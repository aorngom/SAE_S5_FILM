00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:29,280
Oh, no...

3
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:37,247
Oh, my God...

4
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:43,664
What the hell?

5
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:49,838
Anyone there?

6
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:01,387
What?

7
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:05,569
What the hell's going on here, man?

8
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:10,388
Where are my keys?

9
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:29,382
Anyone there?

10
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,238
Hello?!

www.Team-NCIS.com

15
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:12,759
I already rebooted the system,
Frank,

16
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,182
- twice.
- Four hours.

17
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:16,245
That is how long
I waited for your cable repairman.

18
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:18,103
 - You've already said it.
- Four hours!

19
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:20,849
I will not reboot again.
I will never reboot it again!

20
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,936
Reschedule?
So you can waste another Saturday?

21
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:25,438
Just admit you have no idea
how to fix the problem, and

22
00:02:25,518 --> 00:02:27,487
then we can both get on
with our lives.

23
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:30,068
Someone will die today.

24
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,319
Morning, team.

25
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:34,614
- "Morning"?
- "Team"?

26
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:36,866
You are in a particularly
good mood today, McGee.

27
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:38,827
Yeah, and I don't like it.
What gives?

28
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:41,412
I had a good weekend.

29
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:46,042
I had a very good weekend.

30
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,755
- Golden Girls marathon?
- No, Tony, actually, I met someone.

31
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:53,497
- What's his name?
- Her name is Claire.

32
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:55,134
She is a computer programmer.

33
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,480
Where did you meet?

34
00:02:56,614 --> 00:03:00,515
Well, actually, we... we haven't met
yet in person. We met online.

35
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:02,730
Of course, you did.

36
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,615
Go figure.

37
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:05,270
So when is the first date?

38
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:08,398
Hopefully, as soon as possible.
This girl, Ziva, she's perfect.

39
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:12,066
She's gorgeous, she thinks
I'm hysterical and

40
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:13,695
she is a level 5 sorceress.

41
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:15,530
- Oh, God!
- What?

42
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:16,938
No!

43
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:20,033
The sadness when I hear you talk
like this. You don't know who these

44
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:23,207
people are. It could be a 45-year-old
overweight man in Minnesota.

45
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:25,552
I mean, like you said,
you two haven't even met yet.

46
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:28,475
What part of "level 5 sorceress"
don't you understand?

47
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:29,645
All of it.

48
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:32,964
Boss, to be a level 5 sorceress,
you have to conquer...

49
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,591
- Not important.
- No.

50
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:37,135
But we got
a missing Navy Captain who is.

51
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,114
Office of Naval Intelligence
called it in.

52
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:42,014
Where are you going?

53
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:45,639
Yeah, didn't you say that...

54
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:48,146
Missing person, DiNozzo.
Hasn't been 48 hours.

55
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,690
So it is not in
our jurisdiction yet.

56
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,607
No.

57
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:54,179
But you'd like us
to make a few calls.

58
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,356
We certainly would.

59
00:03:57,448 --> 00:03:58,364
Agent Gibbs.

60
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,701
We spoke on the phone.

61
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:03,105
This is Rebecca.

62
00:04:03,553 --> 00:04:04,903
Captain Jennings' daughter.

63
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,339
And you are?

64
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,966
Kevin Nelson, her fiancé.

65
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,377
- Ex-fiancé.
- This is pointless.

66
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:13,127
I hope so.

67
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:16,799
Becky's dad was supposed to meet us
last night for dinner at Mangiamo's,

68
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,177
- but he never showed.
- You know why he never showed.

69
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:20,566
Becky, please.

70
00:04:21,931 --> 00:04:23,449
They got into a fight yesterday.

71
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:24,807
Yeah, yesterday and...

72
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:27,894
the day before yesterday, and...
the day before that.

73
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:29,992
About?

74
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:33,733
My father has his ideas about
how I should be living my life.

75
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,607
Most fathers do.

76
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:38,746
He came by yesterday morning.

77
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:41,658
We got into a fight,
so now he's trying to prove a point.

78
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:42,784
By disappearing?

79
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:45,041
Not answering his cell?
Hell of a point.

80
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,391
Kevin, it's been one day.

81
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:48,790
And you're ready to call out
the National Guard. Relax.

82
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,654
Becky, maybe you've forgotten:

83
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:51,792
you're all he has.

84
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:53,991
Maybe I've forgotten?

85
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:57,590
Thanks for the coffee.

86
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:04,722
She does not seem
to share your concern.

87
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:06,432
Trust me, she's worried.

88
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:08,631
She's got a funny way of showing it.

89
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:12,343
You have to understand, she lost her
mother less than a year ago to cancer.

90
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:15,266
The idea that something
may have happened to her father...

91
00:05:15,326 --> 00:05:17,532
You are a very caring...

92
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:20,037
ex-fiancé.

93
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:22,299
She'd do the same for me.

94
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:32,677
Found a body in Shenandoah. Matches
the description of Captain Jennings.

95
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:37,213
Was just getting ready to call in our
forensic team when I spotted your BOLO.

96
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:38,394
Who found the body?

97
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:40,383
A couple of kids
in one of our warming huts.

98
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:42,601
- Or as they like to call 'em...
- Love shacks.

99
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,263
- How'd you know?
- Lucky guess.

100
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,077
Get a lot of kids up here.

101
00:05:47,745 --> 00:05:49,186
Oh, to be young again.

102
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,924
Well, it has been a while
since we've had a murder up here.

103
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,845
How do you know it's a murder?

104
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:55,695
Ain't a suicide.
That's for sure.

105
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:13,583
Will be hard for Rebecca
to hear her father is dead.

106
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,883
But this...

107
00:06:16,365 --> 00:06:19,800
Reminiscent of a rather dark period
in English history.

108
00:06:20,003 --> 00:06:23,176
Did you know that the preferred
method of punishment for

109
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,094
treason was to be hung,
drawn and quartered.

110
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:28,514
They would hang
the victims by the neck,

111
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,475
then they were taken
from the scaffold

112
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:34,979
before they could have the freedom
of death and disemboweled.

113
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,475
Just like this chap.

114
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:40,068
Except, unlike him, they would hack them
into four "quarters"

115
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,861
and drag them through the streets,

116
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:43,988
their heads stuck on pikestaffs.

117
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,740
Nice story, Ducky.

118
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:47,575
Yes, well, I did say it was dark.

119
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:50,502
And, thankfully, ancient history.

120
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,271
Not so ancient, Duck.

121
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:54,876
Decent tire track.

122
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:58,744
I got things under control. Why don't
you head down to the hut, help Gibbs.

123
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:02,006
Nah, it's a bit small down there.
Wouldn't want things getting cramped.

124
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:03,397
Right. Got it.

125
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,420
Chicken!

126
00:07:08,347 --> 00:07:09,097
What?

127
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:10,431
Five years,

128
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:12,433
you still can't handle
the bloodbaths, can you?

129
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:13,831
Yeah, that's what it is.

130
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:15,889
Look, I told you before,
I had a good weekend,

131
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:18,007
I'm just trying to stay
in the nice head space.

132
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:19,482
Carla.

133
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:20,358
Claire.

134
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,097
Whatever.

135
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:24,144
Enjoy it while it lasts.

136
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:26,336
Women are trouble.
Haven't you learned anything from me?

137
00:07:26,396 --> 00:07:28,825
Yeah.
Not to go on undercover dates with

138
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,287
a doctor whose father
is the world's biggest arms dealer.

139
00:07:32,804 --> 00:07:33,859
That's low, Probie.

140
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:36,666
And not to loan your friends money.
You still owe me 40 bucks.

141
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,168
Don't change the subject.
What are you talking about?

142
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,950
I understand what's going on here:
you're jealous.

143
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,140
You haven't had a date in a few weeks.
It's okay.

144
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:50,138
Me, jealous of the Elf Lord?

145
00:07:50,198 --> 00:07:52,950
I think you have me confused
with someone who's far less awesome.

146
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:55,771
Level 5 sorceress.

147
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:01,440
This abdominal mutilation
was done postmortem.

148
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:04,360
Note the lack of bleeding

149
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:05,653
along the dermis here,

150
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:09,376
unlike this wound,
which shows signs of coagulation.

151
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:11,909
Happened at least one hour prior.

152
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:14,978
The killer snuck up behind him.
Knocked him unconscious.

153
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:16,818
Brought him here, killed him.

154
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:20,466
Well, the lack of defensive wounds
would support that theory.

155
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,296
Ducky, that blood
seems unusually red.

156
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:25,818
Good eye, Officer David.

157
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:28,634
Erythema usually suggests

158
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:31,470
that the blood is saturated
with carboxyhemoglobin.

159
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:33,323
Carbon monoxide.

160
00:08:33,383 --> 00:08:36,726
Yeah, possibly from the stove
in this confined space.

161
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:38,853
Perhaps the cause of death,
perhaps not.

162
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:40,571
And the rest of it?

163
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:43,149
Well, I think
we can rule out organ harvesting.

164
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:45,151
Risk of infection is much too high.

165
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:48,458
Take a look at this.

166
00:09:00,663 --> 00:09:01,783
Oh, boy.

167
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:06,589
- Problem?
- Waiting for you to find out.

168
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:09,717
The man had a pentagram on his back.
That does not make him possessed.

169
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:11,968
Fear the house, Ziva.

170
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,492
Always fear the house.

171
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:16,275
I will keep my eyes open
for any poltergeists.

172
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:17,900
Not the ghosts I'm worried about...

173
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,965
it's the pentagram-happy
dungeon-building freaks

174
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:21,928
that always live
in wholesome places like this.

175
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:24,782
Then I will keep my eyes open
for any dungeons.

176
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:26,629
They looked happy.

177
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,986
It is nice when a couple
has so much in common,

178
00:09:29,324 --> 00:09:31,197
like McGee
and his new sorceress friend.

179
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,911
Oh, yeah,

180
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,229
I was going to talk
to you about that.

181
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:37,331
It's kind of funny, actually.

182
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:39,464
Let's see.

183
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:42,153
How do I put this delicately?

184
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:45,253
She've...

185
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:49,215
- she's not real?
- You did not.

186
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:50,383
I did.

187
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:52,301
I was bored.
It was late.

188
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:54,214
I just watched <i>Weird Science</i>.

189
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:57,782
Next thing I knew, I was building
a fake online profile and...

190
00:09:58,203 --> 00:09:59,225
I'm in with McGee.

191
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,186
He really likes her.
Tony, you have to tell him.

192
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:03,679
I know.

193
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,983
It's actually kind of flattering...
in a creepy way.

194
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:09,235
- What did you think would happen?
- I didn't know.

195
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,743
The flaw in the plan...

196
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:14,865
was the plan.
But I got another plan to end it.

197
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:17,493
- Which is?
- You've ever see <i>Fatal Attraction</i>.

198
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:21,177
<i>Poltergeist</i> is behind me, isn't it?

199
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:22,877
Can I help you?

200
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:24,750
NCIS.

201
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,638
- Who are you?
- Adrianna Lopez.

202
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,885
I live here. I clean.
I stay in the guest house.

203
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:33,801
Did you find Mr. Thomas?

204
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:40,842
I'm afraid...

205
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:42,852
Captain Jennings is dead.

206
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,278
How?

207
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:48,240
He was murdered.

208
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:50,985
Murdered?
<i>Dios mio, por que?</i>

209
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,153
<i>No lo se.</i>

210
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:54,353
<i>Pero lo vamos a investigar.</i>

211
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:55,948
Excuse me.

212
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,084
Do you know where that goes?

213
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:02,246
Mr. Thomas says no one
goes down there.

214
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,757
I don't think he'll mind.

215
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:06,143
Ziva?

216
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,300
I'm betting satanic dungeon.

217
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,954
<i>Hi, there.</i>

218
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:25,019
<i>I'm Beary Smyles.</i>

219
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,688
<i>Would you like me
to sing you a song?</i>

220
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,523
Beary frickin' Smyles.

221
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:32,692
Christmas 1989,
every kid wanted one of these.

222
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:34,904
- Including you, McGee?
- Oh, yeah.

223
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:36,906
But Beary was sold out everywhere.

224
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,157
I was crushed.

225
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:39,784
You were 13.

226
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:40,826
I was 12.

227
00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:43,173
My parents couldn't find Beary so...

228
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:45,664
I decided to take
the bull by the horns.

229
00:11:46,061 --> 00:11:47,079
I designed my own.

230
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,959
I used my dad's old tape recorder
and a Winnie the Pooh bear.

231
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,962
Called him "Pooh 2.0".

232
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:54,590
And 15 short years later,
you lost your virginity.

233
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,300
- DiNozzo?
- Hey, Boss.

234
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,312
I was just telling the guys that...

235
00:11:58,372 --> 00:12:00,644
Captain Jennings' car
was found off Route 19.

236
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:02,326
It was abandoned.
It's being towed in.

237
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:05,204
Boss, still working
on the captain's laptop,

238
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:07,061
but I was able
to access his voicemail.

239
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:10,773
This little gem was left two days ago
by his daughter, Rebecca.

240
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:12,147
<i>Hey, Dad, it's Becky.</i>

241
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:15,599
<i>I thought long and hard about what you
said and I decided that you're right.</i>

242
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,325
<i>I need to pull my life together.</i>

243
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,142
<i>So, from now on, I'm going
to ignore my family,</i>

244
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:23,333
<i>get what I want
through manipulation,</i>

245
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:26,706
<i>and I'm gonna leave home for weeks
at the drop of a hat, and that way,</i>

246
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,293
<i>I can be exactly like you.</i>

247
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:30,750
<i>Okay, see you at dinner tonight.</i>

248
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,704
<i>If you show...</i>

249
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,673
- Daddy's little girl.
- Speaking of Daddy.

250
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:39,468
Captain Thomas Jennings works
in the counterespionage lab

251
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,608
at the Office of Naval Intelligence.
One of those...

252
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:44,242
brainiacs, you know,
who designs all their nifty whiz bangs.

253
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:45,314
"Whiz bangs?"

254
00:12:46,038 --> 00:12:47,399
Whiz bangs, you know.

255
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,270
Sort of like <i>Q</i> in the Bond films.

256
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,607
Come on, DiNozzo.

257
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,484
For the last two years,
despite losing his wife to cancer,

258
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:58,756
Captain Jennings has been working
18 hours a day, seven days a week

259
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:00,612
that is, when he's actually in town.

260
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:02,366
Jennings' Naval travel logs
show that

261
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:04,625
he departed on international flights
once a month.

262
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:08,625
However, according to arrival logs,
he never made it to his destinations.

263
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:10,666
Which begs the question.

264
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:12,110
Where'd he really go?

265
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,503
Scalpel.

266
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:19,567
Hemostats.

267
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:23,437
Screwdriver.

268
00:13:26,524 --> 00:13:27,975
Thank you, Gibbs, RN.

269
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,962
Come to play doctor?
Caf-POW!

270
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:33,481
What do you got, Abbs?

271
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,276
1989's Christmas nightmare
for every parent.

272
00:13:37,801 --> 00:13:39,195
The unattainable...

273
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:40,446
Beary Smyles.

274
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:41,989
My dad waited in line

275
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,241
two hours for one on Black Friday.

276
00:13:44,485 --> 00:13:45,366
Six...

277
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,995
Christmas Eve...

278
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:53,375
You notice the factory seals
are broken. So...

279
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:54,677
Somebody's been inside.

280
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:58,297
Yep, and after Dr. Abby finishes
her exploratory surgery,

281
00:13:58,377 --> 00:13:59,423
she'll tell us why.

282
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,714
Tire tracks.

283
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:02,635
A man on a mission.
I like it.

284
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,983
Unfortunately, I'm still working

285
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:07,348
on finding the exact make
and model of said tires.

286
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:08,891
- And the...
- Pentagram.

287
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:11,539
It's not what you think.

288
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:15,189
Contrary to popular belief,
a satanic pentagram

289
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,607
has an elongated point.

290
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:18,776
This pentagram is
geometrically perfect.

291
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:22,275
Historically, pentagrams have been used
to symbolize all kinds of things.

292
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:24,074
- How about this one?
- Good question.

293
00:14:24,134 --> 00:14:25,560
I'm still working on it.

294
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:28,672
- So, basically, you've got nothing.
- I've spoiled you, Gibbs.

295
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:31,552
You can't get an answer every time
you come down here, but next time

296
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:34,041
- I will have something.
- Next time you'll have a Caf-POW!

297
00:14:36,506 --> 00:14:38,588
Oh, Captain, Captain...

298
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:42,757
disembowelment,
blunt-force trauma and a pentagram.

299
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:45,678
You, my friend,
are as mysterious as they come.

300
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:47,721
I was hoping
you'd already figured him out, Duck.

301
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:50,974
Well, the captain was
in good physical condition.

302
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:53,559
No sign of arteriosclerosis

303
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:55,395
or any other degenerative disease.

304
00:14:55,691 --> 00:14:58,965
However, in the lining
of his duodenum,

305
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:01,610
I found traces
of green discoloration,

306
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:05,479
possibly a reaction
to a tetracycline-based antibiotic.

307
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:06,782
You got a cause of death?

308
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:10,993
The captain's skull showed
additional signs of blunt-force trauma.

309
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:14,572
At first glance I thought
that might be the cause of death.

310
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:15,877
How about second glance?

311
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:19,253
Well, as usual, it proved to be
more reliable than the first.

312
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,297
Abby's tox screen

313
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,091
confirmed
that the captain was exposed

314
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:26,093
to carbon monoxide at levels

315
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:28,429
that would almost
certainly have proved fatal.

316
00:15:29,123 --> 00:15:30,439
Well, CO killed him.

317
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:32,342
Carving the turkey came later.

318
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,491
Yes, and half an hour after

319
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:38,606
the pentagram was imprinted
on his back.

320
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,066
You know, I don't believe
this is the work of satanists.

321
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:45,074
Really? You been chatting with Abby,
have you, Duck?

322
00:15:45,134 --> 00:15:48,224
Well, although these wounds may appear
to be random, they're not.

323
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,825
I found a pattern.

324
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:53,210
Whoever sliced Captain Jennings open

325
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,414
wasn't trying
to kill or torture him.

326
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:58,141
They were looking for something.

327
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:07,968
<i>Hi, there. I'm Beary Smyles.</i>

328
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:10,276
<i>You're my best friend, McGee.</i>

329
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:12,326
Thank you, Beary.

330
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:14,623
<i>You're very welcome.</i>

331
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:18,103
All right, one more time and I'm gonna
rip that bear's head off again!

332
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:20,481
<i>Gear up, DiNozzo.</i>

333
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,483
<i>Got a body at Quantico.</i>

334
00:16:22,563 --> 00:16:25,568
- Don't mess with me.
- That bear sounds very familiar.

335
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:27,071
<i>You think, David?</i>

336
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:29,198
<i>DiNozzo, bag and tag.</i>

337
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:32,284
<i>David, witness statements.</i>

338
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:33,701
<i>McGee,</i>

339
00:16:33,782 --> 00:16:36,516
<i>I ever tell you
how brilliant you are?</i>

340
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,197
Oh, Beary.

341
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:40,291
<i>I love you, McGee.</i>

342
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:45,381
<i>Sorry, boss.</i>

343
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:46,507
Talk to me.

344
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:48,873
You, McGee.

345
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:53,694
Well, we... know why Captain Jennings
was playing with dolls.

346
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:55,808
He was using the primitive
electronics in Beary

347
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,593
here to build
an old-school "phreak box".

348
00:16:57,653 --> 00:16:59,576
- In English.
- A phreak box.

349
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:01,763
That's a tool that hackers
used to use in the '80s

350
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:04,657
to communicate remotely
with computer systems.

351
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:07,800
What?

352
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:11,368
Come on, guys.
<i>War Games, Sneakers, Hackers</i>?

353
00:17:11,768 --> 00:17:13,484
Very young Angelina Jolie in that.

354
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:16,778
Why did Jennings use
a child's toy to build one?

355
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:19,289
Well, my guess is,
that the technology in Beary is so old,

356
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,818
modern systems aren't designed
to defend against it.

357
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:23,609
- He's using it to hack something.
- What?

358
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,379
I'm not sure what he's specifically

359
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,589
after yet, but I do know
who he's targeting.

360
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,884
The IP addresses are assigned
to Homeland Security's mainframe.

361
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,389
We also found a series of encrypted
e-mails on Jennings' laptop.

362
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:37,641
Can't read them.
And we don't know their destination.

363
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:38,780
But get this:

364
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,414
every time Jennings goes on
one of his "overseas business trips",

365
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:43,656
the e-mails stop.

366
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:46,023
- He's meeting his contact.
- Contact for what?

367
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:49,093
He's hacking into Homeland Security.
He's flying all over the country.

368
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,488
- Doubt they're playing Parcheesi.
- DiNozzo, David...

369
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,532
Talk to Jennings' boss.
On it, Boss.

370
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:57,184
- Yeah, Gibbs.
<i>- Now I've got something for you.</i>

371
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,620
Great, be right there, Abs.

372
00:18:03,997 --> 00:18:04,796
So,

373
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:07,588
how's it going
with your other special friend?

374
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:09,168
Claire...

375
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:10,799
she's gotten a bit clingy.

376
00:18:11,552 --> 00:18:14,108
I didn't respond to an e-mail of hers
right away, and she freaked out.

377
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:17,932
Starts going on about how computers
are destroying civilization,

378
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:20,367
which is really weird
because she's a computer programmer.

379
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:21,685
Kick her to the curb.

380
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:23,908
I think I'm gonna give her
another shot.

381
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:25,898
We connected, you know?

382
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,514
And it's not every day
that you find a...

383
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:30,162
Level 5 sorceress.

384
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,477
I know...

385
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:37,419
- You have to tell him the truth.
- Maybe.

386
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:40,120
Not until I'm absolutely sure
lying won't work.

387
00:18:41,377 --> 00:18:42,706
Tell me what you see, Gibbs.

388
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:45,396
- A tire.
- It's not just any tire.

389
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:48,712
It's a retro-edition radial P-396.

390
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:51,715
An exact match to the tracks
that were at the crime scene.

391
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:55,052
And it was especially made
for this bad boy.

392
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,378
Now tell me what you see.

393
00:18:57,325 --> 00:18:58,806
'72 Buick Skylark.

394
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:00,015
Look closer.

395
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:03,300
- Pentagram.
- It's an aftermarket hub cap.

396
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,337
There's a small company
in Texas that sold them.

397
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:06,604
Okay, check this out.

398
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:09,622
Wait for it...

399
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:15,530
- Perfect match.
- When I saw that,

400
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:18,337
I ran a full hydrocarbon panel
on Jennings' blood.

401
00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:20,911
The carbon monoxide
in his tissue had traces

402
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:24,088
of naphthalenes
and polycyclic aromatics.

403
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:26,041
- Car exhaust.
- Yeah.

404
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:29,290
The CO poisoning came
from the car, Gibbs.

405
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:31,723
Jennings had to be in the trunk!

406
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:33,799
And the imprint on his back,

407
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,327
- He was lying on the spare.
- He choked on the exhaust.

408
00:19:36,387 --> 00:19:37,511
He died in the trunk.

409
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:39,763
And then he was carried
to the shack where he was...

410
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:42,151
- sliced and diced.
- Abby...

411
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:43,714
'72 Skylark.

412
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:46,270
Custom hubcaps.
I already told Tony to put out a BOLO.

413
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,313
I was gonna say: "Nice job".

414
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:51,900
Obviously not nice enough.

415
00:19:52,435 --> 00:19:53,402
Fridge.

416
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,824
I don't know how you did that
and I don't care.

417
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,245
Thank you, Gibbs!

418
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:07,279
So, what's a nice girl like you
doing at a top-secret,

419
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,741
government counterespionage
gadget lab like this?

420
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,155
Bet that sounded
better in your head.

421
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:15,267
No, not really.
I like your glasses.

422
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:16,890
Let it go, Tony.

423
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:18,089
I can't.

424
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:19,970
Let me guess.
Hidden camera?

425
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,956
Infrared?
X- ray vision?

426
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:25,058
I'm Dr. Daniel's assistant,
Agent DiNozzo.

427
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:29,271
I make copies, get coffee.
I don't play with the toys.

428
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:32,929
That's my job.

429
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:35,153
Dr. Rod Daniels.

430
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:37,696
You must be Officer David
and you are...

431
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:40,339
Very Special Agent Tony DiNozzo.

432
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,420
- Excuse me.
- Oh, neat.

433
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:44,189
Acoustic bug in the stapler?

434
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:48,926
I assume you'll want to take
a look at Captain Jennings' office?

435
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:50,375
Eventually, yes.

436
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:53,587
I just want to let you know,

437
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:56,381
regardless of what your investigation
has uncovered

438
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:58,402
or what you discover here...

439
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,147
Thomas Jennings was
an honorable man and a patriot.

440
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,137
So, we're gonna find something here?

441
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:06,916
I'm obligated to inform you
that we have had a...

442
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:08,310
breach.

443
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:09,633
Specifically?

444
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,563
A multithreaded mini-processor

445
00:21:11,644 --> 00:21:13,974
that enables our moles
to access enemy computer systems.

446
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:15,150
We call it "Keyhole".

447
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:20,168
This is a mock-up.

448
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,043
USB-compatible.

449
00:21:22,638 --> 00:21:24,576
Disguised as a toothpaste cap.

450
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:26,081
Easy to get through Customs.

451
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:27,217
Nice!

452
00:21:27,544 --> 00:21:28,644
It was nice.

453
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:31,326
It's missing and it's the last thing
you'd want misplaced,

454
00:21:31,386 --> 00:21:33,795
but I assure you Jennings
had nothing to do with it, he was...

455
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:35,754
- We know, a patriot.
- Yes.

456
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:39,591
And he was heavily searched every time
he left the lab area, just as I am,

457
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:41,468
and just as you two will be.

458
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:44,583
So, there's simply no way he could
have gotten anything out of here.

459
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:46,172
You think Jennings swallowed it?

460
00:21:46,232 --> 00:21:48,715
It is the only way he could have
gotten it out of the lab.

461
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,185
If it was stuck in his stomach,

462
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,684
that'd explain the green goop
that Ducky found in his gut.

463
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,523
All right, so he stole it.
Then what?

464
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,488
We got a missing hi-tech
gizmo called "Keyhole", right?

465
00:21:57,773 --> 00:22:00,283
Encrypted e-mails
to some mystery contact overseas.

466
00:22:00,343 --> 00:22:01,530
Maybe he was selling it.

467
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,175
Jennings must have arranged
to meet with his contact here.

468
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:06,558
But they didn't want to wait
for nature to take its course.

469
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,037
So they went dumpster diving
in his belly instead.

470
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:10,706
Guys must have really been
in a rush.

471
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:12,772
- Or decided they didn't want to pay.
- Yeah.

472
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,793
Who is they?

473
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:14,842
Thanks.

474
00:22:15,489 --> 00:22:16,585
Let's find out.

475
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,922
BOLO just came back
on the '72 Buick Skylark.

476
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:20,469
I'll call Gibbs.

477
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,360
Nice rims.

478
00:22:31,628 --> 00:22:32,676
Another meet?

479
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:33,990
Cockpit's empty.

480
00:22:34,142 --> 00:22:35,300
Must be inside.

481
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:36,565
DiNozzo, McGee,

482
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:38,175
around back.

483
00:22:38,235 --> 00:22:39,860
Ziva, you're with me.

484
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:02,327
Boss, Brandon Sykes, 22.

485
00:23:02,488 --> 00:23:04,679
Small-time drifter
with a big-time rap sheet.

486
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:06,552
Larceny, grand theft auto,

487
00:23:06,612 --> 00:23:09,805
dealing, even suspected
of a homicide over an iPod.

488
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:11,475
Doesn't exactly scream espionage.

489
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:14,053
- Hired gun.
- Hired by who?

490
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:16,759
"Whom", Tony.
"Who" is the nominative case.

491
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:19,188
"Whom" always follows a preposition.

492
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:21,275
- Traffic bad?
- Dreadful.

493
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:24,426
I'm having a better day
than this poor young man.

494
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:26,616
Jumped or pushed?

495
00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:28,699
We rushed the warehouse... empty.

496
00:23:28,781 --> 00:23:30,785
Found signs of a struggle
on the roof, though.

497
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:33,756
Yeah, well,
he has defensive wounds on his hands.

498
00:23:34,088 --> 00:23:35,578
Guess we're going with pushed.

499
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:37,068
Okay, thanks.

500
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:39,392
Vehicle is registered to Sykes.

501
00:23:39,973 --> 00:23:42,850
That places him at the warming hut
where Captain Jennings was killed.

502
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:44,424
I doubt he was sightseeing.

503
00:23:44,484 --> 00:23:48,198
So Sykes kills the captain, takes
Keyhole from him, then comes here.

504
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,222
Probably to make the delivery
to whomever hired him.

505
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,496
Didn't work out so well.

506
00:23:53,861 --> 00:23:56,718
Someone is cleaning up
their loose ends.

507
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:05,753
Rebecca's not coming.

508
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:08,172
So she sends her ex-fiancé?

509
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:10,696
Not ex.
We're back together.

510
00:24:15,764 --> 00:24:18,601
I'm not sure if it's the right thing,
but she needs me.

511
00:24:19,744 --> 00:24:21,908
Well, I need her to look
at some photos.

512
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:25,596
I know. But staring at the face
of her father's killer

513
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:27,487
isn't something she's up for
at the moment.

514
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:29,928
She asked if I could pick them up
and bring them to her.

515
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:34,713
It doesn't work that way.

516
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:37,451
This isn't easy for her,
Agent Gibbs.

517
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:39,597
If it wasn't necessary,
I wouldn't ask.

518
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:49,145
Fingerprints matched
a partial found in the warming hut.

519
00:24:50,715 --> 00:24:51,838
You know him?

520
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:54,564
No. Who is he?

521
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:56,886
I was hoping Rebecca would tell me.

522
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:01,528
She wants to help, believe me.

523
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:04,771
But she's in a very bad place
right now.

524
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:06,970
Heck, she took me back.

525
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,273
Just give her some time.

526
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:22,775
For Rebecca.

527
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:25,021
When she's ready.

528
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:29,330
Rebecca Jennings,
22, native of Virginia.

529
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,471
Recently graduated
from Indiana University,

530
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:33,492
works part-time at a pet store.

531
00:25:33,731 --> 00:25:36,885
No criminal record, unless you count
a misdemeanor for disturbing the peace.

532
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,970
She tossed her fiancé's clothes out

533
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:41,154
a second-story window.
I hate it when that happens.

534
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:43,031
She's not exactly
a criminal mastermind.

535
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:45,677
Or the first family member
to not want to identify a killer.

536
00:25:45,737 --> 00:25:48,583
- Think she knows what Daddy was into?
- She knows something.

537
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:51,045
Talk to her friends,
co-workers, everyone.

538
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:54,343
- Why don't we just bring her in?
- What are we gonna put on the warrant,

539
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:55,266
Gibbs' gut?

540
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:58,807
Not that that wouldn't be valid.
I'm sure that...

541
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:01,009
Just talk to her friends.
She'll come to us.

542
00:26:02,753 --> 00:26:04,202
So much for my date tonight.

543
00:26:05,907 --> 00:26:08,566
What are you doing?
So you giving the psycho another chance?

544
00:26:09,011 --> 00:26:10,887
Well, I was.
I guess now I got to cancel.

545
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:12,412
What is that silliness?!

546
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,728
Sorry.

547
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:17,549
Ziva and I will cover
the interviews for you.

548
00:26:18,574 --> 00:26:20,390
That is awfully
un-Tony of you, Tony.

549
00:26:20,577 --> 00:26:22,251
Just doing you a solid, Probie.

550
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:26,100
Because you having a date
is about as rare as me not having one.

551
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:38,713
Am I a suspect, Agent Gibbs?

552
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:43,779
- Sit down.
- Answer the question, please.

553
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:51,945
Why are you investigating me?

554
00:26:53,637 --> 00:26:55,719
- It's my job.
- Are you serious?

555
00:26:57,186 --> 00:26:59,540
Do you think
that I had something to do with...

556
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,419
Is that him?

557
00:27:08,856 --> 00:27:09,774
Who is he?

558
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:11,655
- You don't know?
- No, I don't.

559
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:14,442
- But you know something.
- Yeah.

560
00:27:15,524 --> 00:27:18,973
I know that my father was murdered,
and you have no idea why.

561
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:23,078
- And you don't either?
- I told you, I don't.

562
00:27:23,838 --> 00:27:26,593
You left him a message complaining
about his long trips.

563
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:29,648
No idea where he's been going?

564
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,776
None.

565
00:27:38,546 --> 00:27:40,036
Are you close to your father?

566
00:27:45,683 --> 00:27:46,683
Getting there.

567
00:27:50,347 --> 00:27:51,597
When my mom died...

568
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:54,066
I was devastated.

569
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,924
But I knew that I would be okay.

570
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,863
I knew that I would make it.

571
00:28:05,158 --> 00:28:06,587
But this time...

572
00:28:07,422 --> 00:28:08,638
I'm not sure.

573
00:28:09,602 --> 00:28:13,253
I mean, don't get me wrong. I loved
my mom, I loved her more than anything.

574
00:28:15,002 --> 00:28:16,737
But he's my daddy.

575
00:28:20,714 --> 00:28:23,306
And now I have
no one left in my life.

576
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:26,030
Kevin.

577
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:32,314
I told him I wanted
to try to work things out,

578
00:28:32,381 --> 00:28:34,677
but our last engagement ended
with me...

579
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,605
- Throwing his clothes out the window.
- You heard about that?

580
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:40,703
He deserved it.

581
00:28:43,714 --> 00:28:46,061
But when my mom died,
Kevin was there for me.

582
00:28:48,714 --> 00:28:52,000
I just don't think I can make it
through something like this again.

583
00:28:54,887 --> 00:28:56,707
I don't have it in me.

584
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,072
Yeah, you do.

585
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:04,277
Might take you a while to find,
but you do.

586
00:29:07,951 --> 00:29:10,917
- <i>Boss, hey, I got something here.</i>
- McGee, you're working late.

587
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:15,267
Yeah, actually, I... had a date tonight,
and she didn't show.

588
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:18,805
So, I, really, I kind of <i>ended up
in the area and I thought I'd...</i>

589
00:29:18,865 --> 00:29:20,361
- Jeez, McGee.
- Sorry.

590
00:29:21,253 --> 00:29:22,693
Jennings' mystery e-mails,

591
00:29:22,753 --> 00:29:25,814
I was able to partially <i>decrypt
the routing information in the header.</i>

592
00:29:25,874 --> 00:29:27,669
- That's a good thing, right?
- <i>Oh, yeah!</i>

593
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:31,660
<i>Allowed me to ID the NIC address</i>
on the recipient's computer.

594
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:34,268
It's a laptop,
and it's in use right now.

595
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:37,091
- Where?
- Captain Jennings' house.

596
00:29:54,178 --> 00:29:55,943
It's like I said,
it's always the maid.

597
00:29:56,072 --> 00:30:00,052
No. You have said it is always
the janitor or the butler

598
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:02,103
or anyone assigned
to work in Abby's lab.

599
00:30:02,163 --> 00:30:04,836
But you have never once said "maid".

600
00:30:05,692 --> 00:30:08,324
Anyone ever tell you
your memory can be a real buzz kill?

601
00:30:22,094 --> 00:30:23,094
Who are you?

602
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:25,807
Adrianna Lopez.

603
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:27,922
I worked for Mr. Thomas.

604
00:30:31,516 --> 00:30:33,416
Captain Jennings' credit card record

605
00:30:33,822 --> 00:30:37,265
shows weekly payments
to an outside maid service.

606
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,362
They never heard of you.

607
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:43,749
Fact is, no one has.

608
00:30:45,372 --> 00:30:47,678
Six weeks ago,
you somehow got a green card.

609
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:51,392
Before that,
there's no record of you at all.

610
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:58,054
Who do you think she's working for?
Chinese? Russians?

611
00:30:58,662 --> 00:31:01,527
Cubans.
After all, she is Cuban.

612
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:04,220
That's way too obvious.
Haven't I taught you anything?

613
00:31:08,498 --> 00:31:10,522
Where'd you meet Captain Jennings?

614
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:12,851
In Cuba.

615
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,776
When?

616
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,394
- Six months ago.
- You recruited him?

617
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:22,588
Did I recruit... what...?

618
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,939
Paid him to steal classified
technologies,

619
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,531
- like Keyhole.
- No, wait.

620
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,055
- Then you had him killed.
- No!

621
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,219
- You used him!
- I loved him!

622
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:35,061
Maybe it was the butler.

623
00:31:37,786 --> 00:31:40,074
Thomas was in Cuba
to oversee the installation

624
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:41,973
of a new radar at the American base.

625
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:45,520
He had just lost his wife.

626
00:31:47,668 --> 00:31:49,179
I had just lost my husband.

627
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:52,373
He would come down
to see me whenever he could.

628
00:31:52,752 --> 00:31:54,273
But it wasn't easy.

629
00:31:54,976 --> 00:31:56,364
There are restrictions.

630
00:31:57,327 --> 00:31:59,899
And with his job,
it would have been impossible.

631
00:32:00,873 --> 00:32:03,016
But he was able to hide
where he was going.

632
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:08,676
Eventually, he got me a green card.

633
00:32:10,454 --> 00:32:11,577
And I came here.

634
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,787
To pretend to be his maid?

635
00:32:16,288 --> 00:32:19,336
We lied because Thomas didn't want
his daughter to know about us.

636
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:22,910
Not yet. He thought it was too soon.

637
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,696
And after he died,
you kept lying. Why?

638
00:32:28,524 --> 00:32:30,687
I did what I thought
Thomas would want me to.

639
00:32:39,643 --> 00:32:41,112
She's hiding something.

640
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:43,869
I have posed as a girlfriend
many times to get what I needed.

641
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:46,100
She pretended to be
Captain Jennings' girlfriend.

642
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,255
Convinced him
to steal the missing gizmo.

643
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:51,849
There's one problem with that, Ziva.
That's gizmo is not missing anymore.

644
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,933
I just spoke with Dr. Daniels
at the ONI Lab.

645
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:57,145
- They found Keyhole.
- They "found" it?

646
00:32:57,236 --> 00:32:59,656
- Where, under a couch?
- Subfloor.

647
00:32:59,768 --> 00:33:02,153
Jennings never tried
to get Keyhole out of the lab.

648
00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:04,141
He set it up for remote access.

649
00:33:04,305 --> 00:33:06,846
Dialed in from his basement,
used it to hack the ICE database,

650
00:33:06,906 --> 00:33:10,508
- get his girlfriend a green card.
- That's what she was hiding.

651
00:33:12,402 --> 00:33:14,198
Jennings gamed the system for her.

652
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:15,959
No mystery handler.

653
00:33:16,315 --> 00:33:17,713
No espionage.

654
00:33:17,941 --> 00:33:20,122
So why in the hell was
Thomas Jennings filleted?

655
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:29,298
I liked this case better
when we had a motive.

656
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:32,177
- Yeah, then find one, DiNozzo.
- Easier said than done, boss.

657
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,375
We're, trying to make a connection
between Jennings and his killer.

658
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:38,340
Brandon Sykes.
But we hit a dead end.

659
00:33:38,955 --> 00:33:41,608
- No pun intended.
- Actually, it was.

660
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,406
- In that case, nicely done.
- Focus on Sykes.

661
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:46,880
Find his killer,
we'll find our motive. Ziva.

662
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,648
I will talk to Sykes' parole officer.
Get a list of associates.

663
00:33:50,323 --> 00:33:52,980
Sykes moved around a lot, but
I think I have a lead on his apartment.

664
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:55,122
- Take Tony with you.
- You mean: "Tony, take McGee".

665
00:33:55,182 --> 00:33:57,976
'cause I'm a senior field agent,
which... that's not important.

666
00:33:58,098 --> 00:33:59,900
- Give me...
- Come on, Tony.

667
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:02,305
I'm going to let you play
with the siren.

668
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:08,149
Heard you got stood up
last night, Probie.

669
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:10,220
She never even call.

670
00:34:11,352 --> 00:34:12,637
That ends that?

671
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,131
Maybe.

672
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:15,468
"Maybe"?

673
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:17,173
Know when to fold 'em, McGee.

674
00:34:18,407 --> 00:34:19,744
NCIS, open up.

675
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:22,911
This girl's not worth it.

676
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:24,502
Trust me.

677
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:27,395
Tony, I'm not like you.

678
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,824
It's not that easy
for me to meet women.

679
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,185
Never has been.

680
00:34:33,317 --> 00:34:35,955
That's why I was hoping
this girl might be...

681
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:38,286
you know...

682
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,099
You'll find your girl.

683
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,366
Thought I did.

684
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:55,134
NCIS.

685
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,793
Federal agents.

686
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,790
I love trashed apartments.

687
00:35:04,193 --> 00:35:06,774
Not my apartment.
I like my apartment pristine.

688
00:35:06,889 --> 00:35:10,090
The floors clean and the furniture
dusted, and the casket shined and...

689
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:14,445
Trashed apartments. Okay, first thing
that I noticed is that it's trashed.

690
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:15,669
Good eye.

691
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:18,866
No. I mean, like, really trashed.

692
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,088
There was a microscopic layer

693
00:35:21,148 --> 00:35:24,195
of a silicon carbide covering
pretty much the entire crime scene.

694
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:26,968
Whoever trashed his apartment,

695
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:29,314
went <i>banzai</i> on his dinner plates
with a hammer.

696
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:32,507
- They were not looking for anything.
- No, they just wanted to trash it.

697
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:34,975
And I know who "they" is.

698
00:35:35,354 --> 00:35:38,850
I pulled a partial print off the TV set
that was thrown into the bathtub.

699
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:41,225
Meet our rock star.

700
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:44,080
Hell, yeah, I did it!

701
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,593
I went over to that Jackass' place
and I broke everything in sight.

702
00:35:48,097 --> 00:35:50,334
- That was easy.
<i>- It was all my stuff anyway.</i>

703
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,703
<i>You think that dumb ass
could afford real plates?</i>

704
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:56,289
When I met the guy,
he had a can opener and a plastic fork.

705
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:59,160
The guy's a loser,
like all the rest of them.

706
00:35:59,979 --> 00:36:02,258
Sure I've had it. I'm done.

707
00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:05,711
So is Sykes. He's dead.

708
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:08,248
"Dead"?

709
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:11,530
- How?
- Murdered yesterday afternoon.

710
00:36:14,075 --> 00:36:15,988
- And you think I did it?
- Did you?

711
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,091
I might have, if he'd had been home.

712
00:36:20,152 --> 00:36:23,584
But he wasn't, and I was at work
until 8:00 last night, check the logs.

713
00:36:23,759 --> 00:36:25,850
How'd your boyfriend
know Captain Jennings?

714
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,910
He didn't.

715
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:30,399
You think Brandon
killed the captain?

716
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:32,064
I don't think. I know.

717
00:36:34,947 --> 00:36:35,948
I'm...

718
00:36:36,596 --> 00:36:39,350
I brought him to the Christmas party
last year, but

719
00:36:39,957 --> 00:36:42,344
he spent the whole night
in the parking lot throwing up.

720
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:45,651
- Like I said, a real winner.
- That why you trashed his place?

721
00:36:46,752 --> 00:36:48,733
I trashed his place
because he proposed.

722
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:50,876
I'll take that as a "no".

723
00:36:50,995 --> 00:36:54,742
Like everything else in Brandon's life,
the ring was fake.

724
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:00,471
Turned my finger green.

725
00:37:03,474 --> 00:37:04,474
"Green"?

726
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:08,171
- "Green."
- I'd say it's more of a Torrey pine.

727
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,865
Basically,
it's the same color as this:

728
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:15,709
the discoloration Ducky found
in Thomas Jennings' duodenum.

729
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:17,514
As for the finger, that's easy.

730
00:37:17,764 --> 00:37:20,513
Most fake gold is made out of copper,
like this ring.

731
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:24,609
And when the copper encounters the
natural acids in our sweat, it oxidizes.

732
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,138
It turns the skin green.

733
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:28,173
Torrey pine.

734
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:32,122
Captain Jennings' gut is
where it gets interesting.

735
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:35,442
The ring shows microscopic signs
of acidic deterioration.

736
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:38,824
- Specifically, deoxycholic acid.
- Intestinal acid.

737
00:37:40,322 --> 00:37:43,914
This ring was
in Thomas Jennings' intestines.

738
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:52,399
There was no description
of any intestinal obstruction

739
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:56,256
in Captain Jennings' current
medical records. So I made inquiries.

740
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:59,187
Finally, I was able
to contact his pediatrician.

741
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:01,341
When Jennings was five,

742
00:38:01,484 --> 00:38:03,591
he was rushed to the ER...

743
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:06,993
after swallowing
his mother's engagement ring.

744
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:09,270
I kid you not.

745
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:11,588
The doctors deemed
it too dangerous to operate

746
00:38:11,648 --> 00:38:13,850
and elected to wait
until it worked its way out.

747
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,082
But it never did.

748
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,288
No. As the boy grew,
the <i>plicae circulares</i>,

749
00:38:18,348 --> 00:38:22,042
the lining of the boy's duodenum,
simply closed around the ring,

750
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:25,177
- keeping it in place.
- Who's got access to his records?

751
00:38:25,608 --> 00:38:27,809
Medical records are private, Jethro.

752
00:38:28,158 --> 00:38:30,321
But I doubt this story was.

753
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:34,293
As family tales go, it's certainly
one of the more captivating.

754
00:38:34,394 --> 00:38:37,291
I'm sure dozens of people
heard the story.

755
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:39,604
But only one of them's
been lying to us.

756
00:38:39,689 --> 00:38:42,567
We're going over the evidence from
Jennings' house, take a look at that.

757
00:38:57,518 --> 00:38:58,630
You okay?

758
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:02,447
- You don't have to do this now.
- I know.

759
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,343
You know, don't you?

760
00:39:20,978 --> 00:39:22,550
Why was my father murdered?

761
00:39:25,141 --> 00:39:26,365
Because of this.

762
00:39:30,283 --> 00:39:31,034
A ring?

763
00:39:31,094 --> 00:39:32,976
But it's not just any ring,
is it, Rebecca?

764
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,219
No, it's my grandmother's
engagement ring.

765
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:37,469
I recognize this from the photos,
but that...

766
00:39:44,036 --> 00:39:45,301
My father was...

767
00:39:47,892 --> 00:39:49,076
For a ring?

768
00:39:49,883 --> 00:39:51,495
- A fake ring.
- That's right.

769
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:54,153
Grandpa proposed with a glass ring.

770
00:39:54,634 --> 00:39:57,103
Didn't know that part of
the family story, did you, Kev?

771
00:39:57,201 --> 00:39:59,241
Told your buddy, Sykes,
about the ring, did you?

772
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:01,124
All he had to do was go get it.

773
00:40:01,214 --> 00:40:04,417
- Four carats, hit paid for itself.
- You didn't even get your hands dirty.

774
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:07,434
Until Sykes found out the ring was fake.
Then what happened?

775
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,418
Did he try to blackmail you, Kev?
Is that why you killed him?

776
00:40:10,645 --> 00:40:11,543
Kevin?

777
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:15,232
I told them,
I don't know this Sykes guy.

778
00:40:16,161 --> 00:40:17,651
Let's look at some photos.

779
00:40:18,394 --> 00:40:20,491
There's you at a party.
See you?

780
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:24,168
No, can't see it?
Let's blow it up.

781
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,255
Becky, sweetie, I...

782
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,720
- They put... why would I ever...
- Why?

783
00:40:35,362 --> 00:40:38,987
Because she broke off your engagement.
Because you were desperate.

784
00:40:39,102 --> 00:40:40,950
And killing her father's
supposed to help?

785
00:40:41,062 --> 00:40:43,467
Well, she broke up with you
two years ago, didn't she?

786
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:45,499
Yeah, when my mom got sick.

787
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:47,612
And I took you back.

788
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:50,115
You were hoping history
was going to repeat itself?

789
00:40:50,442 --> 00:40:53,360
- This is insane.
- Unbelievably insane.

790
00:40:53,714 --> 00:40:55,320
And you are a psychopath.

791
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,457
You've just leapfrogged to the top
of our "psychopath of the year" list.

792
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,072
You had my father killed.

793
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:05,523
- Baby, you know me. I would never...
- You son of a bitch!

794
00:41:07,922 --> 00:41:09,136
How could you?

795
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:13,478
You didn't give me a choice.

796
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,502
And he really thought it'd work?

797
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:32,135
Almost did.

798
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:35,332
Is killing for love really
any different than killing for money?

799
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:38,886
Speaking of love,

800
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:42,215
how's that...
cyber-romance going, McGee?

801
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:44,804
It couldn't be worse.

802
00:41:45,227 --> 00:41:46,615
She sent me another e-mail.

803
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:50,178
Said she's getting back
together with her ex-boyfriend.

804
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,204
I'll tell you what though.
I'm not giving up on her.

805
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:58,122
- Wha...?
- No, we got too much in common.

806
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,519
I think she might be scared, but
you know what? We can work through it.

807
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:05,804
I'm telling you, I think
this girl might really be the one.

808
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:13,533
Take it.

809
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:15,879
- Really?
- Sure.

810
00:42:15,996 --> 00:42:16,827
Thanks.

811
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:19,513
Hey, listen, I hate to ask, but...

812
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,762
Sure. I remember.

813
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:24,936
$40.
With interest.

814
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:27,334
Sorry it took so long.

815
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,089
All right, see you guys later.

816
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:39,863
I didn't tell you
so you could torture him, McGee.

817
00:42:46,261 --> 00:42:47,261
Very well.
