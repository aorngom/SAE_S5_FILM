1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,400
Anything else I can do?

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:07,960
No.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,520
I just want to get this over with.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,080
All right.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,040
Heaven forbid he should label
anything and make this easy.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,960
What're you gonna do with his truck?

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,880
I don't know. Sell it, I guess.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,280
How much you want for it?

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,800
I don't know, okay? Listen, I just want to find a
picture of his mother so he can be buried with it.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,160
Not a problem.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,480
Any idea what year it is?

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,360
No.

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,320
Listen, I don't mean to be rude,
but I just feel like being alone.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,760
Wonder what he's got in here.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,320
Holy smoke!

16
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,820
We're leaving in five
minutes. Where have you been?

17
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,820
I got the call. I'm here.

18
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,100
Get up on the wrong
side of the bed, did we?

19
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,940
My car got towed.

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,180
Had to take the bus
to work this morning.

21
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,420
Where was it parked?

22
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,780
That's not important, Kate.

23
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,260
Didn't make it home last night, did you?

24
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,380
Hi, this is Anthony DiNozzo.
I'm trying to locate my car.

25
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,340
It was towed from the 3400
block of Dumbarton in Georgetown.

26
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,740
You've already put me
on hold three times.

27
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,220
You killed my cell phone battery.

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,060
Do not put me on hold again!

29
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:05,060
Do not...!

30
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,260
Dumbarton.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,540
Near campus.

32
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,220
Really hope she was over 21.

33
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,780
You'd love to know, wouldn't you?

34
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,980
Going somewhere this weekend?

35
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,580
Love to know, wouldn't you?

36
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,420
Truck's gassed up. Ducky
already left. You made it.

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,500
Don't start, Probie.

38
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,820
Tony's car was towed. Poor baby
had to take the bus to work.

39
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,460
You know what kind of
people take the bus?

40
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,660
Yeah, I take the bus.

41
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,780
Exactly.

42
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,140
Hey, I heard you're going to Norfolk.

43
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,140
Shouldn't be a problem. We should
still be able to leave by 6:00.

44
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,020
Leave?

45
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,620
For where?

46
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,860
You two are spending
the weekend together.

47
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,980
Hold on. Let me paint a picture.

48
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,660
You're a pig.

49
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,340
Probie, any idea where they're going?

50
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,020
Sorry, cannot divulge
that information, Tony.

51
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,100
Health spa.

52
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,740
Gibbs!

53
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,380
He'll spend all day trying to figure
it out. I do not need him distracted.

54
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,220
I appreciate that, Boss.

55
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,460
What'd you find out
about the Petty Officer?

56
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,820
He rented a storage locker ten months ago
just before he was shipped out for Iraq.

57
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,580
Died in Falluja last week.

58
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,740
His body's at the Theater
Mortuary Evacuation Point in Kuwait

59
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,700
McGee, you stay here

60
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,820
Contact NCIS in Iraq. Find out everything
you can about Petty Officer Dobbs

61
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,220
On it.

62
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,300
DiNozzo,..

63
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,060
...the same clothes
you wore here yesterday?

64
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,620
I buy a lot of the same things.
It makes mornings less stressful.

65
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,300
Yeah, I'm here.

66
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,540
Now you're gone.

67
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,740
What kind of people use
your facility, Mr. Hager?

68
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,620
Most of the renters are Navy personnel.

69
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,380
When they ship out, they pay in advance.

70
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,260
Your guy paid a year.

71
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,420
Got two months left.

72
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,740
DiNozzo.

73
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,540
Talk to me, Duck.

74
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,500
It's definitely female, Jethro.

75
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:56,860
The male pelvis is shaped like a butterfly. The female's is wider and
has larger superior and inferior apertures to facilitate childbirth.

76
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,540
Age?

77
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,980
Oh, I'd estimate 17 to 20.

78
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,700
The pubic symphysis is an
excellent yardstick of age.

79
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,340
Doctor...

80
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,020
It's corrugated in a woman's teens, and
then smooths out during her 20s and 30s.

81
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,660
At the time of this
young lady's demise...

82
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,380
Well, you can see it was
in the transitional stage.

83
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,860
What is so urgent, Mr. Palmer?

84
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,580
- It's just that, he... he...
- He, who?

85
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,580
Special Agent Gibbs.

86
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,700
What about him?

87
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,420
He left, Doctor.

88
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,220
Yes, I know he left.
He left some time ago.

89
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,660
Have you only just realized that?

90
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,580
No.

91
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,500
Then why mention him now?

92
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,660
Well, it's just that I... you, you...

93
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,620
Tell me about it.

94
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,140
Is it that obvious? I'm sorry,
Boss. It's just upsetting.

95
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,300
My car wasn't towed.

96
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,340
It was stolen.

97
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,460
Tell me about the
storage locker, DiNozzo

98
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,420
Right.

99
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,740
Every renter has a code to enter the main gate. Locker number
plus the last four digits of their Social Security number

100
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,900
Manager's checking the computer to see
if anyone accessed Petty Officer Dobbs's...

101
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,140
...locker.

102
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,260
Sorry.

103
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,380
Justin and I were friends since
freshman year in high school.

104
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:12,980
Boyfriend?

105
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,380
No, just friends.

106
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,620
But you have the key to his locker.

107
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,780
Yeah, he mailed it to me with
a will and power-of-attorney.

108
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,740
That's a lot to saddle a friend with

109
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,220
Yeah, tell me about it.

110
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,700
Something I could do without.

111
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,300
Why you?

112
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,900
- He didn't have anybody else.
- Give me the bag, Mr. Palmer.

113
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,820
Tag this for me.

114
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,860
It's stressful, I'm sure.

115
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,060
Do you have any idea
who's in that truck?

116
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,380
No.

117
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,100
We're going to find out, Emmy.

118
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,140
It'd be real good if you
told us anything you know.

119
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,260
There was a girl...

120
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,180
...Nora Webb. We were all
friends in high school.

121
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,420
She disappeared our senior year.

122
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,940
The police always suspected that
Justin knew what happened to her.

123
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,780
All right, let's wrap
her up, Mr. Palmer.

124
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,180
Contact NCIS Iraq?

125
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,420
They were well aware
of Petty Officer Dobbs.

126
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,385
He got in trouble.

127
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,940
Just the opposite, Boss. His C.O. wrote
him up for a posthumous Silver Star.

128
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,100
Actually, the CO wants to talk to you. He's
standing by to go on satellite right now.

129
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,260
Kate, talk to the LEOs
in Dobbs's hometown.

130
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,540
Verify what the girl told us.
Do not tell them what we found.

131
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,420
Got it.

132
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,180
DiNozzo, talk to the insurance
agent on your own time.

133
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,300
Get down to the garage.

134
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,660
Start an inventory on
Petty Officer Dobbs's stuff.

135
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,900
Gibbs is a boat man.

136
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,420
He doesn't understand
I have to have my car.

137
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,540
They're giving you a rental,
DiNozzo. What's the big deal?

138
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,860
Not the same, bus boy.

139
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,420
My car is part of my being.

140
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,940
It's a car, Tony.

141
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,980
It's a classic, Kate.

142
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,300
It's a '90 Z.R.1 Corvette.

143
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,300
Powerful,

144
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,540
...fast.

145
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,860
It's gorgeous.

146
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,980
In other words, it's you.

147
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,780
Exactly.

148
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,380
Under heavy fire,

149
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,020
...Petty Officer Dobbs single-handedly
dragged two Marines to safety.

150
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,140
He saved their lives
at the cost of his own.

151
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,660
That's why I recommended him and
forwarded it up the chain of command.

152
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,820
Now, I understand you're a
former Marine, Agent Gibbs.

153
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,260
I am.

154
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,380
Then you know we don't
take this lightly.

155
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,900
This was an extraordinary young man.

156
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,220
Now this is Lance Corporal Jaime Ramos.

157
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,420
He served with Petty Officer Dobbs.

158
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,020
Sir, Petty Officer Dobbs
wasn't a Marine, but...

159
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,020
...he was one of us. He served in our
platoon, the whole tour as our corpsman.

160
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,340
What they're saying about Doc can't be
true, sir. He died saving lives over he.

161
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,260
Whatever you can do, we'd
appreciate it, Agent Gibbs.

162
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,860
Understood, Lieutenant.

163
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,580
The thing is, sir, Doc isn't
around to defend himself now.

164
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,460
You have to, sir.

165
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,500
Ducky, is it her?

166
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:10,380
She is, indeed, Nora Webb, Jethro. I had a positive I.D
using dental records from the FBI's Missing Person's Database.

167
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,180
How long's she been dead?

168
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,300
How long she been missing?

169
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,140
Almost two years. Petty Officer Dobbs
rented the locker ten months ago.

170
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,220
Well, I'd venture that she met her fate
around the time of her disappearance.

171
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,300
Of course, I can't be certain till I know
where the young lady's remains were kept.

172
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,820
The deterioration would be affected by whether she was
indoors, void of the elements, or buried outside in the...

173
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,700
...ground. Cause of death.

174
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,780
- Uh, that would be hard to determine.
- Duck, I need to know.

175
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,740
Sign this for me over here.

176
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,300
Go ahead, pull it.

177
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,620
It only looks like a
skull and crossbones.

178
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,540
Home movies: Little League '97,

179
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,220
...Christmas '95.

180
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,500
- Hoo-yeah! -And
the winner is?

181
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,020
High School, senior year.

182
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,580
Danke schoen.

183
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,660
So what exactly do you girls do at a...

184
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,340
...health spa?

185
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,900
Get pampered.

186
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,740
Massages?

187
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,460
Many kinds.

188
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,860
Full body?

189
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,420
Places you could only dream of, DiNozzo.

190
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,140
Masseuse or masseur?

191
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,260
I go both ways. You?

192
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,540
Only with, uh... Harris,
my insurance agent.

193
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,300
Whatever works, man.

194
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,740
Spoke with a LEO in Richfield, Virginia.

195
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,100
Officer Billy Krieg confirms that Justin Dobbs was a
Person of Interest in the disappearance of Nora Webb.

196
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,100
What else?

197
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,260
Not much.

198
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,620
Dobbs enlisted out of high school. He was raised by a
single mother who died of cancer while he was in boot camp.

199
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,980
Got in the Advanced Medical
Training Program. Made PO3.

200
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,420
B oss,

201
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,340
Lieutenant Commander
Coleman wants to talk to you.

202
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,300
- Tell her I'm not here.
- Why don't you tell me yourself?

203
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,500
Commander Coleman.

204
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,980
Special Agent Gibbs.

205
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,940
Tony.

206
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,860
Kate.

207
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,940
McGee.

208
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,260
SECNAV wants JAG involved in the
investigation of Petty Officer Dobbs.

209
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:10,820
Why?

210
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,660
He's on the fast track
for a Silver Star.

211
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,100
The Navy doesn't want to be embarrassed
by awarding it to a murderer.

212
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,620
- Did he do it?
- I'll let you know when the investigation concludes.

213
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,020
Petty Officer Dobbs's remains are arriving
at the military mortuary in Dover on Sunday.

214
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,820
- His unit is pushing for a funeral with full honors. You've got 24 hours.
- That's not enough time.

215
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,860
SECNAV can't wait.

216
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,140
You've got 24 hours.

217
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,380
Cancel all weekend plans.

218
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,380
That guy is Justin Dobbs.

219
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,300
The girl in pink is Emmy Poole
with our victim, Nora Webb.

220
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,020
If the time stamp's accurate on this tape, this would've
been shot two days before she was reported missing.

221
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,220
Well, from this video, doesn't
look like anything's wrong.

222
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,700
Sure brings back memories, Probie.

223
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,700
I don't suppose you had a
car to wash in high school.

224
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,580
Actually I did, Tony.

225
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,980
My parents bought one for
me the day I turned 16.

226
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,420
Let me guess...

227
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,700
...Yugo?

228
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,860
No, it was much cooler than that.

229
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,300
Oh, I'm sorry.

230
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,100
What was I thinking? I forgot
who I'm dealing with here.

231
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,220
Ah...

232
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,420
...Duster?

233
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,100
Nope.

234
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,100
Gremlin.

235
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,020
Not gonna guess it, Tony.

236
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,180
One of the Ford trilogy of dork mobiles?

237
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,820
Maverick?

238
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,220
Fiesta?

239
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,060
Pinto?

240
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,300
If you say Datsun Honeybee, I'm
gonna come over there and smack you.

241
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,980
'84 Camaro
Z-28 five-speed.

242
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,100
That's a smoking-hot car, McGee.

243
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,980
What the hell went wrong with you?

244
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,860
Well, the first day I
got behind the wheel,..

245
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,300
...I had a slight thing.

246
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:16,940
Head-on?

247
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,340
I was trying to figure out the wipers...

248
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,380
...took my eyes off
the road for a second.

249
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,220
When I looked up, there it
was, right in front of me.

250
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:27,940
Car.

251
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,500
Bus.

252
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,620
I got a student pass the
day I got out of traction.

253
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,780
I didn't know.

254
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,580
Sure it's Nora Webb?

255
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,660
We're sure.

256
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,340
Knew the son of a bitch did it.

257
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,140
Justin Dobbs was the prime suspect?

258
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,180
Nora Webb was last seen
leaving a party with him.

259
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,820
Kids saw her drive off in the truck.

260
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,820
Next day the parents
reported her missing

261
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,540
When we brought him in, he had
scratches on his face and arms.

262
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,500
I'm sure he had an
explanation, of course.

263
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,780
Don't they always?

264
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Said she got...

265
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,260
...abusive before he dropped her home.

266
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,540
People at the party thought
they saw him coming onto her.

267
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,100
They ever have anything
between them before?

268
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:19,740
No,..

269
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,660
...but he had been drinking.

270
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,580
So, you think he pressed it with her in the car,
when she didn't go along, things got out of hand.

271
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,340
Figured he'd buried her in the woods.

272
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,100
When we couldn't find the body,
the D.A. chose not to go forward.

273
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,100
After graduation, Justin Dobbs
slinked out of town in a Navy uniform.

274
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,820
Petty Officer Dobbs...

275
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,100
...died in that uniform
saving lives, Chief.

276
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,700
Appreciate that, Agent Gibbs.

277
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,660
Doesn't excuse taking
one before he left.

278
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,220
I'd like a copy of that case file.

279
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,380
Not a problem.

280
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,860
Pull it, Billy.

281
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,380
Then show our friends
where the copy machine is.

282
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,340
- Chief Whalen doesn't have a doubt about Petty Officer Dobbs's guilt.
- Nope.

283
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,820
So what do you think?

284
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,980
I was him, I wouldn't either.

285
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,180
Mr. and Mrs. Webb?

286
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,700
Special Agents Gibbs and Todd, NCIS.

287
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,380
We know.

288
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,780
Mr. and Mrs. Webb, y'all take care.

289
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,500
Been pushing for a faster copier.

290
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,620
Hope it didn't cause
too much inconvenience.

291
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,260
When do we get our daughter back?

292
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,900
Our investigation is almost over.

293
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,860
Chief Whalen concluded the
investigation a long time ago.

294
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,420
If Justin murdered your daughter,..

295
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,340
...our investigation
will only confirm it.

296
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,020
We don't need a confirmation.

297
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,100
Do you know how...

298
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,100
...how she died?

299
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:56,860
Not yet.

300
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,020
Is that all?

301
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,380
- We just have a few questions.
- No,..

302
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,140
...we're not going to do it.

303
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,460
I know this is difficult.

304
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,740
You don't know anything, lady.

305
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,420
Mr. Webb...

306
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:09,900
Kate.

307
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,700
Appreciate your time.

308
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,580
Thank you.

309
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,940
What's up, Palmer?

310
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,900
Oh, I, uh, brought you
a substance for analysis.

311
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,660
Where'd you get it?

312
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,660
The victim's femur bone.

313
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,380
Just put it over there.

314
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,500
Hey, sorry to hear about your weekend.

315
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,580
Oh, hmm...

316
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,340
Tony?

317
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,980
Yeah, mass e-mail.

318
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,580
The sender was "Anonymous,"
but it was pretty obvious.

319
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,740
Lots of lascivious references.

320
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,420
You know, the inefficient flow of
chi is a major source of stiffness.

321
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,940
Uh, silent auction item at
my niece's school benefit:

322
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,940
...a weekend seminar in
the art of shiatsu. -Do me.

323
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,460
Uh, n... I-I showed up late.

324
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,340
Your hands,

325
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,260
...my body,

326
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:12,980
...now.

327
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,100
What the hell are you doing, Palmer?

328
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,780
You read the Agency policy on sexual
harassment, didn't you, Palmer?

329
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,380
It wasn't like that!

330
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,300
It never is.

331
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,580
Now, go, you little autopsy
gremlin. Get out of here.

332
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,420
What do you got, Abbs?

333
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,580
He's doing it again, McGee

334
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,700
Mm-hmm.

335
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,140
Doing what?

336
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,500
You become Gibbs when he's not around.

337
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,340
I do not.

338
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,540
Actually, you do.

339
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,020
The Caff-Pow, the head-slaps,
turning my music off.

340
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,220
"What do you got, Abbs?"

341
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,980
He has been in a foul mood all day.

342
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,660
That's another Gibbs trait.

343
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,860
You don't quite have the stare down yet.

344
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,500
Hey, what are you giggling about?
Inventory the contents now, Probie!

345
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,660
Dobbs's sea bag, sent from Iraq,
has all his personal effects.

346
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,980
Do you know anything about chi, McGee?

347
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,220
It was Nora.

348
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,300
It was.

349
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,780
How long have you known about
Justin's storage locker, Emmy?

350
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,660
A week, when I read the will.

351
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,300
Thanks.

352
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,500
You didn't read it until he died?

353
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,340
Anything wrong with that?

354
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,980
Who else knew about the will?

355
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,980
No idea.

356
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,300
He wrote it up online. I didn't
recognize the names of the witnesses.

357
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,860
Guys from his unit, I guess.

358
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,980
We'll need a copy.

359
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,260
Okay.

360
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,140
So you and Petty Officer Dobbs...

361
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,060
We were tight in high school.

362
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,780
Listen, it was his idea to go off to
the stupid war, okay? I didn't need this.

363
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,780
And you and Nora Webb?

364
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,620
Friends. It was high school, okay?

365
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,980
Customer's waiting. Are we through?

366
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,180
For now.

367
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,820
Lot of pissed-off
people here in Richfield.

368
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,780
Here's something interesting, Mr. Palmer

369
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,460
...the hyoid bone.

370
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,940
Do you know what makes it unique?

371
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,780
No, Doctor.

372
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,380
Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry bones

373
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,540
The shoulder bone connected to the Neck bone,
the neck bone connected to the Head bone...

374
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,580
The hyoid bone, Mr. Palmer,
to what is it connected?

375
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,260
Nothing.

376
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,220
Correct.

377
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:43,420
Of the 206 bones in the human body, the hyoid
is the only one not articulated to any other.

378
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,100
Cool.

379
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,020
Its name derives from the Greek,

380
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,860
...uh, U-O-I-D-
shaped like a "U."

381
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,860
Upsilon.

382
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,300
I hope you learned that in medical school and not
at some fraternity ritual. You see, this one...

383
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,460
...is distorted.

384
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,700
Looks like it's been crushed.

385
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,940
And that would suggest...?

386
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,420
- Strangulation.
- Yes!

387
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,260
Who's the cop?

388
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,260
No idea.

389
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,300
What do you have, McGee?

390
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:17,020
Well, the, uh, records show that no one accessed the store
facility with Petty Officer Dobbs's code after he deployed.

391
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
Personal effects?

392
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,860
Nothing out of the ordinary. Only thing of interest
was a padlock key identical to the one Emmy Poole had.

393
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,620
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- Video conference call.

394
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,300
Boss, you're never gonna
believe this. DiNozzo...

395
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,140
My car was used in a convenience
store robbery in Tennessee.

396
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,940
But I'm... I'm cool.

397
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,580
So not important in the
grand scheme of things.

398
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,060
You've had 24 hours.

399
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,260
Not enough time.

400
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,980
Petty Officer Dobbs's body
left Kuwait an hour ago.

401
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,940
What do I tell the SECNAV?

402
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,260
Nothing conclusive at this point.

403
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,420
You are forcing me to
have the medal withheld.

404
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,660
You might be denying a hero his due.

405
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,380
Give me something, Gibbs.

406
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,660
Is there anything working in his favor?

407
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,180
- You're breaking up, Faith.
- I can see you just fine.

408
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,660
Must be a solar flare.

409
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,700
Gibbs...

410
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,420
Such a mysterious room.

411
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,660
You got something, Duck?

412
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,260
Yeah. Cause of death: strangulation.

413
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,460
Things not going too well?

414
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,380
Running out of time.

415
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,380
You ever think that the
petty officer might be guilty?

416
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,820
Crossed my mind.

417
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,380
Yeah, more than once, obviously.

418
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,060
Otherwise you'd be telling me
your gut says he's not guilty.

419
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,820
Some Marine guts in
Iraq are saying that.

420
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,180
But not yours?

421
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,820
Yeah.

422
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,020
Yeah, my gut says it, too.

423
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,140
Your gut or Semper Fi?

424
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,740
Emmy Poole is holding back. I
want her in Interrogation now.

425
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,300
Yes?

426
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,380
This is NCIS Special Agent Todd.
I'd like to speak with Emmy Poole.

427
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,460
Not gonna happen, Agent Todd.

428
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,620
Nice truck.

429
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,580
If we hadn't called the house,
would you have notified us?

430
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,540
Eventually.

431
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,780
I'd sure like my people to have a look.

432
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,660
It was a suicide. What
do you expect to find?

433
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,220
Emmy Poole was material
to my investigation.

434
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,100
Investigation into a murder that took place two
years ago here when Justin Dobbs was a civilian.

435
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,580
That was a local matter.

436
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,900
Just like this is.

437
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,100
Understood.

438
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,380
You want to take a look around, fine.

439
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,340
We just removed the body;
crime scene's intact.

440
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,500
Who found her?

441
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,420
The mother.

442
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,340
Like to speak with her.

443
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,900
You're welcome to read her statement.

444
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,860
She's with friends. Didn't want
to stay at the house tonight.

445
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,220
Leave a note?

446
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,500
Not that we found.

447
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,740
Mother said she'd been depressed, on
medication for the past couple of years.

448
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,300
Since the disappearance of Nora Webb?

449
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,860
Where are you going with this, Gibbs?

450
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,420
According to the mother,
Emmy was close to Nora.

451
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,820
Took her disappearance hard.

452
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,780
Don't think finding the body helped.

453
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,300
Yeah, we... we spoke
to Emmy this afternoon.

454
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,860
Thing is, kept getting the feeling she
wasn't telling us everything she knew.

455
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,460
All there is to know is...

456
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,060
Justin Dobbs killed Nora Webb.

457
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,060
So you keep saying

458
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,980
This your idea of an apology?

459
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,860
For what?

460
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,180
I just don't like to drink alone.

461
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,780
The fact that you know where to find me
on a Sunday morning is a little scary, Gib

462
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,700
Please.

463
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,140
Not as scary as your trunk.

464
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,860
What do you want?

465
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,900
Talk to the office of the SECNAV yet?

466
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,620
No.

467
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,580
The girl who found the remains in
Petty Officer Dobbs's truck is dead.

468
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,700
Suicide, maybe.

469
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,220
You think she was involved?

470
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,100
I don't know.

471
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,820
She could've had an accomplice.

472
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,620
I need more time.

473
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,940
Petty Officer Dobbs's
funeral is tomorrow.

474
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,140
Not if I order his remains
quarantined at Dover morgue.

475
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,620
What are you up to?

476
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,900
I need our M.E. to examine the
body as part of our investigation.

477
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,660
Dobbs died as a result
of enemy fire in Iraq.

478
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,260
What bearing does that have on a girl who was
killed two years ago in Richfield, Virginia?

479
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,220
You can never be too thorough.

480
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,860
You're pushing it, Gibbs.

481
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,060
Why are you sticking your
neck out for this guy?

482
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,780
Several Marines witnessed Petty
Officer Dobbs saving lives.

483
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,820
No one witnessed him taking one.

484
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,860
Mrs. Webb.

485
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,900
Special Agent DiNozzo.

486
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,380
We don't know if you've
heard about Emmy Poole.

487
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,820
Her poor mother.

488
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,860
Well, we're sorry to bother
you. Just a few questions.

489
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,140
- Your daughter and Emmy were close.
- They were very close.

490
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,100
Emmy practically lived at our house.

491
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,740
She was always sleeping over.

492
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,060
They ever have a falling out?

493
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,340
Oh, God, no.

494
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,180
I felt sorry for Emmy.

495
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,020
She was caught in the middle
between her two best friends.

496
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
Nora and Justin.

497
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,380
Nora had disappeared, and everyone
believed Justin was responsible.

498
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,860
She couldn't handle it.

499
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,420
And then finding Nora.

500
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,340
It must've sent her over the edge.

501
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,780
The past two years
have been hell for us.

502
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,380
That's why we've sold
the business and...

503
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,060
It was just too many bad
memories in this town.

504
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:53,900
Hey.

505
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,260
What are you doing here?

506
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,300
Chief Whalen said we don't
have to deal with you.

507
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,340
They're just trying to do their job

508
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,500
They want Justin Dobbs buried as
a war hero, that's what they want.

509
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,260
He killed our daughter.

510
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,780
As far as I'm concerned, he's
responsible for Emmy's death as well.

511
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,900
Leave now.

512
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,420
Why don't you get one of these?

513
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,460
Fits your personality perfectly—loud
overbearing, politically incorrect.

514
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,860
It is tempting, Kate,
but I love the car I have.

515
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:31,660
Had.

516
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,900
Too bad you're not as faithful
to the women in your life.

517
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,220
- That's funny.
- But for your sake, I do hope that you and she reunite.

518
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,220
Actually, I don't
know if I want it back.

519
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,380
And why is that?

520
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,780
She's been violated.

521
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,860
Here to escort us to
the city limits, Officer?

522
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,100
The chief wants you to
leave the Webbs alone.

523
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,140
They've been through a lot.

524
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,140
Well, we realize that, Officer. We're just trying
to resolve Petty Officer Dobbs's guilt or innocence

525
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,860
Now, why can't you
just accept the facts?

526
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,500
They're right there in front of you.

527
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,220
Actually, the only thing
in front of us right now...

528
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,140
... is you.

529
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,940
You move, we'll leave.

530
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,740
Maybe.

531
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,340
Well, I think it's the power supply.

532
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,580
You "think"?

533
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,940
Well, it'd be helpful if
I had a service manual.

534
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,100
I was at church, Gibbs.

535
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,220
What do you got, Abbs?

536
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,020
First of all, you owe me big-time

537
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,980
It took Kate and me six months to
get the reservations to that spa.

538
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,300
You tell me you found something,
I'll think about making it up to you.

539
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,540
Typical man.

540
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,860
Promise you everything until
he gets what he wants...

541
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,820
...right, McGee?

542
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,020
- Well, actually, I...
- Thanks, McGee.

543
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,180
So, I found dirt on her femur bone,

544
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,580
...and identical traces on the inside
of the plastic she was wrapped in.

545
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,345
But not on the outside.

546
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,220
Nora Webb was buried in
the ground, then removed.

547
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,460
And then wrapped in plastic,
and then put in that truck.

548
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,900
Chief Whalen always thought
she was buried in the woods.

549
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,260
Maybe yes, maybe no.

550
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,540
Do you have anything
more specific than dirt?

551
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,260
Well, I was trying, except
my mass spectrometer crashed.

552
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,860
And there's a certain MIT grad that's supposed
to be fixing it but is actually making it worse.

553
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,420
Sooner than later, McGee.

554
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,220
Why don't you just hire a service tech!

555
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,900
Well, I would, McGee.

556
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,340
But it's Sunday!

557
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,620
Oh, there you are.

558
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,580
Appreciate you coming.

559
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,940
It's a godsend, actually. Mother has the
ladies of the kennel club over for cocktails.

560
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,660
Take a ride, Ducky.

561
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,820
Oh, I had a conversation
with the M.E. at Richfield.

562
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,100
He came to the same
conclusion- suicide, indeed.

563
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,300
Well the...

564
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,660
...lacerations on the young girl's wrists
gave every indications of being self-inflicted.

565
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,820
But that's not why you asked me in here.

566
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,580
They're holding Petty Officer Dobbs's
body for you at the Dover morgue.

567
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,820
I don't get it. I
thought he died in combat.

568
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,980
I need you to take a look, Ducky.

569
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,140
- What do you expect me to find?
- Nothing.

570
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,660
I just need to buy more time.

571
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,900
Oh, Jethro...

572
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,580
I can spend forever finding nothing.

573
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,220
Great. Thank you.

574
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,700
Boss, tracked down the two witnesses
who signed Petty Officer Dobbs's will.

575
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,340
Both were Corpsmen he met in training. One's stationed at
GITMO, the other Coronado. Neither knew anything relevant.

576
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,980
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs...

577
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,420
...are we still on?

578
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,380
Weekend at the spa if I've come
up with something really big?

579
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,780
This is a piece of the plastic sheet
that the victim's body was wrapped in.

580
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,300
- You lift a print?
- Negatory.

581
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,700
- Trace evidence?
- No, but... this a really big but.

582
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,020
From analysis of the polymers and the
resins, I tracked down the manufacturer.

583
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,460
They've reworked their formula.

584
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,540
It's polyethylene,

585
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,860
..,four-mils thick.

586
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,620
It's more flexible and
resistant to tearing.

587
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:53,620
What's the point, Abby?

588
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,980
This is a brand-new product, Gibbs. It's
only been on the market for four months.

589
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,580
Petty Officer Dobbs has been in Iraq for
ten months. He couldn't have put it there.

590
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,380
So can I make those reservations now?

591
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:05,985
What's the matter, Gibbs?

592
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,180
That does not mean that Petty Officer Dobbs is
innocent. It only means he could've had an accomplice.

593
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,260
Emmy Poole?

594
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,820
Yeah, Gibbs.

595
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,340
I'll be right there.

596
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,500
You're not calling wi good news.

597
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,860
I'm sorry, Gibbs.

598
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,940
SECNAV made his decision.

599
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,860
He won't sign off on the Star.

600
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,700
You think he's gonna
want us to hang around?

601
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,580
I don't know.

602
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,580
I can't imagine there's
anything till tomorrow

603
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,660
Go ask him.

604
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,620
You ask.

605
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,940
You're the "special agent."

606
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,060
Yeah, well, he likes you more.

607
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,220
That's because I don't
ask him stupid questions.

608
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,820
Rock, paper, scissors?

609
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,860
On three.

610
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,460
Something on your mind?

611
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,820
- No
- No.

612
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,660
You weren't thinking
about leaving, were you?

613
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,780
- Oh, uh, no.
- Absolutely not, no.

614
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,860
I was just gonna go, um,
check on the old spectrometer.

615
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,380
Assuming Petty Officer Dobbs was innocent, why did
Nora Webb's remains show up in his storage locker?

616
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,180
Someone was framing him?

617
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,060
Emmy Poole knew about the
locker and she had a key.

618
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,420
She would've had to have gone there
before the bones were discovered.

619
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,260
But after Petty Officer Dobbs
died so he couldn't defend himself.

620
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:38,020
There's one problem, though, boss. The computer shows that Dobbs's entry
and access code was used only once the time she was with the manager.

621
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,740
She could've used somebody else's code.

622
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,060
There's a surveillance camera
at the entry gate, boss.

623
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,300
I know, McGee.

624
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,020
That is why I am going to Little Creek.

625
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,700
- Avoid the 295- it's
packed. -DiNozzo...

626
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,060
...go with McGee. He's gonna
pick up the surveillance tape.

627
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,460
Boss, I just...

628
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,460
You're driving.

629
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,060
You realize Mother Teresa would
have road rage hell out there?

630
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,900
- I know it's a long shot.
- A long shot is you getting laid by Penelope Cruz, McGee.

631
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,420
This is way beyond that.

632
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,660
- Look, Tony, I'm sorry, but my instincts tell me...
- You have not been around long enough to have instincts, Probie.

633
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,060
Well, I still don't think that
Petty Officer Dobbs is a murderer.

634
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,660
Why, because he was a hero in Iraq?

635
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,580
They Came to Cordura.

636
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,060
What?

637
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,740
The film.

638
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,980
Of course.

639
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,340
Gary Cooper.

640
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,060
Who?

641
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,340
One of the greatest actors of all time?

642
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,060
Coop. High Noon.

643
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,420
They Came to Cordura was
one of his last pictures.

644
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,900
Stick with me here.

645
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,940
It's 1916- the war
against Pancho Villa.

646
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,700
Coop plays an army major escorting
Rita Hayworth-mm, what a body...

647
00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:00,300
and four Medal of Honor winners back to Texas for this...
ceremony, and along the way, he tries to determine...

648
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,660
...what made them heroes.

649
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,060
In the end, he exposes them
for what they really are:

650
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,500
Corrupt, pathetic, hypocritical,
cowardly degenerates.

651
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,220
DiNozzo, it's a movie.

652
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,860
It's a film.

653
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,620
You're taking the stairs, McGee.

654
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,300
Why?

655
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,860
'Cause I am not riding in an elevator with
anyone who doesn't know who Gary Cooper was.

656
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,260
- Abby, can you tell if anyone picked...
- Dobbs's padlock?

657
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,060
- Yes.
- No.

658
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,380
Abbs, I don't have time.

659
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,220
I'm trying to tell you.
I just checked it out.

660
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,100
I knew you were gonna ask. It's scary,
Gibbs. I'm starting to think like you.

661
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,540
The lock is almost virgin.

662
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,100
It's hardly been opened,
and it shows no sign of wear.

663
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,460
If it had been picked, there'd
be scratches on the tumblers.

664
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,140
It was opened with a key.

665
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,300
I would swear to it.

666
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,340
Good work, Abbs.

667
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,700
I knew you were gonna say that, too.

668
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,420
He's the manufacturer's service tech.

669
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,740
He gets triple-time on weekends,
and it's gonna be a while.

670
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,380
Stay on him.

671
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,140
So, what's the verdict?

672
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,140
I'm done.

673
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,060
Really?

674
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,540
That was quick.

675
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,580
It's a simple short.

676
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,540
It's nothing you don't pick
up in an intro ITT class.

677
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,820
I guess they don't offer that at MIT.

678
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,540
Any luck with Emmy's psychiatrist?

679
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,220
It's Sunday, Gibbs.

680
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:15,860
I know.

681
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,740
As everyone keeps reminding me.

682
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,300
Well, it wasn't much of
a challenge finding you.

683
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,420
I actually do like to drink alone, but
I figured you could use a pick-me-up.

684
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,180
You're not surprised I found you here.

685
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,140
No.

686
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,220
No. Why should I be?

687
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,900
Investigation's not over.

688
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,180
It's a lost cause.

689
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,460
You here to gloat?

690
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,500
Actually, I happen to
believe in miracles.

691
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,780
Oh, really.

692
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,580
Yeah, I never had one happen in
front of me, so I figured if one did,

693
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,020
...I'd like to be standing by
so I could call the Pentagon.

694
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,340
Miracles take hard work, Commander.

695
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,820
Any particular desk I should use?

696
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,020
Special Agent DiNozzo
will be gone for a while.

697
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,860
Agent Todd.

698
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,660
Richfield case file.

699
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,300
Do you realize, at this exact moment we would
be in the throes of deep tissue exhilaration?

700
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,100
Don't remind me.

701
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,620
You guys had spa plans?

702
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,180
Yeah.

703
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,500
Last month a girlfriend and I
went to the new one in Charleston.

704
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,900
Serenity Retreat?

705
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,425
- Ooh...
- Ah...

706
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,740
Are you here for a reason, Abby?

707
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,060
I wanna talk dirt.

708
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,220
Boss.

709
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,100
I don't know if you missed my lips moving,
McGee, but actually, I was speaking.

710
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,740
- According to my newly repaired mass spectrometer...
- Sorry, Abbs, but this is big.

711
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,060
Well, it could be big...

712
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,140
uh, at least we think it is. But
if it is big, it is really big.

713
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:50,860
McGee,

714
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,420
Talk. Make sense.

715
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,220
We reviewed the entry gate security
tapes from Little Creek Public Storage.

716
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:01,860
Now, from the day that Petty Officer Dobbs died to the day that
Nora Webb's remains were found, uh, no sign of Emmy Poole entering.

717
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,380
But I think I recognize someone else.

718
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,060
It's grainy,

719
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,460
...but we're hoping that
Abby's capable of enhancing it.

720
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,340
This video was taken three days after
Petty Officer Dobbs died in Falluja.

721
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,180
This guy opened up a locker the
same day, under the name John Weston.

722
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,260
'Kay, freeze it right there.

723
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,300
Any chance we can make the driver, Abbs?

724
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,300
Not a chance, Gibbs.

725
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,100
A certainty.

726
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,340
Webb.

727
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,940
Were there any other surveillance
cameras on the premises?

728
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,860
No. Once he was in, he
could've gone to any locker.

729
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,540
He would have to have known
which locker was Dobbs's.

730
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,700
And he would have had to have had a
key, because the lock was not picked.

731
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,940
Emmy Poole.

732
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,740
Kate, McGee, start backgrounding
Bruce Webb. DiNozzo, you're with me.

733
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,340
Gibbs, Gibbs! My dirt.

734
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:52,980
What about it?

735
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,420
Unless someone has been
fertilizing the forest,

736
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,740
...Nora Webb was not
buried in the woods.

737
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,460
The soil found on her femur contains
chemicals consistent with plant food.

738
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,740
Yeah. Gibbs.

739
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,660
Bruce Webb was Nora's stepfather.

740
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,100
Her biological father walked
out when she was three.

741
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,300
Nora took his name when he officially
adopted her at the age of six.

742
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,220
Nothing else yet, but
we're working on it, Gibbs.

743
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,740
He just cut you off?

744
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,660
Does it to everyone.

745
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,100
Wow. The Stepfather.

746
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,820
You see that movie? Guy marries
a woman with a gorgeous daughter.

747
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,380
I thought I made it clear. We
have nothing to say to NCIS.

748
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:38,900
Tony.

749
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,020
I know. Security video can
be so darn unflattering.

750
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:46,900
What's going on?

751
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,340
By tomorrow we'll have your fingerprints
from the storage locker rental agreement.

752
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,980
We'll have a search authorization to
take soil samples from the nursery...

753
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,540
...and match them against trace
evidence from Nora Webb's remains.

754
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,100
I- I don't understand.

755
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,460
You dug up and you moved the body,

756
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,380
...because you were afraid that the new
owners of the nursery would uncover it.

757
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,700
Bruce?

758
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,260
Emmy Poole was an
impressionable teenager,

759
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,260
...raised by a single mom.

760
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,460
Looking for a father figure.

761
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,020
It wasn't like that.

762
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,180
What was it like, Mr. Webb?

763
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,460
Emmy was...

764
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,820
always around.

765
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,660
With Nora.

766
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,020
I enjoyed...

767
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,780
being with them.

768
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,300
It was fun taking them places.

769
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,100
As they got older,

770
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,860
Emmy was...

771
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,900
...advanced.

772
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,180
Sexually precocious.

773
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,460
It all happened so gradual.

774
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,580
And then one day,

775
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,860
...things got out of hand.

776
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,820
I wanted to stop it, but...

777
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,860
What happened that night?

778
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,100
It was late.

779
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,060
My wife was asleep.

780
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,740
Emmy called...

781
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,860
...to warn me that Nora
had found out abouts.

782
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,460
She was...

783
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,620
hysterical.

784
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,260
She and Emmy had gotten
into a fight at the party.

785
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,700
Justin Dobbs...

786
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,020
...didn't know what the fight was about.

787
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,380
He offered to drive Nora home.

788
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,500
I couldn't let Nora tell her mother.

789
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,340
I met her out front,

790
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,580
and I tried to calm her.

791
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,540
But she started screaming.

792
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,100
I j... I put my hand over her mouth.

793
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,500
But she wouldn't stop.

794
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,860
I didn't mean to kill her.

795
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,580
You want to take it from here, Chief?

796
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,500
So I'm thinking about going to Petty
Officer Dobbs's funeral tomorrow.

797
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,660
I've never witnessed the
awarding of a Silver Star.

798
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,620
Would you like to join me?

799
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,500
Worked all weekend.

800
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,340
Guess I could come in
a little late on Monday.

801
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,900
They found Tony's car.

802
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,900
It's on the I-40 in Oklahoma.

803
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,020
"Chopper John is live on the scene."

804
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,180
"That's right..."

805
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,060
Pull over! You'll never get away.

806
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,100
Kind of drives like Gibbs.

807
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,660
That's harsh.

808
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,860
"Oh, my. Is that the driver?"

809
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,820
"Yes, it is, Gray. I can't
believe it, he seems to be moving."

810
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,540
"He's somehow survived."

811
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,580
"The same cannot be
said for the car, John."

812
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,340
It's been completely demolished.

813
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,420
Fiberglass.

814
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,220
Not good for boats, either.

815
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,380
Have a good weekend.

816
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,100
Oh, Tony...

817
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,980
Tony, that sucks.
