00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,215
What's an NCIS agent
doing so far from home?

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,884
I'm teaching a class
on the forensics of cold cases.

4
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:13,388
We're using the murder of a man named
Pedro Hernandez as a case study.

5
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:15,585
He was killed by a sniper
hiding on a ridge

6
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:18,356
- almost a thousand meters from here.
- How do you know that?

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,812
Because the killer left behind
a message on that ridge.

8
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,524
I need you to exhume
the body of Pedro Hernandez.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,942
The body of a drug dealer
from 20 years ago?

10
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,821
- I don't think anyone would mind.
- I think I have it.

11
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:33,819
I matched the bullet
in Pedro Hernandez head

12
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:35,262
to your sniper rifle.

13
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:37,245
I didn't find this out by accident.

14
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:38,287
Rule 40.

15
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,498
If it seems like someone's out
to get you, they are.

16
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:25,376
Welcome to Mexico, Agent Gibbs.

17
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:28,387
Don't even think about it.

18
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:36,471

<i>Following this year's inspirational
commencement speech,</i>

23
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:08,904
<i>the 2010 U.S. Naval Academy
graduating class began</i>

24
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,963
- <i>their weeklong celebration.
</i>- Good times.

25
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,863
<i>And, never to be outdone,</i>

26
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:16,844
<i>the city of Annapolis hopes
to make it a graduation to remember.</i>

27
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,770
Ah, graduation.

28
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:21,308
For many,
an alcohol-induced purple haze.

29
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:22,934
Easy there, Hendrix, it'll pass.

30
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:26,320
Back when I was on Baltimore P.D.,
every graduation,

31
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:29,732
you'd go down to the drunk tank and
100 seniors throwing up on themselves.

32
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:31,102
Good times.

33
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:33,986
Need I remind you that I, too,
will become a graduate soon?

34
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:35,475
With a degree in what?

35
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,114
English as a tenth language.

36
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:39,826
My naturalization interview
is this week,

37
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,795
both the written and oral exams.

38
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,080
It is how an alien
becomes a citizen.

39
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,957
Oh, I know what it means, E.T.

40
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:47,375
You ready?

41
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,457
I think so.

42
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:52,476
Ask me anything.

43
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:57,301
Fifth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States.

44
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:00,620
Due process.

45
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:04,235
No person shall be held
to answer for any capital crime,

46
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,435
- unless indicted by a grand jury.
- Nice.

47
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,363
Not bad, David, not bad at all.

48
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:10,106
DiNozzo,
eighth letter of the alphabet.

49
00:03:10,436 --> 00:03:12,483
- "G."
- No, "H" for homicide.

50
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,944
Got one on the beach in Annapolis.
Could be academy-related.

51
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,423
Let's go.

52
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:17,673
One minute, Gibbs.

53
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:25,018
Every TV station in D.C.'ll be covering
the Annapolis graduation this week,

54
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:28,623
so until we know something,
let's keep this on the down-low.

55
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:31,959
Keep what on the down-low, Director?

56
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:45,975
Hell of a way to go.

57
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:48,417
It smells like mesquite.

58
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,645
Who are you... Bobby Flay?

59
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:53,774
I'm just saying, certain woods
burn differently than others.

60
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:56,193
There's still green.
That's why it's smoldering.

61
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:58,613
Hmm, it is perfect for s'mores.

62
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:01,198
- Never liked s'mores.
- What are you talking about?

63
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:04,280
What's not to like?
You got your chocolate,

64
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:06,828
Graham crackers, Gooey marshmallows.

65
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,733
What kind of Boy Scout are you?

66
00:04:10,654 --> 00:04:12,042
I'm a Webelos, actually.

67
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,545
Well, zip up, Webelos.
Your inner geek is showing.

68
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,050
Are you sure you didn't see
something last night, Ensign Bosch?

69
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:20,228
No, sir.

70
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,141
The fire was ready to go
when we got here.

71
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,784
I set it up the night before
so we could just drop a match and party.

72
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:28,469
And you think

73
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:32,392
someone came during the night and
deliberately hid the body underneath?

74
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:33,813
Had to have, ma'am.

75
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,469
You feeling all right?

76
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:39,222
Tired, sir.

77
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:42,025
I've been up all night, celebrating.

78
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:47,346
Go get some sleep.
We'll be in touch.

79
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:51,272
"Whenever a good nor'wester blows,

80
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:54,461
Christopher is certain
to have sand between the toes."

81
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:56,545
And who exactly is Christopher?

82
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:58,940
He's a creation of A.A. Milne,

83
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:02,140
who, reputedly,
also liked a good romp on the beach.

84
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:03,853
Well, well, well, well...

85
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:07,915
This one put up quite a fight.

86
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,851
Fingernails are broken
at the cuticle.

87
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:14,986
Heat has cooked off
most of the flesh,

88
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:16,988
but not all.

89
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:21,153
Killers often assume
that a good fire will

90
00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:25,174
act like a crematorium.

91
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,736
They are unaware

92
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,330
that it is impossible to generate
the necessary temperature.

93
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,375
See that?

94
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,084
- Wood wasn't hot enough.
- Thank you, Wee Willy Webelos.

95
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:40,243
Do you have your portable fingerprint
scanner with you, Timothy?

96
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:42,049
Yeah, I believe I do.

97
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:47,430
By rehydrating the heat-dried digit

98
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,831
with saline,

99
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,637
the swirls
and ridges regain definition,

100
00:05:52,865 --> 00:05:55,570
possibly allowing us
to get an identification.

101
00:05:55,946 --> 00:05:57,481
It's like watering a mummy.

102
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:08,743
Anything?

103
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:14,419
Words, McGee.

104
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:17,064
Boss,
this is Special Agent Lara Macy.

105
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:35,836
According to Special Agent
Macy's personnel file,

106
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,065
she left the L.A. office
last year under special circumstances.

107
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,697
Was transferred to the Force
Protection Detachment in Marseille.

108
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:44,760
You're supposed to feel safer
on American soil.

109
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:46,944
That could have happened anywhere.
To any of us.

110
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:48,498
That is the risk we take.

111
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:50,320
The agency's on alert.

112
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:52,453
The director has ordered
a threat assessment.

113
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,913
So now what?

114
00:06:54,017 --> 00:06:54,993
We assess.

115
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:57,458
Figure out who killed
another female federal agent.

116
00:06:57,762 --> 00:07:00,044
And uphold justice
to the full extent of the law.

117
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:01,493
Or whatever it takes.

118
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:04,799
Okay, she's a Marine,

119
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:07,051
an agent, a daughter.

120
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,095
All right, daughter first.

121
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,405
Macy's mom lives on a farm
in Cumberland, Maryland.

122
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:14,437
- Call her. Tell her we're coming.
- On it.

123
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,357
Right away.

124
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:23,417
A member
of Special Agent Macy's team

125
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:25,319
from Marseille is calling into MTAC.

126
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:29,031
Threat assessment's been put out.
Think they know?

127
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,304
<i>Special Agent Macy left
four days ago, sir.</i>

128
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,624
<i>A flight from De Gaulle to Dulles,
aboard a C-130 transport.</i>

129
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,000
Do you know why?

130
00:07:41,013 --> 00:07:42,628
<i>Said she needed some personal time.</i>

131
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:49,301
Special Agent Macy is dead.

132
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,389
We found her here in Annapolis
early this morning.

133
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:58,727
<i>How...? What happened?</i>

134
00:07:58,976 --> 00:07:59,976
She was murdered.

135
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:02,690
On my watch, Agent Mineoux.

136
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:04,775
So if you think
this is case-related,

137
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,445
I'm gonna need every document, file
that you can get your hands on.

138
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,050
<i>Of course.
We'll send everything.</i>

139
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:13,826
<i>But it doesn't make sense.</i>

140
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,202
<i>Who would want her dead?</i>

141
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:18,038
You check her apartment,
her phone records and her mail.

142
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:20,291
Any idea where she was staying
while she was here?

143
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:24,096
<i>She said I could reach her
at a hotel in Norfolk...</i>

144
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,284
<i>the Freemont Inn.</i>

145
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,508
<i>This is a great loss for us,
Director.</i>

146
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:31,135
<i>The whole agency.</i>

147
00:08:31,382 --> 00:08:32,802
You have no idea.

148
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:35,806
It's just us. So tell me...

149
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,350
who did this wretched thing to you?

150
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:41,224
Did it merely coincide
with your line of work,

151
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:43,397
or was it caused by it?

152
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:46,192
Your silence speaks volumes.

153
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,110
It's amazing how someone so demure

154
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:50,433
can say so much with so little.

155
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,807
- You're talking to yourself again.
- On the contrary.

156
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:55,659
Agent Macy is enlightening me.
Take a look at this.

157
00:08:56,112 --> 00:08:57,637
There's a bone chip

158
00:08:57,963 --> 00:09:01,407
on the anterior side
of the C-4 vertebra.

159
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:03,584
I believe a serrated knife

160
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,002
was pulled violently up
and across her neck,

161
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:08,479
practically severing it
from the spinal column.

162
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:10,143
Macy could hold her own.

163
00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:13,260
- Professional hit?
- Well, certainly looks like it.

164
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:16,805
If someone wanted her dead,
why wait until she got home?

165
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,135
And why set her remains ablaze

166
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:22,686
in NCIS jurisdiction?

167
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:32,845
- Hey, Abs, what do you got?
- Questions. For you.

168
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:34,376
Case first.

169
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:40,207
People only travel for two reasons,
business or pleasure.

170
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:42,529
If Agent Macy
was traveling for pleasure

171
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:44,773
then why didn't she stay
at her mom's house in Maryland?

172
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:46,710
Instead, she checked into a motel

173
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,380
and everything we collected
from her room is work-related, so...

174
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:52,081
Work-related items,
work-related visit.

175
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:55,049
That's her NCIS laptop.
And that's her work cell phone.

176
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:56,595
Last call?

177
00:09:57,168 --> 00:09:59,274
It was incoming,
from early last evening.

178
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:02,251
From a store-bought disposable.
I'm trying to track it now.

179
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:05,062
What's really interesting are
the five calls that Agent Macy made

180
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,876
in the last three days.

181
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,148
All to a Petty Officer
Kaylen Burrows.

182
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,192
Pull the file.

183
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:11,902
I already did.

184
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:18,949
Burrows is currently stationed
on the USS Majestic.

185
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,371
It's been docked outside Marseille
until a few weeks ago, and then

186
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:26,347
made port in Norfolk
at the same time that Agent Macy did.

187
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:29,094
Agent Macy followed
Burrows back to the States.

188
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:31,821
- Business...
- Not pleasure.

189
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:36,343
Speaking of business,
we need to talk.

190
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:37,708
About...

191
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,792
stuff... and things.

192
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,225
Not now, Abs.

193
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:56,829
Hello, Mr. Gibbs.

194
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:59,073
Miss Hart,
still not used to you wandering around.

195
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,338
I got a pass now, remember?

196
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:07,364
Limited access.

197
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,679
Your client... Colonel Bell...

198
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:11,462
he'll be disappointed.

199
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,519
This isn't about the Colonel.

200
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:15,703
Actually,
I'm on my way to see Ms. Sciuto.

201
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:17,801
The Mexican government
wants their body back.

202
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:20,429
It's just a drug dealer.

203
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,266
Maybe, but if you had an unsolved case,
you'd want your evidence back, too.

204
00:11:25,588 --> 00:11:27,061
You better get to work.

205
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:29,255
Do you want to grab
some dinner later?

206
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:31,321
No, I can't.

207
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:32,665
Beer?

208
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:35,831
No. Can't do that, either.

209
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:38,906
If I didn't know any better, Mr. Gibbs,
I'd think you were avoiding me.

210
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,514
Something smells good.

211
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,245
Oh, yeah.

212
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,546
- You like mashed potatoes?
- We are not here to eat, Tony.

213
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:56,467
Well, I mourn, I eat.

214
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:57,636
I'm Italian.

215
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,014
Jews and Italians
are similar that way.

216
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,080
That's her.

217
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:05,377
Petty Officer Burrows?

218
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:06,852
Yes.

219
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,427
NCIS. This is Agent David,
I'm Agent DiNozzo.

220
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:11,764
- Can we talk?
- I'm running a little late.

221
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:13,524
I have a quarterdeck watch to start.

222
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:17,626
How's the flan?

223
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,990
The what?

224
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:21,782
Custard-like dessert
on your plate there.

225
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:26,120
It's tough to master the flan.
Texture needs to be smooth.

226
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:27,605
Just the right ratio

227
00:12:27,908 --> 00:12:30,290
of milk to vanilla to caramel.

228
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,001
- Can we stop talking about the flan?
- What are you, anti-flan?

229
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:36,960
Will you tell us
what happened between you and

230
00:12:37,044 --> 00:12:39,091
Special Agent Macy in Marseille?

231
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:43,679
- I don't know who that is.
- Sure, you do.

232
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:46,765
You guys spoke this week...
five times.

233
00:12:47,336 --> 00:12:50,519
Petty Officer, we need to go.
We're gonna be late for muster.

234
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,813
That's kind of cute how you guys
all look out for each other.

235
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,276
And you ate all your flan.
Well done, big boy.

236
00:12:57,738 --> 00:12:59,194
This is a private conversation.

237
00:12:59,414 --> 00:13:02,406
Well, this is a U.S. Naval vessel,
ma'am, and we have responsibilities.

238
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:03,699
And so do we.

239
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,493
She'll meet you up on deck.

240
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:08,370
Gentlemen.

241
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,585
I did it!

242
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,706
Did what?

243
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:18,714
<i>I busted through the back door
of</i> Agent Macy's encrypted laptop.

244
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:22,050
Agent Macy had started a case file,

245
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,720
but she never turned it in
because it was incomplete.

246
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,606
Why?

247
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,514
<i>The victim in</i> the crime
refused to testify.

248
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,349
As a matter of fact, the victim

249
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,677
refused to cooperate at all.

250
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,479
And who was the victim, exactly?

251
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,108
Petty Officer Second Class
Kaylen Burrows.

252
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:43,030
What was the crime?

253
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:45,033
Rape.

254
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:59,129
Tell us what happened in France,
Kaylen.

255
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,755
Nothing you say will leave
this room.

256
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:04,092
You can't promise that, ma'am.

257
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:06,470
No disrespect, but,

258
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:09,477
I've been in this Navy too long.

259
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:12,394
I know better.

260
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:20,501
According to the ship's log,

261
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:24,085
you had a 24-hour liberty
in Marseille.

262
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:25,725
It's a fun town.

263
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:27,366
I guess.

264
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,228
A little Bordeaux, little Cognac.

265
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:31,161
Things went too far?

266
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:36,500
I met someone, we partied.

267
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:39,108
I'm as responsible as anyone.

268
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:42,589
Can anybody verify that?

269
00:14:43,354 --> 00:14:44,591
It seems your shipmates,

270
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,335
Capetanos and Wachter,
were on liberty, as well.

271
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:49,736
Why did they not want you
to talk to us?

272
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,223
What I did is my business.

273
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:53,074
Look...

274
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:55,949
you were attacked.

275
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,138
I'm not pressing any charges.

276
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:04,968
Yeah, I told Agent Macy
the same thing.

277
00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:06,093
I just...

278
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:08,305
want to go back to the Majestic now.

279
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:09,738
Well...

280
00:15:12,857 --> 00:15:13,787
No can do.

281
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:15,303
Why?

282
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,967
Because you're also a witness
in a murder investigation.

283
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:22,004
That's impossible.

284
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,174
Who?

285
00:15:26,444 --> 00:15:28,318
Special Agent Lara Macy.

286
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,590
I've already approved the return of
Pedro Hernandez's body back to Mexico.

287
00:15:36,963 --> 00:15:38,667
Your liaison, Ms. Hart,

288
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:41,472
has agreed to make
the transportation arrangements.

289
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:44,654
The evidence should be on its way
in a few days, Mr. Rivera.

290
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,514
<i>My government and I very much appreciate
your assistance, Director Vance,</i>

291
00:15:49,886 --> 00:15:51,539
<i>especially loaning us Ms. Sciuto.</i>

292
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:54,578
<i>Her visit was illuminating,
to say the least.</i>

293
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,513
I think Ms. Sciuto enjoyed her time
in your country, too, for the most part.

294
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,993
Let me videoconference her in.

295
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,599
<i>Buenas noches</i>, everyone.

296
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:13,221
<i>Abby, I am still amazed</i>

297
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,166
<i>that you've managed
to make progress in such an old case.</i>

298
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:18,844
<i>I am very much looking forward
to reading your report.</i>

299
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,078
<i>So am I.</i>

300
00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:23,398
See,
that's what I wanted to mention.

301
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,984
<i>'Cause I really need
a little more time with it.</i>

302
00:16:26,106 --> 00:16:28,347
<i>You know, just to make sure
I did a thorough job.</i>

303
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:29,775
<i>I mean, it's...</i>

304
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:36,617
<i>I need to double-check
and triple-check everything.</i>

305
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,947
Señor Rivera, you'll have
that report as soon as possible.

306
00:16:40,226 --> 00:16:42,914
<i>We did just lose an agent, Director,</i>

307
00:16:42,998 --> 00:16:44,461
<i>and that does take priority.</i>

308
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,588
It's certainly a priority of mine.

309
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:48,537
<i>I'm sorry, Director Vance.</i>

310
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:51,843
<i>I know what it's like to lose
people fighting for a cause.</i>

311
00:16:52,118 --> 00:16:54,054
- <i>We face it every day.</i>
- Thank you.

312
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:57,730
<i>Alejandro, I swear I'll get it
to you as soon as I can.</i>

313
00:16:58,304 --> 00:16:59,480
<i>Of course, Abby.</i>

314
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:02,331
<i>I hate to see so much
on that brilliant mind of yours.</i>

315
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:05,288
<i>The case has been
dormant for 20 years.</i>

316
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,437
<i>A few more days cannot hurt.</i>

317
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:10,329
<i>Thank you, Ms. Sciuto.</i>

318
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:22,833
Did you know my daughter well?

319
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:26,378
Well, unfortunately,
I only got to meet her one time.

320
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:29,022
She was an outstanding agent.

321
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,509
Good person.

322
00:17:36,742 --> 00:17:38,181
It's excellent tea, ma'am.

323
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:40,058
It was her favorite.

324
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:44,351
Lara and I used to sit
with a pot and talk for hours.

325
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:48,905
Funny how a cup of tea
can mean so much.

326
00:17:51,936 --> 00:17:54,072
We're gonna need to go
through her belongings.

327
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:59,549
Well, everything in Lara's room's
exactly as she left it.

328
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:03,331
Clothes in the closet date
all the way back to high school.

329
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:09,421
But I already showed
your people everything.

330
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:12,841
Not our people, ma'am.

331
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:16,678
Yes. There was a man here earlier.
He couldn't have been nicer.

332
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:18,723
Can you describe him?

333
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,349
Handsome. Military.

334
00:18:22,344 --> 00:18:24,102
After he went through her room,

335
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,675
I showed him
the mud room off the kitchen.

336
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,747
That's
where she kept her papers and...

337
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:31,754
whatnot.

338
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:35,316
Oh, dear,

339
00:18:35,688 --> 00:18:36,865
he left quite a mess.

340
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,793
- All of this is Lara's?
- Most of it.

341
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:45,307
Amazing what we collect
over the years.

342
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,104
I really need to get in here
and go through these things.

343
00:18:49,188 --> 00:18:50,757
So many memories.

344
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,840
Agent Macy's personal notes.

345
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,018
There's years of them here.

346
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:59,011
All dating back to when she was an M.P.
at Pendleton.

347
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:05,583
Box it. All of it, McGee.
Check the dates.

348
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,196
See if anything's missing.

349
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,189
Try to figure out
what this guy's looking for.

350
00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:10,826
Anything in particular?

351
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:15,291
Just check it.

352
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:22,327
Get a sketch artist out there.
Let's I.D. this guy.

353
00:19:22,774 --> 00:19:24,955
I already made the call,
but I can make it again...

354
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:27,165
- Making it again, Boss.
- Come on, chew.

355
00:19:29,213 --> 00:19:30,621
What do you got from overseas?

356
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:32,950
Agents spoke to the owner
of the bar that

357
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:35,173
- Burrows was in the night of the rape.
- Swallow.

358
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:37,957
Remembers an American
civilian hanging with her.

359
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:39,970
Young guy, big mouth, big drinker.

360
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:41,605
Does he got a name?

361
00:19:43,946 --> 00:19:46,476
I used a credit card
to run his bank statements,

362
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:49,603
and came up with a Tyler Hammond,

363
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:52,519
22, out of Chevy Chase.
His dad...

364
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,943
Randall,

365
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:57,737
is a big muckety-muck builder
in D.C.

366
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:01,347
He founded Derby Winner Construction.
They've got sites all over the city.

367
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,185
Junior finished Georgetown last year.
Kicked around for a little bit,

368
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,985
Mom and Dad got tired of his face,
sent him to Europe for 3 months.

369
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:08,623
- He still in Europe?
- Negatory.

370
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:11,334
Flew back a week ago.
Tyler's home now.

371
00:20:11,437 --> 00:20:14,527
- Maybe Agent Macy went to see him.
- Maybe she got too close.

372
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:16,368
Take Ziva.

373
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:17,799
Bring him in.

374
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:21,292
This community relies
on its police department,

375
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:23,564
and this is the kind
of support we get?

376
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:25,056
I know you're chief of police,

377
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,517
but I pay a lot of taxes
to keep this neighborhood safe.

378
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,477
I want you to find those men.
Do you hear me?

379
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:31,945
- What is going on here?
- It's a nice fountain.

380
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:33,356
It's very Caesar Palace.

381
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,315
Hey, guys.
You Tyler Hammond?

382
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:36,526
Who the hell are you?

383
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,697
Damn Navy.
Where were you a few minutes ago?

384
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:43,458
Can you tell us what's going on?

385
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,580
A couple of guys in ski masks pulled up
and beat the daylights out of my son.

386
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,047
Well, that's not good.

387
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:52,207
Can you describe these guys, Tyler?

388
00:20:52,897 --> 00:20:53,652
Big.

389
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:55,879
I never saw them coming.

390
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,256
So you did not see their faces?

391
00:20:58,509 --> 00:20:59,894
Didn't need to.

392
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:03,386
They took off in an SUV
with Navy base permits on the glass.

393
00:21:04,177 --> 00:21:07,140
Couple of respectable military guys
beating up an innocent kid.

394
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,074
I have friends at the Pentagon.
I'm going to call my lawyer.

395
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:11,632
And I'm going to sue you people.

396
00:21:11,716 --> 00:21:13,066
Okay. All right.

397
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:15,501
Why don't you call Gibbs,
give him a heads-up?

398
00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:17,692
Tell him
our attacker's been attacked.

399
00:21:29,296 --> 00:21:30,551
Special Agent Gibbs.

400
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:33,375
How you feeling, Tyler?

401
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:35,402
We've been waiting for you
for over an hour.

402
00:21:35,486 --> 00:21:36,962
It's nice of you to finally show.

403
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,656
Busy day, Mr. Hammond.

404
00:21:38,954 --> 00:21:41,716
Maybe you need to get your priorities
straight, Special Agent Gibbs.

405
00:21:41,855 --> 00:21:43,343
Look what they did to my son.

406
00:21:43,827 --> 00:21:45,011
Who, exactly?

407
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:47,013
Navy guys.

408
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:48,264
Your Navy.

409
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:50,624
I was walking to my car.
They grabbed me and...

410
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,185
You don't need to say any more.

411
00:21:53,398 --> 00:21:54,646
Sound advice. Who are you?

412
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,692
Marshall Tomko,
Mr. Hammond's attorney.

413
00:21:58,201 --> 00:21:59,985
Well, you're right, Mr. Tomko.

414
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:02,792
Tyler, you don't have
to say anything else.

415
00:22:03,274 --> 00:22:04,656
It makes you look guilty.

416
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,685
My son didn't do anything wrong.

417
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:10,120
That's not
what Petty Officer Burrows says.

418
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:12,493
I know all about her,
her little story.

419
00:22:13,203 --> 00:22:14,374
She's lying.

420
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:17,385
If your son's so clean,
why'd two Navy sailors

421
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,254
drive all the way out here
to kick his ass?

422
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:21,570
Because Tyler Hammond
witnessed them rape

423
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:23,560
one of their own
that evening in Marseille.

424
00:22:24,225 --> 00:22:26,218
He tried to stop it, but couldn't.

425
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,995
That's not the Petty
Officer's story.

426
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,974
She's afraid, intimidated.

427
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,511
They're on that ship together, 24/7.

428
00:22:32,837 --> 00:22:34,519
They know that Tyler can I.D. them.

429
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:37,380
They're scared he'll talk,
and they're desperate.

430
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,684
It's a theory.

431
00:22:41,572 --> 00:22:43,862
How about you, Tyler?
You got an opinion?

432
00:22:48,124 --> 00:22:49,811
My son just wanted to help.

433
00:22:50,556 --> 00:22:52,203
And this is the thanks he gets.

434
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,003
What if the lawyer's right?
What if her shipmates did do it?

435
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:04,667
Then I understand why Petty Officer
Burrows has kept her mouth shut.

436
00:23:05,094 --> 00:23:06,074
I don't.

437
00:23:06,158 --> 00:23:08,038
Why would you let someone
get away with rape?

438
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:10,610
Perception.
Burrows is in the military.

439
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,225
If a woman cries rape,
no man on that ship would ever

440
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,685
totally trust her again.

441
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,575
Well, you're a woman.
What would you do?

442
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:20,151
I'm different.

443
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:22,882
After torturing them
until they cried like babies,

444
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:24,819
I would castrate them.

445
00:23:25,565 --> 00:23:27,154
Give them what they deserve.

446
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,909
- Spoken like a true almost-American.
- Background check.

447
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,214
I'm listening.

448
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:35,541
Wachter and Capetanos both
show some teenage offenses.

449
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,208
Both were on 24-hour liberty from
the Majestic the night Macy was killed.

450
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,997
And Seaman Wachter did sign out
a motor pool van earlier today.

451
00:23:43,226 --> 00:23:45,131
It's possible Burrows
is being strong-armed.

452
00:23:45,347 --> 00:23:47,633
And when Macy started snooping,
they killed her, too?

453
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,552
Agent Macy's investigation shows
a hospital rape kit

454
00:23:50,684 --> 00:23:53,223
was administered the morning
after Burrows was attacked.

455
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,766
Swabs, blood work, everything.

456
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:56,392
Were the results determined?

457
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:57,811
You can't tell from here.

458
00:23:58,014 --> 00:24:00,813
When Burrows backed off the case,
the results were never posted.

459
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,774
Have Abby check with
the infirmary on the ship.

460
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,668
See if that rape kit's still there.
You talk to those enlisted guys.

461
00:24:05,752 --> 00:24:07,754
- Already did it, Boss.
- Do it again!

462
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:10,357
Doing it again, Boss.

463
00:24:15,594 --> 00:24:17,643
Everybody out except you two,
Wachter,

464
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:19,749
Capetanos.

465
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:26,822
George,

466
00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:29,300
is this your con-locker?

467
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:37,600
You don't mind?

468
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,514
We have a witness that puts you and,

469
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,609
Big Karl at Tyler Hammond's house.

470
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:49,759
You guys make a habit
of beating up civilians?

471
00:24:50,353 --> 00:24:51,717
What are you looking for, sir?

472
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:53,092
- Evidence.
- Of what?

473
00:24:53,176 --> 00:24:55,201
The assault
on Petty Officer Burrows.

474
00:24:55,509 --> 00:24:57,067
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

475
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,926
'Cause every time I look at her,
you guys are...

476
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:03,133
all over her.

477
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:05,752
You afraid
she's gonna say something?

478
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:07,463
You got it wrong.

479
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,258
What about the murder
of Special Agent Lara Macy?

480
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:12,135
- This is outta hand.
- Shut up!

481
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,720
- We don't know...
- Shut up!

482
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,013
You shut up!

483
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,440
Look, we jumped that rich punk,
Hammond.

484
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,515
We were at the bar
that night in Marseille.

485
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,399
We saw them leave together.
He raped Petty Officer Burrows.

486
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:29,394
She's one of us.

487
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,362
And we take care of our own.

488
00:25:32,021 --> 00:25:35,000
So you're confessing
to the fistfight,

489
00:25:35,757 --> 00:25:38,003
but not the rape or the murder.

490
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,871
And why should we believe you?

491
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:44,233
Because it's the truth.

492
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:52,934
Relax.

493
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:54,761
Exhale.

494
00:25:57,483 --> 00:26:00,573
- I'm trying, sir.
- Try harder, and don't call me sir.

495
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:06,817
Not forcing you to do anything here.

496
00:26:08,903 --> 00:26:09,738
I know.

497
00:26:13,498 --> 00:26:16,658
I get the kind of pressure, the kind
of scrutiny you're under, Kaylen.

498
00:26:20,283 --> 00:26:22,330
Don't let whoever did this
get away with it.

499
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:27,979
It's not just about you.
It's about the truth.

500
00:26:30,183 --> 00:26:31,888
It's about a dead NCIS agent.

501
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:38,221
It's about somebody
getting away with murder...

502
00:26:39,704 --> 00:26:41,057
until now.

503
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,277
Special Agent Lara Macy.

504
00:26:57,154 --> 00:26:58,787
She died trying...

505
00:26:59,323 --> 00:27:00,827
to arrest whoever did this to you.

506
00:27:04,304 --> 00:27:05,440
That was her job.

507
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:08,366
Now this is my job.

508
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:14,612
So, who did it?

509
00:27:16,113 --> 00:27:17,593
Those two sailors on the Majestic?

510
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:18,688
No!

511
00:27:24,906 --> 00:27:26,376
It was the College kid...

512
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:29,981
Tyler Hammond.

513
00:27:35,078 --> 00:27:36,677
But he wasn't alone.

514
00:27:41,317 --> 00:27:43,136
It's contaminated, Gibbs.

515
00:27:43,688 --> 00:27:44,854
Burrows' rape kit?

516
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:47,259
Also known as a Vitullo kit. Yeah.

517
00:27:47,496 --> 00:27:49,991
When Petty Officer Burrows
refused to allow its use,

518
00:27:50,258 --> 00:27:52,784
the hospital filed it away
in some storage closet.

519
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:54,865
I mean, legally,
they have to run the test anyway,

520
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:57,263
but by the time they processed it,
something happened.

521
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:00,553
Abs, you can't pull
anything from it?

522
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:03,923
I'm really sorry, Gibbs,
but scientifically,

523
00:28:04,237 --> 00:28:07,367
you're no closer to knowing who did this
than you're when you started.

524
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:11,123
- Give me the results, anyway.
- I just told you they're useless.

525
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:12,307
I know that.

526
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:15,033
Well, I know that you know, but I...
I'm confused.

527
00:28:16,465 --> 00:28:19,030
I know.
You're doing your Gibbs thing,

528
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,697
to get a confession.

529
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:23,450
Get Tyler Hammond back in here.

530
00:28:23,563 --> 00:28:24,452
<i>I'm on it.</i>

531
00:28:28,217 --> 00:28:31,501
I know that Special
Agent Macy's murder

532
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,149
is super important,

533
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:36,228
and I know that you guys have
a long history together

534
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:38,530
going back to
when you were a Marine.

535
00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:40,593
And not a lot of people know that,
but Gibbs,

536
00:28:41,174 --> 00:28:44,328
we really need
to talk about Mexico...

537
00:28:50,137 --> 00:28:51,520
What'd you just say?

538
00:28:52,954 --> 00:28:55,189
I said we need
to talk about Mexico...

539
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:08,448
Agent Macy's notebooks chronologically,
I have figured out what we're missing.

540
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,998
January '91 through February '92.

541
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,127
Those are all dates
when Macy was an MP at Pendleton.

542
00:29:14,364 --> 00:29:16,598
Now that's the same time
that you were at Pendleton.

543
00:29:20,672 --> 00:29:23,320
- Boss, what's going on?
- Drawing of the guy from Macy's house.

544
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:25,086
I need an I.D., McGee, now.

545
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,849
<i>Bueno?</i>

546
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:36,189
<i>Habla usted inglés?</i>

547
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,110
<i>Sí</i>. This is Camila.
Who is this?

548
00:29:39,318 --> 00:29:41,375
Camila, this is Jethro Gibbs,
Mike Franks' friend.

549
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,778
<i>Señor Gibbs! Como estas?</i>

550
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:46,492
<i>Bien.</i> I need you to get
a message to Mike for me.

551
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:49,871
I have not seen him. But when he comes
in, I will make sure he...

552
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,251
You need to get the message to him now.
Right now.

553
00:29:52,335 --> 00:29:53,585
<i>Sí, señor. I will try.</i>

554
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:56,408
The message is "Rule number 44".

555
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:57,712
Repeat it back to me.

556
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,353
Rule 44.

557
00:29:59,437 --> 00:30:01,158
He will know what this means?

558
00:30:01,242 --> 00:30:02,592
<i>Just give him the message.</i>

559
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:05,062
Make sure he has Leyla
and Amira with him.

560
00:30:05,524 --> 00:30:07,054
Just do that, okay?

561
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,846
Señor Gibbs, are you all right?

562
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:16,707
Kaylen Burrows had a rape kit done
the night of the attack.

563
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,747
It's positive.
Your son's DNA's all over it.

564
00:30:19,035 --> 00:30:21,569
- There has to be some kind of mistake.
- There's no mistake.

565
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,614
I know what's going on here, Gibbs.

566
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:29,827
- This is the Navy covering for its own.
- It's positive for you, too!

567
00:30:31,111 --> 00:30:32,455
You flew to France

568
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,750
to meet Tyler for a few days,
spend some quality time with your son.

569
00:30:36,414 --> 00:30:39,480
He didn't rape that girl alone.
You both raped her together!

570
00:30:42,777 --> 00:30:44,777
Who the hell do you think you are?

571
00:30:46,738 --> 00:30:49,604
- We're done here.
- Sit your asses down!

572
00:30:53,947 --> 00:30:55,478
I'd like to speak to my son.

573
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,044
I'd like to speak to Lara Macy,
but she's dead!

574
00:30:58,128 --> 00:30:59,128
Did you kill her?

575
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:02,276
Who the hell is Lara freakin' Macy?

576
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:04,987
Did you kill her?!

577
00:31:05,915 --> 00:31:06,864
Did you?!

578
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:11,452
That Navy girl...

579
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,414
She was drunk, but she wanted it.

580
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,222
But I swear

581
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:19,126
we didn't kill anybody!

582
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:25,297
<i>We didn't kill that agent.</i>

583
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,611
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

584
00:31:38,903 --> 00:31:41,274
Duck, the knife used to kill
Lara Macy...

585
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,968
who made the knife?

586
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:48,195
For the most part,
linking a specific weapon

587
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:50,907
to a nick in a human bone
is virtually impossible.

588
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:51,993
Okay, but?

589
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,869
But... in this case,

590
00:31:54,953 --> 00:31:57,569
I can go out on the proverbial limb.

591
00:31:58,093 --> 00:32:02,062
The pattern is indicative
of a KA-BAR 12-77.

592
00:32:04,232 --> 00:32:05,687
12-77.

593
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,967
That's an Army knife.

594
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:12,013
Yes. Our assailant knew
that the first cut had to be sufficient.

595
00:32:12,373 --> 00:32:16,058
He ended her life deliberately,
brutally and without hesitation.

596
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:18,111
She was executed.

597
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,271
Yeah, and then left
to be discovered,

598
00:32:20,512 --> 00:32:24,025
to taunt whoever would be hurt
the most by her untimely death.

599
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,318
Not unlike leaving a single bullet

600
00:32:28,402 --> 00:32:30,448
to be found in the Mexican sun.

601
00:32:33,634 --> 00:32:37,446
You're familiar with the kind
of killer to which I speak.

602
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:44,748
I am.

603
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:46,435
Now, Jethro... Wait.

604
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,591
This is as much about you
as it is about Special Agent Macy.

605
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:52,021
Listen to me.

606
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:54,071
I autopsied Pedro Hernandez.

607
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:55,952
The name seemed familiar
at the time.

608
00:32:56,036 --> 00:32:57,642
Now I know why.

609
00:32:59,096 --> 00:33:03,065
I know what you've been carrying
around for nearly 20 years.

610
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:08,625
You may not have wanted this to come
to the surface, but someone else did.

611
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:11,572
And now they are forcing your hand.

612
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:13,824
Who is it?

613
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,343
I mean, tell me Jethro!

614
00:33:19,189 --> 00:33:21,115
Señor, I am glad you answered.

615
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,371
Camila, did Franks get my message?

616
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,608
Sí, señor, but there are men here.

617
00:33:25,692 --> 00:33:28,122
<i>Soldados. </i>Soldiers with guns.

618
00:33:28,308 --> 00:33:29,840
Your <i>amigo</i> is in bad trouble.

619
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:38,706
Where is he?

620
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,434
I don't know
what you're talking about.

621
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,000
The hell you don't.
Colonel Bell.

622
00:33:42,326 --> 00:33:43,396
Where is he?

623
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:45,648
- I haven't spoken to him.
- Sure, you have.

624
00:33:45,894 --> 00:33:47,566
What are you doing to me, Allison?

625
00:33:47,968 --> 00:33:50,680
- I'm here to help with the task force.
- This isn't about that.

626
00:33:50,764 --> 00:33:53,739
This is about Colonel Merton Bell
using you to get to me.

627
00:33:54,148 --> 00:33:56,356
I haven't told him
anything about you.

628
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,406
You must have,
'cause people around me are dying.

629
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,870
People I care about.

630
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,059
Bell is after me.

631
00:34:01,143 --> 00:34:02,970
Because you threw him
in a Mexican jail.

632
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,816
- He's a criminal.
- Is he?

633
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:06,544
Is that for you to decide?

634
00:34:06,737 --> 00:34:08,295
I am his attorney, Mr. Gibbs.

635
00:34:08,483 --> 00:34:10,745
He's a patriot.
It's my job to defend him.

636
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:12,503
He's a murderer!

637
00:34:14,726 --> 00:34:17,197
How's it feel to be
in the murder business, Ms. Hart?

638
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:19,593
- I don't like what you're suggesting.
- Be honest with me!

639
00:34:19,677 --> 00:34:21,766
Just one time, be honest with me.

640
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,417
Where is he?

641
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:36,157
Last I heard,
he was headed back down to Mexico.

642
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:38,212
To Baja.

643
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:43,330
What are you going to do?

644
00:34:44,636 --> 00:34:46,444
You're making a dangerous mistake.

645
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,296
Bell's corporate jet

646
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,297
registered a flight plan out
of Virginia two days ago.

647
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:55,383
Final destination was Mexico.

648
00:34:56,281 --> 00:34:57,810
They're after Mike Franks.

649
00:34:58,453 --> 00:35:00,094
Pulled the passenger manifest:

650
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:02,808
Flight crew, Bell himself and a couple
of his current employees.

651
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:04,185
Names, backgrounds.

652
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:07,295
We've got one ex-con, a few dishonorable
discharges, all low-ranking,

653
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:08,564
except for this guy.

654
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,129
Former Army Ranger Jason Paul Dean.

655
00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:15,041
Army Ranger.

656
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:19,116
Highly decorated, until he killed
Afghan civilians and got discharged.

657
00:35:19,345 --> 00:35:22,441
After which, he was hired
by none other than Merton Bell.

658
00:35:22,525 --> 00:35:24,187
Two peas in a bullet-proof pod.

659
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,911
I think we've got a match
on who stole Agent Macy's notebooks.

660
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,643
Last call Macy got was
from a disposable cell.

661
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:34,799
- Abby find out where that came from?
- Still working on it.

662
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:38,093
Info on Bell
after he landed in Mexico.

663
00:35:39,143 --> 00:35:42,553
- Anything specific you want me...
- Everything. I want everything.

664
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:47,504
Gibbs, come and look at this.

665
00:35:48,097 --> 00:35:49,104
Talk to me, Abs.

666
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:52,369
The disposable cell phone
that was used to call Agent Macy...

667
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:55,302
finally tracked it to a convenience
store in Norfolk.

668
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:59,573
I'm processing the security camera
footage to find out who bought it.

669
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,277
But it's... it's gonna take a while.

670
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,579
You know, if you want to just relax.

671
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,683
Relax?

672
00:36:16,903 --> 00:36:18,020
This is a lockdown.

673
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:19,176
A what?

674
00:36:19,336 --> 00:36:20,924
We're going to talk, Gibbs.

675
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,427
- Like hell. Not now.
- Yes!

676
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:24,932
Now!

677
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:30,478
Since when did I become the kid
in class that the teacher won't call on?

678
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:35,913
The evidence in my report says
that you killed

679
00:36:36,135 --> 00:36:37,695
Pedro Hernandez.

680
00:36:39,556 --> 00:36:41,654
And you're not even willing
to talk to me about it.

681
00:36:41,738 --> 00:36:43,391
I didn't think I needed to.

682
00:36:45,982 --> 00:36:47,790
I owe you everything.

683
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:49,665
You're Gibbs.

684
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:56,180
No one needs to know the truth
about the Hernandez investigation.

685
00:36:57,588 --> 00:37:00,951
I am willing to do anything for you.

686
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:04,744
I just need you
to tell me what to do.

687
00:37:04,828 --> 00:37:06,004
No, you don't, Abs.

688
00:37:07,823 --> 00:37:10,042
I've only ever needed you
to do one thing.

689
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,713
My job.

690
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,830
But it's different this time.
I mean, it has to be, right?

691
00:37:19,378 --> 00:37:20,426
No, it doesn't.

692
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:34,024
Former Army Ranger Jason Dean.

693
00:37:35,525 --> 00:37:36,237
Hell...

694
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,378
He's one of Bell's men.

695
00:37:39,145 --> 00:37:41,758
I bet his knife matches
Agent Macy's wound.

696
00:37:42,484 --> 00:37:43,928
You know too much, Abby.

697
00:37:51,496 --> 00:37:52,646
What do I do?

698
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:55,615
You send in the report
to the task force.

699
00:37:58,723 --> 00:37:59,572
All of it.

700
00:38:00,922 --> 00:38:01,877
I know.

701
00:38:03,886 --> 00:38:06,075
You shouldn't have to tell me,
right?

702
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:22,583
Where's Gibbs?

703
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,522
Security said he ran out
of this place like it was on fire.

704
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:28,432
Excuse me, Sir,
but why am I here exactly?

705
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:30,422
'Cause based on what I'm hearing,

706
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:35,771
Special Agent Macy's killer
worked for Colonel Bell... your client.

707
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:41,402
This is Lieutenant Jason Paul Dean.
That was Bell's right-hand man.

708
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:43,277
I don't represent Mr. Dean.

709
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:46,322
But you represent Bell's firm...
First Defense PMC.

710
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:48,574
Dean is employed by First Defense.

711
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:51,632
Which means you're in the hot seat,
M. Allison Hart.

712
00:38:52,144 --> 00:38:53,330
I'll find Gibbs.

713
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:01,137
- Before you say anything...
- Before you try to explain to me

714
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:03,341
why I don't have
the legal right to question you,

715
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,589
let me assure you, I looked into it.
I do.

716
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:11,190
This is a possible matter
of National Security,

717
00:39:11,655 --> 00:39:15,124
thanks to Bell crossing federal borders
and working with narco-terrorists.

718
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:17,804
Which gives me a whole lot
of wiggle room.

719
00:39:19,995 --> 00:39:21,192
Do I need a lawyer?

720
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:22,815
You need to listen.

721
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,294
I got a lot of pieces
to a puzzle here.

722
00:39:31,178 --> 00:39:33,061
And the only thing
these pieces have in common

723
00:39:33,145 --> 00:39:34,830
are Colonel Bell and First Defense.

724
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,580
So let's cut to the chase.

725
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,144
What the hell's going on?

726
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:47,756
Do you care about Gibbs?

727
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,887
What kind of a question is that?

728
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:52,065
Stop being a lawyer,
start being a friend.

729
00:39:52,149 --> 00:39:55,325
Do you care about what happens
to Special Agent Gibbs?

730
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:58,849
Yes.

731
00:39:59,325 --> 00:40:01,252
Then tell me what your patriot,
Bell, is up to.

732
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:07,455
Ever since Colonel Bell
got out of prison,

733
00:40:07,746 --> 00:40:11,482
he's been accumulating information
on Special Agent Gibbs.

734
00:40:11,971 --> 00:40:13,007
To what end?

735
00:40:13,635 --> 00:40:14,741
Revenge?

736
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:17,414
Blackmail? Leverage?

737
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,010
Mike.

738
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:03,171
Don't even think about it.

739
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,294
You're Dean?

740
00:42:08,505 --> 00:42:10,493
Welcome to Mexico, Agent Gibbs.

741
00:42:14,111 --> 00:42:16,310
First Macy, then you kill Franks?

742
00:42:18,348 --> 00:42:19,896
That ain't Franks.

743
00:42:21,154 --> 00:42:22,372
Who is it?

744
00:42:24,665 --> 00:42:26,062
Colonel Merton Bell.

745
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,905
Who do you really work for?

746
00:42:31,842 --> 00:42:33,855
