1
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:21,203
This is so <i>Usual Suspects</i>.

2
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:25,563
Tony, your dying words will be,
''l've seen this film.''

3
00:00:25,727 --> 00:00:28,480
Gibbs even looks
a little bit like Gabriel Byrne.

4
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:30,239
Okay. Who is Gabriel Byrne?

5
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:32,597
An actor who boards
a mysterious ship like this one

6
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,723
searching for Keyser Sose.

7
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:36,843
- Another actor?
- No.

8
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:40,596
Keyser Sose is a character in the film
who may or may not exist.

9
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:42,405
l'm confused.

10
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:45,767
So am l.
And l saw the DVD twice.

11
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:47,565
<i>The Sound of Music</i> confuses you,
probie.

12
00:00:47,727 --> 00:00:49,399
l love that movie.

13
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:53,886
One note and l will lock you
in a room and make you listen to

14
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:57,323
''lt's a Small World,''
for 24 hours straight.

15
00:00:57,527 --> 00:00:58,642
Do we understand each other?

16
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:02,281
Okay, next.

17
00:01:15,927 --> 00:01:17,076
ls something out of order?

18
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,478
We have no record of Abog Galib
ever entering the United States.

19
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:22,442
So?

20
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:27,439
His passport has Philadelphia entry
and exit stamps. June of last year.

21
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:30,685
Computer glitch?

22
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:34,040
Or a forged passport.

23
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:36,281
Hey.

24
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:52,760
Hell, l thought we were gonna do this
without a chase.

25
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:56,397
- l could not be arrested, agent.
- Gibbs.

26
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:58,239
l had to speak to you alone.

27
00:01:58,407 --> 00:01:59,806
The situation has changed.

28
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:02,527
The head of Abu Sayyaf
wants me to courier for him

29
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:05,401
between Basilan and Pakistan.

30
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,316
Bin Laden?

31
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:10,284
Allah be willing.

32
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, hey, sorry
if l made you run, huh.

33
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:14,362
Oh, l'd chase you to hell
if it lead to Bin Laden.

34
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,000
You only have to chase me
off the ship.

35
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:19,125
Has Abu infiltrated Sealift?

36
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,642
They are about to.

37
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:27,161
Our radio man, Pinpin Pula,
is Abu Sayyaf.

38
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:30,922
Somehow he got a billet
on the <i>Cape Fear</i>.

39
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:33,482
Well, the <i>Cape Fear</i>'s
a Sealift-munitions transport.

40
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:34,966
She sails tomorrow to replenish

41
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:39,006
Marine Expeditionary
Strike Force 8 in the Red Sea.

42
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:41,085
He plans to blow the <i>Cape Fear</i>

43
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:43,238
while it's off-loading ammo
to an assault ship.

44
00:02:43,407 --> 00:02:44,965
This will be as bad as 9/1 1 .

45
00:02:45,127 --> 00:02:46,640
And just as terrifying.

46
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:48,479
Galib, that's good work.

47
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:51,163
l will go off the stern,
fire a couple of rounds.

48
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:53,124
Just do not hit me.

49
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,556
Oh, my passport.

50
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:00,123
l'll alert my team.
Don't want them to shoot you.

51
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:01,686
No. Wait, wait.

52
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:08,966
He looks from the broken coffee cup
on the floor.

53
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:12,604
He looks to the photo on the wall.

54
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,166
Looks--

55
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:24,360
- What do we got?
- Blast victim. Burns and abrasions.

56
00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:25,721
- Pressure steady.
- Got a name?

57
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:27,286
Gibbs. He's a NClS agent.

58
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,603
All right, my count, on three.

59
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:32,156
One, two, three.

60
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:33,962
Agent Gibbs.

61
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:35,956
Agent <i>Gunny</i>.

62
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:39,563
Gunny. Gunny. Gunny.

63
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:44,679
All right, get him out of his gear.
Let's go.

64
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,237
GCS is less than eight.
Let's intubate.

65
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:53,716
Twenty milligrams of etomidate.
A hundred of succinylcholine.

66
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,639
- Doing it right away.
- Skip the X-ray.

67
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:57,206
- Go straight to CAT scan.
- Call CT.

68
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,403
Come on, baby.

69
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:06,759
Ziva, what happened?

70
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:09,282
A bomb. One dead, one injured.

71
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:12,245
You'll need body suits, tweezers
and those suction things.

72
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:13,921
Turkey basters.

73
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:15,918
And many, many, many
specimen jars.

74
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:18,043
- Do you get that, Mr. Palmer?
- Yes, doctor.

75
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,765
Here, allow me.

76
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:21,838
How badly is Jethro injured?

77
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:23,360
Paramedics took him to emergency.

78
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:24,926
Which hospital? Portsmouth?

79
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:27,237
They have a level-one
trauma centre at Portsmouth.

80
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:29,716
- l didn't ask.
- You didn't ask?

81
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:33,038
No, once the paramedics
were on site, l had other priorities.

82
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,925
The possibility of more bombs,
crew to detain,

83
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:36,486
a crime scene to secure.

84
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:39,081
Well, McGee and Tony will know.

85
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:42,125
Oh, Ziva, l'm not implying
that you don't care.

86
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:43,845
Listen, l know you care.

87
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:45,838
l don't need reassurances,
doctor.

88
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:48,767
Very well. But l just want you
to know that l know--

89
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,076
Ducky, drip it.

90
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:52,522
Do you mean drop it or zip it?

91
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:56,917
American idioms
drive me up the hall.

92
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:00,284
Well, actually-- Never mind.

93
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:04,196
One of the crew is missing.
The radio man, Pinpin Pula.

94
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:05,436
Put out a BOLO.

95
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:07,916
Tony, any word on Jethro?

96
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:10,681
Not yet. Portsmouth trauma
said to call back in an hour.

97
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:12,246
Portsmouth. Good, good.

98
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:14,238
- l'll get out that BOLO.
- We have a suspect?

99
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,398
Pinpin Pula.
What kind of name is Pinpin?

100
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:20,765
Filipino. ln Tagalog it means,
"Rice, paddy, dike.''

101
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,838
Don't say a word.

102
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,839
l thought that was
quite an accurate translation.

103
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:33,202
Condition of Special Agent
Jethro Gibbs.

104
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,356
Trauma One,
no condition listed yet.

105
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:47,405
You can't go in there, director.
lt's restricted--

106
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,164
to medical personnel.

107
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:58,197
This isn't about turf, you know.

108
00:06:58,367 --> 00:06:59,641
Oh, l know that.

109
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:02,002
lt's about rules.

110
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,839
And one really big one is

111
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,567
non-medical people
cannot enter Trauma One,

112
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,763
unless they're carried in.

113
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:10,522
Get me a gurney.

114
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:14,277
That's good. ''Get me a gurney.''

115
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,195
l like that.

116
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:19,075
l left a dinner at the White House
to come here.

117
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:20,795
l'm impressed.

118
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:22,764
Really, l am.

119
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:24,724
That still doesn't change the rules.

120
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:27,477
l was hoping
l wouldn't have to resort to this.

121
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,235
- Shooting your way in?
- Don't be silly.

122
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:33,045
l don't have my weapon.

123
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:37,479
- Calling the president?
- Now that would be overkill.

124
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:39,126
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Condi? Jenny.

125
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:41,005
- <i>Any word yet?</i>
- No.

126
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,362
- l don't have his condition yet.
- <i>Well, why not?</i>

127
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:45,882
The head nurse
won't let me into Trauma.

128
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:47,958
<i>Let me speak with her.</i>

129
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:54,685
- Ethel Washington, ma'am.
- <i>Condoleezza Rice, l have a request.</i>

130
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:55,836
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:58,606
l understand.

132
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:05,965
- Thank you, Condi.
- <i>No problem.</i>

133
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:11,440
McGee said that Gibbs
was in a bomb blast.

134
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:14,201
He tried to sound really calm
but l could hear the fear in his voice.

135
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:15,356
And he should be afraid.

136
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:18,087
For Gibbs to be brought to a hospital
in the ambulance cannot be good.

137
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,316
l had to come see for myself.

138
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:23,162
My hearse got a flat, as usual,
so l got in a cab to go to the airport

139
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:25,477
and then l realized
that by the time l got to the terminal

140
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:27,524
and l bought a ticket
and l went through security

141
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,405
and then l flew to Norfolk
and if l got a cab,

142
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,603
it would be better
just to sit in the cab that l was in.

143
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:34,327
So l did that. lt cost a lot of--
You know, it doesn't matter,

144
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:37,001
this is Gibbs. l can't believe
that he's hurt. He is never hurt.

145
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:38,640
Not hurt enough to go to a hospital.

146
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:41,275
He has to be dying
to even go see a doctor.

147
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:42,960
Oh, my God.

148
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:47,517
He isn't dying, is he?
l don't know what l would do.

149
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,795
Positive thoughts. Positive thoughts.
Positive thoughts.

150
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:54,926
Okay, l know the rule is that you have
to be family to go into Emergency

151
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:58,238
that's what they said when Uncle
Charlie got his leg caught in a trap.

152
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:01,160
But Gibbs and me,
we're tighter than blood.

153
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:03,562
l know you need lD.
l have an lD in here.

154
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:05,524
l work at NClS.

155
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:10,636
Forensics and ballistics,
chemical analysis, and DNA typing.

156
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:13,846
Here. That's me. l promise. l just--

157
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:17,682
l had to be in court that day.
But l swear, that is me.

158
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:29,997
You're a really, really good person.

159
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,964
You're gonna have to look
in there sooner or later, McGee.

160
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:45,926
l already did.

161
00:09:48,127 --> 00:09:50,083
Ziva, l don't think
l can go in there.

162
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:51,840
McGee.

163
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,523
- l know.
- Don't let Tony smell fear

164
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,040
- or else he'll just--
- Probie.

165
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:58,084
l gotta special job for you.

166
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:00,006
Too late.

167
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,765
Bomb dog took point
on Rice Paddy Dike's foot locker.

168
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:05,804
Tag and stow it in the truck
for Abby, would you?

169
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:08,039
On it, boss.

170
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:11,285
l do love it when he calls me boss.

171
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,557
ls that why you're being nice to him?

172
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:15,240
Nice?

173
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,840
l'm not being nice.

174
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,962
Lugging foot lockers is probie work.

175
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,764
All right,
l cut the probie some slack.

176
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:26,638
What a bad day.

177
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:28,684
Yes.

178
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:30,485
A very bad day.

179
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:32,400
What's the point of origin?

180
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,876
A 55-gallon oil drum.

181
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:37,117
That twisted ring
is all that's left of it.

182
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:39,847
What is an oil drum
doing in the laundry compartment?

183
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:42,478
Well, ships clean them
and reuse them for storage.

184
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:44,478
This one probably held dirty laundry.

185
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:46,080
Very unsanitary.

186
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:47,839
Fragments indicate a high explosive.

187
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,522
Abby should be able to trace
the taggant.

188
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:54,236
Why's the head and torso intact
when the rest of him is a slushie?

189
00:10:54,407 --> 00:10:57,877
Suicide bombers wearing
an explosive belt look like this.

190
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:02,002
Except there's always something
left of their lower extremities.

191
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,198
- You see a foot?
- Not even a tootsie.

192
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:07,326
- A tootsie?
- A toe.

193
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:08,840
Although in my generation

194
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:13,676
''Tootsie'' also referred
to one's sweetie pie.

195
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,724
Sweetie pie?

196
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:19,997
- Any word from the hospital?
- Jethro's critical, but stable.

197
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:24,916
Then he wasn't in here
when the bomb detonated, was he?

198
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:27,725
That corner.

199
00:11:30,247 --> 00:11:32,044
How did he survive?

200
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:35,359
The washer and dryer shielded him
from the main force of the blast.

201
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:44,643
lt's raining.

202
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:56,806
He's suffered a concussion

203
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,003
but there are no signs
of intra-cerebral haemorrhaging.

204
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,727
- He's going to be okay, though, right?
- He should be fine.

205
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,718
l don't wanna hear should be,
l wanna hear will be.

206
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:06,196
- Abby.
- Should be is not positive.

207
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,005
Enough, Abs.

208
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:24,846
l want to see what's under the hood.

209
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:27,805
Hold the sedation
and call me when he wakes.

210
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:37,686
l'm always positive, Ms. Sciuto.
But with a concussion, until--

211
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:42,206
Until he wakes, no one knows
what's going on inside his brain.

212
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:58,686
l'll miss you, Daddy.

213
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:00,326
We've said it all before.

214
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:01,636
l wanna hear it again.

215
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:04,446
l will take care.
l will come back safe.

216
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:05,801
Not those words.

217
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:08,401
l love you.

218
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:25,721
Shepard.

219
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:28,685
Yikes. Agent DiNozzo here.

220
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:31,407
Cynthia told me you stayed
at the hospital. ls the boss awake?

221
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:34,127
l am, Agent DiNozzo.

222
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:38,925
- You have a sit-rep for me?
- l do, Director Shepard.

223
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,442
Crime scene's been processed.
Evidence tagged.

224
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:42,926
Remains are on the way to autopsy.

225
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:45,806
Officer David and Special Agent
McGee are questioning the crew.

226
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,764
<i>We have an lD</i>
<i>on the suspected bomber.</i>

227
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:50,276
<i>The freighter's radioman,</i>
<i>Pinpin Pula. Filipino.</i>

228
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,438
Suspected to be Abu Sayyaf.

229
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:54,438
BOLO's been issued
for his apprehension.

230
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:56,916
That is all l have to report, ma'am.

231
00:13:57,767 --> 00:14:00,486
- Agent DiNozzo.
- <i>Director?</i>

232
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,476
l was out of line.

233
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:04,683
You are the director, ma'am.
You cannot be out of line.

234
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:09,159
Please. l was bitchy.
Let me apologise.

235
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,040
l'm sorry.

236
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:13,800
<i>lf l may state an opinion, ma'am?</i>

237
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:15,882
Fire away.

238
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:17,806
Never apologise. lt's a--

239
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:19,679
- <i>sign of weakness.</i>
- Sign of weakness.

240
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:23,679
l was his partner too, DiNozzo.

241
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:26,158
l know all the Gibbs-isms.

242
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:28,045
Actually, he borrowed that one
from the Duke.

243
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:30,275
John Wayne.

244
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:33,441
Said it to Joanne Dru in
<i>She Wore a Yellow Ribbon</i>.

245
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:36,278
Jethro's a lot like the Duke.

246
00:14:36,487 --> 00:14:37,681
<i>l keep waiting for him to say:</i>

247
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:39,719
''That'll be the day.''

248
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:44,524
He said that in Paris to me once
when l told him that l--

249
00:14:49,647 --> 00:14:51,365
When we were working together.

250
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:53,480
Shouldn't he be awake by now?

251
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:56,320
You know Gibbs.
He keeps his own schedule.

252
00:14:56,487 --> 00:14:57,966
Do you know what REM is?

253
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:01,005
Sure. Rapid eye movement. Happens
when you're asleep and dreaming.

254
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,883
That's what it looks like
he's doing right now.

255
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:06,277
<i>Oh, well, that's gotta be</i>
<i>a good sign, right?</i>

256
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,086
lf it isn't a nightmare.

257
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:19,242
Gunny, they're both dead.

258
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:22,877
l'm terribly sorry, Jethro.

259
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:24,839
No.

260
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:33,319
How many times are you going
to ask me the same question?

261
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:36,519
No smoking.

262
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,006
What'd he say?

263
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,326
Wait, what'd you say?

264
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:53,642
That l understood him.

265
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:55,126
At least let my crew go ashore.

266
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,926
They have been at sea
for two months.

267
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:01,281
Excuse me. You don't appear
to be the kind of captain

268
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:03,398
who actually cares about
the welfare of his crew.

269
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,797
That's it. l want to speak
to Turkish consulate.

270
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:08,205
- l can arrange that.
- Yes.

271
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:13,801
- lf NClS agrees.
- We do not.

272
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,637
Learn anything, Ziva?

273
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:23,117
<i>Capitan</i> Mahir knows
more than he's telling.

274
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:24,676
l know nothing.

275
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,442
That's very Sergeant Schultz.

276
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:32,676
Tony, how's the boss?

277
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:34,599
l know nothing.

278
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:37,476
That's not funny, Tony.

279
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:40,081
McGee, it's the boss.
He'll be fine. With me.

280
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:45,799
He'll be living off coffee next.

281
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,958
Tony doesn't like coffee.

282
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:51,326
Why do you suspect the captain?

283
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:54,121
He smokes expensive Havanas
and wears a 1 0-carat diamond.

284
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:55,436
Could be zircon.

285
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,002
Never doubt an lsraeli
about diamonds.

286
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,805
Our Turk captain likes money

287
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:02,999
the kind Abu Sayyaf
pays to transport weapons,

288
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:04,959
explosives and terrorists.

289
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:07,243
l'll flip you to see
which of us takes the captain in

290
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:09,159
and who visits Gibbs.

291
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:10,880
l'll take him in.

292
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:12,958
You don't speak Turkish.

293
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:18,563
Your observations, Mr. Palmer.

294
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:21,400
Well, fingerprints are out
of the question.

295
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:25,361
l was rather hoping for something
other than the obvious.

296
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:27,998
Well, we'll have to use DNA to--

297
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:31,400
l guess that's rather obvious too.

298
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,878
He was standing on the bomb.

299
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:37,799
Better.

300
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:40,162
- Why standing?
- Well, it seems to be the only way

301
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,046
to explain his entire lower body
being vaporized.

302
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:45,397
Why not sitting?

303
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:49,446
Whatever he was sitting on
would have shielded his butt.

304
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:53,805
Unless his buttocks
was sitting on the bomb.

305
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:55,798
Who would sit on an explosive?

306
00:17:56,287 --> 00:17:59,882
Someone who didn't know
they were sitting on the explosive.

307
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:02,237
- Of course.
- l did it myself once.

308
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:04,363
No, twice.

309
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:07,035
The first time l was young.
The second time, foolish.

310
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:09,641
Why were you sitting
on an explosive, doctor?

311
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:11,718
l just told you,
l was young and foolish.

312
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:13,798
- Haven't you been listening?
- l was. l just--

313
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:16,363
Specimen jar. Come on.

314
00:18:17,687 --> 00:18:23,796
lf l'm not mistaken, Abby will find
these to be fragments

315
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:26,720
of the 55-gallon oil drum.

316
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:30,961
l must ask Jethro--

317
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,244
Should l take these to Abby now,
doctor?

318
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:42,442
Soon as l've taken a tissue sample
for DNA confirmation.

319
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:44,518
- ls that really necessary, sir?
- No.

320
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:47,685
No, it is not necessary.
We could match his teeth.

321
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,443
ls that what you'd prefer?

322
00:18:57,367 --> 00:19:00,165
A wise choice, Mr. Palmer.

323
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:09,325
Coffee.

324
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,481
- Coffee?
- Sure way to wake Gibbs.

325
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:14,406
Good idea.

326
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,639
But, he's intubated,
we'll have to use the lV.

327
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,957
Tell Miss Sciuto that
l didn't abandon Gibbs.

328
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:27,038
Chief neurologist would have
been here today, anyway.

329
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:29,683
- l'm sure she'll understand.
- l hope so.

330
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:31,246
l like women with fire.

331
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:35,604
So the dog collar and the tats
had nothing to do with it?

332
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:40,521
DiNozzo.

333
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,002
Does he look in pain?

334
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,479
l don't know.

335
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,445
l've never seen Gibbs
show pain, director.

336
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:57,447
Doctor, is he in pain?

337
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:00,479
Doctor?

338
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:02,596
Was this man a Marine?

339
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:04,762
Yes.

340
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:06,719
Wounded in Desert Storm?

341
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:09,605
He has a Purple Heart.

342
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,879
That's it.

343
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:13,800
l treated him in Kuwait.

344
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:18,837
Gibbs never told me
he was wounded in Desert Storm.

345
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:22,158
Me neither, l saw his Purple Heart.

346
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:25,198
He was in a coma
when we evac'd him to Frankfurt.

347
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:26,760
l mean, you talk about déja vu.

348
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,797
But is he in pain?

349
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,002
Certainly not extreme pain.

350
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:33,681
He may be hurting, but the only way
to know is for him to tell us.

351
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:36,724
Why not give him painkillers
just in case?

352
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:38,121
l want him to wake up.

353
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,557
An opiate would only deepen
his coma.

354
00:20:41,527 --> 00:20:43,722
l've just never seen Jethro
look like this.

355
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:45,320
l have.

356
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:47,478
That's why l remembered him.

357
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:50,597
That's the expression
he had in '91 .

358
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:52,246
lt's more anguish than pain.

359
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:02,046
- l want to gallop, Daddy.
- No, Kelly.

360
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:04,203
Let her go, Shannon.

361
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:05,959
Jethro.

362
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:21,237
l've got a better chance
of hooking up with Jessica Alba

363
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,244
than these guys do
of infiltrating Sealift.

364
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,159
Every sailor has to go
through a series

365
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:29,155
of stringent security checks
to be issued a special lD.

366
00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:31,204
<i>A hundred and ten civilian crews,</i>
<i>DiNozzo.</i>

367
00:21:31,527 --> 00:21:33,597
<i>Abu Sayyaf only needs</i>
<i>to slip a man in one.</i>

368
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:35,325
lf Galib knew who that was

369
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:38,081
or the name of the ship,
why'd he run?

370
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:40,078
Why didn't he just let us
arrest him as planned?

371
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:43,444
Give us the intel and then continue
undercover to Gitmo.

372
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:45,643
<i>Either he didn't know,</i>
<i>but was close to finding out.</i>

373
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:47,479
<i>Or he was on to something big</i>

374
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:49,638
<i>that an NClS arrest</i>
<i>would jeopardise.</i>

375
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:51,638
What's bigger
than blowing up one of our ships?

376
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:54,601
<i>Blowing up a port.</i>
<i>Did you ever hear of Port Chicago?</i>

377
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:55,756
No, but l saw the TV movie.

378
00:21:55,927 --> 00:21:58,646
Michael Jai White
is this guy who had--

379
00:21:58,847 --> 00:21:59,962
l see your point.

380
00:22:00,127 --> 00:22:01,799
- <i>Good.</i>
- ls there any intel on the crew

381
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,923
especially this Pinpin Pula guy?

382
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:05,560
We need his photo for a BOLO.

383
00:22:05,727 --> 00:22:08,400
<i>We took surveillance photos when</i>
<i>the crew was docked in lstanbul.</i>

384
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:09,556
Great.

385
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:14,005
<i>lf Galib had intel on Abu's plans,</i>
<i>did he have time to tell Gibbs?</i>

386
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,677
Maybe. They were together
when the bomb went off.

387
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,841
<i>Galib was a good agent.</i>

388
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:26,522
<i>Let's hope Gibbs comes out</i>
<i>of this coma in time.</i>

389
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:29,723
He will.

390
00:22:29,887 --> 00:22:32,685
l ordered another CAT scan
on the off chance

391
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:35,202
that he haemorrhaged since
the last one. l think it's unlikely.

392
00:22:35,927 --> 00:22:39,317
- So why are you doing it?
- Covering my ass.

393
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:42,439
You don't strike me
as the ass-covering type, doctor.

394
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:48,118
You know, l dislike this
doctor-captain-director formality.

395
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:51,405
l'm Todd.

396
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:52,955
Jenny.

397
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:56,401
The truth is, Jenny, l'm puzzled.

398
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:59,718
Gibbs took a long time
to come out of the coma in '91 .

399
00:22:59,887 --> 00:23:02,606
You followed his case
after he left Kuwait?

400
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:03,995
Not until today.

401
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:06,362
From Frankfurt, he was air-vac'd
to Bethesda.

402
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:08,762
They faxed me
his hospitalization records.

403
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:11,566
He was in a coma for 1 9 days.

404
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:15,037
- My God.
- That's not terribly unusual.

405
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:17,118
But the tests weren't
typical of someone

406
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:19,164
who was in a coma that deep.

407
00:23:19,327 --> 00:23:22,000
l mean, his CAT scan didn't
reveal any cerebral damage.

408
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,522
His EEG was normal.

409
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:26,765
lt's the same as now.

410
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:29,316
How do you explain that?

411
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:34,118
Sometimes patients
don't seem to want to wake up.

412
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:39,240
Any reason why Gibbs
might be one of them?

413
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:02,084
The NlS agent driving
was hit with a head shot.

414
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:06,565
Your wife and daughter
died in the crash.

415
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:10,676
- Mom's got one.
- Not as big as ours.

416
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:12,921
lt's bigger, Daddy.

417
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,445
Pedro Hernandez.

418
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:20,684
The drug dealer
your wife saw kill a Marine.

419
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:27,683
- Abby?
- l'm in here.

420
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:40,723
- What are you doing?
- l'm worrying.

421
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:45,719
Me too.

422
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:51,046
You guys can just set that right
there on the floor. Thanks.

423
00:24:56,607 --> 00:24:58,086
What's the matter?

424
00:24:58,287 --> 00:24:59,925
Never heard a girl fart before?

425
00:25:01,687 --> 00:25:03,325
Guys, that was the hippo.

426
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:06,282
Are you sure, McGee?

427
00:25:07,327 --> 00:25:09,079
Yeah, because you sound
more--

428
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:14,157
- Feminine.
- Like a hippo cow?

429
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,198
What aren't you telling me?

430
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:25,722
What do you mean?

431
00:25:25,887 --> 00:25:28,082
You have that
''Three Little Pigs,'' look.

432
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,922
- What?
- The three little pigs.

433
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:32,315
They were afraid to open
the door

434
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:35,001
because the big bad wolf
was outside.

435
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:38,437
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

436
00:25:42,527 --> 00:25:43,642
This is going on my wall.

437
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:46,885
l should be
a professional photographer.

438
00:25:48,887 --> 00:25:50,605
The director hasn't called.

439
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:52,166
About?

440
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:54,158
About...?

441
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:56,040
Gibbs?

442
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:00,680
She didn't call you, did she?

443
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:03,077
- No.
- Because the way you're acting,

444
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:05,124
you might have, just,
forgotten to tell us.

445
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:08,199
Ziva, do you notice
anything different in here?

446
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,684
- No music.
- That's it. No music.

447
00:26:13,087 --> 00:26:15,555
You know, you usually
play music in here.

448
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:18,679
What if those were Gibbs' guts
smooshed all over that room?

449
00:26:18,847 --> 00:26:20,519
Oh, for God's sake, Abby.
They're not.

450
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:22,160
l said what if they were?

451
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:27,125
The colour would be more
coffee-brown than red.

452
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:38,318
His skull was shattered

453
00:26:38,487 --> 00:26:41,001
when the explosion
blew him against the overhead

454
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,600
as if he were fired from a cannon.

455
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:44,884
- The oil drum.
- Precisely.

456
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:48,084
Now don't ask me what our guest
was doing in an oil drum,

457
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:51,205
sitting on a bomb
because l haven't the foggiest.

458
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:53,566
No other explanation?

459
00:26:53,727 --> 00:26:57,402
Well, none that would explain
these remains.

460
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:03,401
l need a positive lD
on this body, Duck.

461
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:06,559
Well, DNA tissue
is in Abby's capable hands.

462
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:09,039
How's Jethro?

463
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:12,637
Still out. The director's with him.

464
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:14,684
Yeah, l'd best get down to Portsmouth.

465
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:16,246
Not until you finish the autopsy.

466
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:18,199
And while you're at it,

467
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:20,677
why don't you ask your guest
what he was doing sitting

468
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:22,565
on an oil drum on a bomb?

469
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,361
You sound like Gibbs.

470
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:29,798
What were you doing
in that oil drum?

471
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:41,757
Oh, boy. Tony,
l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.

472
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:45,163
Sorry. l'm sorry.

473
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:49,961
l'm sorry, Tony.

474
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:02,201
Hate the sight of blood, probie?

475
00:28:02,607 --> 00:28:04,438
Too bad.

476
00:28:05,487 --> 00:28:07,478
- Oh, boy.
- Handkerchief.

477
00:28:07,647 --> 00:28:08,921
l don't have one.

478
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:14,441
Whatever you came to say
better be pretty damn important.

479
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,763
Abby slapped Ziva
and Ziva slapped her back.

480
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:19,885
Damn. l missed it?

481
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:21,924
- Yeah.
- All right.

482
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:24,476
Assemble the team, including Abby.

483
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:26,524
Abby?

484
00:28:32,847 --> 00:28:34,121
Right.

485
00:28:46,647 --> 00:28:48,717
<i>Which hospital? Portsmouth?</i>

486
00:28:48,887 --> 00:28:51,401
<i>You didn't ask?</i>

487
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:56,165
<i>Oh, Ziva. l'm not implying</i>
<i>that you don't care.</i>

488
00:28:57,807 --> 00:28:59,877
<i>The way you're acting,</i>
<i>you might have just,</i>

489
00:29:00,047 --> 00:29:02,766
<i>l don't know, forgotten to tell us.</i>

490
00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:07,125
<i>What if those were Gibbs' guts</i>
<i>smooshed all over that room?</i>

491
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,520
<i>l don't have an answer.</i>

492
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:15,402
His EEG is normal.
His new CAT scan is normal.

493
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:17,686
How well do you know Gibbs?

494
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:19,565
He was my mentor at NClS.

495
00:29:19,727 --> 00:29:21,285
He taught me most of what l know.

496
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,601
Yet you're his boss.

497
00:29:25,087 --> 00:29:27,317
Jethro's a great field agent.

498
00:29:27,487 --> 00:29:29,205
He's a great team leader.

499
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,996
And he deals more efficiently
with difficult politicians than l do.

500
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:36,364
- Well, why isn't he the--
- He shoots them.

501
00:29:40,967 --> 00:29:43,356
So you didn't know him when he was
wounded in Desert Storm?

502
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:45,876
No.

503
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:47,679
He seems to be repeating
that trauma,

504
00:29:47,847 --> 00:29:49,644
a coma he doesn't
wanna to wake up from.

505
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:52,797
ln the morning l'm gonna
try to find the neurologist

506
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:54,161
who was on his case in '91 .

507
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:56,522
Well, why wait until the morning?

508
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:02,758
- Forgive me.
- Yeah.

509
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,282
l'm just tired.

510
00:30:06,127 --> 00:30:07,606
l can arrange a cot
for you in this room.

511
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:09,120
No.

512
00:30:09,687 --> 00:30:12,997
l have been away from my office
far too long.

513
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:46,277
l'll find someone
who knew Jethro back then.

514
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:50,125
- That'd be helpful.
- Here are all my numbers.

515
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:52,482
And my cell.

516
00:30:53,327 --> 00:30:55,079
l'll call you with an update
at 0900,

517
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:56,919
earlier, if he shows any signs
of waking up.

518
00:30:59,327 --> 00:31:01,204
lt was good to meet you, Jenny.

519
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:03,284
Not under the circumstances,
of course.

520
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:09,086
But good nevertheless.

521
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:34,515
- Cover your eyes.
- l've seen you and Mommy kiss.

522
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:37,116
- Oh, this is scary kissing.
- Like kissing a frog?

523
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:39,081
Cover them up.

524
00:31:42,687 --> 00:31:45,918
Much as l'd like to, l can't tell you
where the bastard's hiding, Gunny.

525
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:48,038
l didn't ask you to,
Special Agent Franks.

526
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:52,716
l'm going to take a leak.

527
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:13,844
Pay up, McGee.

528
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:23,040
- Hey.
- You're gonna bet on me, l collect.

529
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:26,803
Abby. Front and centre.
You too, Ziva.

530
00:32:27,607 --> 00:32:29,438
Let's go.

531
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:36,563
- l know what happened.
- Look, she slapped me

532
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:38,922
- and l was just slapping her--
- Hey.

533
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:40,918
lf there's gonna be any
bitch-slapping on this team,

534
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:42,918
l'll do it.

535
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:45,476
Clear? Good.

536
00:32:45,687 --> 00:32:48,406
Now shake hands. Shake.

537
00:32:51,327 --> 00:32:53,921
There we go.
That wasn't so tough, was it?

538
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:55,480
Now, how about a little hug?

539
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:57,717
Big buddy hug. Come on.

540
00:32:57,887 --> 00:32:59,957
There we go. Come on.

541
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:02,197
Now a deep tongue kiss.

542
00:33:03,487 --> 00:33:04,920
Now we feel better.

543
00:33:05,407 --> 00:33:07,682
All right, what do you got, McGee?

544
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:14,566
We've got Singapore's surveillance
photos on the <i>Bakir Kamir</i> crew.

545
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:18,604
Make me hard copies, McGee.

546
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:21,804
Captain Mahir will identify
Pinpin Pula for the BOLO.

547
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:24,117
What makes you think he won't lie?

548
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:26,760
Abby.

549
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:31,043
The taggant traces on the metal
fragments were Semtex

550
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:33,596
from the Czech Republic.
Khaddafi, before we bombed him

551
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:37,282
was handing out Semtex like taffy
to any terrorist with a sweet tooth.

552
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:40,120
That eliminates my
washing machine malfunction theory.

553
00:33:40,287 --> 00:33:41,322
DNA results?

554
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:44,047
- They should be in by now.
- Then what are you doing here?

555
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:47,083
Somebody called a conference.

556
00:33:48,647 --> 00:33:51,002
You don't think
that's Galib in autopsy?

557
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:54,205
- He wants to be sure.
- l've asked Tel Aviv

558
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,523
if Captain Mahir
is a blimp on their radar.

559
00:33:56,687 --> 00:33:57,915
Blip.

560
00:34:00,127 --> 00:34:04,757
DNA confirms the body in autopsy
is NClS Agent Abog Galib.

561
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:08,279
Okay. Any hits on the BOLO?

562
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:10,119
Too many without photos.

563
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:13,956
LEOs are calling in reports
on every Filipino sailor in the area.

564
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:15,480
Did you run them down?

565
00:34:15,647 --> 00:34:19,959
There's 250,000 Filipino sailors. That's
more than any nationality in the world.

566
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:22,083
The way the reports are coming in,
you'd think that--

567
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:24,477
Hey! l don't wanna hear
how tough it is, McGee.

568
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:25,875
l want you to run them down.

569
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:28,242
Stop playing Gibbs.

570
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:31,158
There. You're doing it right now.

571
00:34:31,327 --> 00:34:32,601
Ziva, will you help me out here?

572
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:34,200
lt's true, Tony.

573
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:37,916
You're even getting a little grey
around the temples.

574
00:34:40,607 --> 00:34:42,518
You're not Gibbs, Tony.

575
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:45,405
You're right.

576
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,478
Acting like Gibbs
doesn't make me the boss.

577
00:34:47,647 --> 00:34:50,764
Being senior agent does.

578
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:54,886
So if drinking coffee, staring
or whacking the back of your head

579
00:34:55,087 --> 00:34:57,237
helps me lead this team,

580
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:00,439
live with it.

581
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:09,444
Good morning, Agent Gibbs.

582
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:13,316
The rain stopped.
lt's gonna be a beautiful day.

583
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:16,197
Oh, l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to startle you.

584
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:18,085
l'm Dr. Mallard.

585
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:20,920
l overheard you talking
and l thought he might be awake.

586
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:23,285
l always talk to my patients.

587
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:25,079
Me too.

588
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:26,362
Are you a neurologist, doctor?

589
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:27,920
Medical examiner.

590
00:35:29,887 --> 00:35:33,880
Mine never wake up,
but still l talk to them.

591
00:35:37,647 --> 00:35:38,796
Well, Jethro,

592
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:43,160
l'd have been here sooner
only DiNozzo insisted

593
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:45,887
l finish the autopsy on Agent Galib.

594
00:35:46,087 --> 00:35:47,361
lt's fascinating.

595
00:35:47,527 --> 00:35:51,156
l mean, the poor man was, literally,
blown out of a barrel.

596
00:35:51,327 --> 00:35:56,082
lt reminded me of when my mother
and l visited her brother Carkin

597
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,437
in the little town of Clagolaky.

598
00:35:58,647 --> 00:36:00,524
Yes, Carkin worked
at the cooperage

599
00:36:00,687 --> 00:36:03,997
where they make all the casks
for the various distilleries.

600
00:36:06,687 --> 00:36:08,405
Are you Turkish?

601
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:11,801
Perhaps

602
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:15,164
your father or grandfather

603
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:17,280
was Turkish?

604
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:20,401
Before they come to America?

605
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:24,285
Can you see Ziva as a belly dancer?

606
00:36:25,647 --> 00:36:26,796
He brought it up.

607
00:36:27,207 --> 00:36:29,084
Why? Because he asked
if she was Turkish?

608
00:36:29,247 --> 00:36:30,885
<i>From Russia with Love</i>.

609
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:34,039
Bond is ordered to Turkey

610
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:37,404
to steal the Lector machine
from this beautiful,

611
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:40,035
l mean, is there any other kind
in a James Bond movie,

612
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:42,886
defecting Russian double agent

613
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:46,084
Tatia Romaniva,
played by Daniela Bianchi.

614
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,966
Greek. You are Greek.

615
00:36:50,847 --> 00:36:52,917
Greek. That's why you hate me.

616
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,202
l am not Greek.

617
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:55,959
Greek Cypriot.

618
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:59,403
lt would explain your understanding
Turkish and hating me.

619
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:03,443
l doubt Cyprus has
a liaison officer in the U.S.

620
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:06,565
But you are getting warm.

621
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:08,082
Liaison?

622
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,561
From the French word <i>''lier, ''</i>
which means ''to bind.''

623
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:15,161
ln this case, bind NClS and Mossad.

624
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:23,837
l have your dossier.

625
00:37:28,127 --> 00:37:29,845
Another French word.

626
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,277
Dean Keaton. That's it.

627
00:37:32,447 --> 00:37:34,005
Dean Keaton is the name
of the character

628
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:35,964
Gabriel Byrne plays
in <i>The Usual Suspects</i>.

629
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:37,560
l knew it'd come to me.

630
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:41,042
l am not a terrorist.

631
00:37:41,207 --> 00:37:43,801
l did not smuggle weapons
into Palestine. l swear it.

632
00:37:44,007 --> 00:37:46,202
Or Hamas suicide bombers
into the port of Ashdod?

633
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:48,198
Mossad blames me for that too?

634
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,800
And much more.

635
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,640
Now, look, l am not a terrorist.

636
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:55,042
No Wahhabi. l fight no Jihad.

637
00:37:55,247 --> 00:37:57,238
You profit from it, you swine.

638
00:37:57,407 --> 00:37:59,159
And for that, you should die.

639
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:09,441
Fortunately for you, <i>Capitan</i> Mahir,

640
00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:12,316
<i>politique pratique</i> has suspended

641
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:16,406
lsraeli reprisals
against all but terrorists.

642
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:24,838
And you say you are no terrorist.

643
00:38:25,007 --> 00:38:26,725
l swear by God.

644
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:29,764
Convince me.

645
00:38:37,727 --> 00:38:39,683
Pinpin Pula.

646
00:38:45,527 --> 00:38:48,280
Lisa Guiraut plays one
of those belly dancing women.

647
00:38:48,447 --> 00:38:50,642
Very hot. She'd be a grandmother
by now.

648
00:38:50,847 --> 00:38:54,840
Oh, wait a second. Okay.
Ziva looks like her, which is--?

649
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:58,517
Pay attention, probie. Ziva's
about to get a photo for the BOLO.

650
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:08,682
Winning the Scotsman
Chess Trophy

651
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:12,283
was the highlight
of my lower-sixth year.

652
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:14,119
l didn't compete in Edinburgh.

653
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:18,075
No, no. l was too distracted
by this wee--

654
00:39:19,847 --> 00:39:21,678
lt was impolite of me to eavesdrop,
Dr. Mallard,

655
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:23,678
but l was fascinated by your story.

656
00:39:25,127 --> 00:39:27,561
Nurse Baliad told me your name
and your speciality. l'm Dr.--

657
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:31,879
Dr. Gelfand, Chief Neurologist.
Yes, the director told me.

658
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:34,680
Well, how is our patient?

659
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:37,077
Still comatose, l'm afraid.

660
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:40,566
Were you aware
that he was in a coma for 1 9 days

661
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:42,524
during Desert Storm?

662
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:44,086
No.

663
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:46,076
He never told you?

664
00:39:46,247 --> 00:39:48,920
Well, Jethro doesn't talk much
about the past.

665
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:51,647
l consider us to be close friends

666
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:55,322
but l know very little
about his life before we met.

667
00:40:37,047 --> 00:40:38,799
You're in a hospital. Relax.

668
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:42,037
- Don't fight it, Jethro.
- Relax, relax. You're all right.

669
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:43,276
Here, come on. Come on.

670
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,359
Can you blink?

671
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:48,121
All right. Raise your thumb.
Raise your thumb. Good. Good.

672
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:49,276
Do you want the tube out?

673
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:54,803
All right, all right. Hold still. Hold still.

674
00:40:58,447 --> 00:41:00,358
- Here you are.
- Okay, breathe. You're fine.

675
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:02,563
- That's it.
- l am Dr. Gelfand.

676
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,763
- This is Nurse Baliad.
- Maria.

677
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:07,236
- Of course you know Dr. Mallard.
- He calls me Ducky.

678
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:08,476
Welcome back, Jethro.

679
00:41:09,327 --> 00:41:11,443
Yeah, we've all been
a bit concerned.

680
00:41:11,607 --> 00:41:14,360
You shouldn't frighten us like this.

681
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,239
You have a question?

682
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:21,521
Where am l?

683
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,598
You're in Portsmouth
Naval Trauma Centre.

684
00:41:24,327 --> 00:41:26,238
You were in an explosion.

685
00:41:26,407 --> 00:41:28,602
Relax. Cover your face.

686
00:41:29,607 --> 00:41:31,199
l remember.

687
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:34,837
Good. Very good. Most people
never remember the trauma.

688
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:42,163
l don't know him.
