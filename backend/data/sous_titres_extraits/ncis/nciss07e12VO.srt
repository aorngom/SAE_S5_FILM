2
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:44,840
You were a little hot
on the approach.

3
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:47,213
Come on!
I put it right on the numbers.

4
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,091
You do that on your check ride,
you're going to lose points, man.

5
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:51,551
No hot dogging.

6
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:53,829
- Everything by the book.
- Get the car, Walid.

7
00:00:53,913 --> 00:00:56,244
- I'll only be a couple of minutes.
- Yes, Your Highness.

8
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:59,018
Wish I had someone like that
to run my errands.

9
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,644
Walid doesn't get his act together,
you can have him.

NCIS Season 7 Episode 12

00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,752
Synchro: Gaillots, Kujathemas.

www.Team-NCIS.com

14
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:51,782
For the last time,
my name is Anthony DiNozzo Jr.

15
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:54,934
My father is Anthony DiNozzo Sr.

16
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:57,111
I live in Washington, DC.

17
00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:58,724
He lives in New York City.

18
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:00,388
Is that so complicated?

19
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:01,788
Junior, Senior.

20
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:03,331
Can you follow that?

21
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,475
What is going on?

22
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,460
Tony's trying to withdraw money
from a bank in New York.

23
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:09,045
Sounds like they confused

24
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,048
his account with one of his father's,
and he can't get the money.

25
00:02:12,476 --> 00:02:15,834
Let me get this straight.
You want me to spell my name again?

26
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,638
It's big "D," as in "dimwit".
Little "I," as in "idiot".

27
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:22,627
Big "N," as in "Nimrod".
Little "O," as in "obtuse".

28
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:25,665
- What does he need the money for?
- Double "Z" as in "ZZ Top", or...

29
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:28,094
Well, he and a couple
of his frat buddies

30
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:30,775
have decided to take
a cruise this spring.

31
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,181
No, I'm not kidding!

32
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:33,945
I'm sure that won't lead
to any trouble.

33
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,390
- Clean, wholesome fun.
- Put supervisor on line, now!

34
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:39,294
Why doesn't he just call
his father to straighten things out?

35
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:40,610
Yes, I'll hold.

36
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:42,932
- Mind your own business.
- Grouchy.

37
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:45,702
Left a message
for his father two days ago.

38
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:47,233
Tony hasn't heard back from him.

39
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:49,751
You would like me to spell
my name for you again?

40
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,094
Are you guys in India?

41
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,796
DiNozzo, get off the phone.

42
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:55,424
Got a dead foreign national.
Pax River. Let's go.

43
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:56,633
Pax River?

44
00:02:56,931 --> 00:02:58,400
Weren't we just there?

45
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:03,941
Where are you going on your cruise?

46
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:06,877
It's need-to-know information.
You don't need to know.

47
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:09,140
Aren't you too old for spring break?

48
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:15,611
Car is registered
to Beltway Executive Auto Leasing.

49
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:18,999
Rented to a Prince Sayif Ibn Alwaan

50
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:20,748
on a month-to-month.

51
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:23,650
Hope he got the full coverage.

52
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:27,672
Appears an explosive device
was placed under the car.

53
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:31,119
Get the vehicle to Abby.

54
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:33,457
The victim is Walid Abbas.

55
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,675
He's entered the U.S.
on a visitor's visa.

56
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,825
He worked for the Prince
as his driver.

57
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:41,261
You know, there are over 7,000 Princes
in the Royal family.

58
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,877
What do you got, Duck?
Tell me anything I don't know?

59
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,938
Well, yes.
He wasn't killed by the explosion.

60
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:48,602
At least not directly.

61
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:51,663
There are no burns
or blistering on his...

62
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:53,670
the skin of his hands.

63
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:56,652
Cause of death was
most likely blunt-force trauma

64
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:58,905
when his head hit the tarmac.

65
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:01,165
I've heard the saying
"He got blown out of his shoes",

66
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:03,227
- but I never thought I'd see it.
- No.

67
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,369
If the explosion had knocked
his socks off,

68
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,466
that would be impressive,
wouldn't it?

69
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:10,835
How long has
Prince Sayif been in the country?

70
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,207
Almost three months.

71
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,588
He's attached to the Navy-Marine
Corp's Strike Pilot Training Program.

72
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:16,763
Where is he?

73
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:18,698
Last I saw Sayif,
he was in the hangar.

74
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:20,927
You've been his flight instructor
the whole time?

75
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,392
No. He's been through several.

76
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:25,222
I've only had the pleasure
for the past couple weeks.

77
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,430
I detect some... friction.

78
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:29,993
I just hope he doesn't screw up
on his check ride.

79
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:32,319
He'll graduate
the day after tomorrow, with his class,

80
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:34,103
and he won't be our problem anymore.

81
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:45,924
I was just making
arrangements to be picked up.

82
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:47,108
Cancel them.

83
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:50,907
Don't want to jump
to conclusions here,

84
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,876
but we have to assume
that that bomb was meant for you.

85
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:57,171
Until we know otherwise,
you're under our protective custody.

86
00:04:58,309 --> 00:04:59,799
Yeah. I don't think so.

87
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:01,175
Look,

88
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,095
I am sorry about Walid,
Agent Gibbs, but

89
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:06,252
if you know anything
about the Saudi Royal family,

90
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:08,742
assassinations are
a part of our lives.

91
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,878
I came to the United States
for flight training, and

92
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:12,728
I'm not going to let
what happened stop me.

93
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:15,723
I have no influence
with your country.

94
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:18,067
But I do
with the United States Navy,

95
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,244
and I'll have
your training stopped immediately.

96
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:26,617
Protective custody on my terms.

97
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:30,976
I'm not going to be sequestered on
any base or in a government safe house.

98
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:33,977
I'm staying at the Presidential
suite at the Adams House.

99
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,128
If you would like
to protect me there...

100
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:39,027
you're welcome to.

101
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,579
<i>I've been in contact
with the Saudi embassy.</i>

102
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:51,971
<i>They insist their Royal Guards
be part of the security detail.</i>

103
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:53,844
We'll coordinate with them.

104
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,674
<i>Where is Prince Sayif now?</i>

105
00:05:56,954 --> 00:05:59,150
He's here.
We brought him back to the Navy Yard

106
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,402
while his suite and adjoining rooms
are being cleared.

107
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:02,655
<i>Agent Gibbs.</i>

108
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:03,638
Ma'am.

109
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:07,616
<i>Al Jazeera is reporting
that Jihad Al Hurriya</i>

110
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,722
<i>is claiming responsibility
for the assassination attempt.</i>

111
00:06:10,992 --> 00:06:12,023
<i>You aware of them?</i>

112
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,790
Yes. It translates
to "Freedom Warriors".

113
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,543
They're an offshoot
of the Mujahideen.

114
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,387
Didn't know they had a presence
here in the U.S.

115
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:22,714
<i>Don't know. NSA is checking into it.</i>

116
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:26,449
<i>You questioned Sayif.
Did he mention Jihad Al Hurriya?</i>

117
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,974
He didn't seem too concerned
about the incident, either, ma'am.

118
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,911
<i>The Saudi ambassador assured me that
Prince Sayif will be leaving the country</i>

119
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,286
<i>as soon as he graduates
from flight training.</i>

120
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,675
So he's only our problem
for two more days, then.

121
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,712
<i>His father, Prince Omar,
is a major player in the Royal family.</i>

122
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:46,947
- <i>We need to be kept in the loop.</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

123
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:49,581
Let's call the embassy
from my office.

124
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,791
- You need me?
- No, boss.

125
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,988
- Just gotta tell Tony here something.
- What?

126
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:00,752
You have a visitor.

127
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:02,555
- Who?
- You'll see.

128
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:04,590
- Tell me.
- No.

129
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:06,133
What's the matter with you?

130
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:18,519
Junior mentioned you.
But he never told me what you look like.

131
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:21,732
You are stunning, Ziva.

132
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:26,362
Do you ever think
of wearing your hair down?

133
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:35,746
Junior.

134
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:37,552
Dad.

135
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,602
What are you doing here?

136
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,423
I just want this mix-up
at the bank straightened out.

137
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:53,556
I mean, why is your name still
on the account as a trustee?

138
00:07:54,063 --> 00:07:56,038
Not to worry.
I'll take care of it.

139
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:58,597
All right, you could have just done it
with a phone call.

140
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,054
Sure.

141
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:01,396
And I will.

142
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,532
It's...

143
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:05,025
just that we haven't seen
each other in a long time.

144
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,581
And you thought you'd just fly down
and surprise me?

145
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:09,446
I took the train. It's not that far.

146
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,716
- You all right?
- Never felt better.

147
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:17,079
I mean, nothing's wrong?

148
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,987
We'll have dinner, catch up.

149
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:23,103
So,

150
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,241
tell me about Ziva.

151
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:27,623
Ziva is Ziva.
Nothing to tell.

152
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:31,263
Hotel suite's been cleared.
We're headed over.

153
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:32,386
Be right there.

154
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:36,599
Isn't that Prince Sayif Ibn Alwaan?

155
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:39,727
Yes, it is.
Where you staying?

156
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:41,854
My God. He has grown up.

157
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,993
How do you know him?

158
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,195
His father, Prince Omar,
and I have been in business together.

159
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:51,169
We met years ago in Monte Carlo.

160
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,033
What's Sayif doing here?

161
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:57,698
He was the target of an assassination
attempt this morning.

162
00:08:58,212 --> 00:09:00,039
Hey, should I continue
holding the door?

163
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:02,249
I'm coming!
I'll meet you in the garage!

164
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:03,541
Take it easy!

165
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,133
What happened?

166
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,505
I can't talk about it.

167
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:13,637
Car bomb.

168
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,712
Has his father been told?

169
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:20,059
Yes. He's flying in from Riyadh.

170
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:23,436
Look, I have to get Sayif
to the Adams House Hotel.

171
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,481
I'll take you downstairs,
get you a cab.

172
00:09:28,657 --> 00:09:29,868
Are you sure,

173
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:32,459
you don't want to tell me something?

174
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:35,492
You're busy. It can wait.

175
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:51,206
- Who's that with Sayif?
- It's his older brother,

176
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:52,341
Prince Abdalla.

177
00:09:52,754 --> 00:09:54,346
Lives here in DC.

178
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,282
He's a Deputy Minister
at the Saudi embassy.

179
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:59,139
They do not know I speak Arabic.

180
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:00,599
Good.

181
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,770
Sayif is getting chewed out
for his Western ways.

182
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,188
His brother believes that

183
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,857
his pleasure-seeking lifestyle
brought on the attack.

184
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:13,320
That is too disgusting to translate.

185
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,145
I apologize...

186
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:20,014
for the family disagreement.

187
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:23,122
Prince Abdalla,
this is Special Agent Gibbs.

188
00:10:24,381 --> 00:10:25,272
Pleasure.

189
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:28,377
What happened this morning
is very disturbing.

190
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:31,380
Not only for the assassination attempt
on my brother,

191
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:33,764
but the tragic death of Walid.

192
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:37,780
He was not only Sayif's aide,
but a family friend.

193
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,097
You think
that Jihad Al Hurriya was involved?

194
00:10:40,336 --> 00:10:41,415
It's very possible.

195
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:43,642
They are the sworn enemy
of our government.

196
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,139
Boss. We got agents posted
in the lobby and the garage.

197
00:10:48,223 --> 00:10:51,033
The Royal Guards are covering
the stairwells and the corridors.

198
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,027
- Excuse me.
- Where do you think you're going?

199
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:54,778
Fitness center.

200
00:10:55,273 --> 00:10:58,574
We have to make sure it's secure, and
you need to be accompanied by an agent.

201
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:01,211
Fine.

202
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:03,536
I choose her.

203
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:12,348
Jethro,
I was just about to call you.

204
00:11:12,683 --> 00:11:15,985
X-rays confirm
my initial determination.

205
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:19,029
Blunt-force trauma
was indeed the cause of death.

206
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:20,813
I'll be sure to tell him.

207
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,970
It's not often that I'm graced
by your presence in Autopsy.

208
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:28,039
To what do I owe the pleasure?

209
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,897
Gibbs and I spoke
to the Saudi embassy.

210
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,430
They have requested a quick release
of the body for religious reasons.

211
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,391
As soon as I'm done here, I can make
arrangements for him to be picked up.

212
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:39,475
Thank you.

213
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,120
How's your mother doing?

214
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,042
Thank you for asking.

215
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:51,794
She is... slipping away, slowly.

216
00:11:52,341 --> 00:11:53,962
Losing touch with reality.

217
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:58,286
When I visited her this morning,
in her room, she insisted that the clock

218
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,095
on the wall was going backwards.

219
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,959
Actually,
I've had days that felt like that.

220
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:11,612
Haven't we all?

221
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:17,362
Abby. What are you doing?

222
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,843
Don't say it, Gibbs. I know.
My shoes and socks.

223
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,534
- It's "Mismatch Monday".
- For who?

224
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:24,692
For me.

225
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:27,387
How about it's
"Make my Day Monday" for me?

226
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,332
I am searching for the signature
of a bomb maker.

227
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,544
I found fragments of a bomb.
And I think it's homemade.

228
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,593
Why?

229
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,461
Because my schnozola has detected
a trace of nitromethane.

230
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:40,981
I heard Tony's father's in town.

231
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:42,976
Yeah, he is.
What triggered it?

232
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:46,094
I found remnants of a timer.
I'm hoping to find more.

233
00:12:46,178 --> 00:12:47,656
- What does he look like?
- Who?

234
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,622
- Tony's father!
- I haven't seen him. Anything else?

235
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,813
Yeah. I'm wondering if Tony
and him have the same sense of humor.

236
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,518
Are you focus on the case?

237
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:56,529
Right.

238
00:12:56,613 --> 00:12:59,513
Okay, so I salvaged
the vehicle's on-board nav system.

239
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:01,653
I'm going to download
the data to a hard drive.

240
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,930
And, hopefully,
the little magical zeroes and ones

241
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:07,161
will let us know
where the vehicle's been and when.

242
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,807
- <i>... in MTAC, Boss.</i>
- Right, McGee. Be right there.

243
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:11,804
Thanks, Abs.

244
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:17,681
Echelon's picking up chatter,

245
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:20,665
emanating in real time from
the Washington DC metropolitan area.

246
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,638
This is Barry Kester with NSA.

247
00:13:22,964 --> 00:13:24,239
Special Agent Gibbs.

248
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,652
<i>We locked on the IP address
of the computer sending the message.</i>

249
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:31,399
<i>Could be a Jihad Al Hurriya
operative in the area.</i>

250
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:33,130
<i>Have a location in a second.</i>

251
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,219
Key words intercepted
were "Prince Omar", "assassination",

252
00:13:36,303 --> 00:13:37,566
"contract", and "killer".

253
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,401
<i>We got it.</i>

254
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:42,380
<i>Computer is in the guest business center
of the Adams House.</i>

255
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:44,294
That's where we're keeping
Prince Sayif.

256
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:46,570
I'll take the stairs.

257
00:13:56,498 --> 00:13:58,142
- Where's the business center?
- What?

258
00:13:58,226 --> 00:13:59,784
The business center!
Where is it?

259
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,731
Down that corridor, on the left.

260
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:07,165
Where is the guest business center?

261
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:09,911
- Where?!
- Right down there.

262
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:25,656
Federal agents!
Hands in the air!

263
00:14:27,676 --> 00:14:29,243
Junior, what's the matter with you?

264
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:32,052
Put that thing down.
Someone could get hurt.

265
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:48,307
Maybe Tony didn't have a mother.

266
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,022
Maybe he was cloned.

267
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:54,653
Well, there certainly is
a strong familial resemblance.

268
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,992
You finally get to meet
the real Tony DiNozzo.

269
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,289
I didn't expect it was going
to be under these circumstances.

270
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:17,249
Have a seat.

271
00:15:17,978 --> 00:15:19,565
You've got some explaining to do.

272
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:25,048
I was just... e-mailing
some of my business associates...

273
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:28,700
I'm developing
a resort on St. Bart's.

274
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,790
Junior wouldn't explain,

275
00:15:30,874 --> 00:15:33,616
but, what warranted guns being
pointed in my face

276
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,684
and being brought down
here for questioning?

277
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:38,391
You used certain key words

278
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:40,647
that were picked up
on a global surveillance network.

279
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:43,384
Monitors,
voice and data transmissions.

280
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:46,486
That stuff really exists?

281
00:15:47,782 --> 00:15:51,011
I thought that was only in spy movies.
How does it work?

282
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:53,175
It's classified.

283
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:58,332
This where you bring
the bad guys for the third degree?

284
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,698
You mentioned "Prince Omar" and
"assassination" in your e-mails. Why?

285
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:09,968
I confess.

286
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,376
I'm a bit of an opportunist.

287
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:14,777
Money's tight these days,

288
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:17,614
and I'm missing a key piece
of financing. So,

289
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:22,181
I thought that fate had interceded when
I heard that Al was going to be in town.

290
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:25,400
Al?

291
00:16:26,003 --> 00:16:27,141
Yeah, that's what

292
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:30,999
Prince Omar Ibn Alwaan's friends
call him...

293
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:34,326
So I was notifying
some of my investors that,

294
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:36,961
Al was going to be in town because

295
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:39,731
of the assassination
<i>attempt on his son.</i>

296
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,460
Why are you at the Adams House?

297
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,711
I'm staying there.

298
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:47,246
It's my favorite in Washington.

299
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:50,453
Donald, the concierge,
he's a miracle worker.

300
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:52,094
He can get you anything you want:

301
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,763
theater tickets,
restaurant reservations...

302
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:57,224
Have you ever been

303
00:16:57,555 --> 00:16:58,935
to the Rooftop Grill?

304
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,731
They've got
the best rib eye in town.

305
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:07,972
He's right about that.
It is delicious.

306
00:17:15,676 --> 00:17:18,620
You keep your father clear
of the Ibn Alwaan family.

307
00:17:19,657 --> 00:17:21,748
- Right, Boss.
- Make sure he gets the message.

308
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:22,903
Got it.

309
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,801
I just... I wanted to see
what Tony's dad looked like, but...

310
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:36,359
- Go.
- I'm just gonna go.

311
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:43,372
<i>Okay, Dad...</i>

312
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:47,889
<i>Junior...!</i>

313
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:50,980
- What are you thinking?
- He's not involved.

314
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:54,029
- But?
- But he's got an agenda.

315
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:55,615
Agreed.

316
00:17:57,933 --> 00:17:58,796
Thanks.

317
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,521
Macallan 18, three fingers,
one ice cube.

318
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:09,942
You remembered.

319
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:13,615
Well, what would cocktail hour be
without a single-malt scotch and a

320
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:15,177
lecture from Senior?

321
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,149
And now you're going to lecture me?

322
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:20,941
What are you drinking?

323
00:18:22,023 --> 00:18:23,268
Non-alcoholic beer.

324
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,981
The downside to law enforcement.

325
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:31,066
Are there any upsides?

326
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:32,736
Well, I get to carry a gun.

327
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:39,701
You've always been disappointed
I became a cop.

328
00:18:42,315 --> 00:18:44,953
- Felt that way to me.
- I always...

329
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,595
was supportive.

330
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:49,044
I never said anything.

331
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:50,831
Exactly.

332
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:54,216
- What did you want me to say?
- Well, I don't know.

333
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:57,661
Maybe like, "Junior, I'm glad you found
a career you're passionate about.

334
00:18:57,745 --> 00:19:00,096
I'm proud of you and what you're doing."
Some like that.

335
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:03,519
- How do you know I don't feel that way?
- How would I? We never talked.

336
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:07,930
I mean...

337
00:19:09,553 --> 00:19:10,357
I get it.

338
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,249
It must have been tough.

339
00:19:15,396 --> 00:19:17,948
Your wife dies, and you're left
with an eight-year-old kid.

340
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:22,134
But your solution was to warehouse me
in boarding schools and summer camps.

341
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:25,038
And half the time, I never knew
where you were or what you're doing.

342
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,072
I needed a closer relationship.

343
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:32,545
You forget.

344
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,229
We took some great vacations
together.

345
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,969
Like the trip to Maui where you left me
in a hotel room for two days,

346
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:40,767
and I was 12 years old?

347
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:42,562
Oh, come on, Junior.

348
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,851
I explained that to you.
I had to go back to the mainland

349
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,609
to close a deal.

350
00:19:48,096 --> 00:19:49,549
With a rich divorcée.

351
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:52,148
Who was... very attractive...

352
00:19:52,604 --> 00:19:53,690
as I recall.

353
00:19:53,774 --> 00:19:54,895
A deal is a deal.

354
00:19:57,078 --> 00:19:58,697
How's my current stepmother?

355
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:00,880
Ex-stepmother.

356
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:03,560
I'm sorry to hear that.

357
00:20:04,758 --> 00:20:06,162
I actually liked Karen.

358
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:07,873
Phoebe.

359
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,333
You missed one.

360
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,502
Were you going
to tell me about that?

361
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:16,673
I don't like
to advertise my failures.

362
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,302
Well, my condolences.

363
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:21,970
My congratulations.

364
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:23,638
And my condolences.

365
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:26,892
Thank you.

366
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,417
I have to relieve Ziva.

367
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:41,615
Now, listen...

368
00:20:42,695 --> 00:20:44,793
you stay away from the Ibn Alwaans.

369
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:45,904
Please.

370
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:49,636
I'll call you.

371
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,841
Sayif's rented car went in
for its 10,000-mile service the day

372
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,706
before the explosion.

373
00:21:01,898 --> 00:21:03,375
The dealership was losing tools,

374
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:06,556
so they installed surveillance cameras
to cover all the bays.

375
00:21:07,337 --> 00:21:09,976
Now, the mechanic didn't see
anything unusual on the vehicle.

376
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:11,949
And, as you can see,

377
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,641
nothing was placed under it
while it was there.

378
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:17,628
We backgrounded the mechanic.
He is clean...

379
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:20,423
so the explosive device had
to be planted on the vehicle

380
00:21:20,507 --> 00:21:23,257
after it left the dealership.
I'm going to focus on that period.

381
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:24,735
How'd it go at the hotel?

382
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:28,553
Prince Sayif is a chauvinistic
Royal pain in the tush.

383
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,415
He's not used to anyone
saying no to him.

384
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,540
You have to hire someone
to protect him from me.

385
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:36,922
I just got a back channel call
from MI-6.

386
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:39,855
They have a deep-cover mole
planted inside Jihad Al Hurriya.

387
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:41,675
He made contact this morning.

388
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,927
- You confirmed they're responsible?
- Just the opposite.

389
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,347
Claim's bogus.
Just somebody grabbing media attention.

390
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:50,539
Well, how reliable's the mole?
What's his batting average?

391
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:52,310
Led the league.
He's batting a thousand.

392
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,826
Chatter indicates that we've been
looking in the wrong direction.

393
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,147
This was not
an attack by terrorists.

394
00:21:58,471 --> 00:22:00,052
Do you have any other leads?

395
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,248
Okay, so how many amendments
to the Constitution?

396
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:17,199
Bill of Rights is the first ten.
Prohibition's 18.

397
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:19,379
- I'm guessing 23.
- Twenty-seven.

398
00:22:20,324 --> 00:22:23,006
- Nobody likes a smartass, David.
- Why do I have to study

399
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,051
- all of this and you don't?
- I was born here.

400
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:30,184
Hello, Mr. DiNozzo.

401
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,404
Tony... please.

402
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:34,643
Morning, Ziva.

403
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:36,271
Good morning, Tony.

404
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:40,342
Are you waiting for somebody?

405
00:22:42,689 --> 00:22:44,360
You've got Junior working so hard,

406
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:47,309
I was just killing some time doing
one of my favorite things:

407
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:49,034
people watching.

408
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:57,500
Your hair... looks great.

409
00:22:58,542 --> 00:22:59,551
Thank you.

410
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:05,633
Straighten your leg.

411
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,161
There you go.

412
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,963
- Is that good?
- Very good.

413
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:10,999
Feel the stretch behind your knees.

414
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,016
Sting does a lot of yoga,
and I like him.

415
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,060
Keep breathing.

416
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:23,276
You know,
it's not as bad as it looks.

417
00:23:24,032 --> 00:23:26,848
It's actually an ancient form
of meditation. It's a good thing.

418
00:23:26,932 --> 00:23:28,615
Special Agent Gibbs,
you had breakfast?

419
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:32,531
The party's over.

420
00:23:35,738 --> 00:23:36,803
Explain.

421
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:40,959
Sayif had a date. He actually had a...
he had a couple of dates.

422
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,129
He wanted to go clubbing,
I had to take decision

423
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,256
that we would go clubbing here

424
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,717
in the penthouse suite, and then

425
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,261
Ashley,
the a.m. yoga instructor arrived.

426
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,846
And I guess things got
a little out of hand.

427
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:53,972
This a good thing?

428
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,544
Well, nobody got hurt.
I got in a stretch.

429
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,857
- What's going on here?
- Relax, Abdalla.

430
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,529
- What, what?
- Father's plane landed a half hour ago.

431
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,864
He'll be here any minute.

432
00:24:10,147 --> 00:24:11,074
Ladies, out.

433
00:24:11,197 --> 00:24:12,397
Time to leave.

434
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,553
Get yourself dressed, Sayif.

435
00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:17,914
What were you thinking?

436
00:24:18,312 --> 00:24:20,625
Honestly, I didn't think
you'd be here for another hour.

437
00:24:20,745 --> 00:24:21,995
Time to get up.

438
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,638
- These yours?
- Oh, yeah.

439
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,346
I'll intercept Father in the lobby.

440
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:42,969
- Has it been that long?
- Oh, at least.

441
00:24:43,204 --> 00:24:44,422
'96, I think.

442
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:45,228
Son.

443
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:47,679
Father.

444
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:52,073
I have a little...

445
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:54,626
family matter to attend to, but,

446
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:56,161
then we should talk.

447
00:24:57,031 --> 00:24:58,253
Where are you staying?

448
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:00,289
Right here in this hotel.

449
00:25:01,022 --> 00:25:02,768
Wonderful. Wonderful.

450
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:08,047
- Let's go.
- I told you to handle it.

451
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:09,641
I spoke to him.

452
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:12,643
- I think he's losing his hearing.
- Give me a reason not to bench you.

453
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:18,272
I won't let him out of my sight.

454
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:25,508
I've got something.

455
00:25:25,954 --> 00:25:27,843
- So do I.
- What do you got?

456
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,570
You show me yours first.

457
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,407
Whoever made this bomb... amateur.

458
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:40,246
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.

459
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,957
Cheap components, poorly constructed,
and want to know the weird thing?

460
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:44,928
The timer didn't set it off.

461
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:46,502
How's that?

462
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,833
This bomb was supposed to go off

463
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:50,881
30 minutes after it actually did.

464
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,298
Then what triggered it?

465
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,520
I have a theory.

466
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,629
None of the wires were
properly insulated or grounded.

467
00:25:56,944 --> 00:25:59,019
So anything could have set it off.
Like a bump,

468
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,476
or a really,
really strong vibration.

469
00:26:02,888 --> 00:26:05,367
Witnesses saw a jet
flying low overhead.

470
00:26:06,105 --> 00:26:07,398
So show me yours.

471
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:14,704
After Sayif's car left the service
station, it only went two places...

472
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:18,326
hotel garage where security cameras
show that no one approached it

473
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,870
and Pax River the next morning.

474
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,649
GPS shows that after Sayif
was dropped off at the hanger,

475
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:26,626
the car drove to a remote part
of the base

476
00:26:26,915 --> 00:26:28,877
where there are no security cameras.

477
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:31,933
That's the only place
the bomb could have been planted.

478
00:26:32,017 --> 00:26:33,385
So... where are you going?

479
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:35,939
I got to check with Ducky
about something.

480
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:38,346
Will you be accompanying
the body back to Riyadh?

481
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,567
Yes. Walid died in the service
of my brother.

482
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:45,546
Our families have been friends for
as long as I can remember.

483
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,563
I'm going to have to ask you
to wait right here.

484
00:27:02,951 --> 00:27:04,831
- What is it?
- Prince Abdalla,

485
00:27:05,514 --> 00:27:07,500
this is Dr. Mallard,
our medical examiner.

486
00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:10,729
I'm sorry,
but I cannot release the body just yet.

487
00:27:11,144 --> 00:27:12,973
I was told Walid's body is ready.

488
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:15,194
We have a Royal jet
standing by at the airport.

489
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,343
I apologize for the inconvenience,
but I have one more test I must perform.

490
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:22,974
I can assure you
there will be no desecration.

491
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,179
This is unacceptable.

492
00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:32,400
Your State Department
will hear from my embassy.

493
00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:50,933
Come on, Dad,
I got a lot of work to do.

494
00:27:51,235 --> 00:27:52,480
Almost done, Junior.

495
00:27:52,717 --> 00:27:55,149
You'll be happy to know that,
among other things, I've...

496
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,841
straightened out that mix-up
with your bank account.

497
00:27:58,145 --> 00:27:59,620
The funds will be available.

498
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:02,638
That's great.

499
00:28:04,823 --> 00:28:07,226
Do you have to stick
your nose in everyone's business?

500
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:09,937
Makes me a good investigator.

501
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,777
Give me that.

502
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:17,653
It's for me.

503
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:19,805
Elke?

504
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:21,365
8:00.

505
00:28:21,981 --> 00:28:22,881
Perfect.

506
00:28:23,518 --> 00:28:25,380
Yeah, I'm in suite 901.

507
00:28:26,086 --> 00:28:28,456
- Still have those magic fingers?
- <i>You know I do.</i>

508
00:28:28,654 --> 00:28:29,704
Can't wait.

509
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:32,627
You gave a call girl this number?

510
00:28:33,084 --> 00:28:35,838
Junior, that was the hotel spa.

511
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:39,202
I'm a little tense.
I need a massage.

512
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:45,159
Sayif behaving?

513
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,724
He is fine.

514
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,280
Who's watching Prince Charming?

515
00:28:49,364 --> 00:28:51,227
He's in the air.
His check ride.

516
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:53,689
He cannot get in trouble
for the next three hours.

517
00:28:53,936 --> 00:28:56,317
Unless his instructor
ejects him at 20,000 feet.

518
00:28:57,173 --> 00:29:00,530
You're busy and I'm in the way here.
I'm going to go back to the hotel.

519
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:03,919
You know what, I am going to make you
an offer you can't refuse.

520
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:07,004
Very Special Probationary
Agent Ziva David

521
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,623
is going to give you a personal,

522
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:11,165
special tour of NCIS headquarters.
Come on!

523
00:29:12,522 --> 00:29:16,052
Well, that is a lovely offer,
but I'm sure Ziva must be busy.

524
00:29:16,317 --> 00:29:17,463
Yeah, she is.

525
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,091
- I'll show you around.
- Boss...

526
00:29:20,554 --> 00:29:22,009
We'll start with the armory.

527
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,321
Back to work.

528
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:29,374
I'm flashing back.

529
00:29:30,973 --> 00:29:32,006
Boarding school.

530
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,029
Headmaster wants to talk to my dad.

531
00:29:45,212 --> 00:29:46,912
- Yeah, Tony.
- Where are you?

532
00:29:46,996 --> 00:29:47,763
<i>Autopsy.</i>

533
00:29:47,847 --> 00:29:49,496
Emergency.
Boss needs you up here now.

534
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,617
Get your skinny butt on the move,
<i>pronto</i>! Run!

535
00:29:52,711 --> 00:29:55,418
- What do you want McGee to do?
- Use his computer magic.

536
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,047
I need to find out what my father's been
doing on this thing.

537
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:02,599
'Cause he's up to something.

538
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:04,983
I can smell it.

539
00:30:11,818 --> 00:30:13,632
This doesn't look
like an armory to me.

540
00:30:17,172 --> 00:30:17,883
Sit.

541
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:22,613
When you offered to take me
on the tour,

542
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:25,069
I suspected you had
an ulterior motive.

543
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,367
- What's on your mind?
- Your son.

544
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,599
What has...

545
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:33,148
Junior done now?

546
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,963
Tony likes to hide
behind the face of a clown.

547
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:44,073
But he's the best young agent
I've ever worked with.

548
00:30:47,185 --> 00:30:48,399
I'm glad to hear that.

549
00:30:49,646 --> 00:30:51,502
When was the last time
you talked to him?

550
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:52,953
I mean, really...

551
00:30:53,623 --> 00:30:54,586
talked to him?

552
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:56,810
We keep in touch.

553
00:30:57,526 --> 00:30:58,586
Four years ago,

554
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:02,360
your son came very close
to dying from pneumonic plague.

555
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:04,978
And I expected to see you.

556
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:08,581
You didn't show then.
Why are you here now?

557
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:11,619
He never told me he was sick.

558
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:14,476
So you don't keep in touch.

559
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:16,726
What's your point?

560
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:19,615
Tony inherited
his personality from you.

561
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:24,491
But I get the feeling there's a lot
about your life...

562
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:26,779
you don't share.

563
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:40,481
I should tell you to piss off.

564
00:31:42,648 --> 00:31:45,089
But I do know that Junior
thinks the world of you.

565
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:47,671
So I'll keep this civil.

566
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:52,486
You have children, Gibbs?

567
00:31:57,889 --> 00:31:58,600
Had.

568
00:32:00,557 --> 00:32:01,488
A daughter.

569
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:06,387
But unfortunately...

570
00:32:09,749 --> 00:32:12,079
I didn't get the chance
to know her as an adult.

571
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:18,019
You have that opportunity
to get to know Tony.

572
00:32:20,603 --> 00:32:21,328
Do it.

573
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:24,418
Are we finished?

574
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,932
You were right. The trace evidence
that Ducky swabbed from Walid's hands,

575
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:42,081
it was unexploded particles
of nitromethane.

576
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:43,751
The same explosive in the bomb.

577
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:46,297
Walid planted the bomb
under Sayif's car.

578
00:32:46,554 --> 00:32:48,194
- Nice work!
- You, too!

579
00:32:49,892 --> 00:32:52,738
Walid unintentionally
blew himself up

580
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:56,094
when the vibrations
from the jet triggered the explosion.

581
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:58,100
And the victim was his own killer.

582
00:32:58,717 --> 00:32:59,485
Hinky.

583
00:33:06,078 --> 00:33:08,980
What was Walid's motive
for planting the bomb?

584
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:11,811
Well, as Sayif's aide,

585
00:33:11,895 --> 00:33:14,826
he had plenty of opportunities to kill
the Prince while they were alone.

586
00:33:15,105 --> 00:33:18,037
Maybe he was a suicide bomber
and supposed to be in the car with him.

587
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:21,374
- Would look like a terrorist act.
- DiNozzo, are you with us?

588
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah, Boss.

589
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,590
Whoever hires the women
around here deserves a bonus.

590
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:28,029
They're not only beautiful,
but they're bright.

591
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,369
Stop it.

592
00:33:30,136 --> 00:33:33,052
- This the end of the tour?
- I think I've showed him everything.

593
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:36,681
- Not everything.
- Dad!

594
00:33:37,795 --> 00:33:39,748
Agent Grady is waiting
for you in Polygraph.

595
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:41,757
She would like to give you
a demonstration.

596
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,385
No one's wiring me up.

597
00:33:43,845 --> 00:33:46,594
But I would like to ask Abby
a few more questions.

598
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:49,270
Well, come on, then.

599
00:33:57,513 --> 00:34:00,848
We've been treating him like the victim.
Let's start looking as the murderer.

600
00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:02,343
Background him.

601
00:34:02,804 --> 00:34:05,972
Sayif's the one that spent the most time
with him and was the targeted victim.

602
00:34:06,196 --> 00:34:07,647
He lands in 45 minutes.

603
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:09,275
Go. Both of you, go talk to him.

604
00:34:09,596 --> 00:34:12,136
DiNozzo, get away from that computer.
We got to brief State.

605
00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:16,261
Have to break one
of your rules, Boss.

606
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,084
Number six:
"Never say you're sorry".

607
00:34:18,943 --> 00:34:21,092
I let things get out of control
in the hotel room.

608
00:34:21,176 --> 00:34:22,992
Yeah. It's covered.
Rule 18.

609
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,147
"It's better to seek forgiveness
than ask permission."

610
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,349
- Am I forgiven?
- No.

611
00:34:29,312 --> 00:34:31,280
You've been distracted
by your father.

612
00:34:33,408 --> 00:34:34,447
It's that obvious?

613
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,790
- He's not the man I thought he was.
- I don't know my father.

614
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,253
No, Boss, my father's always been
a mystery to me.

615
00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:51,017
Just a wealthy one.

616
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:53,507
It turns out he's broke.

617
00:34:53,715 --> 00:34:55,043
He has been for years.

618
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:59,045
His bank accounts are overdrawn, credit
cards are frozen, property's foreclosed.

619
00:34:59,813 --> 00:35:02,115
- The guy's tapped out.
- How'd you find that out?

620
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:04,101
McGee got me into his records.

621
00:35:05,174 --> 00:35:08,197
But it turns out Senior's been living
high on the low for quite some time.

622
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:11,275
I wonder if he was ever
as rich as he appeared.

623
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,868
I think the reason he came...

624
00:35:15,722 --> 00:35:17,215
to town to see me was...

625
00:35:19,064 --> 00:35:20,431
to confess the charade.

626
00:35:21,645 --> 00:35:25,349
But when he figured out that Prince Omar
was coming to town, I think he...

627
00:35:27,188 --> 00:35:29,043
he saw the chance
for one last score.

628
00:35:30,286 --> 00:35:32,046
His whole life's one big con.

629
00:35:33,638 --> 00:35:35,382
What are you going to do about it?

630
00:35:38,531 --> 00:35:39,470
End the game.

631
00:35:40,401 --> 00:35:41,112
When?

632
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,600
Time to do it's when he checks out
of the hotel.

633
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,416
He's staying in a $1,000-a-night suite.
He can't afford it.

634
00:35:48,044 --> 00:35:49,551
He's running up a huge tab.

635
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:51,260
I'll get him when he...

636
00:35:51,762 --> 00:35:52,983
tries to pay the bill.

637
00:35:53,928 --> 00:35:55,337
<i>What can you tell me, Gibbs?</i>

638
00:35:56,425 --> 00:35:57,905
We know who planted the bomb.

639
00:36:00,295 --> 00:36:01,746
My protection detail!

640
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:03,667
Miss me?

641
00:36:05,755 --> 00:36:08,015
We need to ask you
a few questions about Walid.

642
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,417
Aren't you going to ask
if I passed my check ride?

643
00:36:10,913 --> 00:36:11,815
Did you?

644
00:36:11,899 --> 00:36:13,058
With flying colors.

645
00:36:13,341 --> 00:36:14,736
Good. Now you can go home.

646
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:19,565
How long have you
and Walid been friends?

647
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:21,595
He was not my friend.

648
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:24,807
He was assigned to me by the embassy.
My brother, to be exact.

649
00:36:25,171 --> 00:36:27,059
- Were they close?
- Since they were kids.

650
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,704
The two of them shared religious
and political beliefs.

651
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,936
Your lifestyle has to be
an embarrassment to them.

652
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,020
I think Walid's real job was
to keep an eye on me for my brother.

653
00:36:36,706 --> 00:36:38,571
He would do anything
Abdalla asked him to do.

654
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:41,723
What?

655
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:44,869
Walid planted
the explosive under your car.

656
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:05,389
- What is it I can do for you?
- You leaving?

657
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:08,403
- Shortly.
- You just arrived.

658
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,326
Pressing family matters.

659
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:13,006
We think your son's driver Walid
planted the bomb.

660
00:37:13,995 --> 00:37:16,150
If Prince Abdalla's here,
we'd like to speak with him.

661
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,028
Sayif called and told me everything.

662
00:37:19,797 --> 00:37:23,257
If you came here to ask Abdalla
if Walid was following his orders,

663
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,034
the answer is yes.

664
00:37:26,174 --> 00:37:27,248
He admitted it?

665
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:28,853
Unfortunately, he did.

666
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:31,665
And why would he do that?

667
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:34,201
He told me he felt
his brother's lifestyle

668
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,878
would bring shame to our family.

669
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:39,018
He thought it better
if Sayif dies as a martyr.

670
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:43,051
I'm sorry what he did
took place on your soil.

671
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,012
Where is Prince Abdalla?

672
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:47,688
At the airport, aboard a Royal jet.

673
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,157
He's gonna have to answer
for what he's done.

674
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:52,827
As a member of the embassy's
administrative staff,

675
00:37:53,497 --> 00:37:55,105
Abdalla has diplomatic immunity.

676
00:37:55,747 --> 00:37:57,324
His safe passage is ensured.

677
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,991
You're gonna let him just get away?

678
00:38:02,037 --> 00:38:04,698
He still is my son, Agent Gibbs.

679
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:07,409
Fathers do what they have
to do for their children.

680
00:38:08,408 --> 00:38:09,524
This is my problem.

681
00:38:10,683 --> 00:38:12,887
He will be dealt with most severely,
I assure you.

682
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:15,064
Now, if you'll excuse me.

683
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:23,509
Would you tell your father I regret
not having more time to spend with him?

684
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:26,661
Let him know I'll be
in Monte Carlo next month.

685
00:38:27,052 --> 00:38:28,806
Maybe we can see each other there.

686
00:38:36,223 --> 00:38:39,627
Prince Omar said you could catch up
with him in Monte Carlo next month.

687
00:38:42,669 --> 00:38:43,560
He left?

688
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:46,811
He just landed this morning.

689
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,929
He's got a lot on his mind, Dad.
Cut him some slack.

690
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:55,338
You have work to do, Junior.

691
00:38:55,422 --> 00:38:56,678
I can check myself out.

692
00:38:56,762 --> 00:38:58,437
No. I've got time.

693
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:02,577
I'll even drive you to the station.
What do you think about that?

694
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:04,425
Already called for a cab.

695
00:39:10,947 --> 00:39:12,175
How may I help you?

696
00:39:12,831 --> 00:39:15,728
I'm checking out.
DiNozzo, suite 901.

697
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:18,355
Would you like me to leave
that on your credit card?

698
00:39:19,762 --> 00:39:20,816
Actually...

699
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:23,908
I need to talk to you about that.

700
00:39:24,215 --> 00:39:26,697
I'll take care of Mr. DiNozzo.

701
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,400
That's all right. I'm sure that...

702
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:31,160
Taylor can handle this.

703
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:41,628
I'm experiencing some problems
with my credit card.

704
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:50,739
I don't think we'll be needing it,
Mr. DiNozzo.

705
00:39:51,493 --> 00:39:53,042
Your bill has been paid in full.

706
00:39:53,752 --> 00:39:55,496
I'll get you a copy
for your records.

707
00:39:56,152 --> 00:39:58,604
And also,
something has been left here for you.

708
00:40:03,626 --> 00:40:04,485
What is it?

709
00:40:07,735 --> 00:40:10,324
A note from... Prince Omar...

710
00:40:11,058 --> 00:40:11,770
Al...

711
00:40:12,573 --> 00:40:13,609
And a...

712
00:40:13,693 --> 00:40:15,621
confirmation number for...

713
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:16,972
an open-ended...

714
00:40:18,284 --> 00:40:20,866
first-class flight to Monte Carlo.

715
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:23,876
I guess he...

716
00:40:25,003 --> 00:40:26,853
felt guilty about standing me up.

717
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,564
You lead a charmed life, don't you?

718
00:40:32,949 --> 00:40:34,848
It was great seeing you, Junior.

719
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:38,352
I enjoyed our talk.

720
00:40:41,044 --> 00:40:42,647
We should do that more often.

721
00:40:43,198 --> 00:40:44,858
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

722
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:47,380
I mean it.

723
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,749
I love you, Anthony.

724
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:10,438
I love you.

725
00:41:29,928 --> 00:41:31,697
Steak, cowboy-style. I love it.

726
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,332
Your father leave?

727
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:40,033
Should be in New York by now.

728
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:52,049
So, how'd it go?

729
00:41:53,174 --> 00:41:55,095
He skated again. Guy's amazing.

730
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,234
So, what happened?

731
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:00,684
His buddy Omar

732
00:42:01,222 --> 00:42:03,036
picked up the tab, bought him

733
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:05,213
an airline ticket to Monte Carlo.

734
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:11,501
Where'd you get the money, Tony?

735
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:14,010
What?

736
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:21,530
How do you do it?

737
00:42:25,481 --> 00:42:29,095
I didn't really need to go on a cruise
with my fraternity brothers, did I?

738
00:42:30,744 --> 00:42:32,418
Getting a little old for that stuff.

739
00:42:34,984 --> 00:42:37,679
You conned the con man.
Runs in the family.

740
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,323
Why'd you do it?

741
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,104
He's my father.

742
00:42:47,977 --> 00:42:49,075
He is who he is.

743
00:42:50,461 --> 00:42:51,652
I couldn't bust him.

744
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:56,541
Sometimes it's better to keep
what you know to yourself.

745
00:43:01,257 --> 00:43:02,095
Amen.
