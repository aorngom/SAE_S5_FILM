1
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:19,661
- Hi.
- Hi.

2
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,169
Try this one.

3
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:24,513
- Emily.
- Yes ?

4
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:25,856
Come here.

5
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:27,743
They haven't called our number yet.

6
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:29,168
I know.

7
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,354
Relax agent Fornell.

8
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:33,306
She's fine.

9
00:00:35,914 --> 00:00:39,754
I didn't expect to see
you again until... 2067 ?

10
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:42,858
I got a reprieve.

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,329
you're not going to use that
in front of your daughter.

12
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:48,311
I don't need a gun to take you down.

13
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:51,006
- You wouldn't hurt a innocent man.
- I'm not looking at one.

14
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:53,287
That's where you and agent Gibbs got it wrong.

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,633
Agent Gibbs is retired.

16
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:59,235
I know. Why do you think I'm talking to you ?

17
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,956
I have no idea. Why don't you enlighten me.

18
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:04,829
I told you. You got the wrong guy.

19
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:06,935
And if there's a shred of decency in you,

20
00:01:06,998 --> 00:01:08,410
and brains...

21
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:12,008
...you'll re-open my case and find the right one.

22
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:19,345
Now I'm going to walk out of here.

23
00:01:19,892 --> 00:01:21,201
You'll want to follow.

24
00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:22,915
But you'll realize something

25
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:25,341
and end up just reaching
for that cell instead.

26
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:26,706
- Really ?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:27,922
What's that ?

28
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:30,179
I might not be alone.

29
00:01:35,132 --> 00:01:36,899
- See you, sweetie.
- Bye.

NCIS Season 4 Episode 2
Escaped

Script : FRM

Synch : BadGOne & Pit for www.Team-NCIS.com

42
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:16,118
The basement needs some work.

43
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,517
But if it doesn't showed "wine cellar,"

44
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:19,979
...I don't know what does.

45
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,200
Have a look.

46
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,053
And I'll be right back.

47
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:28,972
- First my wife, now my house ?
- No.

48
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,714
No, I learned lesson.

49
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:32,596
I'm through with your leftovers.

50
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,625
You're going to need a
bigger box for that boat.

51
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:39,488
You come all the way out here to give me packing tips, Tobias ?

52
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:41,239
Actually, I came to tell you that

53
00:03:41,277 --> 00:03:44,825
Petty Officer Derrick Paulson escaped form prison yesterday.

54
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:49,784
No.

55
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,654
I haven't asked
you anything yet.

56
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:55,308
You caught him last time.

57
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:57,994
Figured you might like
to catch him again.

58
00:03:58,093 --> 00:03:59,264
You thought wrong.

59
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:03,558
He came to see me, Jethro.

60
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,434
When I was with Emily.

61
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,701
She okay ?

62
00:04:12,726 --> 00:04:13,774
For now.

63
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:17,133
He just wanted to tell me
that I got the wrong man,

64
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:20,282
and strongly suggested that
I reopen his case to prove it.

65
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,619
He's risking a lot for something
he's knows can't happen.

66
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:23,684
You think ?

67
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:25,818
I don't know what his game is.

68
00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:27,109
But I'm not going to get
a good night's sleep

69
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,075
until that S.O.B.
is back behind bars.

70
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,637
You don't need
me to find him.

71
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:33,247
Need ?

72
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,167
A convicted killer was two
inches from my daughter !

73
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:39,280
Handing her crayons.

74
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,305
He touched her!

75
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,795
We're way beyond
need, Jethro.

76
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:52,773
Nice tan.

77
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:02,960
It's really not that bad, McGee.

78
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,253
For a spy, you're
a horrible liar.

79
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:06,110
Ziva's right.

80
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,510
You can hardly notice.

81
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:08,924
But...
But ?

82
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:12,067
I wouldn't let Agent DiNozzo
see it if I were you.

83
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,312
Let Agent DiNozzo
see what ?

84
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:14,639
Nothing.

85
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,916
Why are you mumbling, McGee ?

86
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:18,156
I'm not mumbling.

87
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:23,088
Well, you either just said

88
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:25,888
"mimes aren't rumbling"
or "I'm not mumbling."

89
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:27,773
And I don't see
any mimes.

90
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,913
Agent Lee,

91
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:33,765
why is Agent McGee
mumbling ?

92
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:36,133
He over-bleached
his teeth, sir.

93
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:40,467
Apparently, he fell
asleep while wearing

94
00:05:40,517 --> 00:05:42,785
his bleaching tray, sir.

95
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:44,450
<i>You don't watch
Friends, do you ?</i>

96
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:45,643
Same thing
happened to Ross.

97
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:47,784
You could have learned
from our friend's mistake.

98
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,867
But you
choose to read instead.

99
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:52,246
Better let me
see the damage.

100
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:58,189
As team leader, people,

101
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:00,960
I need to be aware
of any condition

102
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:02,637
that might affect
an agent's ability

103
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:05,851
to perform
his or her duties.

104
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,219
And what does having
embarrassingly

105
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:10,052
white teeth have to do
with performing his duties ?

106
00:06:10,102 --> 00:06:11,761
You said it was
not that bad.

107
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,051
She lied.

108
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:14,895
- Open up your mouth.
- No.

109
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:15,878
- Let me see the Chiclets.
- No.

110
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:16,930
Let me see 'em.

111
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,659
- No.
- Open your...

112
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:19,567
Gibbs.

113
00:06:23,277 --> 00:06:24,250
What is... ?

114
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:25,203
I have no idea.

115
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:30,043
Agent Gibbs !
I mean, Mister...

116
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,374
Just as I was
getting used to

117
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:37,219
my door being
treated as a door.

118
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:39,341
I'll call you back, Todd.

119
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,534
I need a temporary
reinstatement.

120
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:42,715
I assume you're here

121
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,345
because of ex-Petty Officer
Derrick Paulson.

122
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:47,423
I read
Agent Fornell's report.

123
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,393
Why the sudden, if temporary,

124
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,826
interest in
bank robbers ?

125
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:55,946
If you've read Fornell's report,
Jen, then you already know.

126
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:56,900
We're wasting time.

127
00:06:56,964 --> 00:06:58,744
It's not that simple, Jethro.

128
00:06:58,807 --> 00:06:59,872
You left.

129
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,201
I appreciate
what you did for Ziva,

130
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,168
but this is not
some gym membership

131
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:05,121
that you can turn on and off.

132
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:07,768
No, I can't ; but I'm not
director of NCIS.

133
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,411
And the director of NCIS

134
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:11,216
already filed
your retirement package

135
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,599
with Navy Human Resources.

136
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:13,537
Un-file it.

137
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:15,450
It doesn't work that way,
Jethro.

138
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,312
It would take weeks
to reinstate you.

139
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:19,281
<i>And that's even if
you managed to pass your...</i>

140
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:20,999
My psych evaluation ?

141
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:26,395
Or are you talking about
my firearms proficiency exam ?

142
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:28,096
No.

143
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,831
That one I'm not worried about.

144
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:34,884
Wait.

145
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,425
Let me at least...

146
00:07:45,147 --> 00:07:46,717
...validate your parking.

147
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:52,315
That's strange.

148
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:55,474
I could've sworn
I filed this.

149
00:07:56,802 --> 00:07:58,884
Your retirement package.

150
00:08:00,377 --> 00:08:04,280
I must have
accidentally put in

151
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:07,681
for your unused
leave time instead.

152
00:08:09,043 --> 00:08:10,449
Of which, it seems,

153
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:12,815
there are
six days left

154
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:15,263
until it has to be filed.

155
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:23,985
Come on, don't tell me you
don't eavesdrop, Cynthia.

156
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:25,399
Every director's
assistant eavesdrops.

157
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,821
He's coming.
He's coming.

158
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:30,290
Hey, Gibbs.

159
00:08:30,322 --> 00:08:31,975
Just visiting
the neighborhood or...

160
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:34,089
taking your desk back?

161
00:08:35,745 --> 00:08:36,650
Let's go.

162
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:48,716
You should've been here
half an hour ago.

163
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:49,950
Yeah, i'm just
getting Emily settled

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,495
- ... at my mom's place.
- Want me to send an agent over ?

165
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,084
How many can you spare ?

166
00:08:54,518 --> 00:08:55,742
Okay, I've got an idea.

167
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,555
Maybe he lost his memory again
and forgot he quit his job.

168
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:00,316
Wouldn't he be sitting
at his old desk then ?

169
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:02,231
If Gibbs wanted us
to know what he was doing,

170
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:03,957
he would've told us.
Oh, right.

171
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,287
Because he would
never expect us

172
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,673
to figure it out
for ourselves.

173
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:09,978
Gibbs is back...
on temporary assignment.

174
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:11,344
The Paulson case.

175
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,373
Paulson ?!

176
00:09:12,462 --> 00:09:14,905
Petty Officer Derrick Paulson :
knocked over a bank,

177
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,815
killed two of his accomplices,
money was never found.

178
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,431
Paulson's
prison cell.

179
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:19,568
I want to see what was in it.

180
00:09:19,603 --> 00:09:21,077
I've already sent
the contents over.

181
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,895
Maybe your techs can find
something mine didn't.

182
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:24,213
Bye, Daddy !

183
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,260
I'm worried.

184
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:27,335
She'll be fine, Tobias.

185
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:28,935
Paulson isn't after her.

186
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:31,037
I ruined his life, Jethro.

187
00:09:31,276 --> 00:09:32,958
We don't know what he's after.

188
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,675
Anything good ?

189
00:09:39,783 --> 00:09:40,905
Yeah.

190
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:43,845
It's a jailhouse appeal
from some escaped convict.

191
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:45,288
The guy really knows
his forensics.

192
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,371
I knew it ! I knew it !

193
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,511
Won't need these anymore
now that you're actually here.

194
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,017
I knew you'd come back.

195
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:58,194
I'm not back.

196
00:09:58,225 --> 00:10:00,669
Of course you're back.
I can feel your badge.

197
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:02,576
That is your badge, right ?

198
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:06,081
You are back.

199
00:10:06,282 --> 00:10:09,160
Reinstatement's
only temporary, Abs.

200
00:10:10,146 --> 00:10:12,609
Until I can find Paulson.

201
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,325
We'll see about that.

202
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,829
So what can I do for you,

203
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:19,389
temporarily reinstated
Agent Gibbs ?

204
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:21,255
Process the contents
of Paulson's cell.

205
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:22,702
What am I looking for ?

206
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:25,253
Oh, right.
Anything to help you find him.

207
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:27,895
I want to know what he was
up to before he escaped.

208
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:31,396
Unless the three of you
have any other suggestions.

209
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:35,115
Uh...

210
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:37,827
Hey...

211
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:39,769
We were, we
were just, uh,

212
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:41,470
eavesdropping like little girls.

213
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:43,194
But we do have
suggestions.

214
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:44,437
Prison records show

215
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:47,369
that only one person ever came
to visit Paulson in jail.

216
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:50,278
Mickey Stokes, 72.
Former Navy sailor.

217
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:51,799
And since Paulson
has no family,

218
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,939
we should assume that he'll try
to contact Mickey.

219
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:55,455
And I already
have an address.

220
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,873
Tony, Ziva, you're with me.

221
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,412
McGee, stay here and...

222
00:10:58,571 --> 00:10:59,107
McGee, stay here, help Abby.

223
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:00,153
...help Abby...

224
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:03,264
...process Paulson's
belongings.

225
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:05,028
Then gargle this.

226
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,650
Before the rest of
us go snow-blind.

227
00:11:18,114 --> 00:11:20,303
Gibbs seemed awfully
quiet in the car.

228
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:22,784
It's not like you were giving
him a chance to talk, Tony.

229
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,207
What, are you nervous he's
going to want his old job back ?

230
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:26,806
No. I'm just
bringing him up to speed

231
00:11:26,873 --> 00:11:28,067
on the latest
protocols.

232
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:30,073
What took you hotshots
so long ?

233
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,881
He's been waiting
over an hour.

234
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:33,865
Hey, shoes off !

235
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,523
Clear.

236
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:38,192
Clear.

237
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:39,495
Where is he ?

238
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:41,577
I never said he was here.

239
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:44,895
Gibbs.

240
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:46,585
Didn't expect
to hear your voice.

241
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:47,584
I heard you quit.

242
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:48,571
Retired.

243
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:49,937
At your age,

244
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:50,671
that's quitting.

245
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:51,889
Why don't you turn yourself in,

246
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:53,716
you can tell me
about this in person.

247
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:55,537
Turn myself in for what ?

248
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:57,126
I'm an innocent man.

249
00:11:57,324 --> 00:11:58,891
Try broken record.

250
00:11:59,256 --> 00:12:01,402
So you're not
going to reopen my case ?

251
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:03,704
We both know what I'll find
if I do, so why don't you

252
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:05,371
tell me what you really want.

253
00:12:05,387 --> 00:12:07,994
I already got it, Agent Gibbs.

254
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:10,449
So what does he really want ?

255
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,832
Our Car.

256
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:24,162
They appear to
be close.

257
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:25,895
Well, they say the way

258
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,993
to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

259
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:31,449
Meals on Wheels.

260
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:34,120
Looks like Paulson was a volunteer.

261
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:37,434
He volunteered to
put... meals on wheels ?

262
00:12:39,428 --> 00:12:41,622
They bring food to the elderly, Ziva.

263
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:43,541
Of course I helped him !

264
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:45,222
Derrick was like
a son to me.

265
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:47,590
I was the closest thing
he had to family.

266
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:50,085
What would you do if it
was your kid in trouble ?

267
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:53,359
I would've told him to give himself up before he got hurt.

268
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:56,691
I'm glad you ain't my old man, Fornell.

269
00:12:57,038 --> 00:12:58,900
Shoes off !

270
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:05,553
And I certainly wouldn't let him

271
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:06,457
steal my car.

272
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,873
Didn't. It was DiNozzo's car.

273
00:13:08,941 --> 00:13:11,129
He just wants you
to reopen his case !

274
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,884
You been reading my
letters the past four years ?

275
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:16,455
You bozos got the wrong guy.

276
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:18,648
Paulson took advantage of you, Mickey.

277
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:21,664
He only brought you food because you lived near the bank he was casing.

278
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,030
<i>You wasted your life savings
defending the wrong guy.</i>

279
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:25,904
Hey !

280
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:27,537
Not my computer !

281
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:29,905
I got an online date tonight.

282
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,313
Where is he, Mickey ?

283
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:35,540
He doesn't know.

284
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:37,534
You sure ?

285
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:40,172
Want to hit him
for aiding and abetting ?

286
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,803
He did shelter Paulson,
he gave him money.

287
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:44,889
I say we
use him as bait.

288
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:48,338
Give Mickey a pass, put a man on him in case Paulson comes back?

289
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:55,927
You're the boss.

290
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:00,586
Yeah ?

291
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:02,204
Where ?

292
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:04,196
Anything in it ?

293
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:09,397
D.C. Metro just found our car
half a mile from here.

294
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:11,449
The only thing missing
was my laptop.

295
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:13,335
And every file
we had on Paulson.

296
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:14,996
I told you, he just...
he just wants

297
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:16,112
to work on his case.

298
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:18,644
Except he's had all his
case files since the trial.

299
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:20,243
Perhaps ours have
something his didn't.

300
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,813
They do.
The addresses

301
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:23,597
of the witnesses
who testified against him.

302
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,277
He's not a threat to anyone !

303
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,731
He's on the run
and unarmed.

304
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:29,374
Do you keep any
weapons in the house ?

305
00:14:29,424 --> 00:14:30,471
Oh, great.

306
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:32,813
Now you're going to pin
another crime on him ?

307
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:35,712
Just my old Colt.

308
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:36,687
Where is it ?

309
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:54,566
Paulson could be after any
one of a half dozen witnesses.

310
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:57,267
I've never seen a convicted
felon file so many appeals.

311
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,133
It's an abuse
of the system.

312
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,488
We're all entitled
to our day in court.

313
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:02,570
Not according
to Agent Gibbs.

314
00:15:02,622 --> 00:15:04,700
I've been going over
his case files.

315
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:07,651
He seems to prefer
a more biblical

316
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:09,099
approach to things.

317
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:09,966
If you ask me,

318
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:12,166
the agency's better off
without him.

319
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,054
Oh.

320
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,228
I like you, Michelle,
so I'm just going to pretend

321
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:17,658
like you didn't
say that.

322
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:20,044
NCIS is lucky
to have Gibbs back.

323
00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:21,719
Except he's not staying.

324
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:23,035
You do realize...

325
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,831
You can kill me without leaving
any forensic evidence behind ?

326
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:27,469
Yeah, you mentioned that.

327
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,415
Good, then.
It's settled.

328
00:15:29,486 --> 00:15:30,846
Gibbs is staying.

329
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:32,705
He has to.

330
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,009
Right, Gibbs ?

331
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:43,907
What do you got
for me, Abby ?

332
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:45,710
Paulson's fingerprints
on the gun case

333
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:47,091
and on Mickey's computer.

334
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:50,512
And he's also visited over
a dozen People Search sites.

335
00:15:50,562 --> 00:15:51,841
I think he was looking
for someone.

336
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:52,983
Yeah, I got
that part.

337
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:55,213
No names yet,
but I'm using the FBI's

338
00:15:55,263 --> 00:15:57,278
mainframe to decrypt
the search cache.

339
00:15:58,441 --> 00:16:00,623
Oh. You always did have
really good timing.

340
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:03,214
Mickey ?!

341
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:05,335
Where the hell
is Mickey, you tramp?

342
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:07,282
Mickey isn't here.

343
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:09,254
It's Mickey's
online playmate.

344
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:10,905
She keeps tunneling
through my firewall.

345
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:12,519
Russell Nash.

346
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:13,862
Apparently, he's...

347
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:15,263
The only accomplice
Paulson didn't kill.

348
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:17,598
Yeah, and the one
he really should have.

349
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:19,379
Nash copped a plea and testified
against Paulson.

350
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,578
Paulson got life,

351
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:23,251
and Nash walked
in 18 months.

352
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:24,785
Skipped out on his parole.

353
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:26,101
Hasn't been seen since.

354
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,406
Well, if the money was
never found, then maybe

355
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:29,665
Paulson is looking
for Nash

356
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:30,678
because he thinks
Nash has the money.

357
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:32,120
Or maybe Paulson is looking

358
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,407
for something a little more...
biblical.

359
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:38,498
<i>Thank you.</i>

360
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:40,139
I'll let Agent Gibbs
know immediately.

361
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:41,528
And I'll see you Saturday.

362
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:42,766
Okay.

363
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:46,868
Hey, was the FBI able
to warn all the witnesses?

364
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,187
All except
for one.

365
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:50,285
Is that your third
Caf-POW!, McGee?

366
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:52,812
It's my fourth.
How do they look?

367
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:55,586
Hmm. Maybe you should
switch to blueberries.

368
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:57,250
Anything good on
our tip hotline?

369
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,300
Is there ever?

370
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:00,636
Half our callers don't know
what a tip is.

371
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:01,871
Have you spoken to Gibbs yet?

372
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:03,028
What about?

373
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,381
You're not
wondering why he's back?

374
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:06,092
Help Fornell like he helped you.

375
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,339
Taking a little
break, DiNozzo?

376
00:17:08,389 --> 00:17:10,856
Oh, I think you know
exactly what I'm doing,

377
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,723
Agent Gibbs.

378
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,913
Why do you think he's back?

379
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:16,157
I don't know, but I'm
hoping it's more than just Fornell.

380
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,764
Let's just say I'm getting
sick of the campfires.

381
00:17:19,816 --> 00:17:20,885
Showtime.

382
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:22,613
Wouldn't let Tony
hear you say that.

383
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:23,870
Say what, Agent McGee?

384
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,403
Yeah, I was just telling
McGee the FBI was able to...

385
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,664
Warn all the witnesses from
Paulson's trial, except for one?

386
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,986
Right! The only one
they couldn't find was...

387
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:32,317
Russell Nash.

388
00:17:36,044 --> 00:17:38,762
I have much to
learn still, Master.

389
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,733
Campfire!

390
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:44,531
There you go.

391
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:45,970
Sort of a new thing
that I like to do.

392
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,180
I find it focuses the group
better than just, uh,

393
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:50,321
you know, shouting
across the bullpen.

394
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:53,964
Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

395
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:57,012
Let's focus on Russell Nash.

396
00:17:57,382 --> 00:17:58,237
The inside man.

397
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,698
Worked for the bank
that Paulson knocked over.

398
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:00,980
Our only
missing witness.

399
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,835
According to Abby,

400
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:03,264
he's the one Paulson's after.

401
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:05,118
- We find Nash...
- We find Paulson.

402
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:08,129
Campfire over.

403
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:09,985
<i>And the last question.</i>

404
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:11,687
"In your own words,
the difference

405
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:13,752
between ethics and morals."

406
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:16,701
Well, the ethical man knows
he shouldn't cheat on his wife,

407
00:18:16,748 --> 00:18:20,642
whereas the moral man
actually wouldn't.

408
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:23,161
You're going to ace
your oral exams, Doctor.

409
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:24,787
Going back to school?

410
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:25,670
I never stopped.

411
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:28,514
The doctor's getting a degree
in Forensic Psychology.

412
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:29,950
Yes, and with it,
I'll be able to add

413
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:33,055
the Psychological
Autopsy to my arsenal.

414
00:18:33,135 --> 00:18:35,030
I'll not only be able
to uncover the hows

415
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:40,232
of our patient's demise,
but the whys, as well.

416
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:44,829
I mean, what motivates us
can be a very tricky thing.

417
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:46,748
I was wondering
when you were going

418
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,512
to come down
and see me.

419
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:49,879
I've been busy.

420
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:51,675
Or avoiding me.

421
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:54,306
I wonder

422
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:56,288
why that could be.

423
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,433
I'm not staying.

424
00:18:57,496 --> 00:18:58,674
Oh, I didn't
think you were.

425
00:18:58,724 --> 00:19:01,985
I'm aware that when Leroy
Jethro Gibbs makes up his mind,

426
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:03,810
his mind's made up.

427
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:05,813
So...

428
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:08,765
why are you here?

429
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:10,839
The Paulson case--
how much do you know?

430
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:14,177
Well, I took the liberty of
examining the M.E.'s reports

431
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:16,186
on Paulson's two
murdered accomplices.

432
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:17,292
Anything bug you?

433
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:19,740
It's about as watertight a case
as I've ever seen,

434
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,769
pathologically
speaking-- why?

435
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:25,339
Do you suspect foul
play in the foul play?

436
00:19:25,386 --> 00:19:25,950
No.

437
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:27,470
Yet you're down here asking me

438
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,271
if anything "bugs you"
about the case.

439
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:33,702
Are you getting one of those
famous gut instincts again?

440
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:36,516
I've already had that, and
it said that Paulson was guilty.

441
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:39,601
And when Leroy Jethro Gibbs
makes up his mind,

442
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:41,053
his mind's made up.

443
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:44,053
Too bad
for Petty Officer Paulson.

444
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:46,135
Let's hope
things work out

445
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:48,440
better for you in Mexico.

446
00:19:56,332 --> 00:19:57,070
Uh-huh.

447
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,311
No word on the Russell Nash

448
00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:00,819
BOLO, but we got something
off the tip hotline on Paulson.

449
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:02,616
What?
Paulson.

450
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:04,823
Hey, Jethro.

451
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:06,781
Hey, you got a tip hotline
to find me,

452
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:10,153
but nothing on my original case.
Not cool.

453
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,564
Gonna have to do something
about that.

454
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,194
But for now,

455
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:16,514
just calling to say thanks
for the car.

456
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:19,625
I left you a token
of my appreciation in return.

457
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:21,549
I'm sure you'll find it soon.

458
00:20:22,592 --> 00:20:24,735
Called his own tip hotline.

459
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:26,817
I'm starting to
like this guy.

460
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:29,217
We're getting an address
from the back trace now.

461
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:30,083
We got it!

462
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,859
It's in the city. 4242...

463
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:33,438
Adams Boulevard?

464
00:20:35,476 --> 00:20:36,938
You been there before, boss?

465
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:37,509
Yeah.

466
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:40,232
That's where Paulson killed
his two accomplices.

467
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:49,718
Is Agent Gibbs aware

468
00:20:49,768 --> 00:20:51,239
our warrant hasn't
officially come through yet?

469
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:53,273
Yeah, I think he got it by the
fifth time you told him, Lee.

470
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:54,369
Got my teams
out front.

471
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:55,762
Any idea what his
game is this time?

472
00:20:55,828 --> 00:20:57,028
Not a clue.

473
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:57,731
Okay, McGee, Ziva,

474
00:20:57,781 --> 00:20:58,777
fire escape, Lee...

475
00:20:58,877 --> 00:21:00,322
Watch the cars.

476
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:07,739
Get back.

477
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:12,493
I imagine you'd rather be
enjoying a nice drink

478
00:21:12,543 --> 00:21:13,639
in a cantina
right about now.

479
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,945
The thought had
crossed my mind.

480
00:21:14,995 --> 00:21:16,240
Mine, too.

481
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:20,778
Any bets on Paulson's
token of appreciation?

482
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,718
Let's hope it' s not
Russell Nash's head on a stick.

483
00:21:24,497 --> 00:21:25,895
Federal Agents!

484
00:21:42,286 --> 00:21:44,233
It appears
ex-Petty Officer Paulson

485
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:45,227
is attempting to highlight

486
00:21:45,277 --> 00:21:46,818
the discrepancies
in this crime scene.

487
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:48,906
Yeah. Picked up on that.

488
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:51,310
For a guilty man,
he's unusually

489
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,957
intent on trying to convince us
of his innocence.

490
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:55,816
Picked up on that, too.

491
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:58,590
No one heard the shooting?

492
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:00,243
Well, it's not exactly

493
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:02,516
a Neighborhood Watch
kind of place.

494
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:05,987
And the fact that
Paulson's DNA was found

495
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:07,604
under this victim's
fingernails,

496
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:09,341
but there was no other
sign of a struggle?

497
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:12,163
Mm-hmm. See that about
a quarter of the time, Ziva.

498
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:18,525
Why isn't he running?

499
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:20,305
That's a good question.

500
00:22:20,877 --> 00:22:22,166
What's that gut of yours say?

501
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,833
Four years ago?
That Paulson was guilty.

502
00:22:24,097 --> 00:22:25,352
Didn't mean
four years ago.

503
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:26,631
Paulson isn't after Nash

504
00:22:26,698 --> 00:22:27,731
for the money
from the bank job.

505
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:29,097
He's after Nash
because Nash

506
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,757
is the one man
who can exonerate him.

507
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,640
So was your gut wrong
four years ago,

508
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:35,222
or is it wrong now?

509
00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:37,633
Our job is not to
reopen Paulson's case.

510
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:39,080
Just catch him.

511
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:41,492
Paulson's already
reopened his case, Ziva.

512
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:43,364
Doesn't matter
what our job is,

513
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:45,243
if we want to figure
out his next move.

514
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,244
Now we're have to
reopen it, too.

515
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:49,100
Smart kid.

516
00:22:53,932 --> 00:22:56,398
The public defender
who represented Paulson

517
00:22:56,414 --> 00:22:57,667
is out on maternity leave.

518
00:22:57,712 --> 00:22:59,666
- Prosecutor?
- Naval reservist.

519
00:22:59,716 --> 00:23:01,241
Deployed to Iraq
two years ago.

520
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,119
Killed by an IED last month.

521
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:05,791
Unless we find someone
familiar with the Paulson case,

522
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:08,151
it'll take us days
just to catch up to speed,

523
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:10,742
much less anticipate
Paulson's next move.

524
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:11,803
Relax.

525
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:13,566
Gibbs brought in Mickey Stokes.

526
00:23:13,598 --> 00:23:15,744
No one knows Paulson
better than him.

527
00:23:15,998 --> 00:23:17,261
Is he even a lawyer?

528
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:18,752
Well, we can't
all be lawyers,

529
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:19,932
Agent Lee.

530
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,504
<i>So what changed your mind</i>

531
00:23:21,554 --> 00:23:22,757
about my boy?

532
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:25,121
Great Oz finally give
you guys a heart?

533
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:26,357
Who said I've
changed my mind?

534
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:28,471
Ah, definitely
wasn't a brain.

535
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:31,332
If Paulson was framed,
we need to find out how.

536
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:32,880
Maybe it was a brain.

537
00:23:33,131 --> 00:23:35,143
Either way, thank you.

538
00:23:35,243 --> 00:23:37,742
I've waited a long time
for someone to listen.

539
00:23:37,821 --> 00:23:39,379
Don't thank me just yet.

540
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:40,849
Jury had two weeks,

541
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:42,756
they didn't buy
that Paulson was framed.

542
00:23:42,998 --> 00:23:44,186
You have one day

543
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,481
to convince our forensic
scientist otherwise.

544
00:23:46,523 --> 00:23:48,287
You must be Mickey.

545
00:23:48,698 --> 00:23:49,970
Well... I'll be

546
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,094
whoever you want me to be.

547
00:23:52,205 --> 00:23:54,367
Mickey will do just fine.

548
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,472
I like your outfit.

549
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:57,463
Thank you.

550
00:23:58,181 --> 00:24:00,242
My dog has a
collar like that.

551
00:24:01,884 --> 00:24:03,550
So, for the sake
of argument, let's say

552
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,523
that Derrick Paulson
was framed.

553
00:24:05,573 --> 00:24:08,027
That makes Russell Nash
your prime suspect.

554
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:10,046
Exactly, Director.

555
00:24:10,747 --> 00:24:12,112
Hey, Gibbs.

556
00:24:12,414 --> 00:24:14,036
Why don't you come
on over and join us

557
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,839
for a little campfire?

558
00:24:20,281 --> 00:24:20,888
Where's he going?

559
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:22,465
Basement.
Fornell.

560
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:24,166
- Whiskey.
- Not tonight.

561
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:26,614
His real estate agent's
fumigating his house.

562
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,443
Apparently, Gibbs
got termites.

563
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:31,131
<i>I'd offer you the sofa,</i>

564
00:24:31,168 --> 00:24:33,353
but when I told Emily
you were staying over,

565
00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:35,094
she insisted you
take her room.

566
00:24:35,194 --> 00:24:39,329
Even said you can sleep
with her Raspberry Rumtart doll.

567
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:45,891
Daddy, watch.

568
00:24:46,064 --> 00:24:48,137
You may now kiss the bride.

569
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:54,624
So, it was four wives.

570
00:24:54,965 --> 00:24:56,516
Unless there's anything else
you want to tell me.

571
00:24:56,598 --> 00:24:58,433
Something you
want to know, Tobias?

572
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,907
You had a family, Jethro.

573
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:10,450
I know you like to play it
close to the vest, but...

574
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:12,918
Hell, I was married
to your second wife.

575
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:14,898
I tried to warn you.
I know, I know.

576
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:16,021
I didn't listen.

577
00:25:16,053 --> 00:25:18,162
If I did, I might
still have a house

578
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:20,038
with a guest bedroom for you.

579
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:29,543
I know it's not our usual stuff.

580
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,082
So we screwed up?

581
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:37,903
Let's wait and see
what Abby says.

582
00:25:37,932 --> 00:25:39,798
We screwed up. Big time.

583
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:42,071
I'm sure it wasn't
the first time,

584
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,677
and I know it's not
gonna be the last.

585
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:46,367
My last.

586
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,975
Least we can still
make it right.

587
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:56,952
If Russell Nash
did frame Paulson,

588
00:25:57,002 --> 00:25:59,491
he's not going to come clean
when Paulson finds him.

589
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:00,879
He's going to kill Paulson.

590
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:02,352
I know it.

591
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,479
I said we screwed up, didn't I?

592
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:09,389
It's funny how things work out.

593
00:26:09,731 --> 00:26:11,296
When I was a kid,

594
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,986
all I ever thought about
was being an FBI Agent.

595
00:26:15,097 --> 00:26:16,353
Now...

596
00:26:17,032 --> 00:26:19,937
not a day goes by I don't
think about being a kid.

597
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:21,806
I don't pay it
much attention.

598
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:24,081
The way I figure it,

599
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:26,414
anyone who doesn't
want to quit this job...

600
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:28,369
isn't doing it right.

601
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,974
<i>My mother'll kill
me if she sees this.</i>

602
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,765
It's a henna tattoo;
It'll come off in a few days.

603
00:26:34,831 --> 00:26:35,769
Looks good.

604
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:37,859
Of course,
I love a girl with tattoos.

605
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:38,738
I've noticed.

606
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:40,347
Can we just get
this over with?

607
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:41,684
Go over there.

608
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:47,334
Could you move around a bit?

609
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:51,860
All right, how about just
walk back and forth?

610
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:54,631
Try a... a little attitude!

611
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,197
A little attitude.

612
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,776
You know, swing the hips,
you know.

613
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,970
Hey, give us something
to dance to.

614
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,067
Kick it up.

615
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:03,399
Swing the pelvis, look.

616
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:06,045
Like you're walking
down the stage.

617
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:07,598
Come on, get the
shoulders going...

618
00:27:07,665 --> 00:27:09,050
Stop it.

619
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:13,631
Huh, the shoulders?

620
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,965
Okay.
Come on, do it.

621
00:27:16,031 --> 00:27:18,081
Okay, only 'cause
it's you, Mickey.

622
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:21,425
Yeah.

623
00:27:30,197 --> 00:27:32,010
This is not what
it looks like.

624
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:33,831
Abby, please turn the music off.

625
00:27:33,898 --> 00:27:35,142
Now, please, off.

626
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,096
I'm so...

627
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:39,264
This is what we were doing, sir:

628
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:40,426
we were working on the Pauls--

629
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,507
We were...

630
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:43,915
We were establishing
a baseline

631
00:27:43,932 --> 00:27:46,347
of henna ink's
optical reflectivity.

632
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,714
You want to know why?

633
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:50,720
Glad you asked.
We're trying to figure out

634
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,458
if the evidence was
planted to frame Paulson.

635
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:54,305
Yeah, like the DNA they found.

636
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:57,334
That could easily have
come from some... uh...

637
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:59,815
Why is he looking
at me like that?

638
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:02,867
He's kind of
a bottom line guy.

639
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,531
Bottom line: the more Mickey

640
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:06,259
told us,
the guiltier Paulson looked.

641
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,105
Until we looked at video
from the bank job.

642
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:11,793
Paulson was identified
by his custom tattoo.

643
00:28:11,887 --> 00:28:13,411
One of a kind,

644
00:28:13,461 --> 00:28:15,697
unique as a fingerprint
and pretty cool.

645
00:28:15,731 --> 00:28:16,980
With the corroborating evidence,

646
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,865
it was more than enough
for a jury to convict.

647
00:28:18,932 --> 00:28:20,187
You think it's a copy?

648
00:28:20,235 --> 00:28:21,631
That's why we were
taking the pictures.

649
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:23,183
It looks like
a henna tattoo.

650
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:26,053
But if Russell Nash had
a copy made to frame Paulson...

651
00:28:26,103 --> 00:28:28,482
- There'd be a color-mismatch.
- Can you prove it?

652
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:29,489
Yeah, but...

653
00:28:29,548 --> 00:28:30,658
I'm gonna have to see Paulson's

654
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,090
original tattoo for the test.

655
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,741
He'll never go for that.

656
00:28:33,773 --> 00:28:35,558
Not unless he believes
you're serious

657
00:28:35,608 --> 00:28:37,159
about reopening his case.

658
00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:38,585
And he won't believe that

659
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:41,655
until you haul in
that bastard, Russell Nash.

660
00:28:41,705 --> 00:28:42,507
We're working on it.

661
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,939
We've got a lead
on that, too.

662
00:28:43,981 --> 00:28:45,613
The FBI has been doing
background checks

663
00:28:45,663 --> 00:28:47,461
on all of
Nash's buddies.

664
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:49,943
Meet Gary Silverstin.

665
00:28:49,993 --> 00:28:51,505
Russell Nash's old roommate.

666
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:53,521
He used to work
at a tattoo shop.

667
00:28:53,585 --> 00:28:55,873
It could just
be a coincidence...

668
00:28:56,873 --> 00:28:58,560
Wow, he hates me.

669
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,097
No, no, no, no, no, no.

670
00:29:00,164 --> 00:29:01,053
Careful, Gary.

671
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:02,697
I told you, stand
five steps back.

672
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,269
Insurance reasons.

673
00:29:04,331 --> 00:29:06,383
You can get insurance
to be a flipper?

674
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:08,619
Human Directional.

675
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:09,857
You're a sign, Gary.

676
00:29:09,907 --> 00:29:11,032
Yeah, I'm the future.

677
00:29:11,097 --> 00:29:11,711
You know what, man?

678
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:13,506
I brought in an
extra ten grand

679
00:29:13,556 --> 00:29:14,992
last month to
Broadbus Burger.

680
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:17,747
In a couple years, this'll
probably be an Olympic sport.

681
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,779
You think you could be
happy flipping a sign all day?

682
00:29:20,922 --> 00:29:21,991
I don't know.

683
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:23,798
I think you'd get bored.

684
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:26,064
You've got to stop
doing that-- stop it!

685
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,273
Am I under arrest?

686
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:29,464
No.
Then, no, man.

687
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:30,856
I work by the hour.

688
00:29:32,763 --> 00:29:34,305
Gary...

689
00:29:34,949 --> 00:29:37,333
I can think of a lot
of ways to arrest you.

690
00:29:37,364 --> 00:29:38,477
A lot of 'em.

691
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:40,498
All right, well, what
else is there to say?

692
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:42,067
Yeah, I worked
at a tat shop.

693
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:43,235
Yes, I lived with Nash.

694
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:44,655
No, I don't know
where he is.

695
00:29:44,705 --> 00:29:46,239
And I don't know nothing
about no bank robbery.

696
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:48,053
That all went down
after he moved out.

697
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:49,253
All right?

698
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:50,747
Sorry, dude.

699
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,959
Good luck in Beijing
in '08, Gary.

700
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,836
I'm just saying,
a man of your drive

701
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:02,187
and ambition needs
a certain kind of...

702
00:30:02,237 --> 00:30:03,538
I'm not staying, Ziva.

703
00:30:03,598 --> 00:30:05,238
That obvious?

704
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:11,257
So, how'd it go?

705
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:13,136
I'll tell you
in 20 seconds.

706
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:15,276
He's already making a call.

707
00:30:15,376 --> 00:30:16,522
Putting it on speaker.

708
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:17,703
NASH
Hey, you got Nash.

709
00:30:17,803 --> 00:30:19,279
Leave me a message
after the beep.

710
00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:20,765
I'd say
that went well.

711
00:30:20,781 --> 00:30:22,435
Hey, Nash, it's Gary S.

712
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:24,521
Now I know you told me
to call you here never, man,

713
00:30:24,571 --> 00:30:25,723
but there was some feds here

714
00:30:25,773 --> 00:30:28,084
and they were asking
questions about that tat.

715
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:29,191
It's a Baltimore prefix.

716
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:32,191
At least I think they were Feds.
I never heard of no N-C-

717
00:30:32,241 --> 00:30:33,865
C-I-S...
Got it.

718
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,132
82 West Pratt Street,

719
00:30:35,182 --> 00:30:36,242
apartment 12.

720
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:38,387
I know it-- 40
miles north of here.

721
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:41,653
Not bad for rush hour.

722
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:44,562
Only you could make it 40
miles in 30 minutes, Boss.

723
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,104
Something's wrong.

724
00:30:46,492 --> 00:30:47,844
Maybe Paulson
beat us here

725
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,315
and found out the
hard way that Nash

726
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:51,273
wasn't willing to
change his testimony.

727
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,812
Stay right where
you are; don't come closer.

728
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:55,008
Yes, all right.

729
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:02,979
It's Nash.

730
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:18,639
The end is
never pleasant.

731
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,333
For this young
man, doubly so.

732
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:23,701
At least he had a great view
on the way down.

733
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:25,155
I doubt that
he enjoyed it,

734
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:27,056
seeing that his
jaw was broken

735
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:28,763
as well as six
of his fingers

736
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:31,020
and his knee.

737
00:31:31,052 --> 00:31:33,587
And all this
before he fell.

738
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:35,034
Killer beat him first.

739
00:31:35,097 --> 00:31:36,985
More like he was
interrogated.

740
00:31:37,016 --> 00:31:38,732
This damage is
too methodical,

741
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,632
too calculated to
be a simple beating.

742
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,799
Whoever did this was
after information.

743
00:31:42,865 --> 00:31:44,932
And when he got it...

744
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:47,848
he repaid his victim
with these.

745
00:31:47,912 --> 00:31:50,034
Guess we can rule out suicide.

746
00:31:50,113 --> 00:31:51,810
Yes, unless Mr. Nash

747
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:53,888
was able to shoot
himself in the back

748
00:31:53,936 --> 00:31:56,002
three times in a row.

749
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:59,181
Ugh...
do we have to do this now?

750
00:31:59,212 --> 00:32:01,302
The slugs are
Winchester hollowpoints.

751
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,524
Winchester hollowpoints.

752
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:05,383
Hey, Gibbs. Gibbs.

753
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,269
Cool, huh?

754
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:09,098
They were fired from the Colt
that Baltimore P.D.

755
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:10,131
found near the scene.

756
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,126
Abs, did you run
the serial number?

757
00:32:12,142 --> 00:32:15,540
It's the same gun that Paulson
took from Mickey Stokes' house.

758
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:17,367
He tried to wipe it,
but I found

759
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:19,066
a partial print.

760
00:32:19,131 --> 00:32:21,799
So the gentleman who asked us
to prove his innocence...

761
00:32:21,865 --> 00:32:24,559
just killed the one man
who could exonerate him.

762
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:26,265
Nash didn't frame Paulson--
they were partners

763
00:32:26,332 --> 00:32:28,132
until Nash double-crossed him.

764
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:31,271
Our ex-Petty Officer
didn't want to clear himself,

765
00:32:31,334 --> 00:32:32,881
he was looking
for the money.

766
00:32:32,924 --> 00:32:36,196
And he used us to take him
straight to the bank.

767
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,446
Smart kid.

768
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:39,134
But if your gut says
Paulson's innocent,

769
00:32:39,184 --> 00:32:40,831
then maybe we're
missing something.

770
00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:43,382
The only thing that I am
missing right now

771
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,004
is happy hour
at Carlos' Cantina.

772
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:18,068
But you're Security, right?

773
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:19,665
Don't let Gibbs leave
the building.

774
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:20,899
I already told you why, Tom!

775
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,298
Abby. Never mind. False alarm.

776
00:33:22,365 --> 00:33:23,632
Gibbs, oh, my God.

777
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:25,231
I was so sure
that you'd be halfway

778
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:26,432
to Mexico by now.

779
00:33:26,498 --> 00:33:27,899
Sorry, you're a flight risk. Abby!

780
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:29,732
We're going to figure
this case out, Gibbs.

781
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,423
We always do!

782
00:33:33,481 --> 00:33:34,355
You already
figured it out.

783
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:35,976
No, but you're going to.

784
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,948
I want to know
how Paulson knows.

785
00:33:37,998 --> 00:33:39,847
Knows what?
Everything.

786
00:33:39,926 --> 00:33:41,992
Everything that we seem to.

787
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:47,265
Russell Nash hid the money
from the bank job somewhere.

788
00:33:47,332 --> 00:33:48,732
Paulson gets to it before us...

789
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,732
He's gone for good.

790
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:50,732
So where is it?

791
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,498
Nash was using
an assumed name.

792
00:33:52,565 --> 00:33:54,497
All transactions
were cash-only.

793
00:33:54,545 --> 00:33:55,332
Money's not in a bank.

794
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:57,231
Storage, maybe.
A third

795
00:33:57,298 --> 00:33:58,465
party could be
holding it.

796
00:33:58,532 --> 00:33:59,665
I'll look at properties
under an alias.

797
00:33:59,732 --> 00:34:01,832
Maybe he hid the money
in a mattress somewhere.

798
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:04,089
Campfire over.

799
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:06,477
Where's Gibbs?
I don't know.

800
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:07,478
Anything wrong?
Uh, well,

801
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:10,363
actually, yeah,
there's quite a lot wrong, Ziva.

802
00:34:10,413 --> 00:34:11,709
Aside from McGee's teeth,

803
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,565
we have a dead man
who shouldn't be dead,

804
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,765
an innocent man who
isn't really innocent

805
00:34:14,832 --> 00:34:16,842
and a trail that's
about to run cold

806
00:34:16,892 --> 00:34:19,165
because our perp has managed
to stay one step ahead of us

807
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:21,179
since this whole thing started!

808
00:34:21,243 --> 00:34:22,996
You're just noticing
that now, DiNozzo?

809
00:34:23,046 --> 00:34:24,771
Oh, no, it's kind
of been a theme.

810
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:29,325
Careful that's, um,
easy to...

811
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,563
...break.

812
00:34:34,725 --> 00:34:36,909
It's a shortwave RF bug.

813
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:37,699
Paulson probably

814
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:40,196
planted it in your Dictaphone
when he stole your car.

815
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,421
And I've been burning
campfires to CD.

816
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,115
The Dictaphone has been in my
lab pretty much the entire day.

817
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:48,104
At least now we know how Paulson
tracked down Russell Nash.

818
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:49,121
There's the little bugger.

819
00:34:49,163 --> 00:34:49,799
Can you backtrack it, Abs?

820
00:34:49,865 --> 00:34:51,398
It's impossible
without a private cipher.

821
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:55,216
But... I think I know
where we can get one.

822
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,131
Paulson's crew bugged the bank's
general manager for two weeks

823
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:03,386
before the robbery-- it was a
custom job, just like this one.

824
00:35:03,465 --> 00:35:04,332
The cops interviewed
the bug-maker.

825
00:35:04,398 --> 00:35:06,358
Cleared him
of any involvement.

826
00:35:06,421 --> 00:35:11,961
I would bet a Caf-POW! that this
came from the same guy.

827
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,550
How can you tell?

828
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:16,403
He signed his name.

829
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,131
<i>"It is a crime for any person</i>

830
00:35:18,198 --> 00:35:19,732
"acting under color of the law

831
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:22,305
to deprive any citizen
of their legal rights."

832
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:24,117
Title Eighteen, U.S. Code.

833
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,390
No one is depriving you
of your rights.

834
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:29,107
We're simply asking for a copy
of the cipher you made.

835
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:30,465
"No one shall be compelled

836
00:35:30,532 --> 00:35:33,188
in any criminal case to be
a witness against himself."

837
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,786
That'd be the Fifth Amendment.

838
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:36,407
And no one has accused you
of a crime, either.

839
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:38,727
Then why'd your goon
confiscate my files?

840
00:35:38,775 --> 00:35:39,632
Goon?!

841
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:41,265
Told you to stop hunching
your shoulders.

842
00:35:41,332 --> 00:35:43,376
How do you know he wasn't
talking about you?

843
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:44,365
It's called
a mirror, McGee.

844
00:35:44,432 --> 00:35:48,121
No, I said every exit,
not every other exit.

845
00:35:48,264 --> 00:35:50,775
For same the reason you don't
floss every other tooth.

846
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:52,539
Where's that cipher,
DiNozzo?

847
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:54,820
We hit
a little snafu, boss.

848
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:55,842
Gibbs.

849
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:57,899
The federal
code also states Yeah.

850
00:35:58,043 --> 00:35:59,584
that not only have the right

851
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:01,498
to remain silent,
but to withhold

852
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:02,866
any information I see fit.

853
00:36:02,882 --> 00:36:04,066
If this keeps up,
we may be forced

854
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:06,506
to unleash Agent Lee.

855
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:14,565
- Now, this should be quick.
- Better be.

856
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:17,850
We got a fugitive on the run
with a pretty big lead.

857
00:36:18,527 --> 00:36:19,849
<i>The Fugitive...</i>

858
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:21,594
You can stare at me
all day, G-man.

859
00:36:21,673 --> 00:36:22,738
I ain't talking.

860
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:24,200
You got something to hide?

861
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:26,374
What, so I refuse to talk
and that means I'm guilty?

862
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,198
<i>You ever heard of
Miranda v.Arizona, 1966?</i>

863
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:30,498
And here, all this time,
how could

864
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:33,093
I have missed it?
It's that simple.

865
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:34,561
Missed what?

866
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,596
Gibbs is clearly
Tommy Lee Jones.

867
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:38,201
Right, I mean there's
no argument there.

868
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:41,141
Which makes me Joey Pants;
initially, I was a little...

869
00:36:41,227 --> 00:36:42,190
What happened?

870
00:36:42,222 --> 00:36:45,349
We've been avoiding the word
fugitive for the last two days.

871
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:47,646
He made the connection himself. Oh.

872
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:49,267
The bottom line, Eyeballs,

873
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:52,176
I run a lawfully
licensed spy shop.

874
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,729
I'm not responsible
for what my clientele does

875
00:36:54,774 --> 00:36:55,510
with my product.

876
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,326
I don't have to
answer any more

877
00:36:58,432 --> 00:37:01,366
of your questions,
no matter what you say.

878
00:37:12,203 --> 00:37:14,167
I got this little girl...

879
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,577
who wants to go home to her dad.

880
00:37:18,891 --> 00:37:21,581
And that's not going to happen
without your help.

881
00:37:26,664 --> 00:37:27,646
So...

882
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,719
please.

883
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,302
Did Gibbs just say...?

884
00:37:35,402 --> 00:37:36,187
Mm-hmm.

885
00:37:41,514 --> 00:37:45,356
What-What did you, uh, what'd
you want to know, again?

886
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,469
Signal's
strong, no movement.

887
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:53,218
Got eyes on the
target, Ziva?

888
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:55,554
I did; suspect's in the
house and he's not alone.

889
00:37:55,605 --> 00:37:56,724
You sure?

890
00:37:56,876 --> 00:37:58,351
I heard Paulson's voice.

891
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:11,741
Let me give you some
more money, in case you need it.

892
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:12,545
I won't.

893
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:13,661
In position, boss.

894
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:16,859
Then here, take this.

895
00:38:16,899 --> 00:38:17,932
Gun.
Move, move.

896
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:19,165
Please, just take it.

897
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:21,734
Hold it!

898
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:23,289
Hold it!

899
00:38:27,821 --> 00:38:30,054
Don't do it, Derrick;
we will shoot you.

900
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,505
Tony, McGee,
put your weapons down.

901
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:44,618
I was wrong.

902
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:48,413
I know you're innocent,
Petty Officer.

903
00:38:52,465 --> 00:38:53,861
But you're not, Mickey.

904
00:38:53,886 --> 00:38:54,726
DiNozzo.

905
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:56,665
You're under arrest for the murders of Russell Nash,

906
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:59,549
his two accomplices in the
Greater Virginia Bank robbery.

907
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,837
And last but
not least

908
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:02,878
the Greater Virginia
Bank robbery.

909
00:39:02,928 --> 00:39:04,652
Is your porch light on?

910
00:39:04,702 --> 00:39:07,235
First, you wrongly accuse
Derrick and now me.

911
00:39:07,265 --> 00:39:08,900
We also found the
bug you planted

912
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,701
in our forensic tech's lab.

913
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:12,824
We were almost as
surprised as you look now,

914
00:39:12,874 --> 00:39:14,102
when the guy
you bought it from

915
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:17,046
pointed you out in that
photo, instead of Paulson.

916
00:39:17,332 --> 00:39:19,732
This is ridiculous.

917
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,098
Do I look like
I got five million bucks

918
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:24,540
laying around?!

919
00:39:24,604 --> 00:39:26,344
If he set me up,
where's the money?

920
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,623
They don't know what they're
talkin' about.

921
00:39:29,174 --> 00:39:30,397
It's here.

922
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:33,473
It's been here
the whole time.

923
00:39:34,093 --> 00:39:36,238
It's a Rosewood Bureau
Plat desk,

924
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,680
19th century. That's 38 thousand dollars

925
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:41,021
First edition of Huckleberry Finn

926
00:39:41,036 --> 00:39:42,117
20,000 dollars

927
00:39:42,742 --> 00:39:46,791
Looks like in the bedroom,
You've got a Chipendale-Mahogany case clock

928
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:48,836
That's six fingers easy !

929
00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:51,498
Mcgee, you don't collect all these stuff on a Navy pension.

930
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:53,324
Wow! wow!

931
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:56,062
Agent Gibbs.

932
00:39:56,531 --> 00:39:58,244
Don't talk to me, I think he should shoot you.

933
00:40:04,955 --> 00:40:06,186
Except he's never been a killer.

934
00:40:10,454 --> 00:40:11,604
And I don't think you're gonna start now.

935
00:40:20,161 --> 00:40:23,409
And miss his trial? Not for the world...

936
00:40:25,304 --> 00:40:26,982
You're a real piece of work, McGee.

937
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:34,996
Antiques roadshow.

938
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:45,894
I just came by to tell you that Derrick Pauleson has been cleared of all charges.

939
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,625
- You saved that boy's life.
-Yeah boss *****

940
00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:52,316
Don't sell yourself short.

941
00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:56,545
- Or is it too late for that?
-There's supposed to be some sort of pep* dog,

942
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:57,853
came here to stay Jen?

943
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:06,477
You don't want me back.

944
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:09,206
No I don't.

945
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:12,340
Or you won't be able to handle me, Director?

946
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:13,923
No Jethro.

947
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:17,253
I'm afraid you won't able to handle yourself.

948
00:41:20,115 --> 00:41:21,700
You've already been in two comas.

949
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:24,222
You might not come out of a third.

950
00:41:25,629 --> 00:41:26,754
The fact is you're good.

951
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:28,790
The best.

952
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:32,930
When you're as good, it's something as you are when you

953
00:41:33,078 --> 00:41:35,690
can make a difference like you can you just don't quit.

954
00:41:52,764 --> 00:41:54,854
You know, you used to be a nice person, McGee.

955
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:57,267
I think sitting at Tony's desk is affecting your personality.

956
00:41:57,512 --> 00:42:00,248
For the better, mcGee picked up a girl all by himself.

957
00:42:00,288 --> 00:42:02,931
- Yeah, at a funeral.
-You didn't tell me that.

958
00:42:03,017 --> 00:42:04,324
Well, you were right.

959
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:06,236
Because when women are vulnerable,

960
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,363
Get right in there.

961
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:28,153
What?

962
