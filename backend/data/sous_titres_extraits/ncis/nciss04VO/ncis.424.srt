1
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:11,126
Welcome home, Director.

2
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:12,754
How was the Interpol conference?

3
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:16,228
Fine. Full of Euro cops
trying to hook up with me.

4
00:00:16,477 --> 00:00:17,971
And, no, I didn't.

5
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:19,397
Oh, I wasn't wondering if...

6
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:22,533
I would if I were you.
Now, get in, Cynthia.

7
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,635
Is the agency still intact after
a week with Gibbs in charge?

8
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:34,280
We survived.

9
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:36,484
Did Gibbs?

10
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:38,043
Barely.

11
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:18,266
<i>Cleared customs see ya soo...</i>

17
00:02:10,182 --> 00:02:13,115
- Welcome home, señora.
- Thank you, Noemi.

18
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:15,165
You hungry, señora?

19
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,028
No, I ate on the plane.

20
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:19,238
I fix your favorite paella.

21
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:23,632
- Very well. I'll have a little.
- Okay.

22
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,834
- Will there be anything else, Director?
- No.

23
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,999
Take Cynthia home.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,130
She's going to argue, but it's silly
for her to go back to the office now.

25
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:40,778
Understood.

26
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,789
What time tomorrow, Director?

27
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,037
05:30, Melvin.
I want to get an early start.

28
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:47,682
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:50,595
Noemi, I'll eat in the study.

30
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:52,905
Si, señora.

31
00:03:02,736 --> 00:03:06,277
My father has been dead since '95.

32
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:08,904
He stood

33
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:12,966
where you stand
three weeks ago.

34
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,718
Noemi!

35
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,965
Si, señora?

36
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,506
Who's been in my study?

37
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:25,343
No one, señora.

38
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:30,025
Obviously someone.

39
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:34,019
You no do that?

40
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,191
I no do that.

41
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,043
Maybe before you leave?

42
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,332
I've been gone for five days.
Didn't you clean in here?

43
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,520
Si, señora.

44
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,065
I... I no see.

45
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:50,894
I'm sorry, señora.

46
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:54,845
It's nothing, Noemi.
Don't worry about it.

47
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,198
Okay, I know this looks a little weird,

48
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,536
but I couldn't get my hands on a real
polygraph machine, so I made one.

49
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:10,885
Name.

50
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,481
Name! Tell me your name!

51
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:16,334
Stop acting like a Nazi. Come over here.
Scratch my nose, please.

52
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:18,265
Right side, right side.

53
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:20,211
Ow! God, not so hard!

54
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:22,942
McGee, stop being such a baby.
Name.

55
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,677
Timothy McGee...
no middle initial.

56
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:27,803
Have you ever used an alias?

57
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,019
Does a nom de plume count?

58
00:04:30,606 --> 00:04:31,612
It does.

59
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:33,284
Thom E. Gemcity.

60
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:34,527
Any other names?

61
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:36,440
No.

62
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,273
- No?
- No.

63
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:42,847
Okay, either you or my polygraph is
lying. And since this is a machine and

64
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:44,742
- it can't lie...
- HAL lied through his chips.

65
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,523
I thought the expression was
"to lie through your teeth. "

66
00:04:47,524 --> 00:04:50,481
HAL, the computer. 2001?
Sci-fi classic?

67
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:52,647
How can a six-year-old movie be a classic?

68
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:54,953
The film that was made in 1968.

69
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:57,184
2001 : A Space Odyssey directed
by Stanley Kubrick.

70
00:04:57,185 --> 00:04:58,862
How long do you have to
be in this country...

71
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:01,253
I'm trying to prep McGee
for his polygraph on Monday.

72
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:02,714
Really?

73
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:06,994
Well, unless you're a spy, McGeek,
the thought of which is utterly ludicrous.

74
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:08,273
What's the sweat?

75
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,582
He panics taking tests.

76
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:12,563
It's not uncommon.

77
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:15,085
Started in kindergarten.
Couldn't change his answer.

78
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:17,842
- Hard to erase crayon.
- Tony, it's not funny.

79
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:21,973
Retaining my Special Agent status
is dependent on passing this polygraph.

80
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:24,255
Oh, this is definitely a lie.

81
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:26,516
- What'd you ask him?
- His name.

82
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:27,996
You lied about your name?

83
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,306
No.

84
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:31,204
Timothy McGee is my legal name.

85
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,558
Thom E. Gemcity is my pen name.
I don't have any other names.

86
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:36,136
- Probie.
- Yeah, boss.

87
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:39,066
And Elf Lord.
Two other names.

88
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,314
Why are you torturing McGee?

89
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:44,215
I am not torturing, McGee.
I am prepping him.

90
00:05:44,216 --> 00:05:46,645
He has his CPS polygraph on Monday.

91
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,875
- Who ordered that?
- Homeland Security.

92
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:52,611
All NCIS agents must take it,
directors included.

93
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,175
Check your e-mails.

94
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:58,403
Monday, 09:00.

95
00:05:58,404 --> 00:06:00,423
Tuesday, 13:00.

96
00:06:00,424 --> 00:06:02,074
Boss, what time is your...?

97
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:12,876
You ever seen the Angel of Death,
Dr. Benoit?

98
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,830
Skeleton, hooded black robe, scythe.

99
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,438
I am not kidding, Doctor.

100
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:20,486
Carly.

101
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:23,937
Not a skeleton with a grass-cutter.
That's for kids on Halloween.

102
00:06:23,938 --> 00:06:27,260
Although, if he wanted to
he could appear as a skeleton.

103
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,616
I take it you've seen him?

104
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:32,318
Once, when my Uncle Luis died.

105
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:34,870
What did he look like?

106
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,448
Miss Puerto Rico.

107
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:39,617
What are you talking about?
You can't keep me here.

108
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:41,587
You want to walk, walk.

109
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:43,864
I can't with this leg iron on.

110
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:45,240
I want a cast.

111
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:46,885
After surgery.

112
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:49,032
Wait a minute...

113
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:51,632
Wait a minute, are they...
are they going to knock me out?

114
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:53,125
Oh, I hope not.

115
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:55,494
Where's my backpack?

116
00:06:57,031 --> 00:06:59,699
Where's my bag?
I want my backpack.

117
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:05,467
Sorry to stick you
with this one, Doctor.

118
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:06,794
No problem, Annie.

119
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:10,139
Dr. Jessup wants him
in monkey bars till he can operate.

120
00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:17,564
Three MGs of Versed,
two of morphine, 15 minutes ago.

121
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:19,507
And he's still amped up?

122
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:22,345
I think the boy had more
on board than ER put in him.

123
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:24,556
Patti said he wouldn't
let them take blood.

124
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:27,173
And it was a fight
just to get the leg X-rayed.

125
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:29,230
Hey, where's my phone?!
Someone stole my phone!

126
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:30,573
You didn't come in with one, Devon.

127
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:32,612
No, I had a cell phone!
I was texting on it when...

128
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:35,492
When you stepped in front
of a cab at Dulles.

129
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:39,028
I'm Dr. Benoit, Devon.
Give me a minute.

130
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:50,808
You're hypertensive and tachycardiac.

131
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:52,390
What's that?

132
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,304
Not good.

133
00:07:56,095 --> 00:07:58,802
Have you taken any drugs
we don't know about?

134
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,430
We're not the police, Devon.

135
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:05,003
Our only concern is your well-being.

136
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:08,813
I want...
I want to call my sister.

137
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:12,660
There's a phone in your room.

138
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:17,878
What do you think, Doctor?

139
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:21,061
Keep your eye out for Miss Puerto Rico.

140
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:46,044
Visiting your ex-wife?

141
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,706
Waiting for you.

142
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:49,518
How'd you know I'd be here?

143
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,613
Friday night. Old weekend.

144
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,351
<i>Hold on, Emily.</i>

145
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:55,641
Hi, Daddy!

146
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:57,810
Hey, Em. Be there in a minute.

147
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:04,238
Diane look that pissed at you
after the divorce?

148
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:06,375
She's looking at me, Tobias.

149
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,981
Ever think of picking up a phone?

150
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:11,727
Hard lines are tapped.

151
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:13,915
Cell calls snatched right out of the air.

152
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,498
Turning into a conspiracy nut, Jethro.
What's next?

153
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:18,009
Alien abductions?

154
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,552
Only if you don't answer my question.

155
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:21,475
- Why the polygraphs?
- No.

156
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:25,352
- Do you still dream about O.J.-ing Diane?
- Nah,

157
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,391
Emily kind of likes her. You?

158
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:31,675
Only when I think about my
grandfather's railroad watch.

159
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:33,472
Beautiful chimes.

160
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:35,351
FBI being polygraphed?

161
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,824
No. And before you run
through the alphabet soup.

162
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:40,477
This net is being cast
strictly over NCIS.

163
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:42,148
Who's doing the fishing?

164
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,411
Obviously, someone who thinks
there's a security risk at NCIS.

165
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:47,969
CIA.

166
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:50,604
Who are they after, Tobias?

167
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:54,471
Your boss.

168
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:24,054
Señor Gibbs.

169
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:26,046
Director home?

170
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,489
I'm in here.

171
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:37,340
In polite society,
one usually calls before a visit.

172
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:38,502
Bourbon?

173
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:40,952
I kicked in too many doors
to be polite. Yeah.

174
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:45,316
I appreciate the restraint
you showed by using the bell.

175
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:49,914
I've been rather fond of that
door since I was a child.

176
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:53,489
You could have waited to report
till Monday, Jethro.

177
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:56,344
That's not why I'm here.

178
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:58,356
You lost your protection detail in Paris.

179
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,998
You went missing for 21 hours.
Where were you?

180
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,243
You sound like a jealous husband.

181
00:11:04,244 --> 00:11:05,501
How would you know?

182
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:08,052
Do you want this or not?

183
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:15,025
Don't... touch that!

184
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:16,720
It's Scotch.

185
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:18,855
You drink bourbon.

186
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:21,058
So you.

187
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:27,230
I had another visitor
before you arrived...

188
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:29,815
unannounced.

189
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:31,796
Did he duck out the back?

190
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:36,545
Now you do sound like a jealous husband.

191
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:40,068
You go off grid for 21 hours...

192
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,063
and we're being polygraphed
for a security breach.

193
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:47,763
Drink your bourbon and
say good night, Gracie.

194
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:51,598
What were you doing
for 21 hours, Jenny?

195
00:11:51,996 --> 00:11:53,788
What we used to do.

196
00:11:54,257 --> 00:11:55,852
Ever so well.

197
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:01,108
When you're lying,
your right eye twitches.

198
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:04,011
It always has.

199
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,995
You know, constitutionally,

200
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:14,207
you can refuse to take a polygraph.

201
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,953
I'd have to turn in my badge.

202
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:18,342
True, but you don't
have to take the test.

203
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:20,060
Hey, I have an idea.

204
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:23,853
Why don't we get Ducky to tell
the examiners that Tim is just way

205
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:25,525
too stressed out to take the test?

206
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:28,126
Ducky's a medical examiner,
he's not a psychiatrist.

207
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:31,397
- But he does psychological profiles.
- Of serial killers.

208
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:35,288
That's good I'll go from Federal Agent
to serial killer in one day.

209
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:36,754
It was just a thought.

210
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:39,707
Here you go.

211
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:42,242
Thanks. Great bartender.

212
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:44,767
- You can beat a polygraph.
- No, you can't.

213
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:47,125
I've done it, Abby.
It's part of Mossad training.

214
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:49,280
- All you have to do...
- Oh, hello!

215
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:51,787
- If it's unethical, I can't hear it!
- Well, don't listen.

216
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:53,041
Fine.

217
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:54,653
Go ahead...

218
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:56,432
May we join you?

219
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:58,946
- Hey, Ducky, here take my chair.
- No, no, no, no, Timothy.

220
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:00,697
At a bar, I prefer to stand.

221
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:01,698
Me, too.

222
00:13:01,855 --> 00:13:05,055
Macallan neat.
Mineral water on the side. No ice.

223
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:08,361
I'll take a, uh, chocolate martini.

224
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:10,102
Just kidding.

225
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:12,200
Uh, make that a Green Fairy Mojito.

226
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:13,201
<i>You got it.</i>

227
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:17,308
Why is everybody so dour?
It's TGIF and the happy hour!

228
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:20,807
Homeland Security's ordering us
to take a polygraph.

229
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:23,309
That's rather odd.
But there's nothing to worry about.

230
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,380
Unless... you're a spy.

231
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:28,806
Why are you looking at me?!

232
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,113
I'm trying to lighten
the atmosphere with a little humor.

233
00:13:32,114 --> 00:13:34,473
I don't think they expect you
to be funny, Doctor.

234
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:37,552
- That didn't come out right.
- No, I should say not.

235
00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:40,141
I mean I don't think they
expect a Scotsman to be funny.

236
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:42,224
Stop digging, Jimmy.

237
00:13:42,244 --> 00:13:43,591
You've almost reached China.

238
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:46,008
Yeah, a round for my friends on me.

239
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:48,989
Dispelling two misconceptions
about Scotsmen in one night.

240
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,803
Does anyone know where the rest rooms are?

241
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:51,903
- I do!
- Okay.

242
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:54,967
One moment!
First... a toast!

243
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,602
- Please, God, make it quick.
- Amen.

244
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,620
May the best you've ever seen
be the worst you'll ever see.

245
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:03,305
May a mouse never leave your girnal
with a teardrop in his eye.

246
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:06,774
May you stay hale and hearty
until you're old enough to die.

247
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:09,661
May you always be as happy
as we wish you all to be.

248
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:11,187
Guys, I'm sorry I gotta go.

249
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:12,209
Uh, me, too.

250
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,530
- Great toast, Ducky.
- Uh... thank you.

251
00:14:15,531 --> 00:14:16,689
Terrific.

252
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,049
Really good, Doctor.

253
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:23,450
May a mouse never leave your girdle
with a teardrop in his eye.

254
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:26,611
Not girdle, girnal. It's an oat bin.

255
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:29,769
If it was empty, a mouse would cry.

256
00:14:30,747 --> 00:14:33,361
To dry-eyed mice.

257
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:35,132
Yeah, yeah.

258
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:39,512
Stupid bastard.

259
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:42,949
I don't think that Dee meant
to get hit by a...

260
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,916
Why didn't you push it?

261
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:57,367
It was lit.

262
00:14:58,685 --> 00:15:00,229
I'd have pushed it anyway.

263
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:02,210
And why is that?

264
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:03,720
To watch it light up.

265
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:17,618
Why don't you get her some help?
ER's on one.

266
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,603
You talking to me?

267
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:25,704
Yeah, I'm talking to you, Bobby.

268
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:29,235
- His name is Nick.
- Shut up, Bernie.

269
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,925
But he thinks that your name is Bobby.

270
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:34,412
- Don't you?
- No.

271
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:38,529
He thinks his name is Bobby. Don't you?

272
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,769
You don't think your
name is Bobby, do you, Nick?

273
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,984
Shut up. Can't you see he's a cop?

274
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:48,644
Hey, ER said Devon Watson was up here.

275
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:50,689
He called his sister to pick him up.

276
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,370
I'm his sister.

277
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:55,139
He hasn't gone into surgery.

278
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,143
Surgery? For a broken leg?

279
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:00,681
It's a severe compound fracture.

280
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:02,159
Put a splint on it.

281
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:05,440
Is there a problem here, Carly?

282
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:08,131
I don't know.
Do we have a problem?

283
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,278
No problem.

284
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:14,314
My girl's worried about
her brother, that's all.

285
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:15,461
Wants to see him.

286
00:16:15,998 --> 00:16:17,425
Yeah, can I see Dee?

287
00:16:17,753 --> 00:16:19,456
That's up to Dr. Benoit.

288
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,167
- I need this stat.
- Sure.

289
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:26,367
This is Mr. Watson's sister, Dr. Benoit.

290
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:30,226
Bernadette.
But everybody calls me Bernie.

291
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:33,300
And you are?

292
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:34,315
A friend.

293
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:36,003
Have a name...

294
00:16:36,725 --> 00:16:37,880
friend?

295
00:16:38,642 --> 00:16:39,755
Nick.

296
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,902
He thinks his name is Bobby.

297
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:48,180
Room 331.
Ten minutes.

298
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:50,025
I wanted to be a doctor.

299
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:51,134
Um, but my dad...

300
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,611
She doesn't want to hear
about your life history, Bernie.

301
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:57,880
<i>- I told you to keep your trap shut.
- Sorry.</i>

302
00:16:57,881 --> 00:17:01,000
I didn't think doctors
cleaned out urinals.

303
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:02,829
We draw the line at bedpans.

304
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,863
Want to take a 15 minute break with me?

305
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,381
We'll be in the cafeteria, Carly.

306
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:09,567
Okay, Doctor.

307
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:12,269
And clock that ten minutes.

308
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:22,169
What's with you calling
that loser Bobby?

309
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,505
Well, he was doing DeNiro in the elevator.

310
00:17:24,506 --> 00:17:26,723
You know, like, you talkin' to me?

311
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:28,149
You talkin' to me?!

312
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,434
So I called him Bobby.

313
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:31,947
Sometimes you are so juvenile.

314
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:34,039
Yes, but it makes me loveable.

315
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:37,220
You don't look so good, Dee.

316
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:40,130
I don't feel so good, Bernie.

317
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:42,394
- Does it hurt?
- Shut up, Bernie.

318
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:44,694
You got to get out of here.

319
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:46,355
Man, they won't let me out.

320
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,026
They can't keep you.
All you got to do is sign a release.

321
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,072
What... what about my leg?

322
00:17:51,073 --> 00:17:52,382
We'll fix it later.

323
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,457
I can't walk.

324
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:58,625
That's why they make the chairs with
those, you know, things that go round.

325
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:00,085
Oh, wheelchairs!

326
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:02,302
I'm really scared, man.

327
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:04,919
I'm feeling really cold, Nick.

328
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,073
I think I might be leaking.

329
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:10,319
Be cool, Dee, be cool.
You're not leaking.

330
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,884
Don't let me die here, man.

331
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:13,708
You're not going to die, honey.

332
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,304
I got to tell somebody.
I've got to tell somebody.

333
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:17,446
No, no... You're not going to tell
anybody nothing!

334
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:20,636
Stop! Stop it, Nick!
You're killing him!

335
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:22,079
Shut up.

336
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:27,623
I hope this stops by morning.

337
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,114
I want you to see the house in sunshine.

338
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:32,469
It leaks.

339
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,215
No, it doesn't leak.

340
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,859
It has bats.

341
00:18:35,994 --> 00:18:39,181
Bats don't come out in the sunshine.
I hate bats... ever since I saw Dracula.

342
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:41,295
You're chickening out on me, aren't you?

343
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,697
After you promised?

344
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,087
Did I say Scout's honor?

345
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:50,672
Wow, you drive a hard bargain. Okay.

346
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:54,129
Yes, I want to see the house.

347
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,499
Just as long as seeing doesn't
necessarily mean buying.

348
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,733
No, of course it doesn't.

349
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:04,641
I just want you to give it
some serious consideration.

350
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:09,271
You can count on that.
Especially after last night.

351
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:11,536
I think that, uh, you deserve...

352
00:19:11,537 --> 00:19:13,999
I'm sorry, that was
you last night, right?

353
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,442
With the mask and the strange headgear?

354
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,369
Code blue.

355
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:22,898
Code blue.

356
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,760
Hang in there, Devon. You're going
to be okay. Got the pulse ox.

357
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:32,765
- What do we have?
- Blood pressure 80/40. Heart 150.

358
00:19:32,766 --> 00:19:34,660
- Don't need that drug panel now.
- Where's the crash cart?

359
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:36,999
- Coming in.
- Carly and I have him.

360
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:39,326
Annie, two milligram Naloxone I.V. push.

361
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:41,396
Got it. Two milligrams I.V. push.

362
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:42,924
Lungs are clear.

363
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:45,827
Pupils are pinpoint and un-reactive.

364
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:48,955
B.P. 75/35,
Heart rate 160.

365
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:50,458
<i>EKG leads.</i>

366
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:54,049
<i>Okay, lift him on three.</i>

367
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,961
<i>B.P. 65/35.
Heart rate's 175.</i>

368
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:03,990
EKG leads in place.
He's in V-tach.

369
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:05,618
How'd he go sour so fast?

370
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:08,363
He flew in from Caracas three hours ago.

371
00:20:08,364 --> 00:20:10,752
He's probably body-packing heroin.
The bags must have burst.

372
00:20:10,753 --> 00:20:12,544
We've got V-fib.
He's stopped breathing.

373
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,752
Damn.

374
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:15,948
Start bagging him.
Charge to 360.

375
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,170
Still in V-fib. Should I give him
an amp of epi?

376
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:20,049
Not till we shock him.

377
00:20:23,344 --> 00:20:26,801
Still in V-fib.
No pressure, no pulse.

378
00:20:47,822 --> 00:20:50,314
I'm sorry, Ms. Watson.

379
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,847
- Me, too.
- Where's he taking him?

380
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:55,079
Hospital morgue.

381
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:57,846
We pick him up there?

382
00:20:57,847 --> 00:20:59,902
No, you do not pick him up there.

383
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:04,174
Sign it, Bernie.

384
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,821
How's Carly?

385
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:11,809
Not bad considering
she saw the Angel of Death.

386
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:14,562
What did this one look like?

387
00:21:14,563 --> 00:21:16,039
Shirley Temple.

388
00:21:17,096 --> 00:21:19,232
I don't like losing patients.

389
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:22,461
If your brother had told us
he was body-packing drugs,

390
00:21:22,462 --> 00:21:24,153
we might have saved him.

391
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:27,757
Or if you had told us.

392
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:32,070
I don't know what's in Dee's gut, Doc.

393
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:36,173
And neither do you.

394
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:37,895
Now...

395
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,692
where do we pick up his body?

396
00:21:41,974 --> 00:21:45,372
City morgue after he's been autopsied.

397
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:47,504
We don't need an autopsy.

398
00:21:48,326 --> 00:21:49,398
I do.

399
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:55,625
Come on, we got to get out of here.

400
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,677
Suck it up, Bernie!

401
00:22:00,963 --> 00:22:02,711
You got to get me somethin', Nick.

402
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:04,476
I'm gettin' too shaky to walk.

403
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:06,971
Pharmacy downstairs. I'll get
cough syrup with codeine.

404
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:08,775
That ain't gonna help much.

405
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:10,412
Never pimp a junkie.

406
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:13,486
- I ain't a junkie!
- Then walk out of here!

407
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:23,697
He knew Devon was body-packing
and said nothing.

408
00:22:23,698 --> 00:22:25,745
Well, he didn't want
to lose his shipment.

409
00:22:26,634 --> 00:22:28,380
That makes him an accessory.

410
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,770
Yeah? How could you prove that, Jeanne?

411
00:22:30,771 --> 00:22:32,967
I don't know, but I can't
just let him walk out of here.

412
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:35,856
Dr. Benoit, you don't want
to get involved.

413
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:38,276
I am involved, Annie.
That boy didn't have to die.

414
00:22:38,277 --> 00:22:40,555
No, but that is not your fault.

415
00:22:40,556 --> 00:22:43,422
Jeanne, the coroner's
going to do an autopsy.

416
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:46,426
He's going to find the
drugs, notify narcotics.

417
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:48,215
What more can you do than that?

418
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:52,203
I don't know.

419
00:22:56,987 --> 00:22:58,464
I feel so damn helpless!

420
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:03,779
They're all like that the first year.
At least the good ones.

421
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,132
It takes a little while to get calluses.

422
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:08,880
I don't know if Jeanne ever will, Annie.

423
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:12,359
Love.

424
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,331
- You pushed the wrong button!
- Sorry.

425
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:26,514
What are you doing down here?

426
00:23:27,403 --> 00:23:28,746
Pushed the wrong button.

427
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,835
- Morgue down here?
- Why?

428
00:23:35,095 --> 00:23:37,762
Bernie might want to take
a last look at her brother.

429
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:39,743
Morgue's closed.

430
00:23:40,783 --> 00:23:43,036
There's no one down here, anyway.

431
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,015
Her brother's here.

432
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,870
I don't think that's funny.

433
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:57,890
Hey, boss, what's up?

434
00:23:57,891 --> 00:23:59,736
There's a letter on your desk.

435
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:01,148
Sign it.

436
00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:11,600
- What is it?
- Just sign it, Tim.

437
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:18,693
It's a get out of jail free card.

438
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:31,907
Boss, why would I need such a card?

439
00:24:31,908 --> 00:24:35,568
Because you're going to hack into the CIA.

440
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:44,075
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

441
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,096
Okay, I know you guys have been
working really hard lately,

442
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:51,845
and I promised that
you could have the weekend off,

443
00:24:51,846 --> 00:24:54,166
but this sounds like an emergency,

444
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:57,640
so I need everybody
to get those electrons flowing!

445
00:24:58,093 --> 00:25:00,946
If anybody is not up to it,
I need to know now,

446
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,766
not when the Director arrives.

447
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:05,679
Something's wrong.

448
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:23,814
Ready.

449
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:29,424
Thanks for coming in
on such short notice, Abby.

450
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:33,403
Neither rain, nor snow,
nor sleet, nor hail

451
00:25:33,404 --> 00:25:36,325
will keep this scientist
from her appointed rounds.

452
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,349
Nice.

453
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,291
You've adopted what
the post office has forgotten.

454
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,930
Did you climb the Eiffel Tower?

455
00:25:43,484 --> 00:25:44,608
No.

456
00:25:44,994 --> 00:25:46,190
No?

457
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:49,727
How can you be in Paris
and not climb the Eiffel Tower?!

458
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:56,424
I want to know
whose fingerprints are on these.

459
00:25:56,994 --> 00:25:59,161
Chain of evidence is not important.

460
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:02,684
I'll be in my office.

461
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:13,727
Boss, you were right.

462
00:26:13,728 --> 00:26:17,043
The order to polygraph
came from Homeland Security's

463
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:19,922
Assistant Director for
Infrastructure Protection.

464
00:26:20,302 --> 00:26:21,728
But it didn't originate from there.

465
00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:25,958
I traced into his IMAP account using
an encryption algorithm developed...

466
00:26:26,183 --> 00:26:28,174
You're not really interested
in how I did this, are you?

467
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:29,601
Nope, I'm not.

468
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,451
Okay, well, the order went from Homeland
Security to China, then Kurdistan.

469
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:37,352
It went through a secondary server
in India to the island of Cypress.

470
00:26:37,353 --> 00:26:39,473
Then through Puerto Rico.

471
00:26:39,825 --> 00:26:42,880
Where it followed a bank line
back to D.C. and...

472
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:43,954
CIA.

473
00:26:43,955 --> 00:26:46,292
Specifically, their National
Clandestine Service.

474
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:49,535
It went in and out of a maze of incoming
and outgoing Black Op chatter.

475
00:26:49,536 --> 00:26:51,834
All encrypted. That's where I lost it.

476
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:54,772
But I found it again.

477
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,067
It's part of a Black Op.

478
00:26:57,068 --> 00:26:58,562
It's code-named Lodestone.

479
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:03,262
Running out of the CIA section for
Weapons Control and Arms Proliferation.

480
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,763
The Frog.

481
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:23,177
Who do I have to thank for this?

482
00:27:23,553 --> 00:27:26,323
A former FBI agent.

483
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:28,920
You're very resourceful, Kort.

484
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:30,279
I try.

485
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,714
So you've recorded their conversations?

486
00:27:32,914 --> 00:27:33,919
No.

487
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,150
No? Why?

488
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,574
You didn't want to intrude
on their privacy?

489
00:27:39,694 --> 00:27:41,977
I didn't think it was necessary.

490
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:43,789
No? Why was that?

491
00:27:44,645 --> 00:27:47,230
I only needed photos for leverage.

492
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:50,785
- This DiNozzo is married?
- No.

493
00:27:51,357 --> 00:27:53,768
Then how did you intend to gain leverage?

494
00:27:58,084 --> 00:27:59,947
You intend to harm her?

495
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:01,911
Only threaten.

496
00:28:06,321 --> 00:28:07,529
He loves her?

497
00:28:08,335 --> 00:28:09,409
DiNozzo...

498
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:11,272
he's a player.

499
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,770
Never with a skirt
more than a few weeks.

500
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,506
That's too bad.

501
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,578
A man in love could be persuaded...

502
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:23,780
to do almost anything.

503
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:25,777
DiNozzo's a white hat.

504
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,278
He won't want to see her harmed.

505
00:28:29,363 --> 00:28:31,332
Have you not noticed, Kort?

506
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:36,840
I like white hats.

507
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:42,513
<i>Shirley Temple looked
through the door...</i>

508
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:45,268
Shirley Temple?
I didn't say Shirley Temple.

509
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,148
Who is Shirley Temple?

510
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:50,370
A child star from the 1930s
with curly blonde hair.

511
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:51,461
Well, you saw him.

512
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:53,996
If you say he looked like Shirley Temple,
he looked like Shirley Temple.

513
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:55,728
I didn't see him, Carly.

514
00:28:55,729 --> 00:28:58,464
The Angel was standing
right behind you.

515
00:28:58,465 --> 00:28:59,971
Your Angel of Death...

516
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,852
wandered away from her mother in ICU.

517
00:29:02,863 --> 00:29:05,665
They flew in from Paris to see
their grandfather who stroked.

518
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:08,032
Security's been searching
the hospital for an hour.

519
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,723
If you see the Angel of Death again,
her name is Sarah.

520
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:14,921
It's just a lost little girl, Carly.

521
00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:17,468
If you say so, Doctor.

522
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,926
All right, well, I will
see you in the morning.

523
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,684
- I gotta go.
- I'll be out at 7:00.

524
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:28,108
And if you see a hooded skeleton, duck.

525
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:30,504
Dr. Benoit.

526
00:29:30,944 --> 00:29:33,776
That addict and her pimp were down
in the basement asking about the morgue.

527
00:29:33,777 --> 00:29:34,925
You didn't let them stay there?

528
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:37,204
Of course not. I made them return
with me to the ground floor.

529
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:38,413
They leave the hospital?

530
00:29:38,414 --> 00:29:39,605
They went into the pharmacy.

531
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:41,062
I had to return the gurney to the ER,

532
00:29:41,063 --> 00:29:43,364
but I got a feeling
they're going to try again.

533
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:44,470
Thanks, Bill.

534
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:47,947
Annie, call Security.
Ask them to meet me in the morgue.

535
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:51,829
Miss me already?

536
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:56,716
Our grieving couple may be in the morgue.

537
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:00,307
Damn.

538
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:02,093
They never make it easy.

539
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,414
He's not in the cabinet, Bernie.

540
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:17,821
I drank the cough syrup
and it ain't doing nothing.

541
00:30:17,822 --> 00:30:19,398
No drugs in a morgue, dummy.

542
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:21,829
You want a fix...
find your brother.

543
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,370
Nick.

544
00:30:35,512 --> 00:30:36,747
Hi ya, Dee.

545
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:43,368
Hey!

546
00:30:44,808 --> 00:30:45,808
Jeanne.

547
00:30:58,871 --> 00:31:00,219
He's still warm.

548
00:31:03,827 --> 00:31:07,021
That's 'cause he hasn't had time to cool.
Have you, Dee?

549
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:10,462
Jeanne, slow down.

550
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:13,443
Is it...?

551
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:15,255
Jeanne, hey.

552
00:31:15,526 --> 00:31:18,130
You trying to get yourself killed?
He's at least got a knife in there.

553
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:20,479
I will not let him butcher
her brother in front of her.

554
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,572
Keep your voice down.

555
00:31:21,573 --> 00:31:23,845
Those drugs are in
25 feet of intestines.

556
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:25,836
He doesn't know where to cut.

557
00:31:25,837 --> 00:31:27,933
He'll make a gory mess she'll
never get out of her head.

558
00:31:27,934 --> 00:31:29,494
Get behind me.

559
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,448
- Why?
- Because I tell you to.

560
00:31:38,993 --> 00:31:41,762
Haven't got a weapon on you
by any chance, have you?

561
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,856
I have a funny feeling, Doctor.

562
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:54,998
It's the tequila, my dear.

563
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:58,410
You've had three shooters
just in the time I've been here.

564
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:02,150
Straight to voice mail.
Just like always when he's with her.

565
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:05,066
- Tony?
- What?

566
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,750
Nothing.

567
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:08,938
Oh, no, no, no.

568
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:11,047
That look was definitely something.

569
00:32:11,048 --> 00:32:13,373
Well, why do you monitor Tony?

570
00:32:13,374 --> 00:32:14,937
I don't monitor Tony.

571
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:18,400
Oh, yes, you do, my dear,
like a mother with her toddler.

572
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,502
That's a good description.

573
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:25,128
Or a woman with a wayward lover.

574
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:26,661
Ducky...

575
00:32:27,164 --> 00:32:29,682
do not profile me...
I'm not a killer.

576
00:32:30,152 --> 00:32:34,688
Correction... I have killed before,
but never feloniously.

577
00:32:35,007 --> 00:32:36,903
Ziva, it's Friday night.

578
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:42,477
Tony is with his girlfriend
and you are worried about him.

579
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:45,914
What does that tell you?

580
00:32:46,377 --> 00:32:47,693
He is my partner.

581
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,304
And my partner said he would be here.

582
00:32:50,466 --> 00:32:51,675
And...

583
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:56,319
and I have this...

584
00:32:57,426 --> 00:32:59,088
not so good feeling.

585
00:33:08,692 --> 00:33:09,986
I didn't find nothing.

586
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:12,939
The way you're shaking,
you couldn't find a shotgun.

587
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:14,818
Let's see...

588
00:33:25,911 --> 00:33:27,942
You called Security, Doc?

589
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,617
Of course you did.
Call 'em off.

590
00:33:32,951 --> 00:33:34,831
I said call 'em off.

591
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:38,008
You haven't done anything
that can't be forgotten.

592
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:41,804
- Do what he says, Jeanne.
- Why?

593
00:33:42,391 --> 00:33:45,161
They can leave now, and we'll
forget this ever happened.

594
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,698
Would you do that?

595
00:33:48,857 --> 00:33:50,065
Yes.

596
00:33:52,532 --> 00:33:53,808
Tony...

597
00:33:58,082 --> 00:33:59,593
Will you forget now?

598
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,856
That's what I thought.

599
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,558
Call off Security.

600
00:34:19,138 --> 00:34:20,616
Put it on the speaker.

601
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,823
Security. Jackson.

602
00:34:26,376 --> 00:34:28,524
This is Dr. Benoit in the morgue.

603
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,882
<i>Oh, sorry, Doctor.
I'll have a man there in a minute.</i>

604
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:33,014
<i>We're just stretched thin
looking for that little girl.</i>

605
00:34:33,015 --> 00:34:34,694
You can recall him.

606
00:34:34,912 --> 00:34:36,221
It was a false alarm.

607
00:34:36,222 --> 00:34:39,401
<i>Okay. Can I have your
hospital I.D. number please?</i>

608
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,499
766.

609
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,553
<i>Thank you, Dr. Benoit.</i>

610
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:50,353
Is a little girl lost?

611
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:53,315
More than one.

612
00:34:55,732 --> 00:34:57,377
Surgery first, Doc.

613
00:34:58,535 --> 00:34:59,558
No.

614
00:34:59,944 --> 00:35:01,069
No?

615
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,663
I help him first.

616
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:06,616
You're a slow learner, Doc.

617
00:35:06,617 --> 00:35:08,782
I called off Security.

618
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:11,600
I help him, then...

619
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,363
I help you.

620
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:18,213
If that's not good enough, shoot me.

621
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,123
Don't hurt her, Nick.

622
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,769
Tony? Tony?

623
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,128
Can you sit up?

624
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:36,515
No, I'm up.

625
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:40,517
Someone is looking at me.

626
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,902
- It's the cleaning crew.
- No, on the computer.

627
00:35:43,903 --> 00:35:46,169
I got to shut down my UPD port.

628
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:50,887
I don't think it penetrated my firewall.

629
00:35:50,888 --> 00:35:53,297
- What the hell is it?
- It's a botagent.

630
00:35:53,298 --> 00:35:55,076
It's probably one of the CIA's.

631
00:35:55,077 --> 00:35:57,076
Botagent...
short for robotic agent.

632
00:35:57,077 --> 00:36:00,038
Designed to crawl the Internet
looking for snoopers like us.

633
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,827
- This for real?
- Oh, yeah, boss.

634
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:05,176
If this had penetrated my firewall,
it could have downloaded my hard drive.

635
00:36:05,177 --> 00:36:07,844
The CIA would have all our data,
and know we were onto Lodestone.

636
00:36:07,845 --> 00:36:10,229
- Can you kill it?
- No, though I could build

637
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,821
a mirror to my firewall, so that when
it looks in, it could just see itself.

638
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:16,693
- How long?
- Too long.

639
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,772
Or I could use another computer.

640
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:22,389
Boss, just one thing...

641
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,332
There's always just one thing, McGee.

642
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:28,553
A really smart botagent
won't just sit on my computer.

643
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:31,507
It'll look for my search
patterns on the Internet.

644
00:36:31,508 --> 00:36:33,937
This is like tracking a dirtbag, McGee.

645
00:36:33,955 --> 00:36:37,168
You stake out his house.
You put out a BOLO.

646
00:36:37,169 --> 00:36:39,368
Keep tabs on the girl.

647
00:36:40,078 --> 00:36:41,818
Never thought of it that way.

648
00:36:42,036 --> 00:36:43,453
Start a new search.

649
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:44,772
Okay.

650
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,424
- What am I looking for?
- The girlfriend...

651
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:48,867
Jenny Shepard.

652
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:53,901
When you look at me like that, McGee,

653
00:36:54,304 --> 00:36:57,610
I get this overwhelming urge
to head slap you.

654
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:13,094
I am going to get...

655
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:15,303
a ding...

656
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:17,460
now!

657
00:37:20,332 --> 00:37:23,214
You guys are doing this
because it's the weekend.

658
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:26,711
And you think if you just stall,
then I'll give up

659
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:31,331
and I'll finish the search on Monday,
but that is not going to happen.

660
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:33,053
Abby...

661
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:34,933
you worry me.

662
00:37:35,957 --> 00:37:39,582
Oh, they know I'm just, you know,
talking to them to pass the time.

663
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:43,457
Because at this point, the fingerprint
match is totally up to AFIS.

664
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:44,996
Right, guys?

665
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:46,657
Right, guys?

666
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,705
I'm just joshing you, Director.

667
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:50,685
I spoiled your Friday night.

668
00:37:51,088 --> 00:37:54,724
Oh, you know, I was just
hanging at the bar.

669
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:58,082
And I probably would have been completely
passed out by now if I'd stayed.

670
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,575
Joshing me again?

671
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:00,952
No.

672
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:03,211
Yes.

673
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:08,043
- How many prints?
- Two sets.

674
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,917
He poured with his left hand
and held the glass with his right.

675
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:14,230
Left-handed?
Or ambidextrous.

676
00:38:14,231 --> 00:38:16,329
I can pour with either hand.

677
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,108
I can tell you he's not military.

678
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:21,381
AFIS would have gotten a match
on anyone on active duty by now.

679
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,774
What if he was retired?

680
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:24,148
Covered them, too.

681
00:38:24,149 --> 00:38:25,628
Dead?

682
00:38:26,026 --> 00:38:27,424
Dead?

683
00:38:27,774 --> 00:38:29,505
You said this wasn't a case.

684
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,116
It's not.

685
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:36,672
I want you to expand the search to include
servicemen alive prior to '95.

686
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:40,896
Okay.

687
00:38:45,931 --> 00:38:47,837
I don't see any signs of concussion.

688
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:49,838
I've been hit harder by my sister.

689
00:38:50,586 --> 00:38:51,773
You don't have a sister.

690
00:38:51,774 --> 00:38:53,059
I don't?

691
00:38:53,646 --> 00:38:55,218
Nick...

692
00:38:56,242 --> 00:38:58,188
Enough playing, Doctor.

693
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:02,525
Do it.
I don't want you to get hurt.

694
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:03,584
Let's go.

695
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:15,651
Half K of pure horse in here, Doc.

696
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,127
I'm no surgeon.

697
00:39:17,128 --> 00:39:19,440
I'm not asking you to save a life, Doc.

698
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:21,956
Maybe I am.

699
00:39:21,957 --> 00:39:23,786
Come on, come on, come on!

700
00:39:23,787 --> 00:39:25,816
Quit stalling. He doesn't have AIDS.

701
00:39:25,817 --> 00:39:28,143
That's not what the mask's for.

702
00:39:28,545 --> 00:39:30,274
What's it for?

703
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,982
Turn around, Bernie.

704
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:34,761
Please hurry.

705
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,213
Why the mask?

706
00:39:37,214 --> 00:39:39,828
Tell her to turn around.

707
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:40,986
Do it, Bernie.

708
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,762
The mask is to protect me
from disease spread

709
00:39:44,763 --> 00:39:47,749
by airborne particles released
when I open him up.

710
00:39:56,965 --> 00:39:58,296
No more stalling.

711
00:40:15,315 --> 00:40:17,212
Devon died bringing this to you.

712
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:18,974
Want it?

713
00:40:18,975 --> 00:40:20,807
What the hell do you think?

714
00:40:26,473 --> 00:40:27,564
Bitch!

715
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,434
Next one's in your ear.

716
00:40:38,384 --> 00:40:39,782
Drop it.

717
00:40:43,722 --> 00:40:44,722
You okay?

718
00:40:46,432 --> 00:40:47,506
Not really.

719
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,169
Oh, God.

720
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:20,564
Who's this?

721
00:41:21,404 --> 00:41:24,911
It's uh, Director's father...
Colonel Jasper Shepard.

722
00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:28,213
You don't know him?

723
00:41:29,596 --> 00:41:31,284
She never talked family.

724
00:41:31,285 --> 00:41:32,781
It's like you.

725
00:41:35,978 --> 00:41:37,623
She has his eyes.

726
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,335
He still alive?

727
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:44,849
Deceased.

728
00:41:46,722 --> 00:41:48,016
Suicide,

729
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,686
12 years ago.

730
00:42:12,288 --> 00:42:13,975
- There she goes.
- Who?

731
00:42:14,277 --> 00:42:15,350
Sarah.

732
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:18,233
Security found her sleeping
in the delivery room.

733
00:42:27,976 --> 00:42:31,154
You should be under
observation for 24 hours.

734
00:42:31,657 --> 00:42:33,486
Whatever doctor orders.

735
00:42:37,413 --> 00:42:38,413
What's this?

736
00:42:39,797 --> 00:42:41,165
My secret.

737
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:46,229
<i>Bonjour, Papa.</i>

738
00:42:47,618 --> 00:42:48,994
<i>Bonjour, ma fille.</i>

739
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:54,382
So this must be Anthony DiNardo.

740
00:42:58,393 --> 00:43:00,141
Welcome to the family,

741
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:02,289
Professeur.
