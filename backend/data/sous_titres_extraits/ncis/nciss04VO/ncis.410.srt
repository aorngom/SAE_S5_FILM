1
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:03,799
Check that eyebolt.

2
00:00:03,938 --> 00:00:06,010
- Just let that... on.
- Secure eyebolt.

3
00:00:06,346 --> 00:00:08,870
All right, get ready, ladies.
Put your backs into it.

4
00:00:09,394 --> 00:00:11,978
Come on, I used to do this
when I was your age by myself.

5
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,142
- Sure, you did, boss.
- Yeah, right.

6
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:14,197
See these pythons?

7
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:18,074
I could lift a 400-pound
load back in the day, huh?

8
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,511
I even remember her
name: Lisa Scarpizzee.

9
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:23,491
Yeah, well she was a hell
of a woman though, huh?

10
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:25,966
All right, let's move
this thing out of here.

11
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:27,535
I've got a furnace waiting to go in.

12
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,390
Push her out, guys. Come on, here we go.

13
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:31,551
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

14
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:32,960
Hey, Manny?

15
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:33,730
Yeah?

16
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:36,552
Looks like a partial
obstruction in the smokestack.

17
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:38,279
Yeah, I see it from up here, boss.

18
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:39,501
Probably carbon buildup.

19
00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:40,814
All right, clean it out.

20
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:41,692
Doing that now.

21
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,280
Anybody that doesn't want to make an ash

22
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:44,630
of themselves, step back.

23
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,735
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:50,067
Hold it up, Manny.

25
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:52,139
We've got more than just
carbon coming down here.

26
00:00:52,248 --> 00:00:52,740
Copy that.

Finish McGee's book yet?

33
00:01:51,062 --> 00:01:51,776
Halfway.

34
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:52,350
You?

35
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,909
I'm on... chapter seven, 

36
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,505
page 103.

37
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:01,720
"Maybe someday

38
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:04,589
"Lisa would find the
courage to tell agent Tommy

39
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:07,270
"about her dream, the two
of them together, their

40
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,016
"bodies covered in sweat
as they made love on

41
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:12,249
the crystal white
sands of her homeland."

42
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,558
I'm gonna kill him.

43
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,024
- Kill who?
- McGee.

44
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:16,186
Have you read this book?

45
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:18,314
Apparently McGee thinks
Ziva's in love with me.

46
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:20,550
There's a reason they
call it fiction, DiNozzo.

47
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:22,993
Boss, just got a call from dispatch.

48
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:24,550
Construction crew found a dead body.

49
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,178
Where?

50
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,220
Chesty Puller High School in Quantico.

51
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:28,298
Student?

52
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:30,445
Uh...not sure.

53
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:32,005
Take the truck, I'll meet you there.

54
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:41,009
How many times do I have to tell you...

55
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,423
it's not about you guys.

56
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:46,075
I'm driving.

57
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:50,699
Comfortable back there, Gore Vidal?

58
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,707
<i>For the last time, Deep Six is fiction.</i>

59
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:56,182
Fiction based on us, yes?

60
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,222
No.

61
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:58,863
Look, if you don't believe me, 

62
00:02:58,864 --> 00:03:00,585
read the disclaimer in
the front of the book.

63
00:03:01,302 --> 00:03:02,746
You buying that, Lisa?

64
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,051
Didn't think so.

65
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:07,062
Nice knowing you, Probie.

66
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,075
Ziva...

67
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,487
It's just a book!

68
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,076
You know, in chapter eight

69
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:20,295
of McGee's book, your character does

70
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:22,044
the exact same thing to Agent Tommy.

71
00:03:22,574 --> 00:03:25,125
Turns out she has this whole
secret photo album of him.

72
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,413
Fascinating, Tony, 

73
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,752
but I wasn't taking a picture of you.

74
00:03:28,434 --> 00:03:29,685
More interested in the wildlife.

75
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:32,072
Ugh!

76
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:35,040
We've pulled rats, cats

77
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,307
and birds out of chimneys
before, Agent Gibbs.

78
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:40,142
Hell, one time even a St. Bernard, 

79
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,529
but this is my first mummy.

80
00:03:43,988 --> 00:03:45,371
Reminds me of that urban legend.

81
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:47,051
Which one is that?

82
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:48,743
Guy dresses up like Santa, 

83
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,073
you know, for Christmas Eve
to surprise his girlfriend, 

84
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,564
but he never shows.

85
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:54,825
She's convinced that
the bastard dumped her, 

86
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:56,669
badmouths him all over town.

87
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:59,239
Until they find the poor soul's body

88
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,883
months later still
clutching the little box

89
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:05,283
with her shiny new engagement ring.

90
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:07,626
And the moral of course is...

91
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:09,678
"It's never a good idea to get married."

92
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,328
No."It's best not to judge someone
until all the facts are in."

93
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:14,990
I like mine better.

94
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:17,875
Any of your crew touch
or move Kriss Kringle?

95
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:20,167
No. Most of 'em were halfway to Manassas

96
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,558
before the dust even settled.

97
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:23,276
There's no I.D. on him.

98
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:24,652
Judging by what's left of the mullet, 

99
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:26,370
I think it's safe to say
he wasn't in the military.

100
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:27,633
You think, DiNozzo?

101
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:28,460
Hey, ...

102
00:04:29,256 --> 00:04:30,424
I need a TOD, Doctor.

103
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:33,563
Considering we've been working
together for over ten years, 

104
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,893
I am well aware of that, Agent Gibbs.

105
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:37,687
DiNozzo, when he gets one, run it through

106
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:39,569
Missing Persons over
the same time period.

107
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:40,825
Where are you going, boss?

108
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,390
To the roof, to figure out

109
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:43,970
how he ended up there
in the first place.

110
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:45,801
What happened to you?

111
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,287
Uh, creative differences
with my coworkers, boss.

112
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:51,039
A lot of that going around these days.

113
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:54,203
Don't you think it's about time
you and Gibbs made up, Ducky?

114
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:55,295
Made up?

115
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:57,314
I wasn't aware we were fighting, Ziva.

116
00:04:57,655 --> 00:04:59,113
Come on. Ever since he retired...

117
00:04:59,114 --> 00:05:01,766
Gibbs didn't retire, he quit.

118
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:04,955
Okay, so he quit, but he's back now.

119
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:07,209
You need to cut the
man some slacks, Ducky.

120
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:09,779
I agree. Except the term is "slack."

121
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,019
Judging by the decay and
the condition of his skin, 

122
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,356
I'd tentatively place
the time of death at...

123
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:17,370
two to four months ago.

124
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:18,488
Works for me.

125
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:22,271
Time of death was two
to four months ago, boss!

126
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,952
Bag and tag the ashes, Probie.

127
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,775
We'll pick you up after
we coordinate with the MPs.

128
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:31,856
Doctor, I'm going to be
laying the bag out here

129
00:05:31,857 --> 00:05:32,608
and...

130
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:35,292
the burrito over here.

131
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,689
Palmer, I need a favor.

132
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:41,134
You want to ride back with us.

133
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:42,510
How'd you know?

134
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,228
I read your book.

135
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:45,768
And for your information, 

136
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,878
I've never had sexual
relations with a corpse.

137
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:49,937
That character was not based on you.

138
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:52,620
His name was Pimmy Jalmer, McGee.

139
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:55,075
He's French Polynesian.

140
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:57,266
Doctor, I'm going to get the gurney now.

141
00:05:58,523 --> 00:05:59,603
It was only a dream.

142
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:03,350
Come on. Haven't you
ever heard of symbolism?

143
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:07,013
The life of an artist
is never easy, McGee.

144
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:09,842
They'll all get over it, eventually.

145
00:06:11,623 --> 00:06:12,481
Thanks, Ducky.

146
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:15,860
By the way, do you know if
Tony has finished it yet?

147
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:17,540
Not yet.

148
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:19,876
Well, him I'd watch out for.

149
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,669
None of the local missing person reports

150
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,750
match our John Doe's description, Tony.

151
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:29,942
And there's no record
of anyone going missing

152
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:30,744
on base, 

153
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:34,053
civilian or military, 
during that period.

154
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:36,365
Are you even listening to me?

155
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:38,752
I'm getting close to the end, Ziva.

156
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:43,494
You know, McGee is really
starting to nail your essence here.

157
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:45,060
"Stakeouts...

158
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,435
"long, endless hours

159
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:49,520
"fueled by cheap food

160
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:51,805
"and even cheaper coffee.

161
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:56,566
"But tonight, Mossad Officer
Lisa didn't seem to mind, 

162
00:06:57,431 --> 00:06:59,067
"because she was getting to
spend it with Agent Tom...

163
00:06:59,212 --> 00:06:59,894
"Agent Tom..."

164
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:02,231
You're behind me again, aren't you?

165
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:03,579
Lucky Guess. 

166
00:07:05,268 --> 00:07:06,411
You know, I think McGee's right.

167
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:08,047
He was, was he?

168
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:11,690
It takes almost all of my willpower

169
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:14,090
to resist the urges I have
when I'm around you, Tony.

170
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:16,105
Maybe...

171
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:18,953
it's about time I just...

172
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,043
give in, yes?

173
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,511
And by "give in, " you mean...?

174
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:25,820
-Letting loose.
-Ah...

175
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,416
Doing what comes naturally to me.

176
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:29,430
Yeah, I thought I was
picking up that vibe

177
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:31,090
the first time we went
undercover together.

178
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:32,348
You were?

179
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,485
In fact, I almost did it

180
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:36,635
the first night in the hotel room.

181
00:07:36,787 --> 00:07:37,898
Hmm. Really?

182
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:40,147
But my father wouldn't approve.

183
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:41,750
Because I'm not Jewish.

184
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:44,365
Because he gets very
angry when I kill...

185
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:45,603
a co-worker.

186
00:07:46,986 --> 00:07:48,943
Like I believed you for even a second.

187
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:51,166
I'm sure you didn't.

188
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:53,768
You two done playing grabass?

189
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:55,050
Oh, he started it.

190
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:56,136
I'm ending it.

191
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:57,140
Oh, I...

192
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:59,209
Next person who mentions this book

193
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,482
will be deep-sixed by me.

194
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,313
I can completely live with that, boss.

195
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:04,771
My point exactly, DiNozzo.

196
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:05,934
You I.D. our victim yet?

197
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,947
We're running him against
missing person cases

198
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:10,058
reported over the last six months, Gibbs.

199
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:11,005
No hits yet.

200
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,531
Um, I'm afraid that's my fault.

201
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,482
It seems...

202
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:17,932
my initial time of death

203
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:20,049
wasn't completely accurate.

204
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:21,405
As you will see, 

205
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:23,900
his body is almost perfectly preserved.

206
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:27,070
Perfectly preserved for a rotted corpse, 

207
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:27,853
that is.

208
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:29,634
Guy looks like a piece
of beef jerky, Duck.

209
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:32,356
Gum tissue rots faster than the...

210
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:33,960
outer flesh, 

211
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:36,808
due to the high degree of
bacteria inside the mouth.

212
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:39,265
As you can see, his gums...

213
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:40,881
are almost intact.

214
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:42,971
Maybe he was just a good flosser.

215
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:45,346
Shutting it, boss.

216
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:46,849
How'd he die?

217
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:48,693
Well, the "how" I'm still working on.

218
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:50,492
It's made particularly difficult

219
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:52,602
by the means by which
his body was preserved.

220
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,477
He was quite literally smoked

221
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:55,841
inside that chimney.

222
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:56,550
Smoked?

223
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,500
Yeah, like a fine cut of meat.

224
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,041
So he really is a beef jerky.

225
00:09:00,262 --> 00:09:02,736
In a manner of speaking, yes, Tony.

226
00:09:02,737 --> 00:09:04,884
It's also the reason
why my time of death

227
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:05,914
was so far off.

228
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:07,808
More than two to four months, Ducky?

229
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:09,190
It would seem so.

230
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:09,829
How many?

231
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:11,282
I would say

232
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:13,997
we're looking at closer to five or six.

233
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:16,005
Don't be so rough on yourself, Doctor.

234
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:17,767
We're already running
the past six months.

235
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,188
Not months....

236
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:21,240
years.

237
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:25,888
Abby, they hate me.

238
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,492
They don't hate you, McGee.

239
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:29,589
Ziva tried to kill me yesterday.

240
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:30,530
Well...

241
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,117
you did base all the
characters in your book on us

242
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,885
and didn't ask our permission.

243
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:38,329
<i>Deep Six is a work of pure fiction.</i>

244
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:42,890
You described everything in my bedroom.

245
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:44,069
Not everything.

246
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:46,197
You still have those...

247
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:48,149
Fantasize later, Hemingway.

248
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,140
I got a match on two of
Old Smokey's fingerprints.

249
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:54,571
-Whoa!
-What's wrong?

250
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:56,699
The match file is restricted.

251
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:57,792
I can't access it.

252
00:09:57,855 --> 00:09:58,630
That's not possible.

253
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,550
NCIS has top-level clearance.

254
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:02,130
Duh, McGee.I work here, too.

255
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:03,886
Can you tell who's blocking it?

256
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:04,624
I could...

257
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:07,283
if they weren't in the process of
deleting the file from the server.

258
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:08,647
What the hell is this?

259
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,828
I was wondering that myself.

260
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,457
We got two matching fingerprints

261
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,617
from the victim and
AFIS just kicked us out.

262
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:15,063
And now they're deleting the file.

263
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:15,682
How?

264
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,078
Working on it, boss.

265
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:18,922
It looks like some agency

266
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:20,582
doesn't want us to
know who the mummy is, 

267
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,227
Gibbs

268
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:32,682
Inbound G-Five from Ibiza, Spain.

269
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:33,622
Tango-Eight, 

270
00:10:33,623 --> 00:10:35,214
I want every bag coming off

271
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:37,640
that plane tagged with a GPS marker.

272
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:38,694
Eagle Six, 

273
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:40,367
remain in over-watch.

274
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:43,020
Tango-Eight is on his own, 
unless I clear you for backup.

275
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:43,777
Solid Copy, 

276
00:10:43,992 --> 00:10:45,962
Eagle Six remaining
in over-watch position.

277
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:54,487
Bring up Tango-Eight's
feed on the big screen.

278
00:11:05,506 --> 00:11:06,069
Hey, there.

279
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,016
How y'all doing?

280
00:11:07,822 --> 00:11:08,800
Toss 'em down, bro.

281
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:12,863
Ooh.

282
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:13,856
Louis Vuitton.

283
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:17,778
Y'all aren't too friendly, are you?

284
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:29,835
This is Eagle Six.

285
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:30,979
Cabin crew are exiting.

286
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:32,122
Tango-Eight, 

287
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:34,467
La Grenouille's people
are about to deplane.

288
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:46,888
The smile was for me, dear boy.

289
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:48,940
There's more luggage.

290
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:51,433
Yes, sir.

291
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:00,070
Good flight?

292
00:12:02,074 --> 00:12:03,542
Very nice, Kort, very nice.

293
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,830
Martin, where's he been keeping you?

294
00:12:05,846 --> 00:12:06,864
The African market.

295
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:08,063
Cape Town, mostly.

296
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:09,224
- Not bad.
- Good.

297
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:13,610
I need to see the passengers.

298
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,961
We've arranged a meeting.

299
00:12:15,427 --> 00:12:16,414
Things are going well.

300
00:12:17,544 --> 00:12:18,902
Isolate and freeze frame.

301
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,033
How long have you been here?

302
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:40,125
Well, long enough to put
your luggage in the trunk.

303
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:42,697
How long have you been working the line?

304
00:12:42,698 --> 00:12:43,889
I haven't seen you before.

305
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:44,868
Oh...

306
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:46,532
about five months, ...

307
00:12:46,855 --> 00:12:48,654
I'd say.You know, part-time.Weekends, 

308
00:12:48,655 --> 00:12:49,617
nights, that sort of thing.

309
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,513
Can you keep your
eyes off her next time?

310
00:12:58,184 --> 00:12:58,895
Probably not.

311
00:13:01,838 --> 00:13:02,999
An honest man.

312
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,344
Thank you, sir.

313
00:13:10,744 --> 00:13:13,996
Eagle Six, confirm four GPS markers.

314
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:16,940
Eagle Six. Four GPS markers confirmed.

315
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:18,770
Signals are long and strong.

316
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:21,570
Bravo Zulu, Tango-Eight.

317
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:22,738
Bravo...

318
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:24,307
Two hours.

319
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:26,004
Gibbs is going to murder me.

320
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,057
How long's Tony been doing errands

321
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:34,899
for the director?

322
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,138
Pretty much since you retired.

323
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:38,589
She trusts him.

324
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:40,325
To do what?

325
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:42,881
You'd have to ask Tony that.

326
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:44,334
Gibbs! Gibbs! Gibbs!

327
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:45,556
I did it!

328
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,977
Well, you mean "we."

329
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:48,925
There is no "we" in McGee.

330
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:50,487
I traced the connection back

331
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:52,294
to the system that deleted
the fingerprint match.

332
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:54,187
It's a government server
in Arlington, Virginia.

333
00:13:54,203 --> 00:13:56,445
Routed into AFIS directly at the source.

334
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,638
Our mystery hacker is... The FBI.

335
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:01,802
Uh, yeah. Sounds a little
anticlimactic when you say it.

336
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,079
How did you know that?

337
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:04,800
I'm looking at 'em.

338
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:09,849
You've got something
that belongs to me, Gibbs.

339
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,698
Petri dish, Mr. Palmer.

340
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:16,264
There's something weird in
this young man's stomach.

341
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,306
Is that...

342
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,145
is that what I think it is?

343
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:22,639
A distal interphlangeal joint.

344
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:24,508
A human toe.

345
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,189
He was a cannibal, Ducky...

346
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:27,728
and a serial killer.

347
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:32,312
I've been hunting this
bastard for 12 years, Gibbs.

348
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:33,322
What's his name?

349
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:37,400
You don't know.

350
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:40,461
We know the prints you ran through AFIS

351
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,640
matched two of the prints
from his crime scenes.

352
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:44,185
Fourteen kills...

353
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:45,582
all women...

354
00:14:46,306 --> 00:14:46,914
drugged, 

355
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,474
strangled, left to rot near
rural, interstate highways.

356
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:52,912
Every one of them missing
the toes on their left foot.

357
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:54,853
They were gnawed off.

358
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,726
How'd he die?

359
00:14:57,884 --> 00:14:59,209
Well, we're still working on that.

360
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:00,187
I can tell you when.

361
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,373
66 months ago.

362
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:03,940
Five-and-a-half
years.

363
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,307
That's a pretty accurate guess.

364
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:06,767
It wasn't a guess.

365
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:08,795
It was the last time he killed.

366
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,888
You want to know why I
restricted access to his prints.

367
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:17,537
For starters.

368
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:19,659
We didn't want local LEOs

369
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,132
trying to bring him down on their own.

370
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:23,289
That sounds like the FBI.

371
00:15:23,392 --> 00:15:24,976
Well, this guy was a ghost, Jethro.

372
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:27,974
Fourteen murders, all
we ever got from him

373
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:30,070
was two partials and a
single strand of hair.

374
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:31,786
We never even got close.

375
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,752
I am more interested
in what he was doing

376
00:15:33,753 --> 00:15:35,528
on my Marine base, Tobias.

377
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,493
As soon as I find out, 
you'll be the first to know.

378
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:40,176
We got a deal?

379
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:44,657
I'll have my M.E. swing
by and pick up the body.

380
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:48,239
After I find out who
he is and how he died.

381
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:51,080
I've spent 12 years
working on this case.

382
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:52,808
Well, then waiting a few extra days

383
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:53,826
shouldn't be a problem.

384
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:57,100
Is there anything else I can do for you

385
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:58,607
while you're grinding the knife in?

386
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:00,224
I'm gonna need a sample of that hair

387
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:01,755
and copies of your files.

388
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,476
A few bottles of bourbon
would be a nice gesture.

389
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:06,394
What do I get, besides a headache?

390
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:08,312
Tobias, I am going to show you

391
00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:10,074
what your serial killer looks like.

392
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:11,250
I've been rehydrating

393
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:12,946
Smokey the Bear's head since yesterday.

394
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:14,604
It makes it easier for identification.

395
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,681
And I've uploaded every
local missing person's sketch

396
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:19,417
and photo into the comparison fields

397
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:20,829
since the killings stopped.

398
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:23,029
As soon as the rendering
algorithm is complete, 

399
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,940
we should have a
fairly accurate likeness

400
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:26,952
of what Slim Jim looked
like when he was still alive.

401
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:28,474
As long as the quadrant system

402
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:30,274
and scales are within the
program's proscribed...

403
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:30,793
McGee...

404
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:33,059
less talk, more of the
the computer chip doo-da.

405
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,567
Making with the doo-da, boss.

406
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:37,099
"Doo-da"?

407
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,173
Yeah, it's a technical term, Tobias.

408
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:40,372
You wouldn't understand.

409
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:42,953
Pretty cute for a serial
- killing cannibal.

410
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:48,831
Well, I've got an 86%
match on a Charles Bright, 

411
00:16:49,154 --> 00:16:50,542
reported missing from Dale City, 

412
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,121
five years, seven months ago.

413
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:53,902
Our profiler was convinced

414
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:55,844
he'd have at least one
body buried near his home.

415
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:56,349
Why?

416
00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:58,228
Something for him to gloat over, Ab.

417
00:16:58,236 --> 00:17:00,334
Relive the rush anytime he wanted to.

418
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:01,802
That's good, Gibbs.

419
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,301
We need an address.

420
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,081
*
Do-do-do, do-do-do *

421
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:08,640
* Do-da. * *
Do-da. * * Do-da. *

422
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,348
That address still good?

423
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,340
Uh, wife still lives there.

424
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:15,308
Karen Bright, 

425
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:16,900
she's the one who reported him missing.

426
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:18,259
There you go, Fornell.

427
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:21,077
You're turning the case over?

428
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,484
No. I just want you to get
my search warrant for me.

429
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:32,499
I do miss you. I do.

430
00:17:35,986 --> 00:17:36,657
Stop.

431
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:40,170
No, no.

432
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,304
What's wrong with this picture?

433
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:43,079
Besides being late over two hours?

434
00:17:43,316 --> 00:17:45,850
Why is the spawn of the
FBI sitting at my desk?

435
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,295
Warrant just came in via the FBI.

436
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:50,170
I made sure NCIS was a co-server.

437
00:17:50,189 --> 00:17:51,230
Warrant for what, Lee?

438
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,784
The serial killer's home.

439
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,852
It covers the grounds and residence.

440
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:56,950
Serial killer? I only
missed like two hours...

441
00:17:57,265 --> 00:17:59,665
Snooze you lose, DiNozzo. Grab your gear.

442
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:00,958
I already have my gear.

443
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,440
Fill you in on the way. Let's go.

444
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:03,862
Today, DiNozzo!

445
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,450
Geez.

446
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:09,340
What do we tell her?

447
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:11,460
The truth, we found her husband.

448
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:15,003
And the whole serial-killing
cannibalism thing?

449
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:18,987
Not until we have to.

450
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:22,939
Hi. Your mom home?

451
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:24,715
Who is it, Amy?

452
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:27,169
It's the police, Mom.

453
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,299
Mrs. Bright, I'm...

454
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,198
He's FBI Agent Fornell, 

455
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:39,051
I'm NCIS Special Agent Gibbs.

456
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:45,300
You, you found him, didn't you?

457
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:46,519
You found my husband Charlie?

458
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,399
His body was discovered
yesterday in Quantico.

459
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,300
It was an accident, wasn't it?

460
00:18:52,658 --> 00:18:54,535
He was a building inspector.

461
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:57,329
The cause of death
is still undetermined.

462
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,648
He would have never abandoned us.

463
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,636
Everyone else thought it, 

464
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:03,143
but I always knew it couldn't be true.

465
00:19:06,672 --> 00:19:07,856
They found Daddy.

466
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:09,829
They finally found him.

467
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:18,901
I'm sorry about that, Jethro.

468
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:21,845
She could have been a twin
to some of his victims.

469
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:23,462
The loving husband, 

470
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:25,995
murdering and eating women
who look like his wife.

471
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,891
It'll probably be
McGee's next bestseller.

472
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,202
It amazes me how the truly sick ones

473
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,418
are always the best liked

474
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:34,082
pillars of the community.

475
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:36,749
They're successful because
they blend in, Tobias.

476
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,855
They go to church, they
coach Little League baseball.

477
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:41,160
I was on the team that
nailed Bundy, Gibbs.

478
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,431
And I'm familiar with
sick, charming bastards.

479
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:46,027
That's probably why
we get along so well.

480
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,234
Oh, I found something, boss!

481
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:58,243
Found some bones fragments.

482
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:14,022
Our serial killer spent
the last five years

483
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:15,488
getting smoked and tenderized

484
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:17,118
in the Puller High School chimney, 

485
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,501
only to fall out during the installation

486
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:20,580
of the new furnace.

487
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,485
I want to know how he
ended up that way, DiNozzo.

488
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:25,577
Boss, he was a building
inspector for the D.O.D.

489
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:27,872
When he disappeared in April, 2001,

490
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:28,883
he was checking structures

491
00:20:28,884 --> 00:20:30,714
at Quantico and Little Creek.

492
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,347
Puller High School was on his list.

493
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,491
It could have been an accident.

494
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,027
He could've fallen to his death while

495
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:36,085
inspecting the school.

496
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:36,678
How?

497
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:38,336
Think about it.

498
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,944
He couldn't just walk
on the military base.

499
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,460
If he drove, they would
have found his car.

500
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:43,401
A 2000 Honda Accord
disappeared with him.

501
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:45,436
Fourteen victims, 

502
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:48,269
spread out from 1993 until his death.

503
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,533
All of 'em looking
pretty much like his wife.

504
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:52,049
Number 15

505
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:53,828
found in his own backyard by

506
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:54,909
yours truly, 

507
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:56,970
with the FBI digging for more.

508
00:20:56,978 --> 00:20:59,178
Why exactly are we letting
the FBI dig for more?

509
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:00,875
They're doing our manual labor.

510
00:21:11,484 --> 00:21:12,937
Well, this is the last one, Ducky.

511
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:14,553
Unless they find more.

512
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:18,672
Yeah, well, this one's also a female, 

513
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,840
judging by the width
of the pelvic bones.

514
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:24,992
With the almost complete lack of tissue, 

515
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,260
I think I'll refrain

516
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:28,901
before I offer a
tentative time of death.

517
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:30,736
Especially after the last time.

518
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:33,310
Yes, I do deeply apologize for that.

519
00:21:33,387 --> 00:21:34,389
No, problems, Ducky.

520
00:21:34,942 --> 00:21:36,196
We all make mistakes, yes?

521
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:38,049
Did I ever tell you about the time

522
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,314
I shoved a French police
officer off a cliff?

523
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:41,758
There was a lake below.

524
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:44,306
Yeah, the man was all right, 

525
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:47,013
but they still issued
a warrant for my arrest.

526
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,940
Gibbs and I managed to keep
two steps ahead of them.

527
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:51,762
Eventually we escaped across

528
00:21:51,763 --> 00:21:53,585
the English Channel in a sailboat.

529
00:21:53,586 --> 00:21:55,597
You and Agent Gibbs were fugitives?

530
00:21:55,629 --> 00:21:57,192
Yes, for a short while.

531
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,974
Until a young

532
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,618
upcoming NCIS agent
had the charges dropped.

533
00:22:03,752 --> 00:22:04,159
Jenny.

534
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:09,109
I mean, Director Shepard.

535
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,539
Yeah, she was the one who
commandeered the boat.

536
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:14,343
Director Shepard stole a boat?

537
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:18,336
She wasn't the director
of NCIS at the time, McGee.

538
00:22:21,593 --> 00:22:22,773
Everything's going to be okay.

539
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:24,962
-This is all a big...
-Mrs. Bright, 

540
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:29,377
I need to know how your
husband ended up in Quantico.

541
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,570
He worked at all the bases.

542
00:22:34,797 --> 00:22:36,954
Don't you people understand you have him

543
00:22:36,984 --> 00:22:38,434
confused with someone else?

544
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,485
Some kind of monster?

545
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,297
Sweetheart.

546
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:46,254
Go get your brother, okay.

547
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:47,439
We're going to go to Grandma's house.

548
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:48,364
Go on.

549
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:52,522
Can't they just leave?

550
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:57,448
My husband was one
of the most loving men

551
00:22:57,449 --> 00:22:58,980
on the planet, Agent Gibbs.

552
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,658
He treated everyone with...

553
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:03,902
kindness and decency.

554
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:07,506
Ask anyone who knew
him, Agent Gibbs, anyone.

555
00:23:09,061 --> 00:23:11,406
They're removing four
bodies from your backyard.

556
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:15,566
Do you know how many old, unmarked

557
00:23:15,576 --> 00:23:16,802
graveyards are in Virginia?

558
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:20,482
When was the last time you saw him?

559
00:23:21,986 --> 00:23:24,146
He was driving to Little Creek.He was...

560
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,580
supposed to call when
he got to his hotel.

561
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:30,337
That's a long way from
Quantico where he ended up.

562
00:23:31,258 --> 00:23:31,804
I knew.

563
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:34,513
I knew something was
wrong when he didn't call.

564
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,620
You ever have one of those feelings?

565
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,124
When you know something
terrible has just happened?

566
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,845
Once.

567
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:50,591
And did it?

568
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:57,780
He didn't do these things, Agent Gibbs.

569
00:23:59,212 --> 00:24:00,839
And I'm sorry, but
there's nothing you people

570
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,249
can do or say to ever
make me believe this.

571
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:21,517
Stashing four bodies in the yard, 

572
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:23,845
that's more than just gloating, Gibbs.

573
00:24:24,574 --> 00:24:26,147
Well, they could be his first kills.

574
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,785
I think we're running out of room.

575
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:32,578
Yes, it won't be lonely in
the Mallard Inn tonight.

576
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:34,771
How could someone do the
things this man did, Doctor?

577
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:38,065
In some cases, there's
a physiological defect

578
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:40,306
in the hard-wiring of their brains.

579
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:42,679
A mechanism that precludes

580
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,592
the ability to feel genuine emotion.

581
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:48,012
Did you find anything
weird in this guy's brain?

582
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:50,546
Like a tumor or a physical abnormality?

583
00:24:50,843 --> 00:24:51,553
I did not.

584
00:24:52,394 --> 00:24:53,219
Then how do you explain him?

585
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:54,898
I can't.

586
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,864
There is also evil

587
00:24:56,865 --> 00:24:59,567
in this world, and even
armed with all our...

588
00:25:00,152 --> 00:25:03,417
science and degrees, it
remains impenetrable.

589
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:07,495
Perhaps because its
depths are unfathomable.

590
00:25:07,777 --> 00:25:09,705
There's a very good book that I...

591
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:12,330
Oh.

592
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:15,440
I seem to have left my bag in the van.

593
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:17,401
Be a good lad and fetch it for me

594
00:25:17,402 --> 00:25:18,695
before you leave for the night.

595
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,443
You got it, Doctor.

596
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:41,759
Oh.

597
00:25:54,781 --> 00:25:56,288
Thought you might be needing a refill.

598
00:25:58,555 --> 00:25:58,958
Thanks.

599
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:02,789
Today certainly brought
back a lot of memories.

600
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:06,946
Yeah.

601
00:26:08,087 --> 00:26:10,920
It also made me realize that

602
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:14,780
since your return I've been
acting a little like a...

603
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:15,608
An ass?

604
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:18,323
Well, something like that.

605
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:20,917
I didn't notice.

606
00:26:23,887 --> 00:26:25,673
Yeah, you and I have been through a lot

607
00:26:25,732 --> 00:26:26,803
over the years.

608
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:29,634
Look, I-I... I hate to

609
00:26:30,641 --> 00:26:32,873
use marriage as an analogy...

610
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:33,535
Then don't.

611
00:26:33,906 --> 00:26:36,480
Just tell me what I did to piss you off.

612
00:26:37,092 --> 00:26:38,185
The night you retired, 

613
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:40,068
you asked me to drive you home.

614
00:26:40,842 --> 00:26:43,579
You didn't say a single
word the entire trip.

615
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:47,039
No explanation, not even a good-bye.

616
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,744
I was kind of still recovering
from the coma, Doctor.

617
00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:55,840
And Kelly and Shannon?

618
00:26:56,638 --> 00:26:58,482
All those years of friendship together, 

619
00:26:58,483 --> 00:26:59,302
and somehow you...

620
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:01,825
failed to mention
that you have a family?

621
00:27:01,844 --> 00:27:02,286
Had.

622
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,821
Had a family.

623
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:13,807
You know how I feel
about apologies, right?

624
00:27:14,312 --> 00:27:15,962
Yeah, they're a sign of weakness.

625
00:27:16,461 --> 00:27:17,574
Not between friends.

626
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:20,362
I am sorry, Ducky.

627
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:23,096
I should have told you.

628
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,666
And I should have told
you something months ago.

629
00:27:28,721 --> 00:27:29,466
Welcome home.

630
00:27:34,394 --> 00:27:35,401
Thanks.

631
00:27:51,282 --> 00:27:52,719
Hope you had a better day than I did, 

632
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,719
Miss Jeanne Benoit.

633
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,993
I've been thinking a
lot about you lately...

634
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:01,655
and I'm really, really
trying to figure out a way

635
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:04,431
to not screw this up.

636
00:28:15,188 --> 00:28:15,831
Tony.

637
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:17,718
Hey. I thought you were sleeping.

638
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:18,907
I was.

639
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:22,991
So...

640
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:25,264
how was your day?

641
00:28:26,515 --> 00:28:27,157
Well...

642
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,375
<i>you ever see The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre?</i>

643
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,180
Original or remake?

644
00:28:33,204 --> 00:28:33,674
Either.

645
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:35,680
Neither.

646
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:37,291
It was a lot like that, ...

647
00:28:38,404 --> 00:28:39,114
but worse.

648
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,256
How about you?

649
00:28:41,784 --> 00:28:43,443
Kind of like a cross between...

650
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,604
<i>Trains, Planes and Automobiles</i>

651
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:46,996
<i>and The Muppets Take Manhattan.</i>

652
00:28:48,024 --> 00:28:49,153
That is a heady, 

653
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:52,281
heady brew of strange
cinematic references, 

654
00:28:52,282 --> 00:28:53,586
and I don't know what to make of it.

655
00:28:54,782 --> 00:28:56,743
I interned at the Children's Ward today.

656
00:28:57,357 --> 00:28:59,000
- Ah...
- I felt kind of like that, too.

657
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:02,176
Beautiful and clever.

658
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:04,491
So why aren't you kissing me?

659
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,369
And she's a mind reader.

660
00:29:07,685 --> 00:29:09,035
Not exactly. Stop...

661
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:58,430
Are you on medication?

662
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:00,051
Just had a good night last night.

663
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:01,107
Doing what?

664
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:03,569
The usual.

665
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,078
The usual what?

666
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,210
Night.

667
00:30:12,203 --> 00:30:13,565
You had sex, didn't you?

668
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,265
What?

669
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,180
It's okay to admit it.

670
00:30:16,302 --> 00:30:17,940
I mean, we're all adults here.

671
00:30:18,518 --> 00:30:20,993
That's a subject I'd be
willing to debate, Officer David.

672
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:22,980
Where's Gibbs?

673
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,418
Well, he must have known you were coming, 

674
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:26,957
because he's not here.

675
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:30,375
It was really more of
a courtesy call, DiNozzo, 

676
00:30:31,152 --> 00:30:34,040
letting him know about
these orders from Justice

677
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,685
the ones where the FBI

678
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:39,252
is taking over your case.

679
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,147
You sure he's not around?

680
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:47,797
These are pretty clear-cut
orders, Agent Fornell.

681
00:30:48,129 --> 00:30:50,572
"And NCIS is hereby ordered to turn over

682
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:54,006
full jurisdiction of the
Bright case to the FBI"

683
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:56,884
by end of business today."

684
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:00,672
Who did you have to
sleep with to get these?

685
00:31:00,673 --> 00:31:01,757
Director, please.

686
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,017
A serial killer falls down
a chimney on a Marine base.

687
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:08,357
Is that a logical way
to decide jurisdiction?

688
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:11,107
It's been working for
us since around 1882.

689
00:31:11,587 --> 00:31:12,140
Sadly, 

690
00:31:12,562 --> 00:31:13,771
Justice doesn't see it that way.

691
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:17,580
The FBI's invested 12
years in this investigation.

692
00:31:17,654 --> 00:31:19,425
And my people made more progress

693
00:31:19,426 --> 00:31:21,131
in just three days.Now, I can see

694
00:31:21,132 --> 00:31:22,233
how that would be embarrassing.

695
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,238
I'll get over it.

696
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,438
No hard feelings, Jethro?

697
00:31:27,174 --> 00:31:27,507
No.

698
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:30,353
Just need you to look at
something before you leave.

699
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:32,527
You got that mustache
in a box, don't you?

700
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:36,326
It took more time than I care to admit, 

701
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:40,549
but I finally managed
to solve the riddle

702
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,488
of how our friend died.

703
00:31:43,457 --> 00:31:44,256
You may need this.

704
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:46,098
Look closely.

705
00:31:46,712 --> 00:31:49,031
In the area of his abdomen, 

706
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,015
do you see anything resembling wounds?

707
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:56,080
No.

708
00:31:56,178 --> 00:31:58,902
No, neither did I, until
I took a second look

709
00:31:59,103 --> 00:32:00,207
at the CAT scan.

710
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:03,059
You see, smoking desiccates flesh, 

711
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,696
which is why it is the

712
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:06,540
preferred method of preserving meat

713
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:08,840
in less technologically advanced

714
00:32:08,864 --> 00:32:09,774
- societies...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

715
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:11,631
How did he die, Doctor?

716
00:32:11,918 --> 00:32:13,640
Well, as the moisture was lost, 

717
00:32:13,793 --> 00:32:14,838
the victim's tissue, 

718
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,325
which protected the vital organs, shrank.

719
00:32:18,314 --> 00:32:20,114
You see these little black dots?

720
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:27,954
oh, yeah.

721
00:32:28,748 --> 00:32:31,725
He was stabbed repeatedly and fatally.

722
00:32:33,438 --> 00:32:34,087
With what?

723
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,281
A safety pin?

724
00:32:36,478 --> 00:32:38,018
No, as I just explained, 

725
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:40,554
the shrinkage of the flesh is deceptive.

726
00:32:40,869 --> 00:32:43,287
Most likely it was an ice pick or a...

727
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:45,419
Phillips-head screwdriver.

728
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:47,720
Somebody killed your
serial killer, Fornell.

729
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:49,476
On a Marine base...

730
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:50,781
which means...

731
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,644
it is still our jurisdiction.

732
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,180
I've seen a lot of things
since I became a cop, Ziva, 

733
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:10,474
But this...

734
00:33:11,204 --> 00:33:13,159
a guy tortures and murders 19 women

735
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,197
and then gets off on eating their toes?

736
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,670
Whoever whacked this sick freak

737
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:19,415
did us and the world a favor.

738
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:21,098
And our job is to arrest them.

739
00:33:21,342 --> 00:33:22,494
Makes perfect sense to me.

740
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:24,874
Justified or not, still a crime, Ziva.

741
00:33:25,665 --> 00:33:26,263
In this country, 

742
00:33:26,264 --> 00:33:28,205
you cannot take the
law into your own hands.

743
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:30,440
Unless it's your little
sister wanted for murder, 

744
00:33:30,906 --> 00:33:31,378
right, Probie?

745
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:32,472
You know what I mean.

746
00:33:33,526 --> 00:33:34,530
What if this was your sister?

747
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,015
Or her?

748
00:33:36,521 --> 00:33:38,015
My point is that we cannot just

749
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,794
investigate the crimes that we want to.

750
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:40,805
McGee's right.

751
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,638
Does anybody have a problem with that?

752
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,012
No, boss, it's just...

753
00:33:44,406 --> 00:33:45,723
Just what, DiNozzo?

754
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:48,120
Some days this job really sucks.

755
00:33:48,214 --> 00:33:49,910
Yeah? Well, it's about to get worse.

756
00:33:50,877 --> 00:33:53,565
Ziva, you and Tony are
with Sacks on this one.

757
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:54,326
Doing what?

758
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,340
Coming up with a list of
people who wanted Bright dead.

759
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,656
Besides everyone in this room?

760
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,445
Except for McLawyer over there.

761
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:01,727
Tony, all I was saying...

762
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:03,839
Go check on Abby, see
if she needs any help.

763
00:34:05,505 --> 00:34:07,540
Running a little late
today, are we, Tobias?

764
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:09,048
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

765
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:11,020
Oh, only slightly more than a lot.

766
00:34:11,286 --> 00:34:11,695
Come on.

767
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:12,678
What?

768
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:14,239
Ducky's got something for us.

769
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:16,825
There wasn't any recoverable tissue

770
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:18,123
from any of the remains.

771
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:21,513
All four bodies were
completely stripped to the bone.

772
00:34:21,545 --> 00:34:23,243
Yeah, I can see that, Duck.

773
00:34:23,574 --> 00:34:24,710
How long were they on the ground?

774
00:34:25,017 --> 00:34:26,055
Shallow graves, 

775
00:34:26,056 --> 00:34:27,448
exposed to the elements, 

776
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:30,077
all four women could
have been there for, 

777
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:33,340
ooh, decades or for as
little as six months.

778
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:35,114
We know it's got to
be at least five years.

779
00:34:35,138 --> 00:34:36,819
Do we, Tobias?

780
00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:40,022
Yes, unless Bright figured out a way to

781
00:34:40,023 --> 00:34:41,659
climb in and out of that smokestack.

782
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,710
For what it's worth, I agree with you, 

783
00:34:43,711 --> 00:34:45,334
but down here, we deal in facts.

784
00:34:45,412 --> 00:34:46,396
Meaning you don't know?

785
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:47,886
Well, not yet.

786
00:34:48,144 --> 00:34:49,465
Couldn't have told me
that on the phone, Duck?

787
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,561
Yes, I could have, Jethro, but

788
00:34:51,562 --> 00:34:53,638
that's not the reason
I asked you down here.

789
00:34:55,091 --> 00:34:58,470
I took the liberty of
reviewing the profile

790
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,253
that the FBI prepared

791
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:03,147
on our serial killer eight years ago.

792
00:35:03,305 --> 00:35:05,851
In order to disguise
his predatory nature, 

793
00:35:05,883 --> 00:35:08,175
Bright had to be methodical, precise, 

794
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:10,586
cautious almost to a fault.

795
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:11,735
Your point?

796
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:15,010
Well, if the FBI's finest
couldn't get to him, 

797
00:35:15,671 --> 00:35:17,148
it makes me wonder who did.

798
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:18,340
He knew his killer.

799
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:21,410
That's good work, Ducky.

800
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:25,355
How else could someone
get close enough to him

801
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,863
to stab him to death
with a screwdriver?!

802
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,440
- DiNozzo?
- Yeah, boss?

803
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,980
Concentrate on the high school.

804
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:31,899
Someone there had to have

805
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,266
a personal connection to Bright.

806
00:35:33,361 --> 00:35:34,486
- On it.
- Find him.

807
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:37,817
I'm a forensic scientist, McGee.

808
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,589
I don't need anyone checking up on me.

809
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,859
What I do need is to date those bones.

810
00:35:42,127 --> 00:35:44,390
The ones that we found
in Beef Jerky's backyard.

811
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:45,480
"Marty"?

812
00:35:46,785 --> 00:35:47,698
Yes!

813
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,956
Why didn't I think of that?

814
00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:53,321
Marty got his degree in
forensic botany at Penn State.

815
00:35:54,257 --> 00:35:56,253
The roots grew into the bones.

816
00:35:56,576 --> 00:35:58,477
So if Marty can I.D. the plant, 

817
00:35:58,729 --> 00:36:00,534
he can probably give us a rough estimate

818
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:01,806
as to when they were buried.

819
00:36:02,302 --> 00:36:03,702
Way to go, McGee!

820
00:36:07,973 --> 00:36:09,992
How did you know what Marty majored in?

821
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:11,823
I didn't.

822
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,418
Who is he?

823
00:36:13,573 --> 00:36:14,132
He's...

824
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:15,886
just a friend.

825
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:20,094
"Being with you makes me believe

826
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,735
size truly doesn't matter. Abby."

827
00:36:23,928 --> 00:36:25,641
Okay, he's a really good friend.

828
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:31,902
Where the hell did
you learn how to type?

829
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:32,586
Do you mind?

830
00:36:32,688 --> 00:36:34,588
Your breath's taking the
starch out of my collar.

831
00:36:35,587 --> 00:36:36,287
- What've we got?
- What've we got?

832
00:36:36,597 --> 00:36:38,170
Um, the teaching staff still present

833
00:36:38,171 --> 00:36:40,568
from five years ago all claim
not to have known Bright.

834
00:36:40,607 --> 00:36:41,694
Well, if they murdered
the guy and stuffed

835
00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:43,548
him down a chimney, that's
not surprising.

836
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:43,977
Tony?

837
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:45,606
Running down a list of substitutes

838
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:46,661
who used to teach back then.

839
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:48,358
His wife's a teacher, third grade.

840
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:49,475
See if she ever worked at Puller.

841
00:36:49,703 --> 00:36:51,919
We checked for Brights
already, boss. There are none.

842
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:53,097
Check her maiden name.

843
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,991
Her maiden name is Burris, Tony.

844
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:56,938
Burris....

845
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,926
Okay, got one hit: Karen Burris.

846
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:04,795
Subbed for social studies
and Western history in 2001.

847
00:37:04,844 --> 00:37:06,228
Social security number listed

848
00:37:06,229 --> 00:37:07,660
is the same as Bright's wife.

849
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,210
My mama always told me

850
00:37:19,211 --> 00:37:21,081
big things come in small packages.

851
00:37:21,695 --> 00:37:22,680
What a coincidence.

852
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:25,290
Mine always warned me about
tattooed girls bearing...

853
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,285
samples.

854
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,300
I'm talking about your lab.

855
00:37:28,543 --> 00:37:29,440
I love it.

856
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:30,286
Yeah?

857
00:37:31,057 --> 00:37:32,048
Pretty sweet, huh?

858
00:37:32,594 --> 00:37:33,790
Sweet!

859
00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:36,627
I'd kill for half this equipment.

860
00:37:36,808 --> 00:37:37,302
Really?

861
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:39,573
What would you do for all of it?

862
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:45,513
What's your crazy
ninja sense telling you?

863
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:46,640
She's scared.

864
00:37:47,127 --> 00:37:49,146
I mean, about whether
she shanked Beef Jerky

865
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:50,712
and dropped him down the wishing well.

866
00:37:51,614 --> 00:37:52,501
What would you do if

867
00:37:52,502 --> 00:37:54,185
you woke up one day and you discovered

868
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:55,678
you were married to a monster?

869
00:37:55,947 --> 00:37:57,210
Happened to my father all the time.

870
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:58,224
We usually just moved.

871
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,832
Ah, that explains it.

872
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:10,172
Karen, you were a substitute

873
00:38:10,173 --> 00:38:12,608
at Lieutenant General
Lewis Puller High School.

874
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,230
I-I've worked a lot
of schools in the area.

875
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:17,919
What does that have to do with this?

876
00:38:18,218 --> 00:38:20,132
Considering we found your husband

877
00:38:20,426 --> 00:38:21,894
petrified in the chimney there, 

878
00:38:23,023 --> 00:38:23,610
quite a bit.

879
00:38:24,644 --> 00:38:25,182
Karen...

880
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:29,628
we know this is hard...

881
00:38:32,904 --> 00:38:33,738
but we're here to help.

882
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:39,372
It's important that
you tell us the truth.

883
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,650
When'd you find out?

884
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:48,539
Find out?

885
00:38:50,824 --> 00:38:52,443
That your loving husband

886
00:38:53,646 --> 00:38:54,944
was murdering women

887
00:38:56,004 --> 00:38:57,317
who looked just like you?

888
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,868
I told you, 

889
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:03,421
my husband didn't do those things.

890
00:39:04,854 --> 00:39:06,821
He removed the toes
from their left feet.

891
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:10,154
We think that you know why.

892
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,558
You mind taking off your shoe

893
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,861
and showing us your left foot?

894
00:39:16,641 --> 00:39:17,498
Please.

895
00:39:19,986 --> 00:39:20,552
Karen?

896
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:42,756
Your husband was an evil man.

897
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:44,601
That thing was not my husband.

898
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,640
It wasn't the man I married.

899
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:51,034
It had to be stopped, don't you see?

900
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:52,341
I had no other choice!

901
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:54,200
Yeah, you could have gone to the police.

902
00:39:54,201 --> 00:39:56,588
And have my children live
the rest of their lives

903
00:39:56,596 --> 00:39:59,085
knowing that monster
was their father? No!

904
00:40:00,312 --> 00:40:03,022
I had to. I had to protect them from it.

905
00:40:07,807 --> 00:40:09,333
<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>

906
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:11,104
evergreen shrub, 

907
00:40:11,105 --> 00:40:13,515
more commonly known as
wintergreen or checkerberry.

908
00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:15,630
We need to see the photo where

909
00:40:15,631 --> 00:40:16,931
the sample was recovered from.

910
00:40:17,324 --> 00:40:19,965
It was taken from between
the fibula and the tibia.

911
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,440
Go back to the wide shot.

912
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:24,291
No..Go to that quadrant.

913
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:26,373
That's your wintergreen, 

914
00:40:26,629 --> 00:40:27,914
about five meters from the remains.

915
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:30,068
Judging from the thickness of the root, 

916
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,650
annual growth rate

917
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:33,775
and the soil samples you brought me, 

918
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:35,854
we can calculate roughly

919
00:40:35,855 --> 00:40:37,239
how long the body's been buried, 

920
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:39,278
plus or minus six months.

921
00:40:40,388 --> 00:40:41,857
You can tell it was a live sample

922
00:40:41,948 --> 00:40:44,315
by the tiny little offshoots
forming off the main root.

923
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:45,699
Want to see?

924
00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:50,260
Abby?

925
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,794
In her position, I can't say

926
00:40:52,795 --> 00:40:54,365
I wouldn't have done
the same thing, Tony.

927
00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:56,540
McGee was right, 

928
00:40:57,092 --> 00:40:58,950
about taking the law
into your own hands.

929
00:41:00,507 --> 00:41:02,710
She's lucky she wasn't his last victim.

930
00:41:13,703 --> 00:41:14,224
Karen...

931
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:17,885
no one should have to
live through what you did.

932
00:41:18,534 --> 00:41:19,963
Believe me when I tell you that...

933
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:22,225
there's no jury in the world

934
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,824
that wouldn't sympathize with you.

935
00:41:28,803 --> 00:41:29,415
It's not me.

936
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:37,980
What?

937
00:41:38,514 --> 00:41:39,907
What do you want to bet that's McGeek?

938
00:41:40,258 --> 00:41:41,195
Rule number 22:

939
00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:43,797
Never, ever bother
Gibbs in interrogation.

940
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:51,740
Tony, I don't think it's McGee.

941
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:54,280
Got it, Abbs, thanks.

942
00:41:56,856 --> 00:41:57,774
You okay, Karen?

943
00:41:57,897 --> 00:41:59,080
You're gonna get through this.

944
00:41:59,703 --> 00:42:00,969
Get away from her, Tobias.

945
00:42:07,343 --> 00:42:10,010
The bodies in the yard are
not from five years ago.

946
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:10,874
They're older?

947
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:12,142
No.

948
00:42:14,227 --> 00:42:15,245
They're more recent than that.

949
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:20,792
Her husband wasn't the serial killer.

950
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,609
She is.

951
00:42:35,026 --> 00:42:36,824
I got to tell you, Jethro, that was...

952
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:41,683
that was...

953
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:46,788
How in God's name could
we have missed that?

954
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,893
I don't think God had
much to do with it, Tobias.

955
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:52,289
You know what's really
got me freaked out?

956
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:54,644
If her husband's body
hadn't gotten hung up

957
00:42:54,645 --> 00:42:56,339
going down that chimney five years ago, 

958
00:42:57,364 --> 00:42:58,458
she'd still be out there.

959
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:00,972
We'd never have caught her.

960
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:04,594
I can do you one better than that.

961
00:43:05,287 --> 00:43:07,215
No, can't top that, Jethro.

962
00:43:07,942 --> 00:43:10,341
What was a toe doing in
her husband's stomach?

963
00:43:07,942 --> 00:43:10,341
