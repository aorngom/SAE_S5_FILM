1
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:13,826
Not bad for a queen who's supposedly
been dead for a few thousand years.

2
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,818
Geez, you scared the
hell out of me, Erik.

3
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:40,454
You ever hear of knocking?

4
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:43,760
Oh, Custer's Last Stand. Cute.

5
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:45,911
By the way, the party doesn't
start for another hour.

6
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,111
Sarah...

7
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:49,592
Erik?

34
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,387
You're not planning on
leaving early, are you?

35
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:01,917
And if I am?

36
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:04,197
I wouldn't advise it.

37
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,227
You know what today is?

38
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:07,376
Tuesday.

39
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,162
It's Halloween, Ziva.

40
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:13,517
-  It's an American holiday...
- I know, the wearing of silly outfits and begging for treats.

41
00:02:13,518 --> 00:02:16,556
I imagine it would be a
DiNozzo national holiday.

42
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:19,502
Well, you imagine wrong.
I don't do Halloween.

43
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:20,972
I see.

44
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:22,621
Your father again, yes?

45
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:25,788
I don't do Halloween because
ever since I became a cop

46
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:28,704
weird things always
happen on October 31th.

47
00:02:28,705 --> 00:02:30,113
Define weird.

48
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:33,232
Brave robberies, beheadings,

49
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,402
cattle mutilations

50
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,462
and McGee turning fuzzy and blue.

51
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,041
What?

52
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:42,649
What's under your shirt?

53
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:45,250
My T-shirt.

54
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:46,306
Okay, he's lying.

55
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:47,635
Oh, yeah.

56
00:02:48,063 --> 00:02:49,570
Oh, yeah.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,804
I knew you played a
fairy on that online game,

58
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:00,493
but dressing up as one?

59
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:04,272
It's a snow elf. And I'm
going to a costume party, okay?

60
00:03:04,273 --> 00:03:06,711
It's far from okay, Probie.

61
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:08,821
In fact, I'd say that this is...

62
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,929
taking geek one step beyond.

63
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,371
Oh, sadly, I have to agree.

64
00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:19,101
I instantly felt all the respect
leave    my body as soon as I put this on.

65
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,617
Well, normally you'd be right,but...

66
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,105
... you haven't yet met my ice queen.

67
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:26,691
You have to be kidding me.

68
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,312
Did I also mention that
she's a Redskins cheerleader?

69
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:34,489
Very impressive.

70
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,951
She's a very hot woman.
How'd you find her?

71
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:38,559
Met at the Armani store.

72
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,051
Found out we played on the
same gaming server together.

73
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:43,140
Since when can you afford Armani?

74
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:45,382
Gear up.

75
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:54,068
Oh, God.

76
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:56,026
They're McGee's.

77
00:03:56,785 --> 00:03:59,377
I'm going to a costume
party later tonight.

78
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:02,658
Not anymore, Elf Lord.

79
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,588
General Custer has been shot, and he
has a dead skeleton in his living room.

80
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:08,452
What did I tell you? Halloween.

81
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:14,021
No, wait, wait,
wait, Sharon, it's....

82
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:16,155
Well, what about next weekend?

83
00:04:16,285 --> 00:04:17,796
Look, it's not my fault.

84
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:20,144
Oh, my poor little McGee.

85
00:04:20,145 --> 00:04:22,538
There'll be other elf queens online.

86
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:23,799
She's right.

87
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,487
Of course they won't be Redskins cheerleaders
and they'll probably weigh a few thousand pounds.

88
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:30,025
Not to mention there's a good
chance some of them are actually men.

89
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:31,260
But you play long enough...

90
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:32,609
Anything can happen.

91
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,250
Guy dressed as Custer is
Staff Sergeant Erik Niles.

92
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,585
LEOs are looking for his wife and daughter.

93
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:41,505
Blood trail leads from his house to
the neighbour's house who called it in.

94
00:04:41,506 --> 00:04:43,277
Tony, Ziva, get her statement.

95
00:04:43,278 --> 00:04:45,954
McGee, start processing the
Staff Sergeant's living room.

96
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:47,601
Oh, and there's a, uh...

97
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,392
dead John Doe in there
dressed like a skeleton.

98
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:54,922
What happened to them?

99
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:55,783
Halloween.

100
00:04:55,784 --> 00:04:57,403
Sorry we're late,

101
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,196
only we had a minor run-in
with some local youths.

102
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:02,410
Yeah, I can see that, Doctor.

103
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:03,509
Did you get a good look at them?

104
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,115
We did better than that.

105
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:07,535
Release the captives, Mr. Palmer.

106
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,631
Are we in trouble?

107
00:05:09,632 --> 00:05:10,941
Where we at?

108
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:12,309
We said we were sorry.

109
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,610
Right.

110
00:05:14,738 --> 00:05:15,856
Clean it.

111
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,825
Nice work, Palmer.

112
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:18,053
It wasn't me, Tony.

113
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:20,668
Dr. Mallard chased
them for three blocks.

114
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:23,720
Oh, please, it's not that impressive.

115
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:26,218
It's not as if they were real ninjas.

116
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,808
I thought he was play-acting at first.

117
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:36,099
General Custer's Last Stand, all that?

118
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,943
You removed his jacket. Why?

119
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:39,421
To check for other wounds.

120
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,500
There weren't any.

121
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:43,172
Just a single gunshot wound
that nicked his carotid artery.

122
00:05:43,173 --> 00:05:45,646
I'm a doctor, paediatrician.

123
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:46,455
Oh...

124
00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:50,396
Oh, that explains why he headed over
here. You probably saved his life, Doctor.

125
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:53,920
I stabilized him the best I
could until the EMTs arrived.

126
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,431
And it's Leslie.

127
00:05:59,032 --> 00:06:00,781
Did he say anything to you?

128
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,399
He was trying to. I think
it was his daughter's name

129
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,548
Sarah.

130
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:08,801
I'm hoping she was with
her mother when this...

131
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:11,717
this happened.

132
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:23,774
No, that's not creepy.

133
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:00,161
Palmer!

134
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:01,495
Is something wrong?

135
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:02,886
You trying to get shot?

136
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:04,400
Um, no.

137
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:07,661
There's someone in this room.

138
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,072
You mean besides the dead skeleton guy?

139
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:12,793
Yes, besides the dead skeleton guy.

140
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,937
Basement's clear, boss.

141
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:19,920
Look, I know what I saw.

142
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:22,292
Someone policed the brass
tried to wipe up the blood.

143
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:24,946
Who, Probie, the crime scene
fairies? There's no one here.

144
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:27,200
Get Ducky in here. We're wasting time.

145
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:29,507
Boss, I'm sorry, but I swear, there...

146
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:31,596
What do you make of this, McGee?

147
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:34,575
Well, obviously signs of a struggle.

148
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:37,114
One dead assailant. Not really sure
how his head got that way, though.

149
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:38,242
You're not?

150
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:41,159
Come on, let me show
you. Get on the floor.

151
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:44,117
Well, Tony did tell me about when
you demonstrated this technique...

152
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:46,488
Yeah, you guys talk
about things like that?

153
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:48,065
You learn by feeling, McGee.

154
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,828
This is how marines
silence enemy sentries.

155
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:53,069
66 pounds of pressure and then...

156
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,625
Snap!

157
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,100
So Staff Sergeant Niles
went down fighting.

158
00:07:58,585 --> 00:07:59,861
See?

159
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:02,245
The blood spatter on the wall.

160
00:08:06,205 --> 00:08:08,701
He was right about where I am now

161
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:10,193
when he got shot.

162
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:12,183
Bullet impacted...

163
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:15,389
means the shooter was
over here somewhere.

164
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:17,901
This is where the brass is.

165
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:19,194
Well, was.

166
00:08:19,597 --> 00:08:21,765
- So two assailants.
- At least.

167
00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:24,189
Yes, the cause of
death is pretty obvious.

168
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,756
But you never know.

169
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:30,194
I once had a case where a
man who died of heart failure

170
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:31,953
had an ice pick

171
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:36,302
plunged into his skull four
hours after the time of death.

172
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:39,653
His wife discovered that she
had been left out of his will.

173
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:40,421
Good news, boss.

174
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:42,904
A kid saw a car leaving the sergeant's
house around the time of the shooting

175
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,199
Ziva's getting a description.

176
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,508
Well, let's have a look at you.

177
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:50,372
Whoa!

178
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:52,613
Something just touched my foot.

179
00:08:52,984 --> 00:08:54,614
Something's under the couch.

180
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,355
Maybe it's the, uh,
crime scene fairy, Tony.

181
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:02,844
I hate Halloween.

182
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:12,875
Hey, it's a Roomba.

183
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:14,342
It's a robot vacuum cleaner,

184
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:17,080
uses navigational sensors to clean
the floor while the owner's away.

185
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:20,805
Yes, well, your Roomba is about
to interfere with your crime scene.

186
00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:29,398
Damn thing policed the brass.

187
00:09:29,644 --> 00:09:31,423
Told you I wasn't crazy.

188
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:33,760
Bag it.

189
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,099
I think it was a silver Kuruma.

190
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,742
The door slammed and he just drove away.

191
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,413
Thanks a lot.

192
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:53,987
The boy saw a car leaving the
scene that looked like a Kuruma.

193
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:56,071
I'm not familiar with the model.

194
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:58,993
Kuruma is Japanese for car, Ziva.

195
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:01,474
Your description of the car is car.

196
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,814
Nice work, Officer David.

197
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:05,426
Kuruma's the name of a car
in Grand Theft Auto Three.

198
00:10:05,427 --> 00:10:07,638
It's a Chrysler Sebring sedan.

199
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,632
McGeek with the save.

200
00:10:09,653 --> 00:10:11,019
I'll put out a BOLO.

201
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,393
Find the Staff Sergeant's wife and...

202
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:13,441
Erik.

203
00:10:15,877 --> 00:10:17,056
Oh, my God.

204
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:19,486
Is-is that...

205
00:10:19,593 --> 00:10:21,186
Is that... is that my...

206
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,950
- Is that my husband in there?
- It's not him.

207
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:26,190
That's not your husband.
It's not your husband.

208
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:28,031
Okay?

209
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:30,370
I'm her sister.

210
00:10:30,477 --> 00:10:34,334
We were at the school helping set up for
the Halloween party when the police came.

211
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:35,956
Is her daughter still there?

212
00:10:35,957 --> 00:10:38,503
Sarah? She was with Erik.

213
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,286
Amber Alert, on it, Boss.

214
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:48,149
I'm okay now.

215
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:52,340
When they said Erik was shot
and I saw that body, I...

216
00:10:53,691 --> 00:10:57,671
Mrs. Niles, your husband's at
Bethesda Hospital. He's in surgery

217
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:59,211
And we'll take you to see him.

218
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:01,439
Just need to ask you a few questions.

219
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:02,598
Laurie...

220
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:04,868
... Sarah's missing.

221
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:06,369
You mean she's been kidnapped.

222
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,905
They don't know that for sure yet.

223
00:11:07,906 --> 00:11:10,543
Mrs. Niles, your daughter may have
just become scared and run off.

224
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,626
Perhaps there's a friend or
relative's house she would go to?

225
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:15,424
No, no, she...

226
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,102
she would have called
me on my cell phone.

227
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:19,772
They took my little girl.

228
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:23,372
They'll find her, Laurie, we
just have to stay positive, okay?

229
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:26,887
That could be her right now.

230
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:29,684
Do you mind
putting that on speaker?

231
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:32,548
Hello?

232
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:34,080
Mommy!

233
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:35,604
Baby, are you okay?

234
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:37,179
They hurt Daddy.

235
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,652
I tried to call the
police, but the man...

236
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:41,269
Listen to me, Sarah.

237
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,702
Everything is going to be
all right. You just need to...

238
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,146
We have your daughter.

239
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:48,836
You want to see her alive again,
you'll do exactly what I say.

240
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:50,797
I'll call back with instructions.

241
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:06,542
I dressed up as a
skeleton once in my youth.

242
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:11,697
Did you know that the tradition of
Halloween was brought over from Scotland?

243
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:16,414
Along with the fine
sports of golf and curling.

244
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:19,171
I wouldn't call anything
using a broom a sport, Ducky.

245
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:23,408
Tony, curling is referred
to as chess on ice,

246
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:28,410
because it puts high demands
on tactics and foresight.

247
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:30,674
Relax, Ducky, I love Scotland.

248
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:31,849
Sean
Connery--

249
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,293
the very best James Bond ever.

250
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:36,131
I thought he was Irish.

251
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:39,859
Uh, Darby O'Gill and the Little People.

252
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,958
He was using a fake Irish
accent; it's called acting.

253
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:47,247
The preliminary cause of death
is blunt-force trauma to the neck.

254
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:49,464
However, once I've done the...

255
00:12:49,465 --> 00:12:52,017
This guy's our only
link to the missing girl.

256
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:53,375
I need an ID.

257
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:55,968
Well, currently, he remains a John Doe.

258
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:58,691
He had no ID, he has no tattoos,

259
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:00,940
no distinguishing marks. Here.

260
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:02,498
What about his prints?

261
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:05,458
Mr. Palmer took them up to Abby's lab,

262
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,698
although she's not there, and
she's not answering her calls.

263
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:10,563
Halloween's a pretty big night for Abby.

264
00:13:10,564 --> 00:13:12,559
Every night is Halloween to Abby.

265
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:15,559
Ah, there you are. Is she here yet?

266
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,542
Oh, she's here.

267
00:13:16,543 --> 00:13:18,101
And she is in costume.

268
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:20,747
Oh, yeah? What's it like?

269
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:24,075
Trust me, you wouldn't want
me to ruin the surprise.

270
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:41,497
Oh, sorry I was late, you guys.

271
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:43,560
I couldn't hear my cell
phone ringing at the party.

272
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,651
You'd think a cemetery
would be a little quieter.

273
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:47,479
It's awful about that little girl.

274
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,173
I mean, getting kidnapped on Halloween.

275
00:13:49,174 --> 00:13:50,772
Totally creepy.

276
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:53,881
I'm running our skeleton's
fingerprints through AFIS.

277
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:55,563
I'm starting with Virginia and Maryland

278
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:58,853
and then a subset of all known
child molesters on the East Coast.

279
00:13:58,854 --> 00:14:01,843
Got an Amber Alert running, no hits yet.

280
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:04,880
We've got to find her.

281
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,088
Why are you looking at me like that?

282
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:10,126
Do I have food in my teeth or something?

283
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,385
I'll just stick with "or something."

284
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,739
Need to run our dead guy's
photo against mug shots.

285
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:22,878
Give me.

286
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:28,263
The camera, McGee.

287
00:14:28,264 --> 00:14:30,067
The camera. Sorry.

288
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:38,324
We need to put out a BOLO.

289
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,807
See if anyone recognizes our guy.

290
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,146
McGee, what is wrong with you?

291
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:46,528
You look three cans
short of a six-pack.

292
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:48,673
Nothing, it's just you...

293
00:14:48,674 --> 00:14:50,413
you look different.

294
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:53,493
He means the Halloween costume, Marilyn.

295
00:14:53,755 --> 00:14:54,983
Oh...

296
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:56,395
... right.

297
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,274
Sweet, huh?

298
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:58,833
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

299
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,746
DiNozzo.

300
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:04,884
Woodbridge P.D. has a kid who says

301
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:07,055
he may have seen the
Sebring in the neighbourhood.

302
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:08,629
Okay, on it.

303
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,088
We also got a picture of our
skeleton without the makeup.

304
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:12,095
Send them.

305
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:14,148
See if I can get the wife to ID him.

306
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:16,444
What's the condition
of the staff sergeant?

307
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:18,262
Still in surgery.
According to the doctors,

308
00:15:18,263 --> 00:15:20,201
we won't be able to
interview him until tomorrow.

309
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,591
Tomorrow's too late.

310
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:22,658
Yeah.

311
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:24,004
Kidnappers call back yet?

312
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:26,593
Nope, but it makes me wonder.

313
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,077
If she's still alive?

314
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,061
No.

315
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:32,290
..at they want with an enlisted
Marine who makes less  than

316
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,189
$32,000 a year.

317
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,332
Yeah, I was kind of
wondering the same thing.

318
00:15:36,391 --> 00:15:37,635
Find out.

319
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,718
How long do I have to sit here?

320
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:45,277
They're doing everything
they can for us, Laurie.

321
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,225
You must try to stay calm.

322
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:48,893
That's easy for you to say.

323
00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:51,573
Do you have children, Officer David?

324
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:54,808
No. But I know what it's like
to lose a member of my family.

325
00:15:57,601 --> 00:15:58,596
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

326
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:00,864
Nice. Thank you.

327
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:02,524
Sarah will be fine.

328
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:04,901
Laurie, you have to believe that.

329
00:16:05,637 --> 00:16:07,453
Our skeleton, John Doe.

330
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,166
She recognize him?

331
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,720
I haven't showed it to her yet.

332
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:17,284
Apparently, everything
I say makes her cry.

333
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:18,459
Ziva...

334
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:20,932
...her husband is in critical condition.

335
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:22,320
her daughter's been kidnapped.

336
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:24,909
I know, I'm just not very good
with the crying and the women and...

337
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,759
That makes two of us.

338
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:29,735
I also believe she's hiding something.

339
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:31,816
She seems conflicted,

340
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:32,761
Like...

341
00:16:32,762 --> 00:16:34,098
...like she's holding something back.

342
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:35,998
I'll show you something.

343
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,238
One shirt.

344
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:42,781
Our staff sergeant wasn't living here.

345
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:45,441
That a question or a statement?

346
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:46,877
Actually, more of a...

347
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:48,817
You want me to find out why.

348
00:16:51,564 --> 00:16:54,699
You saw the Sebring driving that way?

349
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,775
No, no.

350
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:58,770
What? Is that German?

351
00:16:58,771 --> 00:17:00,197
Are you speaking
Ger-- Is that German?

352
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:01,425
No.

353
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:06,348
I think he's saying "two people."

354
00:17:07,356 --> 00:17:08,887
Two people where?

355
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:12,460
What is that, a manhole cover?

356
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:15,602
They're moving a manhole
cover? What is that, a rake?

357
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:19,188
Yeah, no, he's just saying
you're bad at charades.

358
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,880
All right, screw this.

359
00:17:21,864 --> 00:17:23,664
Dude, you ruined my costume!

360
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:26,249
You want to be charged with
obstructing a federal investigation?

361
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:30,013
Then speak, zombie.

362
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:30,461
Okay, look,

363
00:17:30,462 --> 00:17:31,452
I-I saw a Sebring, all right?

364
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:33,496
And I think there were two people in it.

365
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,435
Which way did it go?

366
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:36,394
That way.

367
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:39,522
Yeah, it cut the corner so
hard, it ran over the curb.

368
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:41,252
All right, show me.

369
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,199
Don't be a wise guy.

370
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,063
Okay, okay, look,

371
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:50,732
it crashed into all that stuff,
right? And then it drove off that way.

372
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:51,994
You get a look at the license plate?

373
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:55,160
Dude, I can barely see you
two with all this makeup on.

374
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:01,350
Thank you.

375
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:14,032
You got a time of death on the
Great Pumpkin here, Charlie Brown?

376
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:16,822
I might have more than that.

377
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:18,993
The car left an impression on it.

378
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:27,572
This is the guy that was
fighting with your husband.

379
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,083
Sorry, Agent Gibbs,
I don't recognize him.

380
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:32,810
Think, Laurie. Maybe you saw
him at a store or the mall.

381
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,533
I said I don't know him!

382
00:18:35,706 --> 00:18:37,541
Can I talk to Erik?

383
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,070
Sure. He's still in surgery.

384
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:42,311
When he gets out, we'll put
him on the phone with you.

385
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:45,679
It's gonna be all right.
We need to have faith.

386
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,555
Stop touching me!

387
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,349
I know what you're going through, Laurie.

388
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:15,349
I know...

389
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:19,268
I know there's nothing I can say...

390
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:21,496
Have you ever had a daughter kidnapped?

391
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:27,195
Kidnapped, no.

392
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:31,034
I promise to do everything I can do

393
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:33,216
to bring your daughter home safe.

394
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:37,144
I believe you, Agent Gibbs.

395
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:40,464
I just hope it'll be enough.

396
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:52,784
Dawn of the Dead was awesome.

397
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:54,691
Cinematic blasphemy.

398
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:57,774
Fast zombies? There's a reason
you don't remake classics.

399
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:59,807
John Carpenter's The Thing.

400
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:02,050
Well, there's an
exception to every rule.

401
00:20:02,051 --> 00:20:03,156
The Fly.

402
00:20:03,157 --> 00:20:04,222
Maybe two.

403
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,356
Didn't you say that Al Pacino
in Scarface was the best...

404
00:20:06,357 --> 00:20:08,797
Okay, but my point is:

405
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:10,387
zombies should be slow.

406
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:14,301
Tony, there's nothing scary about
a zombie dragging his butt around.

407
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:17,482
Well, a zombie's not a zombie
unless it's dragging its butt around.

408
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,842
You liked 28 Days Later.
Those zombies were really quick.

409
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:24,183
Okay, enough with the zombies already!

410
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:26,517
We find an impression
on the vegetable or not?

411
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,929
Technically, it's a fruit.

412
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,766
We're finished rendering the laser
scan of the Great Pumpkin's surface.

413
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:34,380
McGee, can you invert the image?

414
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:36,815
As soon as you're done
undressing me with your eyes.

415
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,780
And bring up the gamma.

416
00:20:40,903 --> 00:20:42,680
And increase the contrast.

417
00:20:42,835 --> 00:20:44,588
And flop it.

418
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:46,358
Smashing pumpkins!

419
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:48,664
It's the left-hand side of
a Virginia license plate.

420
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,131
Nice work, Abs. Run it, McGee!

421
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:54,944
First four letters, cross-referencing
against Chrysler Sebrings.

422
00:20:56,077 --> 00:20:57,920
And we got a hit.

423
00:20:58,303 --> 00:21:02,886
Car was registered to a rental
car company in Catlett, Virginia.

424
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,308
Yes! DiNozzo does it again.

425
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:07,655
I think you mean Abby
and I did it again.

426
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:09,577
What's that for?

427
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:10,624
Those days ended

428
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,479
the moment you started
sexing up the cheerleader.

429
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,115
All right, find out who rented that
car. I'm about to make Gibbs' night.

430
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:19,082
Uh, wait a second, Tony.

431
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:20,731
There is no name.

432
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:23,145
Car was reported stolen three days ago.

433
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,374
Our staff sergeant moved into the Quantico
Bachelor Enlisted Quarters three weeks ago.

434
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,400
Marital problems?

435
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:33,438
Well, according to
someone called "Scuttle...

436
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:36,097
butt", he caught his
wife cheating on him.

437
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:38,378
Scuttlebutt's not a person, Ziva.

438
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:41,212
Scuttlebutt is what Marines call gossip.

439
00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:44,184
And then you wonder why I have
a problem with your language.

440
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:49,573
Okay, stay calm.

441
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,401
Tell him you want to talk to Sarah.

442
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,040
Can you do that for me, Laurie?

443
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,452
Okay.

444
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,770
Sarah?

445
00:21:59,771 --> 00:22:01,140
Try again.

446
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:04,369
I want to talk to my daughter
right now or I'm, I'm hanging up

447
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,786
Hang up and she dies, Mrs. Niles.

448
00:22:11,478 --> 00:22:13,393
I want to talk to her right now.

449
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,827
Talk is cheap.

450
00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:16,764
If you want to see her alive again,

451
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:18,027
that'll cost.

452
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:21,514
Whatever it is, whatever
you want, I'll do it.

453
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,305
I-I give you my word.

454
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:25,633
$100 000 in small bills.

455
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,034
You have until dawn to get it.

456
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:29,830
Yes, okay, now...

457
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:32,124
now just please let
me talk to my daughter.

458
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:35,257
Money first, then you can talk.

459
00:22:41,202 --> 00:22:42,941
Scared, little darling?

460
00:22:44,304 --> 00:22:45,491
Good.

461
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,825
You should be.

462
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:57,596
Call wasn't long enough to trace.

463
00:22:57,597 --> 00:23:01,800
We'll get another chance when he calls her
back to tell her where to drop off the ransom.

464
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:02,967
Laurie...

465
00:23:04,097 --> 00:23:05,744
I'd like to talk to you...

466
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:07,118
...alone.

467
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:08,874
It's okay, honey.

468
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:12,276
I'll be right here if you need
me. I'm not going anywhere.

469
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:22,809
Tell DiNozzo I want that
John Doe ID'd in an hour.

470
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:30,405
We don't have a hundred thousand dollars
sitting in the basement, Agent Gibbs.

471
00:23:31,504 --> 00:23:35,352
Maybe my parents can get it,
but it's going to take time.

472
00:23:35,353 --> 00:23:37,138
Yeah,we can help you with that.

473
00:23:37,576 --> 00:23:39,022
But I need some answers first.

474
00:23:39,023 --> 00:23:40,983
- Anything.
- Sit down.

475
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:50,023
So, Laurie, why did your husband
move out of your house and onto base?

476
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:51,294
What does that have to do with this?

477
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:53,748
Maybe nothing, but I need to know.

478
00:23:57,295 --> 00:23:59,234
We were having some problems.

479
00:23:59,448 --> 00:24:02,010
Erik wanted a trial separation.

480
00:24:03,557 --> 00:24:04,545
Why?

481
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:07,534
I made a mistake.

482
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:10,923
A stupid mistake eight years ago.

483
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:13,244
What kind of mistake?

484
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:16,587
Laurie, look,

485
00:24:16,775 --> 00:24:18,852
I've been married four times.

486
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,711
I've made every mistake in the book.

487
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:26,613
Right before we were married,

488
00:24:26,614 --> 00:24:28,169
Erik, he...

489
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,215
he broke off our
engagement for a few weeks.

490
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:33,845
I saw an old boyfriend.

491
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,449
It was a stupid fling. I
pretended it never happened.

492
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,714
Erik's not your daughter's
biological father?

493
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:40,924
I don't know.

494
00:24:40,925 --> 00:24:43,335
But even if I did, it doesn't matter.

495
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:45,456
How'd you husband find out?

496
00:24:45,835 --> 00:24:47,220
My ex-boyfriend,

497
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:52,059
last month, he showed up and
demanded Sarah take a paternity test.

498
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:55,113
When I refused, he threatened me.

499
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,065
And his name? Address?

500
00:24:58,156 --> 00:24:59,815
Robert Miller.

501
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:02,322
I have no idea what his address his.

502
00:25:02,323 --> 00:25:03,229
He live in Virginia?

503
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,296
- Used to.
- Age,

504
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,579
weight, eye and hair color?

505
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,431
We can run him down through DMV.

506
00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:11,800
He's 28 years old.

507
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:14,930
Brown hair, green eyes.

508
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:17,219
Maybe 180 pounds.

509
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:28,647
Hey, Laurie,

510
00:25:28,648 --> 00:25:30,704
what aren't you telling me?

511
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,535
It's my fault.

512
00:25:35,087 --> 00:25:37,048
- I, I...
- Laurie?

513
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:39,496
You okay in here?

514
00:25:41,677 --> 00:25:43,144
No...

515
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:47,148
I destroyed my family.

516
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:49,895
Don't you think she's been
through enough already?

517
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,893
Could Miller have done this?

518
00:25:51,894 --> 00:25:53,663
Maybe, I...

519
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,390
I don't know.

520
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:58,507
I just want my baby back.

521
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:03,151
She's just telling you this now?

522
00:26:03,152 --> 00:26:06,433
Just because I'm a woman doesn't
mean she'd tell me everything, Tony.

523
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:09,945
Robert Miller-- there's over 300
listed in the tri-state area alone.

524
00:26:09,946 --> 00:26:12,692
Narrow the search with
the criteria, Probie.

525
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:18,079
Still over a hundred
Robert Millers listed.

526
00:26:18,528 --> 00:26:20,850
We've got her cell phone records, right?

527
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,380
When we tapp her lines.

528
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:25,359
So check to see if Robert
Miller called in the last month.

529
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,105
Abby's right, I am three
beers short of a six-pack.

530
00:26:28,106 --> 00:26:30,722
I think she was talking
about your abs, McFlabby.

531
00:26:32,484 --> 00:26:36,386
Okay, three calls about a month
ago. Called from his home phone.

532
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:39,058
Called from his home phone.
Three calls in the last month.

533
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,121
My sister can barely stand here.

534
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:42,802
Is there any way we can
let her get some rest?

535
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:43,551
Sure.

536
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:44,931
We got an address.

537
00:26:47,216 --> 00:26:48,230
You keep an eye on them.

538
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,885
The kidnappers call again, you tell them
no more money until we talk to the girl.

539
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:56,715
Last time I did
Halloween I was an astronaut.

540
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:57,999
Neighbourhood
I grew up in--

541
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,656
well, it really wasn't a neighbourhood.

542
00:27:00,657 --> 00:27:02,487
There were these estates with mansions

543
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:06,225
smack-dab in the middle of
them and really long driveways.

544
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,781
Made Halloween very tricky.

545
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:09,361
It's a lot of walking.

546
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:11,553
God, my feet were tired that night.

547
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,210
Dogs were barking.

548
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:15,627
Yeah, I gotta imagine it really
sucks growing up rich like that.

549
00:27:15,628 --> 00:27:18,234
My costume was fantastic, though.

550
00:27:18,396 --> 00:27:19,800
Wicked awesome.

551
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:21,731
I was a spaceman.

552
00:27:21,743 --> 00:27:23,439
No ventilation, though.

553
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,611
Burning up.

554
00:27:24,655 --> 00:27:28,051
Sweating like Roger Federer
after a five-set tiebreaker.

555
00:27:28,102 --> 00:27:29,503
And stinky.

556
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:31,200
Stinky like cheese.

557
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:35,125
Man, what a haul. I made off with
more candy than I could carry.

558
00:27:35,126 --> 00:27:38,074
Got to imagine this story's
coming to an end soon.

559
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:39,634
But when I got home,

560
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:42,279
old man made me throw it all away.

561
00:27:42,456 --> 00:27:43,752
Even the apples.

562
00:27:43,753 --> 00:27:45,828
He was concerned about your teeth.

563
00:27:47,326 --> 00:27:48,306
Oh...

564
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:49,862
... No, I...

565
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:52,372
made my astronaut costume out of ...

566
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:56,241
... one of his $3,000
designer ski suits.

567
00:27:57,382 --> 00:27:59,904
I don't think I sat down
again till Christmas.

568
00:28:00,502 --> 00:28:02,081
Good times, Probie.

569
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,034
Good times.

570
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,202
Kuruma.

571
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,760
Plates match.

572
00:28:19,454 --> 00:28:21,275
It's Miller's stolen ride.

573
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:22,751
This is his building.

574
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:25,389
Second floor, apartment 207.

575
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,904
Halloween doesn't
have to suck after all.

576
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,174
Something was
burned in here recently.

577
00:28:32,584 --> 00:28:34,224
It's still smoldering.

578
00:28:34,385 --> 00:28:36,108
Pop the trunk, McGee.

579
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:54,532
Let's get this son of a bitch.

580
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,450
What's going on?

581
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,415
Federal agents!

582
00:29:15,341 --> 00:29:17,272
All right!

583
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:23,597
Great group costume guys, but, uh...

584
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:25,973
you spelled CSI wrong on your hats.

585
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,896
Robert Miller?

586
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:30,153
Somebody's in a bad mood.

587
00:29:31,056 --> 00:29:33,790
Right over there by
the blue alien ladies.

588
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:39,934
It's not easy being a
root vegetable, is it?

589
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:43,493
Robert Miller?

590
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:47,900
Hab Sosli' guch!

591
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:51,066
Boss, he just said, "Your
mother has a smooth forehead."

592
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:53,466
It's a Klingon insult.

593
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:54,675
You speak Klingon?

594
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:56,738
Not fluently, but yes.

595
00:29:57,013 --> 00:29:58,326
Federal agents.

596
00:29:58,327 --> 00:30:00,521
Zeghbe Thlinganpu!

597
00:30:01,036 --> 00:30:03,897
Now he's saying,
"Klingons don't surrender."

598
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,585
Are you Robert Miller?

599
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:09,908
Who are you people?

600
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,261
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

601
00:30:12,262 --> 00:30:14,070
Sarah Niles
where is she?

602
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,317
That bitch sent you here.

603
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:19,000
My lawyer says I have a right
to know if she's my child.

604
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:21,089
I'm just trying to do the right thing.

605
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,745
If she's my daughter, I just
want to be a part of her life.

606
00:30:23,746 --> 00:30:25,941
She looks exactly like me.

607
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,932
Well, except for the fake teeth
and the bumps on the forehead.

608
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:31,548
Is that why you kidnapped her?

609
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:32,802
I didn't kidnap anybody.

610
00:30:32,803 --> 00:30:35,778
The car that was used is
parked outside downstairs.

611
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:38,288
I have no idea what the
hell you're talking about.

612
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:40,650
I've been here all day with my
friends getting ready for this party.

613
00:30:40,651 --> 00:30:41,448
You can ask 'em.

614
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:43,222
Boss, no sign of Sarah.

615
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:44,432
See? I told you.

616
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:46,902
The only thing I hate worse
than Halloween are Klingons.

617
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:49,962
Look, ask 'em, okay? Ask the guy
with the cheesehead hat. Ask, uh,

618
00:30:49,963 --> 00:30:52,901
the vampire. David Lee
Roth. Carrot man, ask him.

619
00:30:52,902 --> 00:30:55,222
This has gone far enough.
I happen to be a lawyer.

620
00:30:55,223 --> 00:30:59,021
Good, the only thing I hate
worse than Klingons are lawyers.

621
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:01,371
I didn't do anything, all right?

622
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,591
Laurie's the one who threatened me.

623
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:05,528
She told me that her husband...

624
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:08,474
her  husband was going to kill
me if I didn't leave her alone.

625
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:09,753
Ask her.

626
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:11,099
DiNozzo.

627
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:19,499
Ziva.

628
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,466
Boss wants to talk to the mom.

629
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:30,005
Mrs. Niles?

630
00:31:30,006 --> 00:31:32,404
Agent Gibbs needs to talk to you.

631
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,551
General Kang crying,
or is that just sweat?

632
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:13,251
Half-hour alone in a
room with an angry Gibbs

633
00:32:13,252 --> 00:32:15,068
even Klingons have their limits.

634
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:18,125
- What's he been doing to him?
- Mostly staring.

635
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,400
Maybe that's a new
interrogation technique.

636
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:23,352
Well, it seems to be working.
It's definitely creeping me out.

637
00:32:23,446 --> 00:32:24,341
You check his alibi?

638
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,875
Well, according to six people,

639
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:28,931
Worf here was at the party when
the little girl was kidnapped.

640
00:32:28,932 --> 00:32:31,010
Well, shouldn't we tell Gibbs that?

641
00:32:31,221 --> 00:32:33,096
Well, I don't know, Probie.

642
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:36,575
Have you figured out how the kidnapper's
car was outside his apartment yet?

643
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:38,251
He could have hired
someone to kidnap her.

644
00:32:38,252 --> 00:32:40,181
Or 's being framed.

645
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,837
I'm trying to
cooperate, Agent Gibbs.

646
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,825
Aren't you going to say anything?

647
00:32:54,449 --> 00:32:56,407
I screwed up, Ducky.

648
00:32:56,762 --> 00:32:58,932
I knew the staff sergeant's
wife was hiding something.

649
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,248
That she wasn't telling
us the whole truth.

650
00:33:01,249 --> 00:33:02,692
And you know what I did?

651
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:05,423
I allowed myself to feel sorry for her.

652
00:33:05,424 --> 00:33:08,087
Ugh! Do you know what that makes me?

653
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:10,190
- Human.
- A chimp!

654
00:33:10,191 --> 00:33:12,044
I think she means "chump," Doctor.

655
00:33:12,045 --> 00:33:14,183
See, a chimp is an animal, Ziva,

656
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:17,071
whereas a chump is someone
who's easy to take advantage of

657
00:33:17,072 --> 00:33:19,520
- ...or-or fooled...
- Mr. Palmer,

658
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:20,422
I'm not saying that you are...

659
00:33:20,423 --> 00:33:23,104
would you mind giving us a moment alone?

660
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,063
He means well.

661
00:33:28,122 --> 00:33:29,485
He's right.

662
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,056
You're being too hard on yourself.

663
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:34,004
I let Laurie Niles and her sister

664
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:36,324
climb out of a bedroom
window in the middle

665
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:37,968
of our investigation.

666
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:40,571
Perhaps they should
throw me a parade, yes?

667
00:33:40,572 --> 00:33:43,332
The question we should
be asking ourselves...

668
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,109
... is why, Ziva.

669
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,354
Two-thirds of all child abductions
are by a biological relative.

670
00:33:49,355 --> 00:33:51,187
She kidnapped her own child.

671
00:33:51,188 --> 00:33:54,224
You know what they say about
a mother bear and her cubs?

672
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:56,001
They eat them when their food runs out.

673
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:58,626
I saw it in a documentary, Tony...

674
00:33:58,685 --> 00:34:00,528
... forced me to watch... Grizzly Man ?

675
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:03,656
I was referring to a mother
bear's protective nature

676
00:34:03,657 --> 00:34:05,418
when her cubs are threatened.

677
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,703
There's no deadlier
creature on the planet.

678
00:34:07,704 --> 00:34:08,846
I agree.

679
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:12,238
They also ate the man who shot
the footage and his girlfriend.

680
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,136
Yeah, well, that's...
perfectly dreadful.

681
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,132
That's what I said to Tony.

682
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:17,202
My point is, Laurie Niles

683
00:34:17,203 --> 00:34:19,733
may have been trying
to protect her daughter.

684
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:22,141
The husband filed for a separation.

685
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:25,626
Another man was claiming
to be the child's father.

686
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:29,290
She didn't want to lose
or share custody of Sarah.

687
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:31,302
That's one possibility.

688
00:34:31,892 --> 00:34:33,367
What does Gibbs think?

689
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,319
Hard to tell.

690
00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:38,819
He's currently not talking to me.

691
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,851
Well, chin up, dear. It could be worse.

692
00:34:40,852 --> 00:34:41,824
Hmm.

693
00:34:42,136 --> 00:34:43,196
How?

694
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,330
He could be a bear.

695
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,216
You know, we're wasting time here.

696
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,642
Right now there's someone's out there
with my daughter doing God knows what.

697
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,117
Alleged.

698
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:03,176
What?

699
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:06,104
Alleged daughter, Miller.

700
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,111
Whether I'm her father or not,
she's still Laurie's daughter.

701
00:35:11,112 --> 00:35:13,525
I still care about what happens to her.

702
00:35:15,508 --> 00:35:17,170
I believe you.

703
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,914
Well, then why are we just sitting here?

704
00:35:19,974 --> 00:35:21,888
You're sitting; I'm waiting.

705
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:23,370
Waiting for what?

706
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,712
Talk to me, Abs.

707
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,125
- Got an I.D. for you, Gibbs.
- On my way.

708
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:35,870
- Checked Miller's alibi.
- He didn't do it.

709
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:37,162
I know.

710
00:35:37,325 --> 00:35:38,337
Mind telling us how?

711
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:40,052
Spent 40 minutes with him.

712
00:35:40,053 --> 00:35:41,319
Well, all you really
did was stare at him.

713
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,099
You ever tried reading
a Klingon's face, McGee?

714
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,966
It isn't exatly easy.

715
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,245
I've I.D.'d our skeleton.

716
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,457
Our dead John is no longer a Doe.

717
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:52,228
I got a hit on him
from the DMV database.

718
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,584
Lee Varon.

719
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:56,039
He's 38 years old from
Fredericksburg, Virginia.

720
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,599
- No criminal record.
- I want everything on this guy from birth

721
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,800
until Ducky cracked his sternum.

722
00:36:01,947 --> 00:36:03,296
Yeah! On it, boss!

723
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:04,485
- Right!
- Right.

724
00:36:08,153 --> 00:36:09,753
Not bad for a blonde.

725
00:36:09,754 --> 00:36:12,031
You know, there's no statistical
evidence that say blondes

726
00:36:12,032 --> 00:36:13,929
have lower IQ's than
any other hair color.

727
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,237
I'll take your word for it, Abs.

728
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:17,618
There's more-- if
you're interested...

729
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:19,070
Mr. President.

730
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:23,884
I ran some tests on the piece of burned
paper found inside the kidnapper's car.

731
00:36:23,885 --> 00:36:26,557
There were no fingerprints, but
I did find traces of chemicals.

732
00:36:26,558 --> 00:36:27,391
Ink?

733
00:36:27,392 --> 00:36:28,102
Yes.

734
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,425
When I applied my own special
and unique brand of chemical,

735
00:36:31,426 --> 00:36:33,482
ran it through the laser
scanner a few times,

736
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:34,870
we get...

737
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:37,343
this.

738
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,446
The miracle that separates
us from all other primates.

739
00:36:45,643 --> 00:36:47,526
Really bad penmanship.

740
00:36:47,593 --> 00:36:49,010
Miller's home address.

741
00:36:49,011 --> 00:36:52,196
Probably given to the kidnapper
by the staff sergeant's wife.

742
00:36:52,197 --> 00:36:53,494
She didn't kidnap her daughter.

743
00:36:53,495 --> 00:36:55,136
Then where is Laurie Niles, Gibbs?

744
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:56,870
Last time I saw her, with you.

745
00:36:56,871 --> 00:36:59,521
Okay, I admit I screwed that one up.

746
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:01,682
But why did she run?

747
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:03,696
She was hiding something.

748
00:37:03,697 --> 00:37:06,533
- So you do agree with me?
- Oh, yeah.

749
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:08,447
You definitely screwed up.

750
00:37:09,231 --> 00:37:10,986
Is there something I should know?

751
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:13,842
I think he's planning on devouring me.

752
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:18,007
And they say blondes have all the fun.

753
00:37:19,478 --> 00:37:21,438
Our dead skeleton
served in the air force.

754
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:24,310
Received an other than
honorable discharge in 2003.

755
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:26,218
Did one year of community college.

756
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:28,509
He was a security guard,
boss. Worked for a law firm,

757
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,507
Kapp and Associates,
in Annandale, Virginia.

758
00:37:30,508 --> 00:37:35,099
Laurie Niles also works for Kapp and Associates,
Gibbs, she's their chief financial officer.

759
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,911
So she knew him.

760
00:37:35,912 --> 00:37:36,502
Oh, yeah.

761
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:37,861
She hired him to abduct her daughter.

762
00:37:37,862 --> 00:37:39,400
I mean, it's the only
thing that makes sense.

763
00:37:39,401 --> 00:37:40,761
There's another reason.

764
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:43,643
They kidnapped her because they
want Laurie to do something.

765
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:45,019
Like what?

766
00:37:45,957 --> 00:37:48,124
Ooh, got a hit on a BOLO here.

767
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:49,944
Yeah, and, McGee?

768
00:37:50,108 --> 00:37:53,764
And this is strange because I
just entered it into the system.

769
00:37:54,729 --> 00:37:56,987
It's Varon's vehicle,
and it's been moving.

770
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,564
There's a cop following it.

771
00:37:59,565 --> 00:38:01,650
No, the hits were
generated electronically.

772
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:03,773
It's his E-Z Pass for
high-speed toll lanes.

773
00:38:03,774 --> 00:38:05,375
He's doing a lot of
driving for a dead guy.

774
00:38:05,376 --> 00:38:08,265
It left Woodridge right after Laurie
Niles and her sister disappeared.

775
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:10,840
Made a little run up to Manassas
not too far from Miller's apartment.

776
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:12,388
Last hit was five minutes ago.

777
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:15,835
Annandale-- one exit from
Kapp and Associates Law Firm.

778
00:38:18,907 --> 00:38:20,182
We're in.

779
00:38:23,857 --> 00:38:25,796
That's from Sarah's costume.

780
00:38:29,524 --> 00:38:30,752
Clear.

781
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:34,133
Plates match our
skeleton's car in the parking lot.

782
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:38,649
You two,

783
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:39,912
find the girl.

784
00:38:55,137 --> 00:38:58,131
In the last office. Far room, far room.

785
00:38:58,132 --> 00:39:00,070
Visual contact on the sisters.

786
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,618
Appears to be one male Caucasian,

787
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,658
approximately 35 years old holding them
hostage with a semiautomatic weapon.

788
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:08,101
You got a positive
I.D. on the little girl?

789
00:39:08,256 --> 00:39:11,181
That's a negative I can only see
the left side of the room, boss.

790
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:21,977
I'm in.

791
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:24,761
The insurance money's here.

792
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,288
All $3 million.

793
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:29,080
Now all you have to do is transfer to
these accounts and we call it a day.

794
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:30,294
I want my daughter first.

795
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:32,582
You'll get her once
you transfer the cash.

796
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:36,794
You've been smart so far, Mrs. Niles.

797
00:39:36,947 --> 00:39:39,120
You played along to protect
your little princess.

798
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:41,257
Hate to see you blow it now.

799
00:39:41,308 --> 00:39:43,236
You shot my husband.

800
00:39:43,237 --> 00:39:44,771
I didn't have a choice.

801
00:39:44,772 --> 00:39:46,700
We were supposed to kidnap
him and the girl, but...

802
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:48,563
he chose to fight back.

803
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:51,334
Don't make the same mistake.

804
00:39:52,317 --> 00:39:54,808
How-how do I know
you're not going to just

805
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,781
kill us when I transfer this?

806
00:39:56,782 --> 00:39:57,971
I'll kill you if you don't.

807
00:39:57,972 --> 00:40:00,287
Look, we've come this far, Laurie.

808
00:40:00,288 --> 00:40:02,346
Just do it and let's end this.

809
00:40:02,347 --> 00:40:03,642
Please.

810
00:40:05,214 --> 00:40:07,395
NCIS is gonna figure this out.

811
00:40:07,396 --> 00:40:10,006
I've had those Navy cops
running around all night...

812
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,163
they're clueless.

813
00:40:11,164 --> 00:40:12,857
Now, transfer the damn money.

814
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:15,454
Federal agents! Drop your weapon!

815
00:40:25,097 --> 00:40:26,580
They-they still have Sarah.

816
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:28,835
If she's in the
building, we'll find her.

817
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:39,214
Clear in the hallway.

818
00:40:44,085 --> 00:40:45,249
Clear.

819
00:41:05,273 --> 00:41:06,532
Laurie.

820
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:07,854
Hey.

821
00:41:08,103 --> 00:41:10,387
We're friends with your mommy.
We're here to take you home.

822
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:12,895
We have the little girl.
Repeat, we have the little girl.

823
00:41:12,896 --> 00:41:15,163
GIBBS: Hey, hold up, hold up, hold up.

824
00:41:16,692 --> 00:41:18,048
We've got Sarah.

825
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:21,440
Once we secure the building,
you and your sister can see her.

826
00:41:22,685 --> 00:41:25,550
She's not my sister!

827
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:27,330
She's one of them!

828
00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:32,690
Told me if I didn't lie to
you, they'd kill my baby!

829
00:41:33,387 --> 00:41:34,226
Stop!

830
00:41:34,227 --> 00:41:36,568
All they wanted was the stupid money!

831
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:37,812
Gun!

832
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:41,831
Sarah!

833
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,371
Mommy!

834
00:41:44,521 --> 00:41:46,481
Oh, baby!

835
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,907
I love you so much!

836
00:41:51,368 --> 00:41:54,247
- I'm so glad you're okay.
- Oh, Mommy....

837
00:41:54,248 --> 00:41:56,734
Apparently, she doesn't have a sister.

838
00:41:57,755 --> 00:41:59,350
Halloween, Ziva.

839
00:41:59,452 --> 00:42:01,735
Be glad it only happens once a year.

840
00:42:02,445 --> 00:42:05,081
The sky is blue, the grass green,

841
00:42:05,082 --> 00:42:07,394
may we have our Halloween?

842
00:42:07,395 --> 00:42:10,125
That's how we used to say
"trick or treat" in Scotland.

843
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:10,959
Thank you.

844
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,946
You're most welcome, Your Highness.

845
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:16,640
We have a lot of desks to get to.

846
00:42:18,404 --> 00:42:19,815
You didn't have to do this.

847
00:42:19,816 --> 00:42:22,546
Well, every kid deserves
a happy Halloween.

848
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,450
Your husband is awake, and
asking for you and his daughter

849
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:28,866
There's a car waiting
for you when you're ready.

850
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:33,383
Please let Agent Gibbs know how much
I appreciate him keeping his word.

851
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:36,614
And that I'm sorry I
lied to him, but I was...

852
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,423
- I was just trying to protect...
- Trust me.

853
00:42:39,781 --> 00:42:41,056
He knows.

854
00:42:47,697 --> 00:42:49,356
Look at this.

855
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,461
Trick or treat!

856
00:42:53,462 --> 00:42:55,891
Daddy,look I got
more candy!

857
