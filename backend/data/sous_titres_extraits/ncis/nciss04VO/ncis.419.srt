1
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,649
How do you eat that crap?

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,942
Easy, like this.

3
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:18,689
Our anonymous caller was supposed to meet
us here three hours ago, boss.

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,851
I say we call it.

5
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:21,319
<i>I would love to but,</i>

6
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,689
he claims he has information
on a terrorist attack, so here we sit.

7
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:25,863
<i>Like the guy last Saturday</i>

8
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:28,074
claimed his dog was a Taliban
sympathizer?

9
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:30,621
Why are we pulling this crap duty
two weekends in a row anyway, boss?

10
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:32,621
You know I'm wondering
the same thing, Jim.

11
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:35,513
I... Hold on. Hold on. Stand by.
This is him.

12
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:38,215
We're here. Where are you?

13
00:00:38,382 --> 00:00:41,205
Close. Meet me at 408 Millstone Avenue.

14
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:42,794
I'll explain all inside.

15
00:00:42,998 --> 00:00:44,900
I prefer the meeting on the street.

16
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:45,901
I do not.

17
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:48,300
I'm a dead man
if they see me talking to you.

18
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,301
Who?

19
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:50,771
The people no one can see.

20
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:51,883
They are everywhere.

21
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,001
Invisible folks.
This should be fun.

22
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:57,322
Find him, guys.

23
00:00:58,714 --> 00:00:59,825
I think we just did.

24
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:02,073
Yeah, I got him.

25
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:07,114
The sunglasses are a nice touch.

26
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,776
How do you want us
to handle this?

27
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:11,635
Pick him up.
I'll be right behind you.

28
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:12,838
You got it.

34
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,807
Secret is to keep your front
shoulder in as long as possible.

35
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:29,492
Both eyes stay level
on the pitcher,

36
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:32,117
weight is back and you track the ball.

37
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:35,158
And you wait.

38
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:43,077
It's all about concentration.

39
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:46,539
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a cute butt?

40
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:52,549
I'm sorry. Did I just ruin
your concentration, Jethro?

41
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,280
No, it was a lousy pitch.

42
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:55,467
It happens.

43
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,791
But you still haven't
answered my question.

44
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:01,031
Do you want me to teach you
how to hit or not?

45
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:03,943
Well, considering my CO
just placed me in charge

46
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:05,781
of our softball team, yeah.

47
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:07,858
By all means, teach away.

48
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,180
This end here, it goes up.

49
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:11,654
I think I got that part.

50
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:13,071
All right.

51
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:15,367
Inside of your feet,
shoulder width apart.

52
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,991
Slightly bend the knees.

53
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:19,661
Hands together,

54
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,844
knuckles lined up.

55
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:25,277
You teach everyone this way?

56
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,679
Yeah.

57
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,659
Fast or slow?

58
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,754
Kind of depends
on what mood I'm in.

59
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:33,729
Okay, fast it is.

60
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:43,692
You got to swing to hit it.

61
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:45,800
I knew I was forgetting something.

62
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:57,939
This thing go any faster?

63
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Yeah. Gibbs.

64
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:04,962
Boss, a bomb took out
two of Cassidy's people.

65
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:06,199
Yeah, I'll be right there.

66
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,284
I got to go, Hol.

67
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:10,979
What happened to our spending
an entire weekend together?

68
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,176
I just lost two NCIS agents.

69
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:17,056
Did you know them, McGee?

70
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,986
Jim Nelson and I went to FTC together.

71
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:20,487
I was at his wedding two months ago.

72
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:22,212
This better not be
another recall drill.

73
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:24,473
I had floor seats
for the Wizards this afternoon.

74
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:26,914
It's Agent Cassidy's team out of
the Pentagon, Tony.

75
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:27,970
They were attacked.

76
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:29,038
She okay?

77
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:30,039
She survived.

78
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,683
Her men weren't as lucky.

79
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:32,823
Well, what the hell happened?

80
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:34,538
That's what we're gonna
find out, DiNozzo.

81
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:35,713
Grab your gear.

82
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:38,606
Grab your gear!

83
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:54,425
Flags of Iran, Iraq, Syria
and Saudi Arabia.

84
00:04:55,412 --> 00:04:56,943
What type of a store was this?

85
00:04:56,944 --> 00:04:58,652
McGee's working on it, Ziva.

86
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:00,716
Their deaths were almost immediate

87
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,385
if that's any consolation, Jethro.

88
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,789
No, it's not, Ducky.

89
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:05,564
No, it never is.

90
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:09,153
All our agents' wounds appear to
have been caused by shrapnel,

91
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:10,573
specifically

92
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:13,896
ball bearings and nails,

93
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:16,085
the hallmark of a homemade device.

94
00:05:16,322 --> 00:05:19,117
All emanating from
a central point of the floor.

95
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,662
Now, this man appears
to literally have been

96
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:24,720
at the heart of the explosion.

97
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:26,055
He was sitting on the bomb?

98
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:27,743
He was the bomb, DiNozzo.

99
00:05:31,155 --> 00:05:32,270
Electrical wiring.

100
00:05:32,395 --> 00:05:36,815
Yeah. Explosive amputation of legs, arms

101
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:38,234
and head.

102
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:39,281
A suicide bomber.

103
00:05:40,635 --> 00:05:42,790
I don't suppose any of you
have seen the head?

104
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,466
Still looking for it, Ducky.

105
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:46,467
Judging by the holes in the ceiling,

106
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:48,427
we may have to try the roof next.

107
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:50,744
Why blow yourself up
in an empty store?

108
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:52,616
It wasn't empty, Tony!

109
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:01,278
She insisted on being
part of the investigation.

110
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:02,686
Talked to the landlord.

111
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:05,163
Said he just rented
the place to a nonprofit group.

112
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,499
He's pulling the
paperwork. Calling him now.

113
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,624
It's my fault!
It's my fault.

114
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,181
It's not your fault, Paula.

115
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:13,919
You weren't here, Tony!

116
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:16,328
I've killed my team!
Outside.

117
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:17,721
Take it outside.

118
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,666
DiNozzo, find me that missing head.

119
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,601
Well, it's a drop ceiling,

120
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:28,077
so the thing's probably
wedged up there somewhere.

121
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:30,959
Ziva, you're going head-hunting.

122
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:43,506
I don't need a lecture right now, Gibbs.
I really don't.

123
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:48,328
I'm just bringing you this.

124
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:51,471
Thanks.

125
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:55,160
Tell me about the phone call
at tip-line this morning.

126
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:58,963
Anonymous, just a guy saying he had
info on a potential terrorist attack.

127
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:00,326
Did he name the target?

128
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:02,661
No, but it was obvious it's us.

129
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:05,662
I should have gone in
with those guys!

130
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:08,123
Well, yeah, then you'd be dead, too.
It was an ambush.

131
00:07:08,124 --> 00:07:10,100
There was nothing you could have done.

132
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:12,600
Would you feel the same way
if it was your own team?

133
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:13,601
Yes, I would.

134
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:18,984
I have a tough time
believing that, Gibbs.

135
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:21,112
Yeah, well, the difference,
Paula, is I wouldn't stop

136
00:07:21,113 --> 00:07:24,727
to grieve until I put the bastards
responsible for this in the ground.

137
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:26,914
What about you?

138
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:33,098
You knew him.

139
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:36,679
He was a good friend of mine.

140
00:07:37,263 --> 00:07:38,765
Seeing him like this...

141
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:41,198
it's almost like...

142
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,368
It could have been you.

143
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:46,135
It almost was, McGee.

144
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,794
We were supposed to work
the hotline this weekend.

145
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:52,042
Boss, you serious about that?

146
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:53,382
What happened here?!

147
00:07:53,383 --> 00:07:54,995
Hang on! Hey!

148
00:07:55,217 --> 00:07:56,233
Who are you?

149
00:07:56,234 --> 00:07:57,370
We work here.

150
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:59,863
For the Muslim Coalition
For Peace.

151
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:08,576
Yazeed, was he.
Was he in here?

152
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:11,330
We're supposed to help him
paint this afternoon.

153
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:12,818
I found it!

154
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:20,796
Allah, Yihfidhna!

155
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:22,673
You recognize him?

156
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:24,230
Yazeed Fahad,

157
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:26,914
our chapter president.

158
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:30,968
Whatever happened to Gibbs' rule
about not putting two suspects

159
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,483
in the same room?

160
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:33,721
More of a guideline.

161
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:36,016
<i>You are not listening to me,
Agent Gibbs.</i>

162
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:38,088
Yazeed Fahad was a man of peace!

163
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:41,226
He condemned suicide bombers
as cowards, agents of evil.

164
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,604
And now you wish us
to believe that he was one?

165
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:44,689
He was wearing the bomb.

166
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,442
Then he was forced to put it on.

167
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,527
By who?

168
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,568
The timing was not a coincidence.

169
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:52,361
Yazeed organized a meeting with both

170
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:54,865
Shiites and the religious
leaders for this Friday.

171
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:58,072
Clerics and holy men from five different
Arab countries will be in attendance.

172
00:08:58,073 --> 00:09:01,546
All of them prepared to issue fatwas
condemning the sectarian violence in Iraq.

173
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:04,763
Their words could save
thousands of lives.

174
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:09,448
How many will attend if they find
the man who planned it

175
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,528
was a suicide bomber?

176
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:12,423
Where were you this afternoon

177
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:14,117
when your president
was blowing himself up?

178
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:16,397
Lunch, together.

179
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:17,676
Where?

180
00:09:20,424 --> 00:09:22,362
We don't have to answer
these questions.

181
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:23,474
We're not criminals.

182
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:25,610
Well, I think you should both
get a good lawyer.

183
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:27,828
- But we did nothing...
- The Grace Street Diner.

184
00:09:28,565 --> 00:09:30,678
We were there between 1:00 and 2:30.

185
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:33,604
They're only doing their jobs, Abdul.

186
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:37,617
When they do, they'll see
that Yazeed was innocent.

187
00:09:39,456 --> 00:09:40,527
I'm going to go with you.

188
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:41,917
Gibbs wants you here, Paula.

189
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,178
Why?

190
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:44,736
Ask him.

191
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:50,681
I cannot give you my name.

192
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:52,390
Sir, we have
standard procedures.

193
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,711
If you want to stop this attack,

194
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:55,524
you will have an agent to meet me.

195
00:10:01,229 --> 00:10:03,274
McGee? Is that you?

196
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:07,607
How long have you been sitting there?

197
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:09,303
Not long.

198
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,765
I'm really sorry
about Jim Nelson.

199
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,128
I know you guys were really close.

200
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:21,304
I wouldn't have graduated
from FLETC without his help.

201
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:23,913
Then we would have never met.

202
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,527
Then maybe he'd still be alive.

203
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,754
We were supposed to take
the weekend shift.

204
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,861
Those bodies downstairs
should be us.

205
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:34,368
Timothy...

206
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:37,480
don't even think things
like that, okay?

207
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:39,566
Everything happens for a reason.

208
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:44,685
I'm not even going to ask.

209
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:48,053
Um, technically,
that was a squatting hug.

210
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,986
Or a... "squg,"

211
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:52,047
if you will, but I digress.

212
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,738
Yeah, big-time.

213
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:58,128
I have some paperwork to do.

214
00:10:58,568 --> 00:10:59,755
What have we got?

215
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:02,592
I analysed and compared
the two tip-line calls

216
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:06,006
and the one this morning
that Agent Cassidy got on site.

217
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:09,808
Same caller both times,
and I'm assuming that it's this guy,

218
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:11,518
Yazeed Fahad.

219
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,922
Can you tell us something
that we don't know, Abby?

220
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:18,271
Okay, how about this?

221
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:19,672
He was in the Navy.

222
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:22,801
And he was honorably discharged in 2004.

223
00:11:22,802 --> 00:11:24,803
The suicide bomber was a sailor.

224
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:28,780
<i>I wouldn't be too quick to rush
to judgment on that, Agent Cassidy.</i>

225
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:30,223
<i>Jethro, could you come down here?

226
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:32,990
<i>There's something you really must see.

227
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:35,711
It appears we have a bit of a mystery.

228
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:39,215
I'm not entirely certain
how our guest died.

229
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,078
Well, it's kind of obvious, Duck.

230
00:11:41,092 --> 00:11:45,259
Yes, if I base the results solely
on the damage to his body.

231
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,460
Fortunately, we have this
miraculously preserved head.

232
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:52,194
And the rate of decay of his brain tissue
doesn't even come close

233
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:53,932
to the time of the explosion.

234
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:56,310
I saw that guy walk
through the door, Ducky.

235
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:59,522
Well, Agent Cassidy, I don't see
how that's possible.

236
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:02,278
Our suicide bomber was dead

237
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,958
at least one day before
his bomb went off.

238
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:15,087
You okay?

239
00:12:15,637 --> 00:12:17,711
I just got off the phone with Amy,

240
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,340
Special Agent James Nelson's
bride of two months.

241
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,671
Correction,

242
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:25,562
widow.

243
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:27,564
Now I have to call Tom and Mary Hall.

244
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:29,497
I don't like making these calls, Jethro.

245
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,965
No C.O. does, Jen.

246
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:32,088
I know, but...

247
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:36,683
- What?
- This isn't Iraq or Afghanistan.

248
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:40,521
My people are not supposed to be
killed by suicide bombers here.

249
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,129
No, but they were, Director,

250
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,527
and it'll happen again
if you stand around here

251
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:46,866
feeling sorry for yourself.

252
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,027
I am not feeling sorry
for myself, Jethro.

253
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:52,111
I'm feeling sorry for
the agents and their families.

254
00:12:56,214 --> 00:12:57,298
But you're right.

255
00:12:57,968 --> 00:12:59,341
I have a call to make

256
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:01,286
and you have a terrorist to kill...

257
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:04,599
catch.

258
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:08,624
By the way, Ducky says

259
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:12,419
the bomber was dead at least a day
before he blew himself up.

260
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,411
You might want to give that some thought.

261
00:13:17,316 --> 00:13:18,878
We swabbed his apartment,

262
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,654
not a trace of explosives;
he was a former sailor,

263
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:24,310
president of the Muslim Society
For Promoting Peace.

264
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:27,091
Tony checked out his friends.
Their alibi holds up.

265
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:29,969
- They were at a restaurant...
- Are you going to make a point soon?

266
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:34,433
Yes.

267
00:13:34,593 --> 00:13:36,963
Who did you see entering
the building yesterday, Cassidy?

268
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:38,892
I'm not convinced
that it wasn't this guy.

269
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:41,032
I mean, how do we know that Ducky
didn't make a mistake?

270
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:43,537
- Tony?
- 'Cause Ducky doesn't make mistakes.

271
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,568
Which means what you saw yesterday
was, by definition, mistaken.

272
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:48,878
Look, even if he did die the day before,

273
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,531
it doesn't mean he
wasn't involved, right?

274
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,440
She does have a valid point, Ziva.

275
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:56,280
We don't even know what
his cause of death is.

276
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:58,706
For all we know, he could
have committed suicide.

277
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:01,835
A suicide bomber who commits suicide
before his bombing?

278
00:14:01,836 --> 00:14:05,088
- I mean, that doesn't make any sense!
- No, it doesn't.

279
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:07,077
But it does raise
an interesting point.

280
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:08,801
Imagine if you will, ladies,

281
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:12,917
an assisted suicide of a suicide bomber
who suicided before his suicide bombing.

282
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,762
It's kind of like how many chucks would
a woodchuck chuck

283
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:15,794
if a woodchuck could
chuck...

284
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:18,282
DiNozzo, what the hell
is wrong with you?

285
00:14:18,283 --> 00:14:21,796
I am just trying to lighten
the mood of the room a little bit, boss.

286
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:23,406
I got a better way: leave.

287
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:24,929
And take her with you.

288
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,972
That works for me.

289
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:27,404
That works for me too, David.

290
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:28,475
"Daa-veed."

291
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:31,030
Reevaluate the crime scene.
Do not come back until you figure out

292
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:34,409
how the guy she saw got out
before the explosion.

293
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:37,206
Are you getting soft on me,
Officer "Daa-veed"?

294
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:39,220
Look, I know what she's going through.

295
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:42,720
Sometimes you need to find something
or someone to focus your anger on.

296
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:44,131
It's your only relief.

297
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:46,908
Of course the drawback
is, you know,

298
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:49,998
that they tend to hate you for life.

299
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:54,740
If it helps her get through it,

300
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:57,173
I can live with that.

301
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:02,048
I don't know how you work with her.

302
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:04,814
- Well, I worked with you, didn't I?
-  Funny.

303
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:06,785
What do you think Gibbs
would do if I slapped her?

304
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:08,730
I'm more worried about what she'd do.

305
00:15:09,236 --> 00:15:11,049
You know, Mossad assassin and all.

306
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,996
You don't think I could take her?

307
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,324
I took you, didn't I?

308
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:17,244
Technically you did put me down,
but I distinctly remember

309
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:19,553
the floor was slippery that day.

310
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:28,774
Okay, I'll do the left, you do the right.

311
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:29,915
Okay.

312
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:31,852
You okay?

313
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,654
It's a little dusty in here.

314
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:40,686
Paula, you don't have to do this.

315
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:43,378
We both know that I do.

316
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:48,545
When did you start being so caring?

317
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:50,921
I have always been caring.

318
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:52,725
I come from a very caring family.

319
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:56,399
The DiNozzos, in fact, are celebrated
for their caringness.

320
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:58,381
Right.

321
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:02,706
Maybe I wasn't as caring once as I am now.

322
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,097
And what brought that on?

323
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:09,464
Or should I say who?

324
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:12,759
Well, you get older, you change.

325
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,478
What's her name?

326
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,656
Please tell me it's not Ziva.

327
00:16:19,657 --> 00:16:20,880
It's not Ziva.

328
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:22,634
Good.

329
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:24,035
Her name is Jeanne.

330
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:25,979
You love her?

331
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:30,211
Yeah, I do, Paula.

332
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,799
Wow, you really mean that.

333
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,223
What's the problem?

334
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:40,973
I can't tell her.

335
00:16:42,155 --> 00:16:43,903
Why can't you tell her, Tony?

336
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,290
It's just three simple little words:

337
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,291
"I love you".

338
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:50,098
It's not so simple.

339
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:55,995
We were on this climbing wall
and she made a little bet.

340
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,287
First one to the top gets to say
"I love you".

341
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:01,942
You lost on purpose.

342
00:17:01,943 --> 00:17:03,484
No, I won.

343
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:04,828
And you didn't say it?

344
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,093
You know, Tony, it's a "cliché",
but it is true,

345
00:17:11,668 --> 00:17:15,112
life is too short to not tell
someone you love them if you do.

346
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:19,604
And you do.

347
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,469
The NCIS tip-line received
two calls on Sunday.

348
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,232
If Yazeed didn't make them,
one wonders who did.

349
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:29,429
Whoever set up Cassidy's team, Abby.

350
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:31,973
Yeah, it's a rhetorical
question, McGee.

351
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:33,970
Just, just work with me here.

352
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,889
The NCIS phone logs show
that both calls came

353
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,100
from the same disposable cell phone.

354
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,436
Are you going to tell me who, Abs?

355
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,477
Well... no.

356
00:17:45,436 --> 00:17:50,074
But a third call was received
by the tip-line on Friday two days before.

357
00:17:50,497 --> 00:17:53,860
It's an exact voice match
to the calls that came in on Sunday.

358
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:56,154
<i>I must speak with an NCIS special agent.</i>

359
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:57,791
<i>What is this regarding, sir?</i>

360
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,908
<i>About someone I work with Yazeed.</i>

361
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:01,243
<i>He's what, sir?</i>

362
00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:03,746
<i>I can't... I can't talk now.</i>

363
00:18:03,747 --> 00:18:05,049
<i>I'll call back.</i>

364
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:07,798
This one we can trace.

365
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:11,107
It was logged from a company
in Annandale, Virginia.

366
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:12,613
Kertek Computing.

367
00:18:12,614 --> 00:18:14,881
They make software for disabled people.

368
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:16,318
That's where Yazeed works.

369
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,207
Worked, McGee,
before he got himself all blowned up.

370
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,942
Boss, if we can get samples
of their employees' voices,

371
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:23,840
we can match it to our caller.

372
00:18:25,131 --> 00:18:26,408
That's good work, Abby.

373
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:29,759
Not bad yourself, Elf Lord.

374
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,130
Yazeed is dead?

375
00:18:36,402 --> 00:18:37,694
You're sure of this?

376
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,695
Very.

377
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:39,883
How did this happen?

378
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:41,467
Cause of death is still being determined.

379
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:42,788
So you believe he was murdered.

380
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,008
What makes you think that?

381
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:47,707
Three federal agents in my office
may have something to do with it.

382
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,460
Mr. Abu Selom, what did Yazeed
do here at your company?

383
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:51,735
He was an instructor.

384
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:55,518
He taught various classes on how
to best utilize our software.

385
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,521
We're going to need to speak
to each one of your employees.

386
00:18:57,522 --> 00:19:01,379
As well as check out Yazeed's office
and any computers he had access to.

387
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,877
- You have a warrant?
- I can get one soon enough.

388
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,001
Maybe you won't need one
if you just tell me

389
00:19:07,002 --> 00:19:09,237
why Yazeed is dead, Agent Gibbs.

390
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:11,364
You watch the news lately?

391
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:13,770
Yesterday? Right around this time?

392
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:18,465
The policemen that were killed
by the suicide bomb?

393
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:22,015
They weren't police officers.
They were NCIS Special Agents.

394
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:23,238
That's us.

395
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:25,533
Yazeed Fahad, he was the bomber.

396
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,133
Oh, no.

397
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:28,634
No.

398
00:19:35,948 --> 00:19:38,602
You can talk to whoever you like.

399
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,758
Okay, let's try this a different way.

400
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,197
How many seconds between
our bad guy coming in here

401
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:53,648
and the explosion, Paula?

402
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:55,948
Maybe ten... twelve seconds.

403
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:58,572
Not a lot of time for our
bad guy to get out of here

404
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,949
before this place was turned
into The Killing Fields.

405
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,208
It blew once my team closed the door.

406
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:04,572
So where'd he go?

407
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:06,531
There's no back door,
there's no side rooms.

408
00:20:06,532 --> 00:20:09,136
How does a dirtbag
just vanish into thin air?

409
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:18,301
Gibbs is almost done with the interviews.
What about you?

410
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:21,761
Just finishing downloading all the folders
Yazeed kept on the company servers.

411
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,167
Any of them sound like the voice on
the tip-line?

412
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:27,059
Not to my ears,
but Gibbs is recording them.

413
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:30,013
Ah, they don't seem
very pleased with us.

414
00:20:30,014 --> 00:20:32,347
Gibbs tends to have that effect on people.

415
00:20:33,174 --> 00:20:34,495
<i>We develop the...</i>

416
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,831
Sorry, guys.

417
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:41,861
None of these voices match our caller.

418
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:44,075
Are you sure that was every male employee?

419
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,323
All but one, Abby.

420
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:46,408
Yazeed Fahad.

421
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:48,855
Who couldn't have made any calls
because he was dead at the time.

422
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:50,941
We don't have a voice
sample of his anyway.

423
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:52,081
Yes, we do.

424
00:20:52,082 --> 00:20:54,097
This is one of his training DVDs.

425
00:20:56,744 --> 00:20:58,621
All right, you guys ready
to give this a shot?

426
00:20:58,622 --> 00:20:59,956
30 minutes ago, Abs.

427
00:20:59,957 --> 00:21:03,402
We had to compress the DVD audio to match
the quality of the original phone calls

428
00:21:03,403 --> 00:21:05,168
- to make an accurate...
- Come on, McGee,

429
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:06,767
will you just do it?

430
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:08,537
We're doing it.

431
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:09,766
Okay, Yazeed's DVD

432
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:12,584
audio is on the top, and the
caller's is on the bottom.

433
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:14,864
We have eight key words
from each soundtrack.

434
00:21:14,865 --> 00:21:17,269
But if Ducky was right about
Yazeed's time of death...

435
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,264
This has been a whole lot
of work for nothing.

436
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:20,269
Okay...

437
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,049
<i>And... meet... people...</i>

438
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:24,218
<i>invisible... listen...</i>

439
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:26,329
<i>close... suspect...</i>

440
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,518
<i>back...</i>

441
00:21:28,568 --> 00:21:31,265
It's an exact match.
Yazeed made the phone calls.

442
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:32,725
But how is that possible?

443
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:36,368
I never thought I would say this,
but Ducky was wrong.

444
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:40,870
Yazeed was still alive when Cassidy's
team walked into that building.

445
00:21:45,531 --> 00:21:47,518
Evidence cannot tell you two completely

446
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,330
contradictory things
at the same time, McGee.

447
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:51,909
No, it can't...
except when it does.

448
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,524
It doesn't make any sense!

449
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:55,435
Well, perhaps you need
a fresh pair of eyes.

450
00:21:55,436 --> 00:21:56,617
What do you have so far?

451
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:59,273
Yazeed Fahad,
a former American sailor

452
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:02,055
called our tip-line to warn
of a pending terrorist attack.

453
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:03,515
Yazeed set the meet here,

454
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:05,475
a building with only one way
of getting in and out.

455
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:08,243
Agents Hull and Nelson followed him into
the building.

456
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:12,035
Both of them died seconds later
when Yazeed activated his suicide vest.

457
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:14,755
According to Ducky,
he had been dead for a day.

458
00:22:15,178 --> 00:22:16,193
How can that be?

459
00:22:16,194 --> 00:22:18,626
Well, you can't blow up a dead man, McGee.

460
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:20,495
True, but Abby has proof

461
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:23,220
Yazeed was talking to Cassidy
seconds before the explosion.

462
00:22:23,221 --> 00:22:24,842
Someone micking his voice.

463
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,886
Audio forensics say it's an exact match.

464
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,582
And there's no other way
out of the building?

465
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:31,052
No. We covered every inch of it.

466
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:33,082
He's like Shrödinger's cat;

467
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,293
alive and dead at the same time.

468
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,104
Existing in a super position.

469
00:22:39,632 --> 00:22:42,330
It's quantum physics...
theory.

470
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:46,279
When faced with a situation like this,
the solution's obvious.

471
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,113
One of them's wrong.

472
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:51,127
I was going to use the
term "mistaken", but yes.

473
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:53,341
So we have to choose
between Abby and Ducky?

474
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:55,135
I'd rather be McGee's cat.

475
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:57,272
So which one are you leaning toward?

476
00:22:57,957 --> 00:22:59,347
Neither.

477
00:23:00,306 --> 00:23:02,281
My money's on DiNozzo.

478
00:23:09,913 --> 00:23:11,457
I let you down.

479
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,072
I give you my word,
I'm gonna get this bastard.

480
00:23:15,587 --> 00:23:17,050
Who are you talking to?

481
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,963
No one, me.

482
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:23,274
I got the goodies:

483
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,562
cigar, paper towel,

484
00:23:27,563 --> 00:23:29,912
water and a candy bar.

485
00:23:30,545 --> 00:23:31,717
That one's for you.

486
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:33,747
Can I have the cigar?

487
00:23:34,484 --> 00:23:35,680
Well, I need it.

488
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,124
If there is a secret passageway in here,

489
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,685
I'm finding it.

490
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:41,520
How are you gonna do that?

491
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:46,563
I saw it in this old monster movie.

492
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:48,218
This guy...

493
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:51,625
is trying to find his girlfriend

494
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,378
in some evil scientist's castle.

495
00:24:00,537 --> 00:24:04,037
Now don't move... too much or talk.

496
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:06,571
And if there are any gaps
in these walls,

497
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:09,338
then the air pressure should
suck some smoke through 'em.

498
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:11,448
DiNozzo, we checked this wall.

499
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,769
It's solid brick.

500
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,897
You ever hear of a secret passageway?

501
00:24:14,898 --> 00:24:17,525
No, this wall shares
with the building next to it.

502
00:24:17,526 --> 00:24:19,319
How could there be a passageway?

503
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,511
Okay, Paula, a secret door, then.

504
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:26,084
All right, we're running out of daylight.
I'm gonna be in the car.

505
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:32,299
Special Agent Cassidy...

506
00:24:33,783 --> 00:24:35,326
check this out.

507
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,864
I'm gonna go get
a pry bar from the trunk.

508
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:50,073
I can't believe that.

509
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:52,531
Believe that.

510
00:25:04,824 --> 00:25:07,021
All right, DiNozzo, it's time
to get serious.

511
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:09,073
You're messing with a buckeye.

512
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:11,221
You want it, I'll bring it.

513
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:12,469
I'm from Ohio.

514
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:14,006
One, two.

515
00:25:20,471 --> 00:25:22,373
I thought I'd just check it
from this side.

516
00:25:22,374 --> 00:25:23,649
This thing is cool.

517
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,197
Are you okay?

518
00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:29,690
It's a old college football injury.

519
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,978
That do close kind of fast, don't it?

520
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,563
It wouldn't be much of a secret door

521
00:25:47,564 --> 00:25:49,777
if it stayed open long now, would it?

522
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,096
Tony, look.

523
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,375
The guy that I saw was wearing
mirrored shades this shape.

524
00:25:55,376 --> 00:25:58,671
He probably dropped them hauling ass
from the explosion.

525
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:01,744
Congratulations, you did see him.

526
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,775
Means you're not crazy.

527
00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:06,096
Not yet at least.

528
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,422
Ah, Mr. Palmer, did you manage...?

529
00:26:10,423 --> 00:26:11,923
You want to see us, Duck?

530
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:16,501
Did you pass Mr. Palmer
on your way down here?

531
00:26:16,502 --> 00:26:18,254
- No.
- I swear, every time

532
00:26:18,255 --> 00:26:21,818
I turn my back these days that young
man is running off somewhere.

533
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:24,031
Well, you should try smacking him
in the back of the head.

534
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:26,868
- It did wonders for DiNozzo and McGee.
- Well, I did.

535
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:29,206
Mr. Palmer seemed to enjoy it.

536
00:26:30,207 --> 00:26:31,458
I'll remember that.

537
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:34,907
I apologize for the delay
in determining the exact cause

538
00:26:34,908 --> 00:26:36,617
of Yazeed's death, but the bomb

539
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:38,850
didn't leave us much to work with.

540
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:42,357
Thankfully, his brain
survived relatively unscathed.

541
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:46,834
My first clue was the massive accumulation
of lactic acid in its cells.

542
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:49,469
This normally occurs
when the brain is forced

543
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,796
to obtain energy by anaerobic glycolysis.

544
00:26:52,797 --> 00:26:54,321
Yeah, naturally, Duck.

545
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:59,387
I had a series of CAT scans
done to confirm my suspicions.

546
00:26:59,388 --> 00:27:02,835
These dark areas show the
most brain damage,

547
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:05,821
all areas associated with rapid

548
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,975
and sudden loss of oxygen.

549
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:09,673
- He was suffocated.
- Yes.

550
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:11,228
You have enough left to tell me how?

551
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,480
Oh, yes.

552
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:16,099
Yazeed was suffocated
with a silicone-based substance

553
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:21,183
that was forced into his mouth and nose,
allowed to harden and then removed.

554
00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:25,340
Whoever did it was probably
trying to make a mask of his face.

555
00:27:25,341 --> 00:27:28,060
Abby says it's latex.

556
00:27:28,061 --> 00:27:30,160
Abby also says you're wrong.

557
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:33,622
So I've heard.
Only I'm afraid it's the other way around.

558
00:27:33,623 --> 00:27:37,477
This man was dead long before
his bomb went off.

559
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,794
I'd stake my career on it.

560
00:27:44,785 --> 00:27:47,640
- You guys miss me today, Abs?
- Why, where were you?

561
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:50,027
Never mind.

562
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:51,640
Of course I did, Tony.

563
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:54,741
Sorry. Are you okay?

564
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,447
Cassidy hit me.

565
00:27:56,697 --> 00:27:59,381
If I'd punched him, Abby,
he wouldn't be standing.

566
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:03,650
Never lie to a woman, Anthony DiNozzo.

567
00:28:05,432 --> 00:28:06,753
What do we got, McGeekle?

568
00:28:06,754 --> 00:28:08,268
Well, Ducky is still saying that

569
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,953
Yazeed was dead when the bomb went off,
and Abby is saying he was alive.

570
00:28:11,954 --> 00:28:14,340
- What did Gibbs say?
- Where the hell have you been, DiNozzo?

571
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:16,370
Solving the mystery
of the vanishing dirtbag, boss.

572
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:17,919
Yeah, well, it took you long enough.

573
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,661
He... found a secret passageway
into the store next to it.

574
00:28:20,662 --> 00:28:23,313
It was actually quite impressive.

575
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,232
Turns out both places were part of a

576
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:27,885
magic joke shop that closed down
about 20 years ago.

577
00:28:27,886 --> 00:28:29,044
So I was right.

578
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,975
You didn't see Yazeed enter the building.

579
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:32,560
Thank you for pointing that out...

580
00:28:33,436 --> 00:28:34,965
- Officer David.
- "Daa-veed"!

581
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:39,011
But now we know we're looking
for another man, and...

582
00:28:39,012 --> 00:28:42,307
we're hoping, praying that
you can pull a print off that.

583
00:28:42,308 --> 00:28:44,760
If there is a print, if there is a fiber,

584
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:48,460
if there is a drop of dried sweat
I will find it.

585
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:50,893
Not bad.

586
00:28:52,853 --> 00:28:54,716
Hey, boss...

587
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,211
I got a question for you.

588
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,768
That thing you said yesterday

589
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:04,186
we were really supposed to have
the weekend duty Cassidy's team took?

590
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:07,051
- Yep.
- How'd we get out of that?

591
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:09,192
I asked.

592
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:13,452
So that really could have been us?

593
00:29:13,453 --> 00:29:16,594
It could have been us every
single damn day of the week.

594
00:29:16,595 --> 00:29:17,769
Sometimes it has been.

595
00:29:18,608 --> 00:29:21,719
You want to worry about something?
Worry about tomorrow.

596
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:33,995
Going off to war, Gunny?

597
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:35,747
You trying to get rid of me.

598
00:29:35,748 --> 00:29:37,526
I haven't decided yet.

599
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:40,314
Well, while you're thinking about it,

600
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:42,826
why don't we pound
down some of that chow?

601
00:29:43,257 --> 00:29:45,092
Spoken like a true Marine.

602
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:47,586
I heard what happened.

603
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,550
Anything I can do?

604
00:29:50,928 --> 00:29:52,487
Yeah, chopsticks?

605
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,421
Anything else?

606
00:29:57,144 --> 00:29:58,211
Soy sauce.

607
00:30:00,987 --> 00:30:02,987
You're not gonna talk
about it, are you?

608
00:30:02,988 --> 00:30:04,011
Nope.

609
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,776
Got it.

610
00:30:21,702 --> 00:30:24,377
I had a very good time
at the batting cage.

611
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:27,334
Yep. It was fun.

612
00:30:27,801 --> 00:30:29,634
We should do that
again sometime.

613
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:32,668
Yeah, we should.

614
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:35,142
Too bad our schedules are polar opposite.

615
00:30:36,187 --> 00:30:38,690
Must be a CID/NCIS thing.

616
00:30:39,781 --> 00:30:42,632
Well, someone's got to keep the wolf
away from the door.

617
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,407
That's why I've been thinking.

618
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,997
Coming up on my 20-year mark next month.

619
00:30:46,998 --> 00:30:48,399
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

620
00:30:49,274 --> 00:30:51,610
You're right in the zone
for full-bird colonel.

621
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:53,677
I'm thinking about retiring, Jethro.

622
00:30:56,546 --> 00:31:01,117
Settling down, you know, making
some time for the people in my life.

623
00:31:05,803 --> 00:31:07,033
So what do you think?

624
00:31:10,893 --> 00:31:12,798
- Where's Gibbs?
- We found him.

625
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:14,328
- Who?
- That dirtbag who took

626
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:15,928
my team into that slaughterhouse.

627
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:18,843
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs!
We got a fingerprint match off the piece

628
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:21,449
of mirrored sunglass lens that Cassidy
and Tony found.

629
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,620
Salman Umar we interviewed him yesterday
at Kertek Computing.

630
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:27,929
I got two fulls, a right index
and a forefinger

631
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,472
and I got a partial
on the left thumb.

632
00:31:29,494 --> 00:31:32,492
I also found his home address
and a couple of his uncles

633
00:31:32,493 --> 00:31:34,168
that lived in...

634
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:37,060
Be safe.

635
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:42,118
Low and slow, McGee.

636
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:44,343
Take the rear exit and don't spook him.

637
00:31:44,344 --> 00:31:45,677
We take him alive.

638
00:31:45,678 --> 00:31:47,861
Find out if he's working
with anybody else.

639
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:49,593
I don't get an answer from you, Cassidy,

640
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:51,428
I'll take your weapon from you right now.

641
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:54,098
Alive. Alive, I got it. I got it.

642
00:31:55,224 --> 00:31:57,977
Well, Special Agent Gibbs,
has there been some development?

643
00:31:57,978 --> 00:32:00,291
Need to ask your employees
a few more questions.

644
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:02,989
You already cost me a full
day's work yesterday.

645
00:32:07,242 --> 00:32:08,438
Oh, damn it.

646
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:10,343
NCIS! Everybody get down!

647
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:12,058
On the floor! Now!

648
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,248
We had no choice, Gibbs.

649
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,667
If we had not acted, he
would have shot someone.

650
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:42,937
We had a choice.
I could have left her back at NCIS.

651
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:44,970
He was carrying this.

652
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:46,388
I want to know why.

653
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:47,683
Yeah.

654
00:32:51,061 --> 00:32:52,424
It's Arabic. Read it.

655
00:32:54,217 --> 00:32:57,436
"A covenant from Mecca sponsored
by the Muslim Coalition for Peace".

656
00:32:57,437 --> 00:32:59,749
The flyer for the conference on Friday.

657
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:01,395
You think he was planning on attending?

658
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,697
I doubt that, Officer "Daa-vid".

659
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:07,312
Umar was quite vocal about his feelings
toward Shiites.

660
00:33:07,313 --> 00:33:11,021
He used to argue quite a bit with Yazeed
on how they were destroying Iraq.

661
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,761
Well, it would have been nice
to have known that yesterday.

662
00:33:13,762 --> 00:33:16,376
People have a right to their
own opinions, Agent Gibbs.

663
00:33:16,377 --> 00:33:19,654
His were usually ignorant and
colored by his own prejudice.

664
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:23,304
- Still, I can't believe that he would...
- That he would kill over them?

665
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,236
<i>Apple, toast...</i>

666
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:28,883
Boss, you should see this.

667
00:33:28,944 --> 00:33:33,185
<i>...pig, giraffe, Yankee, white.</i>

668
00:33:33,825 --> 00:33:36,161
Is it me or does this sound
like Yazeed Fahad's voice?

669
00:33:36,162 --> 00:33:37,218
Turn it up.

670
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:40,891
<i>...Holland, black, display,</i>

671
00:33:41,503 --> 00:33:44,042
<i>results, oriented.</i>

672
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:46,440
What the hell kind
of program is that, McGee?

673
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,946
V.S. Twelve. It's still in development.

674
00:33:48,947 --> 00:33:50,648
It's a vocal simulation.

675
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:54,941
It allows disabled people who can't talk
to converse in a natural sounding voice.

676
00:33:54,942 --> 00:33:56,312
Just like Stephen Hawking,

677
00:33:56,313 --> 00:33:58,001
you type and the computer says the words.

678
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,948
Yes, but ours uses
a 3D model of the vocal chords

679
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:04,532
to resonate cavities in the head
creating a lifelike sound.

680
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:06,423
Umar was our main programmer.

681
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:08,245
Would explain how Yazeed

682
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,108
was making phone calls
from the dead, right?

683
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:12,097
But I don't see how
he could have done it.

684
00:34:12,098 --> 00:34:15,689
It would have required
a CAT scan of Yazeed's throat and mouth.

685
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:19,126
For a terrorist whack job,
Omar is an amazing programmer.

686
00:34:19,127 --> 00:34:20,756
Amazing enough to fool me.

687
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:23,872
This recreates Yazeed's voice flawlessly.

688
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:27,102
<i>Now you know why you
found traces of latex</i>

689
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:28,943
<i>in my throat and mouth, Abby.</i>

690
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:31,049
Well, yes, I do, Yazeed.

691
00:34:32,134 --> 00:34:33,609
<i>What about you, Tony?</i>

692
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,328
<i>And I like your shirt, by the way.</i>

693
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:36,649
<i>It's sexy.</i>

694
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:39,930
Thanks, it's from the George
Peppard Collection, I'm...

695
00:34:40,569 --> 00:34:41,569
Abby.

696
00:34:41,738 --> 00:34:43,392
Sorry.
Sorry.

697
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:46,006
Umar didn't need a CAT scan for Yazeed.

698
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:49,018
He poured hot latex down his throat
and cast a mold.

699
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:53,362
All he had to do was laser-scan
it into his computer,

700
00:34:53,363 --> 00:34:54,963
input the results into the program.

701
00:34:54,964 --> 00:34:56,019
Mystery solved.

702
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,995
Umar was who you heard
type-talking on the phone, Paula.

703
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:02,242
The guy that I saw was not
carrying a laptop and typing.

704
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,626
I would have definitely noticed that.

705
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:06,422
Means he wasn't working alone.

706
00:35:07,696 --> 00:35:08,711
<i>Hey, Gibbs.</i>

707
00:35:08,712 --> 00:35:09,759
<i>Why no Caf-POW?</i>

708
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,607
<i>I'll shut up now.</i>

709
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:17,569
Your team was set up,
but they weren't the target.

710
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,702
Yazeed was.

711
00:35:18,703 --> 00:35:21,069
They were trying to stop his Sunni-Shia
peace conference.

712
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,070
By turning him into a suicide bomber?

713
00:35:23,071 --> 00:35:24,404
It almost worked, Paula.

714
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:28,253
But luckily for us, Yazeed
lost his head, literally.

715
00:35:28,254 --> 00:35:29,852
We don't know that it didn't work.

716
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:31,723
At this point, who's going
to show up to this thing?

717
00:35:31,724 --> 00:35:33,478
You'd be surprised, Cassidy.

718
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:35,853
We're not the only ones
who refuse to bow down to terrorism.

719
00:35:35,854 --> 00:35:37,619
They're going ahead
with the conference anyway?

720
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,071
Now that we've cleared Yazeed.

721
00:35:39,072 --> 00:35:40,758
But we only got one of them.

722
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:42,320
What if somebody else tries to stop it?

723
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:43,702
We kill them, Abby.

724
00:35:44,188 --> 00:35:45,259
We catch them.

725
00:35:45,592 --> 00:35:48,060
- That's the preferred term.
- I like hers better.

726
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:53,912
If there are still any holdouts,

727
00:35:53,913 --> 00:35:57,068
I will personally call
and offer reassurances

728
00:35:57,069 --> 00:36:00,002
that Yazeed Fahad was
the victim of a terrorist

729
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,740
bombing and not the perpetrator.

730
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:05,344
I'm sure a reassurance from you will
encourage people to attend, Director.

731
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:07,949
This incident has only
strengthened our resolve.

732
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,505
And made your peace
conference a major target.

733
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:12,910
All the more reason for us not
to back down, Agent Gibbs.

734
00:36:12,911 --> 00:36:14,697
That's why we're going to help.

735
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:17,709
I have contacted the FBI and Metro Police,

736
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,334
and they've agreed to increase
security at your conference.

737
00:36:20,335 --> 00:36:23,880
I will also be assigning agents
for close protection

738
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,574
of the senior clerics that will be
attending the event.

739
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:28,635
- Bodyguards?
- Where they go, we go.

740
00:36:30,323 --> 00:36:32,886
Yazeed always spoke highly
of his time in your Navy.

741
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:35,263
- Now I can see why.
- We are in your debt.

742
00:36:35,264 --> 00:36:39,358
If your event lessens or ends
the insurgency in Iraq,

743
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,865
it is us who are in your debt, gentlemen.

744
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,691
Thank you for your support, Director.

745
00:36:47,075 --> 00:36:48,075
Thank you.

746
00:36:50,386 --> 00:36:52,075
Sheik Abu Talid Yusef,

747
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,013
the senior Sunni cleric in attendance.

748
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:55,625
He's yours for the day, Tony.

749
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:58,824
Sheik Ali Bashir, the senior Shia cleric
is Cassidy's,

750
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:03,760
and the most senior cleric at the
conference is Imam Abdul Al-Maliki.

751
00:37:03,766 --> 00:37:04,766
He's mine.

752
00:37:05,138 --> 00:37:06,804
Ziva floats between all three,

753
00:37:06,805 --> 00:37:08,209
depending on the situation.

754
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,129
The quickest way to stop the conference
is to target one of these men.

755
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,577
Well, we're not gonna let that happen.

756
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:13,807
Boss, what about me?

757
00:37:14,578 --> 00:37:16,670
Yeah, right. Almost forgot.

758
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:19,506
Names of everyone attending:
run them down.

759
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:21,806
Look for any links to terrorist groups.

760
00:37:22,317 --> 00:37:24,343
There looks to be over
300 names here, and

761
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:25,887
the conference starts
in less than six hours.

762
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,390
Yeah. Why you still
standing there, McGee?

763
00:37:29,044 --> 00:37:30,044
Right.

764
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:32,117
We pick them up at their hotels
one hour before?

765
00:37:32,118 --> 00:37:34,578
No. A little change of plans.

766
00:37:34,828 --> 00:37:36,066
We pick them up now.

767
00:37:36,067 --> 00:37:37,443
A little field trip.

768
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:40,918
They want to hold a ceremony
for Yazeed and Cassidy's team.

769
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:42,629
What kind of ceremony?

770
00:37:42,641 --> 00:37:43,863
- A memorial.
- Where?

771
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,599
Where they died.

772
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:00,577
I've never been much
for praying, but...

773
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:02,446
after this, I'm...

774
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,996
Hall and Nelson were good men.

775
00:38:06,395 --> 00:38:07,450
They were the best.

776
00:38:11,143 --> 00:38:12,410
I could have saved them.

777
00:38:12,411 --> 00:38:15,052
Paula, that's not true.

778
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:17,041
I could've turned down the weekend
duty, Tony.

779
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:19,629
There's just no way we should've
had it two weeks in a row.

780
00:38:21,117 --> 00:38:22,718
It was supposed to be us.

781
00:38:23,022 --> 00:38:24,190
"Us" what?

782
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:28,207
It was our team that was supposed
to take it.

783
00:38:34,957 --> 00:38:37,543
Oh... I mean, doesn't matter.

784
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,212
Nothing does.

785
00:38:40,772 --> 00:38:42,383
I was supposed
to be in here.

786
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:43,708
I know it.

787
00:38:46,902 --> 00:38:48,269
But...

788
00:38:49,224 --> 00:38:50,460
here I am.

789
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:55,550
Very clever.

790
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:56,639
This side is clear.

791
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:01,905
I didn't think anything
could make you jump, Officer "Daa-vid".

792
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,309
That was merely a reflex.

793
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,254
In America, we call that jumping.

794
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:09,509
In Mossad, we call that the difference
between life and death.

795
00:39:17,108 --> 00:39:21,315
I'm just going, I'm going to let, Gibbs
know that we're... we're clear over there.

796
00:39:32,113 --> 00:39:33,670
Something wrong?

797
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,603
It was supposed to be us.

798
00:39:35,937 --> 00:39:37,578
But it wasn't.

799
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:39,357
Nope.

800
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:41,835
Not this time.

801
00:39:49,777 --> 00:39:51,005
Abs, hey, you wanted to see me?

802
00:39:51,006 --> 00:39:53,046
I really need your help
with this, McGee.

803
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:55,525
Gibbs has me running down the names
of over 300 people attending

804
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,298
- a conference, I...
- Now, McGee.

805
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,145
Okay, we know that whoever was helping
Umar was using

806
00:40:01,146 --> 00:40:03,579
that computer to re-create Yazeed's voice.

807
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,581
I know. I'm the one who found the program.

808
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:08,336
So his fingerprints could be on
this keyboard, but the problem is,

809
00:40:08,337 --> 00:40:10,081
so are everybody else's
who ever typed

810
00:40:10,082 --> 00:40:11,896
on this thing,and they're all...  mashed

811
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:14,402
- on top of each other, look.
- So you're hand-tracing them?

812
00:40:14,403 --> 00:40:16,823
Well, I'm isolating the "J"
and the "F" keys because that's

813
00:40:16,824 --> 00:40:19,068
where you would park your
fingers when you're waiting to type.

814
00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:20,709
Okay, what do you need me to do?

815
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,600
I just... I need you to look at this.

816
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:24,526
I need you to check my work
because I'm getting

817
00:40:24,527 --> 00:40:26,339
dizzy from staring at it for so long.

818
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,411
Okay.

819
00:40:33,703 --> 00:40:35,496
How long is this supposed to take, boss?

820
00:40:35,497 --> 00:40:37,780
Longer than if you
helped them set up, DiNozzo.

821
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,323
When this thing starts, I want you
out front, Ziva.

822
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:44,506
What about me?

823
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:47,857
I didn't bring you here for security.

824
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,711
Look, I know I screwed up
at Kertek Computers,

825
00:40:52,712 --> 00:40:54,422
- but I'm...
- Say a prayer

826
00:40:54,423 --> 00:40:55,867
for your team, Cassidy.

827
00:40:58,529 --> 00:41:00,806
We'll take the heavy lifting on this one.

828
00:41:10,054 --> 00:41:12,320
Green one's definitely Umar.

829
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:15,407
The other two are less defined.
Probably going to take a while for...

830
00:41:15,866 --> 00:41:17,151
You were saying, McGee?

831
00:41:17,152 --> 00:41:19,237
How'd you get three
potential matches so fast?

832
00:41:19,238 --> 00:41:22,733
Because these fingerprints
were taken from the first crime scene.

833
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:28,642
Looks like it was someone
who was helping Yazeed paint the place.

834
00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:39,602
This was Yazeed's dream.

835
00:41:39,603 --> 00:41:42,828
To show the world that these
terrorist groups do not speak for us.

836
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,775
We thank you for making it a reality.

837
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:50,260
At least something good's
going to come from all of this.

838
00:41:50,656 --> 00:41:51,845
Yeah, Gibbs.

839
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:57,778
Put your hands on top of your head.

840
00:41:57,779 --> 00:41:59,572
- Boss?!
- It's one of them, DiNozzo.

841
00:41:59,573 --> 00:42:01,588
The prints on Umar's laptop match the
painting gear.

842
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:03,103
What laptop?!

843
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,157
- Where's Jamal Malik?
- He was here a minute ago.

844
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:08,737
Ziva, it's Malik! Find him!

845
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:10,447
Behind you!

846
00:42:15,683 --> 00:42:16,782
Paula!

847
00:42:17,436 --> 00:42:19,157
Allahu Akkbar!

848
00:42:46,836 --> 00:42:49,269
<i> Everybody hurt sometimes .</i>

849
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:53,093
<i> Everybody cries.</i>

850
00:42:56,565 --> 00:43:00,640
<i>Everybody hurts.</i>

851
00:43:00,641 --> 00:43:02,474
I love you, Jeanne.

852
00:43:02,475 --> 00:43:04,158
<i>Sometimes.</i> [song of R.E.M.]

853
00:43:08,468 --> 00:43:12,890
<i>Everybody hurts.</i> 

854
00:43:13,321 --> 00:43:17,369
<i>Sometimes.</i>

855
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:21,016
<i>So hold on...</i>

856
00:43:21,017 --> 00:43:24,683
<i>So hold on...</i>

857
00:43:24,684 --> 00:43:27,733
<i>So hold on...</i>
