1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,151
When you said we had
reservations, David...

2
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:10,707
I was picturing something
a little more...upscale?

3
00:00:11,028 --> 00:00:12,464
You don't recognize it?

4
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:13,465
Should I?

5
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:14,841
Think back.

6
00:00:19,716 --> 00:00:21,786
I cannot believe
you forgot.

7
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:23,310
Oh, my God.

8
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:24,565
This is where your grandmother

9
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,340
choked to death on veal.

10
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:27,341
No.

11
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:29,321
Okay, picture this...

12
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:32,322
A small water fountain
right there.

13
00:00:32,593 --> 00:00:33,593
We sat...

14
00:00:33,842 --> 00:00:34,842
right here.

15
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:38,090
You do remember.

16
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,200
That we met here?

17
00:00:40,717 --> 00:00:41,837
Oh, I remember.

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,842
I also remember it was
over ten years ago, David.

19
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:47,655
Yeah, I guess that's kind
of a long time to date.

20
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:49,450
Four's long. 12?

21
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,226
Pathetic, I know.

22
00:00:51,656 --> 00:00:54,467
I should have done
this a long time ago, so...

23
00:00:58,093 --> 00:00:59,693
Mary Elizabeth Donahue,

24
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,095
will you...

25
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:06,854
You can do it, baby.

26
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,784
It's only four simple words.

27
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:22,921

Every knife has its own
individual balance.

33
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,289
The trick is to find it.

34
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,350
When you do...

35
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,416
you get this.

36
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:22,171
Any questions?

37
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:24,415
Gibbs really approved this?

38
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,853
Yes, McGee. Why do you
keep on asking that?

39
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:29,417
Well, because they give us
Sigs for a reason.

40
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:31,042
In Mossad, we
have a saying:

41
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:32,541
Knives don't run out of bullets.

42
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:35,102
Now any questions pertaining
this particular class?

43
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:36,928
Yeah, I got one for you.

44
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:39,708
You ever kill
anyone with a spoon?

45
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:45,016
No, but I'm seriously
considering it.

46
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:47,553
All right, grab your knives.

47
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,644
So, you come right
past your ear.

48
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:53,859
Once your arm is fully
extended, you release.

49
00:02:55,857 --> 00:02:56,857
Tony!

50
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:02,195
All right. Watch and learn,
probie-sans.

51
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:11,670
Five summers at
Camp Poke-a-quatic.

52
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:13,899
I was also a pretty
mean clogger.

53
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:17,168
That doesn't leave this room.

54
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,861
Nobody cares if you
spent your summers

55
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:21,587
prancing about in
little wooden shoes.

56
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:23,201
The term is "dancing."

57
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,170
McGee...

58
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,609
Math camp?

59
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:31,734
Chess.

60
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:34,211
But at least I
didn't wear man-clogs.

61
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:37,108
Lee.

62
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:40,943
Okay...right by my ear.

63
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:49,233
I thought you said you
grew up around weapons?

64
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,922
I did. I didn't say
my father actually let

65
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:53,172
me touch any of them.

66
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:54,173
Okay.

67
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:55,986
- It's my fault, Gibbs. I was...
- Save it.

68
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:59,445
We've got a dead sailor in
Georgetown. Grab your gear.

69
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:06,235
Thank you.

70
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:10,660
Pulled his I.D.

71
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,360
Found our victim
was a sailor. Called you.

72
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:15,174
A couple found him
here last night.

73
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:17,548
Supposedly this was where
they had their first date.

74
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,316
Guy got the keys from the
landlord, wanted to propose.

75
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:21,908
Well, nothing
says "I love you,"

76
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:24,942
like a rotting corpse
in an abandoned crap hole.

77
00:04:24,943 --> 00:04:26,157
What did she say?

78
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:27,158
She, um...

79
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:29,692
says she wants this back
before he changes his mind.

80
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:30,693
Yeesh.

81
00:04:30,943 --> 00:04:32,942
And they say romance is dead.

82
00:04:32,943 --> 00:04:34,755
Wallet was next to his body.

83
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:36,067
No money, no credit cards.

84
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,444
Just a military I. D.
and driver's license.

85
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,445
Robbed.

86
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:41,317
I'd be curious to know
how he died, Agent Gibbs.

87
00:04:41,318 --> 00:04:43,431
When I know, Detective Morris,

88
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:45,467
you will know.

89
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:46,624
I appreciate it.

90
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:50,004
Got the statements we took
from the couple in my car.

91
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:51,005
All right.

92
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,507
You're on sketch details
there, Probie.

93
00:04:53,508 --> 00:04:55,569
I tell you, this thing
is making me nervous.

94
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:06,570
The larval stage
of the Musca domestica,

95
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:09,541
the common housefly,
a nuisance to most,

96
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:12,380
but invaluable to the
trained investigator.

97
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:14,822
Not to mention a great
source of protein.

98
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:16,509
Saw it on the
Discovery Channel.

99
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,571
A documentary on
survival training.

100
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:20,102
Ah, as I was saying,

101
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:22,759
they should prove helpful in
determining the time of death,

102
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,905
unless, of course, my assistant
decides to eat them first.

103
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,134
Temperature and current size,
Doctor?

104
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:30,580
These eggs couldn't
have been laid

105
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,753
in his mouth
more than a week ago.

106
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:33,933
Very good, Jethro.

107
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:35,925
It's surprisingly
warm in here.

108
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:39,698
I'd estimate he's been dead
somewhere between...

109
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,114
four and five days.

110
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:42,699
Any idea how?

111
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:46,280
Many, but with no obvious signs

112
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:48,198
of trauma or injury,
that will have to wait

113
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,571
until we get him home.

114
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:52,052
Let's get the gurney,
Mr. Palmer.

115
00:05:57,575 --> 00:05:59,935
McGee, what do you make of this?

116
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:02,384
The word "disgusting"
comes to mind.

117
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:04,905
I think he was talking
about the card.

118
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:07,026
Maybe some
kind of ticket?

119
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,555
Find out for what.

120
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:11,653
Ziva, photos.

121
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:14,327
McGee, you find any more maggots
walking around, you bag them.

122
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,632
They're evidence.

123
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:22,566
Ziva, I will give you
$100 to trade with me.

124
00:06:23,014 --> 00:06:24,951
You're afraid of bugs, McGee?

125
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:25,952
Bugs, no.

126
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,639
Uh...wriggling, faceless

127
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,350
blob creatures crawling inside
human flesh? Yes.

128
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:34,511
Believe it or not,
I used to feel the same way.

129
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:35,516
How'd you get over it?

130
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:38,762
I found that... that
if you're hungry enough,

131
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:40,945
they actually don't
taste that bad.

132
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:46,016
Our dead sailor is
Petty Officer Evan Davidson.

133
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:48,638
A corpsman stationed at
The Basic School in Quantico.

134
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,072
Reported UA four days ago.

135
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:53,702
Last seen Thursday night
at a Georgetown bar.

136
00:06:53,703 --> 00:06:55,638
Marine buds said
he hooked up with a girl

137
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,078
and left before closing.

138
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,891
Marines ever leave
before closing?

139
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:00,954
I'm gonna head down to Quantico,
get her description.

140
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:03,382
McGee, tell me about the card
we found on the body.

141
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:05,016
Where is he?

142
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:07,687
Apparently not here.

143
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,005
I'll find him.

144
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:17,661
Gibbs is looking for you.

145
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:21,512
Ziva, this is a men's room.

146
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:23,351
You can't be in here.

147
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:26,390
He wants to know what you
found out the pink ticket.

148
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,391
Hi.

149
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,619
Trying to wash
the bug germs off, yes?

150
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:33,615
Will you please leave?

151
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,120
He didn't wash his hands.

152
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:40,921
You need to learn to face
your fears, McGee.

153
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:42,085
I can help you with that.

154
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:43,642
I do not need help, okay?

155
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:45,457
I just don't like maggots.

156
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,395
Why?

157
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:49,794
Much like the concept of
a men's room, it's personal.

158
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:58,996
Have you ever wondered why
perfectly healthy individuals

159
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:00,738
suddenly and occasionally

160
00:08:01,144 --> 00:08:03,449
keel over and die,
Mr. Palmer?

161
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:05,435
Yeah, now that
you mention it...

162
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:06,680
No. No, no, no, no.

163
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:08,334
It's a trick question.

164
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:09,335
They don't.

165
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:11,165
There is always a reason.

166
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,894
Now, take our Petty Officer,
for example.

167
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:15,772
On the outside,
he appears young,

168
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:19,356
virile, perfect physical
condition, yet inside...

169
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:23,503
we find the liver
of a 75-year-old man.

170
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,649
It is swollen, scarred
and well on its way

171
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,697
to full-blown cirrhosis.

172
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,020
He's an alcoholic?

173
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:31,201
Was, Mr. Palmer.

174
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:33,398
That what killed him, Duck?

175
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,836
No, but it was certainly
a contributing factor.

176
00:08:35,837 --> 00:08:38,211
His blood-alcohol
level was five times

177
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:39,392
the legal limit.

178
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:40,744
I'm surprised
he could stand,

179
00:08:40,802 --> 00:08:43,271
never mind break
into an abandoned restaurant.

180
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,402
And his preliminary tox screen

181
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:48,900
also shows traces of Ecstasy
and other chemicals

182
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:52,173
in his blood : quite
a volatile cocktail.

183
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:53,712
What kind of other chemicals?

184
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:55,899
Abby's running
them right now.

185
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,885
It appears our young man went

186
00:08:57,934 --> 00:09:00,023
on a bender Thursday night,

187
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:02,463
one from which
he could not recover.

188
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:03,464
He OD'd.

189
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,338
That would explain the multiple
organ failures we found.

190
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:09,088
We won't know more till
we finish the autopsy.

191
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:10,744
Very good, Mr. Palmer.

192
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,699
Anything else you'd care to add?

193
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,714
Well, there's a very good chance

194
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:18,215
that this was an
accidental death, Doctor.

195
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:20,766
Nothing accidental
about it, Palmer.

196
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:25,277
People who choose to live
their lives this way

197
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:27,883
have nobody to blame
but themselves.

198
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,716
I hereby accept your challenge.

199
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:33,966
We'll meet on the field at dawn.

200
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:34,778
Weapons,

201
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,654
caffeine-fueled intellect versus

202
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:38,970
cold silicate-based
intelligence.

203
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:40,029
Until then...

204
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:42,343
I bid you a good day, sir.

205
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:44,717
Hi.

206
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:45,958
Hi.

207
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,575
You talk to your
mass spectrometer?

208
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:49,718
Yeah. Sometimes.

209
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:51,901
Why?

210
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:53,342
You challenged
it to a duel.

211
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,243
Well, it spit out
a chemical composition

212
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,777
that I'm not familiar with.

213
00:09:57,778 --> 00:09:59,903
There has to be some sense
of decorum around here.

214
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:01,402
I'm running it through
the computer now.

215
00:10:01,403 --> 00:10:03,780
Now, Gibbs is more
interested in this.

216
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:04,903
Did you find anything yet?

217
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,342
When, McGee? If you
haven't noticed,

218
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:09,048
I'm the only one here.

219
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:12,028
Which may be why I started
talking to my machines

220
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,444
in the first place.

221
00:10:13,469 --> 00:10:14,968
Well, Abs, I gotta
tell him something.

222
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:16,906
Tell him you love him, McGee.

223
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,186
It works for me.

224
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,417
Not all the time.

225
00:10:19,464 --> 00:10:20,658
Hi, Gibbs.

226
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:21,907
Just in time.

227
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:24,154
This is the mass spec

228
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:27,022
on the mystery compounds
in Petty Officer Davidson's blood.

229
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:30,094
It's organic and it's
definitely what killed him.

230
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:31,060
Meet neriin,

231
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:32,995
oleandrin and oleondroside.

232
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,845
Friends of yours,
Elf Lord?

233
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:37,750
No, Gibbs. They're not
characters from Lord of the Rings.

234
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:39,204
They're compounds...

235
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,096
found in the oleander plant.

236
00:10:41,097 --> 00:10:42,658
What drug is made from that?

237
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:44,369
None. It's pure poison.

238
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:47,410
Our Petty Officer didn't OD.

239
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:48,836
He was murdered.

240
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:00,032
What language do I have to say it in?

241
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:02,818
You obviously
don't understand English.

242
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:07,316
I said no!

243
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:10,372
- Travis.
- Yeah, Tony.

244
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:11,729
Can I get two
Belvedere martinis.

245
00:11:11,777 --> 00:11:13,763
Straight up. Very dry.
Very cold. Twist of lemon.

246
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,947
You are becoming a stalker.

247
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:17,534
No.

248
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,758
What else do you
want to call it?

249
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,259
Over is over.

250
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:26,474
Forever over.

251
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:27,786
No ciao,

252
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:28,846
no "we'll meet again"

253
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:30,142
because we won't.

254
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,350
Hey.

255
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:38,785
Hey.

256
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,788
Cheers.

257
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:46,789
Sorry.

258
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:48,851
Sante.

259
00:11:51,914 --> 00:11:52,914
Yes.

260
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:54,728
That was him.

261
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,726
And no, I will not
tell you his name.

262
00:11:57,727 --> 00:11:58,727
Did I ask?

263
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:00,225
Your eyes did.

264
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,621
What are they asking now?

265
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,595
To skip dinner.

266
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:08,408
You are amazing.

267
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:11,415
I don't know
how you do it.

268
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,915
You always want to
skip dinner, Tony.

269
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,886
But not tonight, I'm famished.

270
00:12:16,354 --> 00:12:17,354
Me, too.

271
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:20,542
Food first.

272
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,791
All right.

273
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:24,913
Our reservations aren't till 8:00.

274
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:25,974
How 'bout, uh,

275
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,654
some oysters to tide us over?

276
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:30,663
The last thing you need
is an increased libido.

277
00:12:30,664 --> 00:12:32,604
You don't believe that
old wive tale, do you?

278
00:12:32,605 --> 00:12:33,605
It's true.

279
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:36,039
Oysters are rich
in rare amino acids

280
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,279
that trigger increased levels
of sex hormones.

281
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:40,104
Two dozen malpeques, please.

282
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:40,918
We'll be at that table.

283
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,159
And more alcohol!

284
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,119
Mademoiselle.

285
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:46,876
Merci.

286
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,526
You look incredible.

287
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:58,506
I'm glad you like it.
It's my favorite.

288
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:02,609
Wasn't talking
about the dress.

289
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:05,406
I meant you, Jeanne.

290
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:10,805
Thank you.

291
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:14,243
What's that?

292
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:16,964
I'm working Wednesday.

293
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:18,681
Wednesday?

294
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,998
Valentine's Day.

295
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:23,453
Yeah.

296
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:24,681
Yeah.

297
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:27,528
Comes around fast
every year, doesn't it.

298
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:28,745
Yeah.

299
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:31,792
Well, your gift...

300
00:13:33,308 --> 00:13:34,869
is still at the store
because I...

301
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,225
I never bought it.

302
00:13:36,868 --> 00:13:37,868
Sorry.

303
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,317
You know how wonderful it is
to be with someone

304
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:44,459
who doesn't even lie
about the little things?

305
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:47,183
Go on.

306
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:48,688
Open it.

307
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:49,918
Oh, it's just not the box?

308
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:52,884
- No.
- I was gonna say it's the nicest box

309
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,422
- I've ever...
- I know, it is nice.

310
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:56,735
Oh, come on.

311
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,496
It's, uh, more permanent
than the...

312
00:13:58,497 --> 00:14:00,502
last one I tagged you with.

313
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:02,054
This is, uh...

314
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,549
This is platinum.

315
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,274
It's expensive, Jeanne.

316
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:07,014
I'm a doctor. I can afford it.

317
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:10,994
Mental Ward?

318
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:13,681
You trying
to tell me something?

319
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:15,157
It worked last time.

320
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:16,561
Yes, it did.

321
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:22,657
I've never had a gift this unique.

322
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:25,373
Or a woman.

323
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,666
Thank you.

324
00:14:35,857 --> 00:14:37,499
He doesn't give up, does he?

325
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:39,047
I'm going to
change my number.

326
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,547
Okay, don't be ridiculous.
Let me talk to him.

327
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:42,168
- No!
- Believe me, I can...

328
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:44,296
- I'll talk a little sense to him.
- I don't want you to get involved in my problem.

329
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:45,912
I can handle it.

330
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:48,178
If it doesn't go away...

331
00:14:48,794 --> 00:14:49,794
It will.

332
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:51,484
I promise.

333
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:56,269
Saved by the mollusk.

334
00:14:57,293 --> 00:14:58,293
Thanks.

335
00:14:58,517 --> 00:14:59,811
Here you go.

336
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:12,591
I changed my mind.

337
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:15,591
Let's skip dinner.

338
00:15:18,805 --> 00:15:20,297
Okay.

339
00:15:20,982 --> 00:15:21,982
Shakira.

340
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:24,423
That's who this police sketch
reminds me of.

341
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,424
Shakira.

342
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:26,736
Yes?

343
00:15:27,112 --> 00:15:28,647
You know, the singer?

344
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:31,236
The one who dances like this.

345
00:15:39,424 --> 00:15:41,482
You're not even listening
to me, are you?

346
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:45,087
Look at this police sketch.

347
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:45,733
The marine said

348
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,487
this woman left the bar
with Petty Officer Davidson.

349
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:50,258
She could be the killer.

350
00:15:50,673 --> 00:15:51,673
Hey.

351
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:57,612
Where are we going?

352
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:58,797
We're not going anywhere.

353
00:15:58,798 --> 00:15:59,923
Who are you taking, McGee?

354
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,284
Agent Gibbs around?

355
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:04,178
Brought him an early
Valentine's Day present.

356
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:11,231
He's a junkie.

357
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:13,673
Hangs out in the area
where we found your dead sailor.

358
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:15,674
Morris thinks he saw something.

359
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,864
What do you think,
Detective Carson?

360
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:19,450
It's, um, it's John.

361
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,489
Um, love the accent by the way.

362
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,053
It's, uh...

363
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:24,119
Israeli, right?

364
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,990
Not bad.

365
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,299
Most people don't recognize it.

366
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,490
I took a vacation there
a couple years ago.

367
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:32,026
Back to the question.

368
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:34,490
What makes you think
he knows anything...

369
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:35,491
John?

370
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:36,801
Well, um,

371
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:39,756
mostly this, Tony.

372
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:42,839
He had one of your Petty
Officers' credit cards on him.

373
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:48,054
I got somebody that I want
you to meet, Frankie.

374
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:50,065
This is Special Agent Gibbs.

375
00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:52,426
Wants to ask you
a few questions.

376
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:54,117
Look, I didn't do nothing wrong.

377
00:16:54,118 --> 00:16:56,180
I mean, I, I didn't even
use the card.

378
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,181
No problem.

379
00:16:57,303 --> 00:16:59,270
I just want to know
how you got it.

380
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:01,292
Oh, I found it.

381
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:03,574
You know, in the street.

382
00:17:05,618 --> 00:17:08,786
Where do you keep your credit
cards, Detective Morris?

383
00:17:09,432 --> 00:17:12,118
Oh, like 99% of the people
on this planet,

384
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,284
a wallet.

385
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:14,178
- You?
- Yeah.

386
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:15,179
Same. Same.

387
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,093
You see, we got a problem here,
Frank, because

388
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:24,048
Petty Officer Davidson's wallet was
found lying next to his body.

389
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,528
And his body wasn't out
in the street.

390
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,936
Well, you ever stop
to think, uh,

391
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,562
the guy could have dropped it?

392
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,995
Man does raise a valid point.

393
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,431
Yeah.

394
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:39,749
Yeah, works for me.

395
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Good.

396
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:42,121
So, I can...

397
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:43,434
I, I can go?

398
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:46,306
Uh, no. I think I'm gonna charge
you with murder instead.

399
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:47,496
Wait, I didn't murder nobody!

400
00:17:47,497 --> 00:17:49,687
Look, he was still breathing...

401
00:17:56,123 --> 00:17:58,564
It's almost unfair
interrogating junkies.

402
00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:00,435
It's like shooting
fish in a pond.

403
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,377
I think you mean
a barrel.

404
00:18:04,937 --> 00:18:06,722
Why would a fish
be in a barrel?

405
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:10,560
It's a good point,
I never really

406
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:11,767
thought about it before.

407
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,342
Frankie, Frankie, Frankie.

408
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,751
When I found your guy, uh,

409
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,170
he was pretty wasted.

410
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:25,251
Where?

411
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:26,558
In an alley.

412
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,739
Behind One Club.

413
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:30,687
You saw him coming out of there?

414
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:33,624
No. No, he, he was, was lying
over by some Dumpsters.

415
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,376
All right, so I decided, I
decided to keep an eye on him,

416
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:40,097
you know, to make sure
that he don't hurt himself.

417
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:44,361
I think you need to find
a new line of work.

418
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:47,524
He's dead, you retread.

419
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:49,406
Not when I saw him!

420
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:51,125
I mean, all I did,

421
00:18:51,126 --> 00:18:53,061
all right, was help him
into that restaurant

422
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:55,753
and I just, I just waited
for him to pass out.

423
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:57,344
So you could rob him?

424
00:18:58,877 --> 00:18:59,877
Well, yeah.

425
00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:01,876
Look, man, but I didn't...

426
00:19:01,877 --> 00:19:03,287
I didn't kill him.

427
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:06,638
No, but you just left
him there to die.

428
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:12,312
This is really starting
to vex me, McGee.

429
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:14,187
I mean, normally
I love lamination

430
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:15,753
because it collects
fingerprints

431
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,065
like you collect
royalty checks.

432
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:19,806
But this is completely sterile.

433
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,664
Are you sure it was
in the Petty Officer's pocket?

434
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:23,878
Yup.

435
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:25,503
Well, then how did it get there?

436
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:28,004
Either he put it in there,
or someone else did.

437
00:19:28,005 --> 00:19:29,378
Then there would be
fingerprints.

438
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:31,314
There would be oil
from skin contact,

439
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:33,441
residue from the environment it's in.

440
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:34,630
They wiped it down.

441
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,689
Why would they go
to all that trouble?

442
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,067
They could have just taken it.

443
00:19:38,068 --> 00:19:39,188
And believe me,

444
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:41,379
they went to all
that trouble.

445
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,826
Maybe they wanted us to find it.

446
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,780
Question is why?

447
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,883
What does that look like to you?

448
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:00,131
It's on the paper,

449
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,972
but it's under
the lamination.

450
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:03,446
Ink?

451
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,820
Possibly.

452
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:08,527
I'm thinking it's a message for us.

453
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:13,632
One Club's been on our
radar for the last year.

454
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:16,132
Drugs, illegal gambling,
prostitution.

455
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,421
Why haven't you breasted them?

456
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,416
She means busted.

457
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:22,762
Oh, yes. Yes, busted.
Sorry.

458
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:23,901
It's a private club.

459
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,030
We can't get in to get enough
evidence for a warrant.

460
00:20:26,082 --> 00:20:27,124
Why not raid it?

461
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,758
If they're doing half
of what you think they are,

462
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:29,695
you'll find evidence.

463
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:30,820
Not without a warrant.

464
00:20:30,821 --> 00:20:32,696
Last time, I damn near
lost my badge.

465
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:35,009
Club's lawyers ripped
into the department, big time.

466
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,540
Owner's a smart guy.

467
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,884
His name's Scott Pell.

468
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:40,572
Knows how to protect his clients.

469
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,259
If you're a member of One Club,

470
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,322
you can get away
with just about anything.

471
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:46,844
It's not the kind of club
you expect to find a sailor.

472
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,695
You gotta be rich or famous
to step through that door.

473
00:20:48,696 --> 00:20:51,181
Yeah, or have something
they want.

474
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:54,861
You two waiting for
an engraved invite?

475
00:20:57,635 --> 00:20:58,635
On the surface,

476
00:20:58,636 --> 00:21:01,196
it's a moderately priced
Italian knockoff.

477
00:21:01,197 --> 00:21:02,699
But on the inside of the heel,

478
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,120
a portable pharmacy.

479
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:06,449
Twenty four tablets
of Ecstasy.

480
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,324
Well, that could have
gotten through the door.

481
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:09,708
That's a good job, Abby.

482
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:11,821
Oh, that was just
the warm-up act, Gibbs.

483
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:14,537
The real show is in here
with McGee.

484
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:17,448
Boss.

485
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:19,949
This card was definitely
planted at the crime scene.

486
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,512
They wanted us to find it.

487
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,949
Uh, how do you
figure that?

488
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,388
Well, the blood stain was
intentionally put

489
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:26,514
underneath the lamination.

490
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:27,763
A human blood stain.

491
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:29,572
Well, that doesn't prove
that it was planted.

492
00:21:29,573 --> 00:21:32,198
They wanted us to take the
card out of the plastic.

493
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,201
And who's they?

494
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:35,217
Stop interrupting and listen.

495
00:21:35,701 --> 00:21:37,263
They being the person or persons

496
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:39,389
who killed Petty
Officer Davidson.

497
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,199
Okay, here's
where it gets weird.

498
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,451
And when I say weird,

499
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:44,449
I mean like the sick
and creepy kind of weird,

500
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,827
not the good weird, 'cause
I'm a big fan of that...

501
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:46,824
Abby.

502
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:48,761
Um, all right,
you're gonna need these.

503
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,049
All right, McGee,
hit the lights.

504
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:55,390
We sprayed the card with Luminol

505
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:56,640
to look for more blood splatter.

506
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:59,039
And instead, we found this.

507
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:03,087
It's written in blood.

508
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,640
I'd say that's creepy.

509
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:09,001
You think, DiNozzo.

510
00:22:16,311 --> 00:22:19,970
Abby analyzed the contents
of our petty officer's stomach.

511
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:23,864
We now know how the
poison was administered.

512
00:22:23,953 --> 00:22:27,384
The oleander plant
leaves were first reduced

513
00:22:27,425 --> 00:22:29,677
to a fine powder,
and then ingested.

514
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,643
Judging by the absorption rate,

515
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:34,529
it had to be in the
form of a liquid.

516
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:39,081
What's this stuff
taste like, Ducky?

517
00:22:39,082 --> 00:22:40,268
Oh, extremely bitter.

518
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:41,645
In order to disguise it,

519
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:43,519
you'd have to use something
equally strong,

520
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,820
- such as...
- Booze?

521
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:47,019
- Yeah.
- Somebody spiked his drink?

522
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,707
Well, considering
his blood alcohol level,

523
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,413
I'd say more than one.

524
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,144
How many shots of this
before you end up like he did?

525
00:22:54,145 --> 00:22:56,921
From that concentration,
no more than three or four,

526
00:22:56,968 --> 00:22:59,930
which brings me to
the real reason for this visit.

527
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,896
The note found
on the body.

528
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:04,520
- "Expect more."
- Yeah.

529
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:08,040
An average bottle contains 25 shots,

530
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,083
enough to kill seven people,

531
00:23:10,084 --> 00:23:12,026
but an entire case?

532
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:13,277
More than 60.

533
00:23:13,324 --> 00:23:15,646
Few cases, you wipe out
the entire nightclub.

534
00:23:15,647 --> 00:23:17,084
Well, bars and discotheques

535
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:19,459
have been terrorist
targets overseas.

536
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,647
It's only a matter of time
before they try it here.

537
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:26,147
Terrorists don't leave shiny
pink clue cards for us, Duck.

538
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:27,210
No, they don't.

539
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:28,545
Not do they leave threats

540
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:31,210
that can only be read
in a forensic lab.

541
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:35,343
I believe the killer is trying
to show us how clever they are.

542
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,667
"Expect more."
He's planning to do it again.

543
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:39,668
Or she.

544
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:43,681
Poison has been the weapon of choice
for women for centuries,

545
00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:47,626
except they tend to hide it
in food rather than drink.

546
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:50,424
That would explain why
my last ex-wife spent

547
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:51,843
so much time in the kitchen.

548
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,647
If Petty Officer Davidson was drinking

549
00:24:15,648 --> 00:24:17,087
in this neighborhood Thursday night,

550
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,095
it had to be here.

551
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:20,242
Doesn't exactly look
like a celebrity hangout.

552
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:22,338
That's why celebrities like it, Probie.

553
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:24,820
Ordinary people don't
even know One Club exists.

554
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:26,866
DiNozzo, find me the 
woman he was with,

555
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:28,344
and McGee, get a warrant.

556
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:28,993
On it, boss.

557
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:29,995
On what grounds?

558
00:24:29,996 --> 00:24:31,542
Dead sailor's good for me.

559
00:24:31,543 --> 00:24:33,433
Metro doesn't work like that.

560
00:24:33,796 --> 00:24:34,599
Uh, then don't.

561
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,828
Too late. We're involved.
I need grounds, Agent Gibbs.

562
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:39,354
Your witness places
the victim at the club

563
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:40,629
at the time of his murder.

564
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,420
Outside the club.

565
00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:44,173
And he wasn't exactly a witness.

566
00:24:44,174 --> 00:24:46,436
He let him die so he could rob him.

567
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,754
Agents Gibbs and Lee
to see you, Director.

568
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:00,973
Let them in, Cynthia.

569
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:09,003
What's the problem?

570
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:11,073
Jurisdiction issues with Metro Police.

571
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:12,575
They're insisting on a warrant.

572
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:13,722
And this...

573
00:25:14,735 --> 00:25:16,733
legal person won't get me one.

574
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:17,891
I've tried,Director.

575
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,229
We don't have probable cause,

576
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,816
I can't get a judge to sign off on it.

577
00:25:20,817 --> 00:25:21,868
We have a dead sailor.

578
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:22,901
We've got a killer

579
00:25:22,902 --> 00:25:24,811
leaving us messages in human blood.

580
00:25:24,812 --> 00:25:27,056
But we need to get a
warrant, sir. Not sir...Gibbs.

581
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:28,506
Special... Special Agent Gibbs.

582
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:29,952
Where did you find her?

583
00:25:29,953 --> 00:25:31,280
Harvard Law School.

584
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,329
We need a witness who
saw the petty officer

585
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,433
inside of the club.

586
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:36,012
We've got one!

587
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:40,069
- Is there a witness?
- Yes.

588
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,085
Metro Detective Morris informs me

589
00:25:42,086 --> 00:25:43,201
that he's a drug addict

590
00:25:43,202 --> 00:25:46,109
that no judge would
find reliable, Director.

591
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:48,898
Who's running this
agency, Metro Police?!

592
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:50,299
You know damn well who.

593
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,819
Find me a witness, and I will
get you that warrant, sir.

594
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:55,556
Special...

595
00:25:55,557 --> 00:25:56,715
Agent...

596
00:25:56,753 --> 00:25:57,965
Gibbs.

597
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:02,016
All right.

598
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:07,818
Don't take it personally, Michelle.

599
00:26:09,406 --> 00:26:10,957
He's right, Director.

600
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,144
He usually is.

601
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:16,204
That's what makes him
so damn irritating.

602
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,245
Thanks.

603
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:32,581
Excuse me. I need a prescription

604
00:26:32,582 --> 00:26:34,609
for this burning sensation in my loins.

605
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,996
Are you trying to outspend me?

606
00:26:37,705 --> 00:26:39,369
A Bermuda weekend?

607
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:43,686
What could be a more perfect Valentine?

608
00:26:46,645 --> 00:26:48,502
A weekend in the Bahamas?

609
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:51,813
It's interesting, though.

610
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,695
He and I must be a lot alike.

611
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:03,652
You are...

612
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:06,759
You are night and day.

613
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,754
How does that work exactly?

614
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:11,188
Am-Am I day and he's
night, or you switch us out?

615
00:27:11,189 --> 00:27:13,845
That was totally uncalled for, Tony.

616
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:19,664
That was totally uncalled for.

617
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,548
Was it, Jeanne?

618
00:27:22,027 --> 00:27:23,537
He still calls,

619
00:27:23,538 --> 00:27:26,399
plans a Valentine's
weekend in Bermuda with you.

620
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,343
I'd say that's not a man
who understands it's over.

621
00:27:29,344 --> 00:27:31,367
It's over...

622
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:32,996
for me.

623
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:35,928
I'm not so sure.

624
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:39,243
If you can't sell him, and
you won't let me handle it,

625
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:40,958
maybe it's not over for you.

626
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,129
Don't do this, Tony.

627
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,884
Okay, what if I had an ex-girlfriend

628
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:45,426
who was always calling me and planning

629
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:47,329
little romantic getaways
for the two of us?

630
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,675
- How would you feel?
- I wouldn't like it.

631
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:50,676
Well...

632
00:27:50,807 --> 00:27:53,989
But I would trust you to handle it.

633
00:27:54,969 --> 00:27:57,238
And if I didn't handle it?

634
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:00,941
Then it would be your problem.

635
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,907
Just as this is mine.

636
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:06,307
Exactly...

637
00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:08,044
wrong.

638
00:28:09,884 --> 00:28:11,226
This is our problem,

639
00:28:11,227 --> 00:28:12,266
Jeanne.

640
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,074
We need to talk, Gibbs.

641
00:28:37,325 --> 00:28:38,754
Should we call the paramedics?

642
00:28:38,755 --> 00:28:39,926
No need.

643
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,189
If they fight, it will be to the death.

644
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:46,930
Talk.

645
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,449
I used to be like you, Gibbs.

646
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,950
You were never...

647
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:51,402
like me.

648
00:28:54,141 --> 00:28:56,520
Got the dirtbags any way I could.

649
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:59,429
Let the lawyers sweat the paperwork.

650
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:01,715
About a year ago,...

651
00:29:01,716 --> 00:29:03,745
I went into a hole down on Eighth.

652
00:29:03,746 --> 00:29:06,154
The bastard in there was a bad-ass.

653
00:29:06,155 --> 00:29:08,072
Rapist, pedophile.

654
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:11,023
Scum you got to take off the
street to get sleep at night.

655
00:29:11,024 --> 00:29:13,771
I didn't have a warrant
or probable cause,

656
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:16,054
but I knew...

657
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:18,412
here,

658
00:29:18,827 --> 00:29:21,202
so I took him down hard.

659
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,455
That it,

660
00:29:23,456 --> 00:29:25,426
or should I get a refill?

661
00:29:26,118 --> 00:29:28,491
His lawyer said it was a bad bust.

662
00:29:28,492 --> 00:29:29,534
No warrant.

663
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:32,039
Judge agreed, Bad-ass walked.

664
00:29:32,691 --> 00:29:34,182
A month later,

665
00:29:35,324 --> 00:29:37,746
he raped and strangled
a six-year-old girl.

666
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:41,214
I'm never gonna make that mistake again.

667
00:29:41,586 --> 00:29:43,203
Not getting a warrant...

668
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,321
or not killing the bastard?

669
00:29:47,124 --> 00:29:49,117
Boss using the elevator
as an office again?

670
00:29:49,118 --> 00:29:50,915
Had to take the stairs.

671
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:53,105
All right.

672
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,687
Looky what I found.

673
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,537
Marines gave a pretty good description

674
00:29:58,538 --> 00:30:00,211
of Davidson's last date.

675
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:02,778
Lisa Delgado, age 23.

676
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:03,952
Where'd you find her?

677
00:30:03,953 --> 00:30:06,115
There's only two parking lots within...

678
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:07,587
within stumbling distance of the club.

679
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:10,302
So, you showed the police
sketch to parking attendants?

680
00:30:10,303 --> 00:30:12,895
Yeah and they I. D.'d her.

681
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:14,639
She's a regular at the One Club.

682
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,194
Arrives alone and
usually leaves with her...

683
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:20,248
Porsche or Ferrari or Mercedes SLR.

684
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:21,249
Good thinking, DiNozzo.

685
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,692
Did you think to pick her up?

686
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:23,982
Uh, I did.

687
00:30:23,983 --> 00:30:26,210
Roommate hasn't seen her
since Thursday. Not unusual.

688
00:30:26,211 --> 00:30:27,750
She can be gone for days.

689
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:30,346
She is, after all, in
the escort business.

690
00:30:30,347 --> 00:30:31,505
The club owner, Pell,

691
00:30:31,506 --> 00:30:33,311
lets some of the escorts stay overnight.

692
00:30:33,312 --> 00:30:34,523
So, she could be there now.

693
00:30:34,524 --> 00:30:37,411
If she is, we'll be
there when she comes out.

694
00:30:37,981 --> 00:30:39,718
And if she's not?

695
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:42,274
We'll be there when she goes in.

696
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,323
That, uh... that Feb's?

697
00:30:55,324 --> 00:30:56,961
Pro cheerleaders

698
00:30:56,962 --> 00:30:58,080
in the off-season.

699
00:30:58,081 --> 00:31:01,081
Yeah, buddy in Vice told
me one of them's a man.

700
00:31:02,287 --> 00:31:03,519
No.

701
00:31:04,235 --> 00:31:05,334
Well,

702
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:07,519
I probably shouldn't be looking
at it anyway. I'm trying to

703
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,823
wrap my head around the idea
of a monogamous relationship.

704
00:31:10,824 --> 00:31:13,101
That takes serious retraining.

705
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:14,533
Tell me about it.

706
00:31:15,238 --> 00:31:17,002
You're not in love, are you?

707
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:20,793
- Could be.
- Could be, my friend,...

708
00:31:20,794 --> 00:31:23,828
- isn't love.
- Isn't love. I know, I know.

709
00:31:25,388 --> 00:31:26,687
It's complicated,

710
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:27,761
John.

711
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:28,877
Aren't they all?

712
00:31:28,878 --> 00:31:30,619
No. Usually, they're pretty simple.

713
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,416
Fall in love, three weeks later,

714
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:33,613
fall out of love.

715
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:35,202
It's been my life.

716
00:31:35,203 --> 00:31:36,854
Except for once.

717
00:31:38,015 --> 00:31:39,759
I got engaged.

718
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:42,943
What happened?

719
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,236
What do you think?

720
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,803
I screwed it up.

721
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,491
I, um,

722
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:49,989
slept with her best friend.

723
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:53,616
That's not nice, John.

724
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:54,922
Yeah, I know.

725
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:57,989
She was the one, too.

726
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,414
She's...

727
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:00,886
smart.

728
00:32:01,146 --> 00:32:02,490
Beautiful.

729
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:04,529
Funny.

730
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,115
The whole marriage package.

731
00:32:10,655 --> 00:32:11,831
Oh, well.

732
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:13,489
I'll always have

733
00:32:13,857 --> 00:32:16,777
April 2005 to keep me company.

734
00:32:16,778 --> 00:32:19,273
- Hooters Girls of D. C.?
- Yeah.

735
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:21,154
Collector's edition.

736
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:22,155
Yeah.

737
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,971
Baby steps.

738
00:32:32,977 --> 00:32:34,934
This is really weird.

739
00:32:34,972 --> 00:32:37,613
I would agree. What exactly is this?

740
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,259
It's a
chick-e-baby.

741
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,897
- My friend makes them.
- Why?

742
00:32:40,898 --> 00:32:42,362
For Valentine's Day.

743
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:45,236
I think I may be confusing
this holiday with another.

744
00:32:45,237 --> 00:32:46,382
What do you got, Abs?

745
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:48,632
Oh, I'm not sure, yet.

746
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,663
I got a partial match

747
00:32:52,664 --> 00:32:55,554
on the blood the killer used
to write his calling card.

748
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:56,727
Who is he?

749
00:32:57,301 --> 00:32:58,301
He's a she.

750
00:32:58,302 --> 00:33:00,737
Our Petty Officer's murder is a woman.

751
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:02,228
I don't think so.

752
00:33:02,229 --> 00:33:03,959
You don't think a woman can kill

753
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,329
and leave a calling card?

754
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,421
Not this one.

755
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:08,857
She was murdered two months ago.

756
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:18,282
Sandra Thompson, age 24.

757
00:33:18,283 --> 00:33:20,769
Arrested seven times for prostitution.

758
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,164
Found murdered in Canal Park,

759
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:24,869
December 24.

760
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,794
Christmas Eve.

761
00:33:26,795 --> 00:33:28,726
- Sad.
- No day's a good day

762
00:33:28,727 --> 00:33:30,912
to be stabbed 22 times, Miss Sciuto.

763
00:33:30,913 --> 00:33:32,357
At least she didn't feel anything.

764
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:34,172
All the wounds were post-mortem.

765
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:34,905
What killed her?

766
00:33:34,906 --> 00:33:39,069
She OD'd on something 
called...nerhine...

767
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,415
Neriin

768
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,352
and oleandroside.

769
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,652
That's the same thing that
killed the petty officer.

770
00:33:44,653 --> 00:33:47,597
That would've been nice to
know two days ago, Detective.

771
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:50,265
Hey, don't bite my
ass. This isn't my case.

772
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:51,855
Did you ask whoever's case it was

773
00:33:51,856 --> 00:33:54,613
if they found a pink card on the body?

774
00:33:55,502 --> 00:33:56,627
I did.

775
00:33:56,628 --> 00:33:57,711
They didn't.

776
00:33:57,712 --> 00:33:59,167
The only clue here is

777
00:33:59,168 --> 00:34:00,818
a bloody shoe print.

778
00:34:01,676 --> 00:34:03,613
There a photo in the file?

779
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:05,456
It is the case file, Gibbs.

780
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:07,753
- McGee.
- Excuse me, Detective.

781
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:17,206
All that blood and just one print?

782
00:34:17,311 --> 00:34:19,198
It was his only mistake.

783
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,238
McGee.

784
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:30,572
It wasn't a mistake.

785
00:34:34,233 --> 00:34:35,751
You were right, Tony.

786
00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:39,618
Maybe it wasn't over for me.

787
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:42,610
If it was, I would
have told him about you.

788
00:34:44,277 --> 00:34:45,708
He doesn't know?

789
00:34:45,853 --> 00:34:47,311
He does now.

790
00:34:48,578 --> 00:34:49,841
Why didn't you tell him?

791
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:52,347
I didn't want to answer all
those stupid questions that

792
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:53,685
men ask when it's over and they know

793
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:55,447
there's another man is in your life.

794
00:34:55,448 --> 00:34:56,640
Like, uh,

795
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:58,428
"Is he better looking than me or

796
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,818
is he better in bed?"

797
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:01,367
Exactly like that.

798
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:02,380
Is he?

799
00:35:04,284 --> 00:35:05,775
That was a joke.

800
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,299
Sort of..

801
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:10,337
You're better in almost all categories,

802
00:35:10,338 --> 00:35:11,430
Tony.

803
00:35:11,807 --> 00:35:13,059
Almost?

804
00:35:14,682 --> 00:35:15,920
sort of.

805
00:35:16,566 --> 00:35:17,771
I gotta go.

806
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,144
I love you, Tony.

807
00:35:21,149 --> 00:35:22,839
I love you, too, Jeanne.

808
00:35:28,856 --> 00:35:30,574
Well, I know that look.

809
00:35:30,818 --> 00:35:31,983
What look?

810
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:33,971
The cold-feet look.

811
00:35:34,713 --> 00:35:35,724
You asked her to marry you

812
00:35:35,725 --> 00:35:37,777
and now you wonder if your life is over.

813
00:35:37,778 --> 00:35:39,483
I didn't ask her to marry me.

814
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:40,756
You gonna?

815
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:45,706
I can't live a lie.

816
00:35:45,707 --> 00:35:47,684
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

817
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,996
I don't want to end up like you.

818
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:54,336
Oh, hell, that's easy.

819
00:35:54,337 --> 00:35:56,127
Don't sleep with her best friend?

820
00:35:56,234 --> 00:35:57,486
Don't drink.

821
00:36:00,935 --> 00:36:02,936
Think I'd have blown the best
thing to ever happen to me

822
00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:04,347
if I was sober?

823
00:36:05,203 --> 00:36:06,674
Sorry, John.

824
00:36:07,756 --> 00:36:08,955
Don't be.

825
00:36:10,077 --> 00:36:11,614
Because of her...

826
00:36:12,147 --> 00:36:13,551
I quit drinking.

827
00:36:24,023 --> 00:36:25,026
Here.

828
00:36:25,027 --> 00:36:26,690
Look at the outside edges.

829
00:36:28,434 --> 00:36:29,885
Did you ever read MAD Magazine?

830
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:30,630
- No.
- No.

831
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:32,815
Until my mother found them
and burned them in the yard.

832
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,240
Oh, my God!

833
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:36,529
It's exactly like

834
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,666
the back cover MAD Magazine.

835
00:36:45,213 --> 00:36:46,619
"Dead whore"?

836
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,061
The shoe print's not a
mistake, J. D., it's a message.

837
00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:51,136
Like "Expect more"
written on the pink card.

838
00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:53,862
Which was also written in
Sandra Thompson's blood.

839
00:36:53,863 --> 00:36:55,557
We're dealing with a serial killer.

840
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:57,314
If it's a serial killing,

841
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,843
shouldn't your dead sailor be a whore?

842
00:37:10,153 --> 00:37:11,385
Hey, Matt.

843
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:12,576
Have a good time.

844
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:14,996
Why couldn't you guys get
a hot female cop inside?

845
00:37:14,997 --> 00:37:15,973
Tried.

846
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:17,604
Got stopped at the door every time.

847
00:37:17,605 --> 00:37:18,921
Not hot enough.

848
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:19,991
You believe that?

849
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:20,902
No.

850
00:37:20,903 --> 00:37:24,149
Hate to say it, but I think
someone in Metro tips the owner.

851
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:25,912
And there he is,

852
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:27,232
at the door.

853
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:28,692
Any problems, Matt?

854
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:30,822
None so far, Mr. Pell.

855
00:37:31,478 --> 00:37:32,918
Thought Metro might hit us with another

856
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:35,480
warrant after what
happened Thursday night.

857
00:37:37,377 --> 00:37:38,469
Yeah?

858
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:40,642
Hey, boss, what's up?

859
00:37:40,707 --> 00:37:41,707
We're going in.

860
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,569
- You got a warrant?
- No.

861
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,318
No, we've got somebody rich and famous.

862
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:02,808
McGeek?

863
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:03,968
No.

864
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,891
A very famous novelist.

865
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:07,822
Thom E. Gemcity.

866
00:38:07,823 --> 00:38:08,823
Who?

867
00:38:08,824 --> 00:38:09,885
Don't ask.

868
00:38:09,886 --> 00:38:10,913
John,

869
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,491
I'd vomit explaining.

870
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:14,433
McGee, if Delgado's inside,

871
00:38:14,434 --> 00:38:16,713
you get her out quietly.

872
00:38:17,222 --> 00:38:18,222
How?

873
00:38:18,223 --> 00:38:21,469
Well, she's a hooker,
Tim. Use your imagination.

874
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:23,272
Lee,

875
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:25,806
can you please pretend you
want to be here with us?

876
00:38:25,815 --> 00:38:26,815
I'm trying.

877
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,890
P. S., I don't know where your Sig is,

878
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,703
but I'm having trouble walking.

879
00:38:30,704 --> 00:38:32,820
Snuggle up, Lee, it's fun.

880
00:38:34,487 --> 00:38:35,918
Names, please.

881
00:38:36,058 --> 00:38:38,108
Thom E. Gemcity.

882
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:40,242
Thought I recognized you.

883
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,484
Deep Six, right?

884
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,870
That's the one.

885
00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:44,781
I'm a big fan.

886
00:38:45,577 --> 00:38:46,577
Go right in.

887
00:38:46,578 --> 00:38:47,870
Thank you.

888
00:38:49,433 --> 00:38:50,613
I gotta write a book.

889
00:38:50,614 --> 00:38:52,391
You should read one first.

890
00:38:52,975 --> 00:38:55,410
Hey, woman in the alley. Camera three.

891
00:38:56,678 --> 00:38:58,481
Tighter on her face.

892
00:39:04,621 --> 00:39:06,317
It could be Delgado. Right size.

893
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:07,361
That's the best I can do.

894
00:39:07,362 --> 00:39:08,726
Check her out, Tony.

895
00:39:08,727 --> 00:39:09,830
John, you go with him.

896
00:39:09,831 --> 00:39:11,016
All right.

897
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:27,554
I thought we agreed you weren't
gonna come around here for a few days.

898
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:31,312
That's Delgado.

899
00:39:31,313 --> 00:39:33,042
Tony, that's Delgado in the alley.

900
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:35,586
She's got company. Move! Now! Move!

901
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:37,992
Cops are after me. I
gotta get out of town.

902
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:39,623
I'm not stopping you.

903
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:41,427
I need money.

904
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:42,764
Why don't you use the thousand dollars

905
00:39:42,765 --> 00:39:44,792
that sailor gave you to
leave the back door of my club

906
00:39:44,793 --> 00:39:46,637
open last Thursday night?

907
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:48,298
I tell you what it happened.

908
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:49,886
Excuse me?

909
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:53,163
You forced a spiked
drink down his throat

910
00:39:53,164 --> 00:39:54,509
and killed him.

911
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:56,181
Matt caught that guy

912
00:39:56,182 --> 00:39:58,584
trying to slip you a roofie.

913
00:39:58,641 --> 00:40:00,094
You should be grateful he saw it.

914
00:40:00,095 --> 00:40:01,898
- It wasn't a roofie.
- Then what was it?

915
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,301
I don't know. Whatever it was,

916
00:40:03,302 --> 00:40:05,295
that freak was trying to kill me.

917
00:40:05,296 --> 00:40:07,744
Well, I guess that
means I saved your life.

918
00:40:08,062 --> 00:40:09,497
Come inside, we'll talk about it there.

919
00:40:09,498 --> 00:40:10,557
No.

920
00:40:10,581 --> 00:40:11,740
You just...

921
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:14,666
Just give me five green and I am gone.

922
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:16,498
I'll give it to you inside.

923
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:18,734
I'll never come out of there alive.

924
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:23,061
Lisa...

925
00:40:23,062 --> 00:40:24,892
you're probably right.

926
00:40:26,355 --> 00:40:27,482
Forget about the money!

927
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:28,700
I won't say a word, I swear!

928
00:40:28,701 --> 00:40:30,374
Yeah, you will. 
First time

929
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,806
a cop pulls you 
over for tricking.

930
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,516
Lisa, you'll deal.

931
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:36,235
And I'll be the card.

932
00:40:39,184 --> 00:40:41,161
Freeze! Federal agents!

933
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:42,993
Damn cops.

934
00:41:05,248 --> 00:41:06,533
Did we hit her?

935
00:41:06,534 --> 00:41:07,534
No.

936
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:09,272
Looks like he broke her neck.

937
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:12,755
John.

938
00:41:12,832 --> 00:41:13,832
John!

939
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,763
Officer down.

940
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:19,076
6618 Chillum Road, Northwest.

941
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:21,541
You're going to be okay, buddy.

942
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:22,542
Try not to move.

943
00:41:22,543 --> 00:41:23,885
Hang on.

944
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:27,290
Okay, all right.

945
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,849
You're gonna be fine.

946
00:41:30,144 --> 00:41:31,462
Liar.

947
00:41:32,613 --> 00:41:34,123
Stay with us, Carson.

948
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,147
You gotta stay with us. Okay?

949
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,875
I should've caught this, guys.

950
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:19,093
Metro had the bloody print

951
00:42:19,094 --> 00:42:20,776
for two months, they didn't catch it.

952
00:42:20,777 --> 00:42:22,429
Yeah, but I had

953
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,327
Petty ficer Davidson's
boot the whole time.

954
00:42:25,328 --> 00:42:27,466
You thought the petty
officer was the victim,

955
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:29,277
not the killer, Abby.

956
00:42:31,992 --> 00:42:33,689
There's no excuse.

957
00:42:35,997 --> 00:42:37,521
It's ironic, isn't it?

958
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:40,648
A serial killer forced
to drink his own poison.

959
00:42:42,482 --> 00:42:44,219
It'll make... book.
