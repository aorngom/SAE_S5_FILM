1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:03,711
How much?

2
00:00:03,772 --> 00:00:05,949
Don't know.
Come on, take a guess.

3
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:07,309
I don't know.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,396
Then we're just going to have
to settle this with facts.

5
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:12,008
I am Googling "men's jacket."

6
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:13,459
What would you say
it was made of?

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,985
- It felt like butter.
- Lambskin.

8
00:00:15,037 --> 00:00:16,333
Who's the designer?

9
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:18,446
- Why do you assume I know?
- Because.

10
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:19,901
Because? Because I'm a woman?

11
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:20,957
Because I'm Jewish?

12
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,899
Because you're a great detective.

13
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,900
True.

14
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,904
McGee flashed the label
when he showed us his lining.

15
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,085
Armani.

16
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:29,334
Anything else?

17
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:30,689
Lizard-embossed trim,

18
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:33,516
a two-way zipper,
and a chest pocket.

19
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:36,878
Found it.
It's from the Armani

20
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,157
2007 Resort Collection.

21
00:00:38,192 --> 00:00:40,161
- You can purchase it for...
- $2,000.

22
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,161
They say the clothes make the man.

23
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,647
Yeah, he's not a
man, he's a McGee.

24
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:45,981
Either way, where is he?

25
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:49,446
Over there, overdressed.

26
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,586
You okay?

27
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:57,351
Yeah.

28
00:00:57,854 --> 00:01:00,631
I, um, I just need to talk
to Special Agent Gibbs.

29
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:04,252
Hey, your, uh,
jacket's really soft.

30
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,540
Thanks.

31
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,250
Who is McGee escorting?

32
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:09,225
I don't know;
never seen him before.

33
00:01:09,226 --> 00:01:10,781
This is Special Agent Gibbs.

34
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:12,684
Lieutenant Sanders, sir.

35
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:15,045
I need you to investigate a murder.

36
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,101
Whose?

37
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:24,226
Mine.

43
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:14,528
This is killing me.

44
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:15,875
I feel like I know him.

45
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:17,353
Mossad?

46
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:18,473
Maybe.

47
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:19,598
Internet dating?

48
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:23,027
I will kill you 18 different
ways with this paper clip.

49
00:02:23,863 --> 00:02:26,113
Ducky figure out what's wrong
with Lieutenant Sanders, boss?

50
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:27,489
No, he's still examing him.

51
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,174
Thinks it could be
radiation poisoning.

52
00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:30,739
Do we know how he was exposed?

53
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,517
No, but he's got
a high-risk job

54
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:34,288
as an inspector for the IAEA.

55
00:02:34,428 --> 00:02:36,372
International Atomic Energy Agency.

56
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:39,578
I wonder if he's been to Israel.

57
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:43,052
I feel like I know
him from somewhere.

58
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:44,497
DiNozzo, check his travel.

59
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,351
Is this guy contagious, boss?

60
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:48,148
Well, for McGee better hope not.

61
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,302
Underwear, too?

62
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:52,155
Yes, McGee, I need everything.

63
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:53,927
Don't you think that's
kind of overkill?

64
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:54,983
Get over it, McGee.

65
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:56,996
I'm a scientist, remember?

66
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,677
You said he coughed on you?

67
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:01,177
Yes.

68
00:03:01,302 --> 00:03:02,302
So I need to check

69
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:04,621
all of your clothing
for radiation.

70
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:06,463
If you were exposed...

71
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:08,845
Yeah, I feel exposed.

72
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:12,352
Where's your jacket?

73
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:15,428
Come on, you need to test
that, too?

74
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:16,990
You said he grabbed your arm.

75
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:18,615
Will you promise
not to stain it?

76
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,460
I promise not to stain it.

77
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:34,491
Table's cold.

78
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:37,261
None of my other patients
ever complained.

79
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:40,015
Sorry,
I thought it might be nice

80
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:42,364
for you to have someone
to talk to for a change.

81
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:44,087
Oh, I always talk to my guests.

82
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:46,886
The difference here is
that you talk back.

83
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,957
- Talk about what?
- Let's see.

84
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:52,035
In your case, I'd talk
about your runner's physique,

85
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,601
your well-toned calves,
your impressive thighs.

86
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:59,208
It doesn't sound quite
so personal when you're dead.

87
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:00,743
Mr. Palmer.

88
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,962
Yes, I will label these and
get them over to radiobiology.

89
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:08,436
When did the nausea start?

90
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:11,054
Two days ago.

91
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:14,135
Since I'd been traveling,
I blamed it on the local moqueca.

92
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Until your hair
started falling out.

93
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,302
Ah, Jethro.

94
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,989
We have to wait
for radiobiology

95
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,434
to find out exactly
with what we're dealing.

96
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Containment?

97
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:25,650
Minimal.

98
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,242
Abby's preliminary
findings show

99
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:28,367
that they're alpha emissions

100
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,053
which, unlike gamma rays
and X rays, can be blocked

101
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:33,498
by a simple layer
of dead cells on the skin.

102
00:04:33,743 --> 00:04:36,076
Just avoid contact
and exchange of fluids.

103
00:04:36,802 --> 00:04:38,742
- Is he fit to answer questions?
- I'm right here.

104
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,539
I can hear you.

105
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:42,605
I'm sorry;
it's force of habit.

106
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:44,694
You're around uranium
in your job.

107
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:46,757
What makes you think this was
murder and not accidental?

108
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:48,134
The radiation badge.

109
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:51,078
It's a thermoluminescent dosimeter.

110
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,383
I wore it to inspect
the power plant in Brazil

111
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:55,008
where we discovered violations.

112
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:56,258
When I returned four days ago,

113
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:58,314
the film from my badge
was processed.

114
00:04:58,387 --> 00:04:59,442
And the glow curve?

115
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:00,861
Detected no exposure.

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,649
Said everything was fine.

117
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:05,382
Were the Brazilians aware
of your findings?

118
00:05:05,383 --> 00:05:06,575
From my line of questioning,

119
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:08,443
I'd say they knew they were busted.

120
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,383
Brazil has a history
of covert attempts

121
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:12,939
to secure nuclear weaponry
with Germany's aid.

122
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,897
Yeah, it's an
unsavory partnership

123
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:17,627
that goes back to the fall
of the Third Reich.

124
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,182
I'll need access
to your offices

125
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:21,383
and your inspection team.

126
00:05:21,384 --> 00:05:23,758
I told transpo I want
to move him to AFRRI.

127
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,008
That's the Armed Forc...

128
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:27,509
Armed Forces Radiobiology
Research Institute.

129
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:29,773
Although in my line of work,
we call it something else.

130
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:30,774
What's that?

131
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,465
The last exit.

132
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,649
Okay, ready? Look away now.

133
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,960
Look at me,
close your eyes.

134
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:40,137
Now look back
really fast.

135
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:41,463
Open them up. Anything?

136
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:43,095
N- No, still nothing.

137
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:44,867
Okay, squat down.

138
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:47,893
Squat down, close your eyes,
and then jump up and look.

139
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:51,399
Ziva, you find
out how you know

140
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:52,835
- the lieutenant?
- Not yet.

141
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,962
He's been to Israel
twice in the past decade.

142
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:56,151
We've never been in the same city.

143
00:05:56,152 --> 00:05:58,527
He's also been to Iran, Bulgaria,
Pakistan, Kuwait,

144
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:00,139
Croatia, Korea, and Slovenia.

145
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,346
- Guy gets around.
- I left out Canada.

146
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:04,529
Ducky's transferring him
to AFRRI in Bethesda.

147
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,399
- Ziva, go with him.
- Protection detail?

148
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:07,651
Not sure yet.

149
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:10,341
On it.  Tacing his
phone calls, bank accounts,

150
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:11,839
everyone he's ever met
in his entire life.

151
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,838
Leave that to McGee.
You're with me.

152
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,087
Uh, McGee's not here.

153
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:16,421
Where the hell is McGee?

154
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:19,926
Abby is testing my clothes
for radiation,

155
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:22,025
and it is taking longer than
we thought, so...

156
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:23,748
Pick up where DiNozzo left off.

157
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:24,901
Got it, boss.

158
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:27,965
If clothes make the man,
what does that make McGee?

159
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:28,966
Male nurse?

160
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:31,087
No. Aqua Smurf.

161
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,336
I've e-mailed your records
to the doctors at AFRRI.

162
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:37,588
They'll be running more tests.

163
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:39,144
Try to conserve your energy.

164
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:41,069
You'll need it later.

165
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:44,893
I don't want to see you
back on my cold table.

166
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:46,832
I appreciate your help, Doc.

167
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:48,027
Good luck.

168
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:57,624
Forget something, Doc?

169
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:00,525
Special Agent Gibbs asked
me to accompany you.

170
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:01,526
I'm Officer David.

171
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:03,928
I'd, uh,
shake your hand, but...

172
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,307
Um, actually, it would be best
to avoid all bodily contact.

173
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:09,422
You sound just like my prom date.

174
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,633
Would you mind smiling for me?

175
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:19,873
- Do I have something in my teeth?
- No.

176
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,445
You can stop smiling.

177
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,279
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

178
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:36,266
Do we know each other?

179
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:39,927
Where'd you go to college?

180
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:41,546
Israel.

181
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:44,543
Could we have met
at a conference?

182
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:45,544
Yes.

183
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:47,273
Except I've never been to one.

184
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:49,419
Burning Man, 2002.

185
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,896
Extreme Twister Camp.

186
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,121
I don't even know
what that means.

187
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:00,543
It took two hours,
but I finally found

188
00:08:00,544 --> 00:08:03,432
three seats on a nonstop
Lufthansa flight to Gdansk.

189
00:08:03,543 --> 00:08:04,987
You leave
next Thursday...

190
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:08,169
Holly, I don't know even if
we'll be making this trip.

191
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:11,168
I'll know more after I talk
to NCIS. Special Agent Gibbs.

192
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:12,793
Okay, well, the sooner
the better because there's

193
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:14,793
- cancellation fees...
- I understand, just leave the itinerary.

194
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,794
I'm Mark Sadowski.

195
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:16,858
We spoke on the phone.

196
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,899
Diane, NCIS is here.

197
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,091
Which one is
Lieutenant Sanders' desk?

198
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:22,795
It's clean.

199
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,230
I can see that.

200
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:26,781
He means they swept
the office, DiNozzo.

201
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:28,569
When Roy said he was
throwing up, we checked

202
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,747
the radiation levels.
They're within normal limits.

203
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:32,836
I'll gather his things.

204
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,419
Hi. I'm Diane Russio.

205
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:37,106
How's Roy?

206
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:38,522
Transferred to AFRRI.

207
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:43,565
We were hoping it was
just food poisoning.

208
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:44,607
Radiation.

209
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:46,044
Do you know where
he was exposed?

210
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:47,045
No, not yet.

211
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:48,185
Well, it couldn't
have been Brazil.

212
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:49,219
We toured the facility together,

213
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,239
and Diane and I aren't sick.

214
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:53,906
Could someone have done this
on purpose?

215
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,997
I'll need
your radiation badges.

216
00:08:55,998 --> 00:08:56,998
Of course.

217
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:00,538
After hours in Brazil,
did all of you stick together?

218
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,622
Uh, we stayed in the same
hotel, ate the same food.

219
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:05,345
Roy would get up
early and run.

220
00:09:05,747 --> 00:09:08,245
Oh, the night before we left, we
hit the local bars for a cerveza

221
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:09,246
and a cigar.

222
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:10,511
Roy left early.

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Alone?

224
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,002
I was with him.

225
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,749
We just went straight back
to the hotel.

226
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:15,997
I'm 30 years older

227
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:17,118
than both of them
and they're the ones

228
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:19,249
who are too tired to party.

229
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,415
I'll go get my badge.

230
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,297
So can we visit Roy?

231
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,671
Yeah, if he wants
to see you.

232
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,622
Answers, Abs.

233
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:34,623
I got them, Gibbs.

234
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,371
I took Lieutenant
Sanders' dosimeter apart,

235
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:39,260
and I discovered
that it is hinky.

236
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:42,148
I- I might even call it
hinky-dory.

237
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,914
Oh, come on, Gibbs,
it's a little cute.

238
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,748
Okay, um...

239
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:49,304
if you follow
this red beam,

240
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:51,582
you can see there's
no clear path

241
00:09:51,935 --> 00:09:55,157
between the photomultiplier
tubes and the crystal lattice.

242
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:58,874
This little piece of plastic

243
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,625
is blocking the light emissions.

244
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:02,276
- Sabotage?
- Or...

245
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,541
faulty manufacturing.

246
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,936
I mean, it's a state-of-
the-art lifesaving device,

247
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:08,377
but it's still made from
injection-molded plastic

248
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:10,155
just like a, um,
Happy Meal toy.

249
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,877
And you know how sometimes
you get one of those

250
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,436
and there'll be a little
blob of plastic on the leg

251
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:14,934
and you have to bend
it back and forth...

252
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:15,935
Abby.

253
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:18,248
Somebody needs a Happy Meal.

254
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:19,249
What about these?

255
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,754
Um, these are
operational.

256
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,251
No globs.

257
00:10:22,252 --> 00:10:23,811
Their reading
was a true positive.

258
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:25,706
My conclusion is that
Sanders had a bad badge.

259
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,125
There was no
foul play.

260
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,311
If he hadn't
gotten sick,

261
00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:29,809
he wouldn't have even noticed.

262
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,143
I need to talk to Ducky.

263
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,250
Hey, Duck.

264
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:40,645
Jethro, I was just
about to call you.

265
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:43,125
Lieutenant Sanders wasn't
poisoned at the power plant.

266
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:45,861
I know. The radiobiology lab

267
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:47,812
identified the isotope
in his blood.

268
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,619
It was thallium.

269
00:10:50,438 --> 00:10:51,826
Wow, that is nasty stuff.

270
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:53,894
Isn't the nonradioactive

271
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:56,082
form of that
used for rat poison?

272
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:57,377
Yes, it's lethal

273
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,126
and extremely effective:
colorless, odorless,

274
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,065
tasteless,
and soluble in water.

275
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,119
Are you thinking ingestion?

276
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:06,505
Most likely.

277
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,626
And-and no longer
than 72 hours ago.

278
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:11,590
Okay, so now we know the "when."

279
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,632
We just have to figure out

280
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:17,590
why, how and who.

281
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:27,267
The pigment, Prussian blue,

282
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,625
has been applied by artists

283
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:29,626
since the 1700s.

284
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:31,812
Yeah, it was used
by van Gogh,

285
00:11:31,813 --> 00:11:32,813
Monet, Picasso.

286
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,190
Me.

287
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:36,223
How long until
it takes effect?

288
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,375
About 24 hours.

289
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,771
Prussian blue works best
when it's used

290
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:43,835
or taken as a preventative
measure before exposure.

291
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,307
Or right after.

292
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:47,681
But in the meantime, let's see
if you can replace the fluids

293
00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:49,707
you lost without an I. V.

294
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,834
We prefer oral feeding
to maintain

295
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,437
the integrity of your gut.

296
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:55,222
My gut has integrity.

297
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:56,744
So does my spleen.

298
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:58,683
Now, you can eat anything

299
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,867
you want, just so long
as it's low-microbial.

300
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:01,868
But no drinking,

301
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:03,879
no smoking.

302
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,620
Are we done?

303
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:06,621
One more thing.

304
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:08,868
We need to keep
his stress levels down.

305
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:11,091
We're in the middle of an investigation...

306
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:14,812
I have to go.

307
00:12:16,056 --> 00:12:18,000
Any place I can
get some fresh air?

308
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:20,487
This facility has
an open-air garden.

309
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,067
They catch it in time?

310
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:27,472
Uh, unclear.

311
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:30,336
The next 24 hours are key.

312
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:33,101
I'm more interested in the past.

313
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:35,785
I want a list of every sip,

314
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:38,904
every bite, every kiss,
every time

315
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,015
he's hit the head
in the past 72 hours.

316
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:44,418
Do you think he's
hiding something?

317
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,306
Have you placed him yet?

318
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:48,786
No.

319
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:50,793
You place him first, Ziva.

320
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:53,598
Trust later.

321
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:03,473
There were only trace
amounts of radiation

322
00:13:03,474 --> 00:13:05,140
on your clothes,
but I'm still

323
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:06,274
glad we tested them.

324
00:13:06,474 --> 00:13:08,862
'Cause it's better
to be safe than glowing.

325
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:11,786
Where's my jacket?

326
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,042
It's here.

327
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:15,724
It's really soft.

328
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,533
If you rubbed that against

329
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,412
- a certain part of your body...
- You didn't.

330
00:13:19,413 --> 00:13:20,968
I don't even have that part.

331
00:13:23,098 --> 00:13:24,787
Thank you for taking
good care of my jacket.

332
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:25,788
You're welcome.

333
00:13:28,593 --> 00:13:30,036
What?

334
00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:32,107
I promised you
I wouldn't stain it.

335
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:34,586
Just put your hand over it,
like this.

336
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:38,308
It looks very natural.
Thank you.

337
00:13:39,414 --> 00:13:40,911
So did you find
anything in the stuff

338
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:42,411
Tony took from the lieutenant's desk?

339
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:43,412
Nothing yet.

340
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:44,740
I'm checking
all the protein bars

341
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,324
for needle-puncture marks.

342
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,589
Think the killer
injected them with thallium?

343
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,471
That's what I'd do.

344
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:51,904
It's pretty devious.

345
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,752
Using something so healthy
to make someone so sick.

346
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:02,745
So the rest of the pizza
is inside your refrigerator?

347
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:05,223
Yeah. You can test it,
but I, for one,

348
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:07,627
trust Papa Don
implicitly.

349
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,638
Then what?

350
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:09,699
I brushed my teeth.

351
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,913
And then I
went to bed.

352
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:12,594
I was pretty jet-lagged,

353
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,009
but I still got up to run
the next morning.

354
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,010
What time?

355
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:16,499
0530.

356
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:19,824
I thought I was the only one who
got up that early to exercise.

357
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:20,825
Nope.

358
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:23,511
Had water from the tap
and an energy gel.

359
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:24,512
Raspberry.

360
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:25,575
Noted.

361
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,635
Then I ran the two
miles from my apartement

362
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:29,510
to the Custis Trail,
which runs along the...

363
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:30,511
The Potomac.

364
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:32,074
Right. Then I headed over the...

365
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:33,741
The Arlington Memorial Bridge,

366
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:36,715
where you passed a woman
wearing a yellow Windbreaker.

367
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:38,049
Is she part of the plot?

368
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:39,091
No, she's me!

369
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:41,901
You're the one who wears the
fluorescent orange watch cap

370
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:43,124
when you run, correct?

371
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,279
Right, yeah,
so the cars will notice me.

372
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,092
People, too.
I pass you every morning.

373
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:48,981
I'm going east,
you're going west.

374
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:50,305
Don't you recognize me?

375
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,331
I'm sorry, no.
How about now?

376
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:54,717
I mean, you've got to picture me

377
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:56,773
sweating and panting
and, you know...

378
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:59,271
Yeah, of course, I know you.

379
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,669
Yeah, you have a smooth
stride, great carriage.

380
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,856
I often turn after you pass

381
00:15:02,857 --> 00:15:04,245
to admire your technique.

382
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:05,863
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

383
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,105
Yeah.

384
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:09,465
You have a very cute,
tight technique.

385
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:14,065
How far did you run
that morning?

386
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,042
Eight miles.

387
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,931
Went home, showered,
and headed to the field office.

388
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:23,074
Ate two protein
bars at my desk.

389
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:24,731
Then at 1200,

390
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:26,856
Mark and I headed
to Oakwood Shooting Range.

391
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:28,792
- Where's that?
- Near Andrews.

392
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:30,482
What do you shoot?

393
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,544
Glock.

394
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:32,711
That's a good choice.

395
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:34,282
Mark and I ate lunch

396
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,336
while we took target practice.

397
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:38,529
I had a bacon cheeseburger
with fries,

398
00:15:38,795 --> 00:15:40,572
washed down with a large coffee.

399
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:44,159
You run like a health nut
and eat like a slob.

400
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:46,592
I've always weighed the same.

401
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,501
People told me at 40,
my body would change.

402
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:53,232
I guess I might not
have to worry about that.

403
00:15:56,794 --> 00:15:57,960
Have you made a will?

404
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:00,420
I'm sorry, that was
too blunt. Uh..

405
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:01,421
No, no, no.

406
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,919
I like blunt.

407
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:07,468
I was thinking your beneficiary

408
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:10,602
would have a potential motive.

409
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,149
The joke's on them, because I...

410
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,611
I don't have a will.

411
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:24,062
Mark Sadowski, senior member
of the team, is about to retire.

412
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,451
You know what that means.

413
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:26,809
He gets a watch?

414
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:28,065
No, somebody's
going to bump him off.

415
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:29,623
Standard procedure
in '70s cop flicks.

416
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:31,568
Did Sadowski and Sanders
get along?

417
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:36,814
Worked together nine years.

418
00:16:37,124 --> 00:16:38,512
Neither filed a complaint

419
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:40,021
or requested a transfer.

420
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:41,627
What about the
other inspector?

421
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:42,628
Ah, Diane Russio.

422
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,523
Something's up with her.

423
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:46,563
She made Gibbs'
spidey sense tingle.

424
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:48,562
Don't touch that.

425
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,333
Sanders' car could
be a hot zone.

426
00:16:52,873 --> 00:16:54,039
This car? I doubt it.

427
00:17:00,998 --> 00:17:02,936
Rem is low. It's safe.

428
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:04,687
After you, probie.

429
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,750
Reeks of cigar.

430
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:14,512
It's a manly scent
good for you.

431
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:17,063
You know what this guy
being poisoned reminds me of?

432
00:17:17,064 --> 00:17:18,064
A movie?

433
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:19,417
Yeah, but what movie?

434
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:21,084
A movie I've never seen?

435
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:22,603
D. O. A. it's called.

436
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,276
1950 film noir classic.

437
00:17:25,374 --> 00:17:26,997
This accountant goes to San
Francisco, parties all night,

438
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:29,498
wakes up, finds he's poisoned.
He has 24 hours

439
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:31,443
- to find his...
- Found something.

440
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,001
Is it dangerous?

441
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,208
Do you want kids?

442
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:35,954
Kidding.

443
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:37,640
Rem count's not that high.

444
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,141
We should take it to X ray.

445
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:42,495
Let's see what
we got in here.

446
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:46,537
Body parts?
Gym clothes.

447
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,764
- Get them to Abby.
- Ziva called with a list of

448
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:53,042
Lieutenant Sanders' movements,
where he went, what he ate.

449
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,327
We'll start at his apartment,

450
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:56,605
collect these items,
sweep for radiation.

451
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:58,766
Ziva figure out
how she knew him?

452
00:17:58,767 --> 00:17:59,878
Personal connection.

453
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,681
Ziva has personal connections?

454
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:10,391
Lieutenant.

455
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:11,766
Did I startle you?

456
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:14,078
A little.

457
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:15,890
I'd say I was paranoid,

458
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:17,502
but someone just poisoned me.

459
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,890
Who?

460
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:21,139
Well, I've racked my brain

461
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,190
for enemies at work, but I...

462
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,913
I can't think of anyone.

463
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:29,128
What about your
private life?

464
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:30,594
Do you have a girlfriend?

465
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:34,765
Are you asking me
in a professional capacity?

466
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:35,766
Yes.

467
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,830
I don't have one.

468
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:39,767
Why not?

469
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:41,231
Professional follow-up.

470
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,574
Well, I wouldn't date
anyone I worked with,

471
00:18:44,617 --> 00:18:46,329
and outside of work,
I've never met a woman

472
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,080
who could understand
why I do what I do.

473
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:50,136
The focus, the risks,
the sacrifices.

474
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:53,343
They always want me to go teach
or go to law school.

475
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:55,358
But I love what I do.

476
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,580
I truly believe there are
good guys who need protection

477
00:18:57,581 --> 00:18:59,203
and bad guys who need monitoring.

478
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,648
It's a mission, not a job.

479
00:19:01,143 --> 00:19:03,442
"All that is necessary
for evil to succeed

480
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:06,066
is that good men do nothing."

481
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,430
That's my favorite quote, ever.

482
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:17,018
Sorry.

483
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,441
Felt a little dizzy.

484
00:19:19,832 --> 00:19:21,332
I have to get you
into bed.

485
00:19:23,718 --> 00:19:25,643
I'm not saying anything.

486
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:27,889
Sorry, it's the English.

487
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:31,143
How long do you think
he's going to be in here?

488
00:19:31,144 --> 00:19:32,144
Hey.

489
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:33,706
Roy!

490
00:19:34,393 --> 00:19:35,393
Hi.

491
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,428
I'm sorry, no contact.

492
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:43,248
I can't believe this happened.

493
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:45,088
You going to be all right?

494
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,019
Well, I hope so.

495
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:09,597
We'll probably just
cancel next week's trip.

496
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:10,598
Which one?

497
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:13,280
Pakistan,Uzbekistan and Russia.

498
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:14,862
It's one of those
"If this is Tuesday,

499
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,847
it must be Tashkent" trips.

500
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,587
Don't cancel.

501
00:20:18,723 --> 00:20:19,908
See if Howard's available.

502
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:20,909
He's a good man.

503
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,599
Carreful.

504
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,474
Sorry. I'm a...

505
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:27,895
I'm a bit wiped out.

506
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:30,126
Oh, we'll let you
get some rest.

507
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:31,750
See you tomorrow, okay?

508
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,097
I need to talk to you.

509
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:40,598
It's about Lieutenant Sanders'
personal life.

510
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:41,723
Um, he says

511
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:43,584
he doesn't have
a girlfriend,

512
00:20:43,848 --> 00:20:45,459
that he doesn't date, either.

513
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:48,678
Hard to believe,
but I think it's true.

514
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:51,347
Mr. Sadowski,

515
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,821
would you mind
giving us a moment alone?

516
00:20:55,598 --> 00:20:56,986
I'll be at the elevators.

517
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:03,404
You know something.

518
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:04,785
It's about Brazil.

519
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,413
When you two went back
to the hotel together.

520
00:21:07,414 --> 00:21:08,747
Roy tell you about that?

521
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:10,035
No, my boss did.

522
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
What happened?

523
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,410
Nothing.

524
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:15,285
Tell me.

525
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,850
Nothing.

526
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,102
I got a little drunk,
I knocked on his door,

527
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:22,325
he wouldn't let me in.

528
00:21:22,912 --> 00:21:24,189
I was a complete idiot,

529
00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:26,313
and he was a complete gentleman.

530
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,036
Or maybe he's gay.

531
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:29,975
Oh, I don't think he's gay.

532
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:31,411
How do you know?

533
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,262
I saw the way he looked at you.

534
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:37,660
The higher levels of
radiation are due to

535
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:40,035
the concentration of
Lieutenant Sanders' sweat.

536
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:41,813
He made his
clothes radioactive,

537
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,850
not vice versa.

538
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,657
Abs, it's over.

539
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:57,724
I just hate to see the first
one of the morning end.

540
00:21:57,725 --> 00:21:59,058
I did get one unexpected

541
00:21:59,162 --> 00:22:00,328
piece of information.

542
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,822
Lieutenant Sanders

543
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,620
had a computerized chip in his left
sneaker to log his workouts.

544
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:08,495
That one of those
experimental DOD things?

545
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,341
Uh, no. You can buy them
at any running store.

546
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:14,553
It transmits into this.

547
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:19,782
I was able to access
his exercise logs.

548
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:21,553
These are the last
two weeks

549
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:22,554
of his workout.

550
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,490
He's a machine.

551
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,594
Eight miles every day
in under an hour.

552
00:22:27,865 --> 00:22:29,301
Lieutenant Sanders
was poisoned...

553
00:22:29,302 --> 00:22:30,302
Right around here.

554
00:22:31,305 --> 00:22:32,490
His last two workouts,

555
00:22:32,491 --> 00:22:34,053
they were only
slightly off pace.

556
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:36,492
Does that tell you
something about the case?

557
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:38,326
Tells me something
about the man.

558
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:39,677
Like what?

559
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,318
Like he would have made
a damn good Marine.

560
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:50,352
He's sleeping again?

561
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:53,970
We took a walk around the
garden, and it knocked him out.

562
00:22:54,054 --> 00:22:56,054
We got the second
test results back.

563
00:22:56,868 --> 00:22:58,645
Was the Prussian
blue effective?

564
00:22:58,741 --> 00:22:59,741
No.

565
00:23:00,305 --> 00:23:03,427
Lieutenant Sanders' lymphocytes
are continuing to decrease

566
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:04,761
and his radiation levels

567
00:23:04,928 --> 00:23:06,246
are higher than
when he was admitted.

568
00:23:06,247 --> 00:23:07,802
That doesn't make any sense.

569
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,234
It does if he's still
being poisoned.

570
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:18,178
There's no mistake, Gibbs.

571
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:19,555
The doctor said
Lieutenant Sanders'

572
00:23:19,556 --> 00:23:21,333
radiation levels are increasing.

573
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:23,313
He's still being poisoned.

574
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,513
Someone wanted to finish the job.

575
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:29,241
Not a lot of people have
access to him: nurses, doctors...

576
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,686
People preparing his food.

577
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:32,965
Could be a lot.

578
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:34,741
Plus, he had two
visitors from work

579
00:23:34,742 --> 00:23:36,019
yesterday: Diane Russio

580
00:23:36,304 --> 00:23:37,827
and Mark Sadowski.

581
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:39,616
Were they alone with him?

582
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:40,742
Yes.

583
00:23:42,306 --> 00:23:43,680
At one point, I went to
the vending machine.

584
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:45,555
One of them could have
slipped it in his water.

585
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:46,556
What about Tony and McGee?

586
00:23:46,931 --> 00:23:49,375
Have they followed up
on the list of locations?

587
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:50,992
Swept Sanders' apartment, office,

588
00:23:50,993 --> 00:23:52,881
running path yesterday.
All clean.

589
00:23:52,993 --> 00:23:54,166
They'll hit the rest today.

590
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:56,234
This is starting to look
very targeted, Gibbs.

591
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:59,555
Whoever did this is not just
after any nuclear inspector.

592
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:01,931
Sanders know
he's still being poisoned?

593
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:02,932
Not yet.

594
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:04,841
I'm worried it will
increase his stress.

595
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:05,842
Your call.

596
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,489
You stick with him, Ziva.

597
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,000
Like tattoos on Abby.

598
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:18,584
I think this will make
you feel better.

599
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:21,847
They tested the pizza
inside the refrigerator and, um...

600
00:24:21,848 --> 00:24:23,584
you were right about Papa Don.

601
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:24,600
Yes!

602
00:24:25,002 --> 00:24:26,002
Exonerated.

603
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:27,808
Did they, um...

604
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,099
did they find any clues,
any answers?

605
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
Not yet.

606
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:34,157
But they're still looking.

607
00:24:34,158 --> 00:24:35,484
Well, tell them to hurry up.

608
00:24:35,528 --> 00:24:39,388
I want to know who
killed me before I die.

609
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:41,227
Ziva.

610
00:24:43,592 --> 00:24:46,032
Can you do something
else for me?

611
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:47,207
Of course.

612
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,290
Can you find me a lawyer?

613
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:52,257
I think I need to write my will.

614
00:24:56,849 --> 00:24:59,776
Mark and Roy came here
a couple of times a week.

615
00:24:59,777 --> 00:25:01,237
Usually at lunchtime.

616
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:04,300
You check out Roy's two perfect
targets hanging inside?

617
00:25:04,301 --> 00:25:05,301
Missed them.

618
00:25:05,682 --> 00:25:07,063
Which station
did they use?

619
00:25:07,064 --> 00:25:08,504
We don't keep track.

620
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:10,880
At lunchtime,
it's first available.

621
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:12,204
But if you really
need to know,

622
00:25:12,205 --> 00:25:13,613
I got a security camera.

623
00:25:13,614 --> 00:25:17,265
Insurance made me put it
in last year after I got sued.

624
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,266
Personal injury?

625
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,497
Sexual harassment.

626
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:21,192
See, I like to...

627
00:25:21,212 --> 00:25:24,115
come up behind a shooter
and correct his stance.

628
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:25,456
Most appreciate it.

629
00:25:26,028 --> 00:25:27,878
One guy from Utah didn't.

630
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:29,275
Bet I could
correct your stance.

631
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:30,838
I'm okay with my stance.

632
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,796
Sure like to teach you how to position
your shoulders over your hips.

633
00:25:33,797 --> 00:25:35,258
Maybe we should get the
security footage

634
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:37,655
and review it back at the office
to see where they were.

635
00:25:38,643 --> 00:25:39,643
No need.

636
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:42,832
I think we just
found our hot zone.

637
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:48,014
I have been working
for 30 hours straight.

638
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:50,772
This is only my fourth
cup of the day.

639
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:52,547
Mossad. Hot liquid.

640
00:25:52,574 --> 00:25:54,594
I'd let her have it, McGee.

641
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:57,489
Thanks.

642
00:25:58,832 --> 00:26:01,697
So you spend the night
in the lieutenant's room, huh?

643
00:26:02,464 --> 00:26:03,464
Yes.

644
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:05,134
We stayed up late, talking.

645
00:26:05,135 --> 00:26:07,298
Yeah, I remember staying
up late in college...

646
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,299
"talking."

647
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:10,385
What's that look
on your face?

648
00:26:11,184 --> 00:26:12,184
What look?

649
00:26:12,215 --> 00:26:13,526
Are you falling in love
with a dying man?

650
00:26:13,527 --> 00:26:14,728
- Of course not.
- Hey.

651
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:18,131
The look on your
face says you are.

652
00:26:18,132 --> 00:26:20,336
When did you become
an expert on love?

653
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:22,456
Last time I checked,
your idea of a long-term

654
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:24,184
commitment was a three-day weekend.

655
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:26,295
What's that look on your face?

656
00:26:26,296 --> 00:26:27,296
Nothing.

657
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
I was just
going to say that...

658
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:29,613
Look, I know what you
were going to say.

659
00:26:29,614 --> 00:26:32,528
The next time Lieutenant Sanders
and I stay up late "talking",

660
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:33,928
we're going to use
a lead condom.

661
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:35,799
- Thank you.
- No, Ziva...

662
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,375
I was going to say,
I hope he pulls through.

663
00:26:40,376 --> 00:26:42,058
But you should know that
I found a photo

664
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,390
of an attractive woman,

665
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:45,761
a kid, and a husky
in his desk.

666
00:26:48,535 --> 00:26:50,032
How'd he ingest the thallium?

667
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:51,991
Well, they ate lunch
at the shooting range and

668
00:26:51,992 --> 00:26:53,927
Abby's combing through
the physical evidence, but

669
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:55,774
we still haven't
found the smoking gun.

670
00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:57,460
We swept the Dumpsters
at the shooting range,

671
00:26:57,461 --> 00:26:59,313
but the levels were low.
Same with the kitchen.

672
00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:01,337
There were two food
preparers, two servers.

673
00:27:01,338 --> 00:27:02,464
They all scanned clean.

674
00:27:02,465 --> 00:27:04,329
So did Dee Dee,
and she's the rather

675
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,698
eccentric woman
who runs the place.

676
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:07,191
Then Roy, I'm sorry...

677
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,923
Lieutenant Sanders must have

678
00:27:08,924 --> 00:27:10,940
been contaminated at the point
of consumption.

679
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:14,561
I think someone spiked
his hamburger or his coffee.

680
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,245
Who got near his food?

681
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:19,930
I watched the
security footage,

682
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:22,279
and Mark Sadowski is with
him the whole time,

683
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,069
but you can't see
see the table or the food.

684
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,192
The cameras are trained
on the shooting stalls.

685
00:27:26,193 --> 00:27:28,190
Oh, believe me, you don't
want to know why that is.

686
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:29,830
Someone could have
come from the back

687
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:30,849
and not been seen.

688
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,914
Sadowski was at the range
and he was here,

689
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:35,124
which places him at both
contamination sites.

690
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,125
Bring him in.

691
00:27:36,126 --> 00:27:37,126
On it, boss.

692
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:39,696
I thought I told you to stay

693
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:41,361
with Lieutenant Sanders
the whole time.

694
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:42,912
Agent Lee's with him.

695
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:44,763
He's making out his will.

696
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:47,641
Can't die unless you see
a lawyer.

697
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:49,517
Hey.

698
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,060
He may not die.

699
00:27:53,415 --> 00:27:54,865
He may pull through.

700
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:58,834
Officer David,

701
00:27:58,982 --> 00:28:01,542
I need you
to witness the document.

702
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:06,241
In case you're wondering,

703
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,305
I left it all to my sister.

704
00:28:08,751 --> 00:28:10,611
I hope she appreciates it.

705
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:11,805
We fight a lot.

706
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:13,706
Someday I'll tell you
about my family.

707
00:28:13,707 --> 00:28:16,027
Yeah, well, don't wait too long.

708
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:18,796
Does your sister have a husky?

709
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:19,947
How'd you know?

710
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:21,867
It is a nice addition
to any family.

711
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:23,248
Do you have a dog?

712
00:28:24,388 --> 00:28:25,388
No.

713
00:28:31,953 --> 00:28:34,213
I'll file this
with the court.

714
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:37,961
But I hope we don't need
to execute it for a very long,

715
00:28:37,962 --> 00:28:38,962
long time.

716
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:40,704
Thank you, Agent Lee.

717
00:28:46,706 --> 00:28:47,706
Ziva,

718
00:28:47,707 --> 00:28:50,181
Abby sent back
some of his things.

719
00:29:11,494 --> 00:29:14,713
You know a lot about handling
radioactive materials.

720
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:15,984
Sure, for my job.

721
00:29:16,764 --> 00:29:17,809
You were at the shooting range

722
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,775
with Lieutenant Sanders
a few days ago.

723
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:21,166
Yeah, we had lunch.

724
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,535
You slipped him
a little

725
00:29:22,536 --> 00:29:23,536
thallium.

726
00:29:25,174 --> 00:29:26,919
I've never touched thallium.
Look,

727
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,307
I had nothing to do with Roy
getting poisoned.

728
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:30,308
Nothing.

729
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:32,158
Skip the denials, tell me why.

730
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:35,109
This is my favorite part.

731
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:37,323
The part where
Gibbs breaks him?

732
00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:38,324
No,

733
00:29:38,325 --> 00:29:39,813
the part right
before Gibbs breaks him,

734
00:29:39,814 --> 00:29:42,894
when the guy still
thinks he has a chance.

735
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Why?

736
00:29:45,186 --> 00:29:46,883
- There is no "why."
- Why?

737
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:47,968
I didn't do it!

738
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:49,464
I would never hurt Roy.

739
00:29:49,465 --> 00:29:50,465
Sit down.

740
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,693
He's my friend.

741
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:54,876
We've traveled
the world together.

742
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,320
When I thought I had
prostate cancer,

743
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:58,573
he was the first person
I called.

744
00:29:58,574 --> 00:30:00,270
So if you have
any proof I did this,

745
00:30:00,271 --> 00:30:01,273
lay it out for me.

746
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:02,364
Let me see it.

747
00:30:02,603 --> 00:30:04,863
'Cause I know it doesn't exist.

748
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:11,929
He'll break him.

749
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,969
I finished analyzing the debris

750
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,824
that I vacuumed from
the shooting range gravel.

751
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:18,625
Was it our prime suspect?

752
00:30:18,744 --> 00:30:19,744
You mean...

753
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:21,579
Frenchie?

754
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,580
No.

755
00:30:22,581 --> 00:30:25,140
The fry registered scant
radioactivity after it was dusted.

756
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:27,313
None of the larger items
were contaminated,

757
00:30:27,314 --> 00:30:30,124
but the micro debris
was through the roof.

758
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:33,056
Were you able to break
down its component?

759
00:30:33,057 --> 00:30:34,521
Well, it took me a while,

760
00:30:34,522 --> 00:30:36,382
but I isolated human skin,

761
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:37,685
human hair, lint,

762
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:40,751
tobacco ash,
both large and small,

763
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:42,501
salt, pepper, dirt,

764
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:44,192
and pollen.

765
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:45,479
Ducky?

766
00:30:46,256 --> 00:30:47,256
Ducky?

767
00:30:47,955 --> 00:30:48,955
He's gone.

768
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:53,829
I gotta go, too.

769
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:02,284
I guess when you gotta go,
you gotta go.

770
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,851
Make it fast, Duck.

771
00:31:04,852 --> 00:31:06,529
We found the smoking gun,

772
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,530
with the emphasis
on "smoking."

773
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:11,286
Abby isolated large
radioactive ash

774
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,206
from the debris from
the shooting range.

775
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:14,657
It wasn't ingestion,

776
00:31:14,828 --> 00:31:16,108
it was inhalation.

777
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:18,680
Someone injected the
thallium into the cigar.

778
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:19,872
Yes, it's very efficient,

779
00:31:19,873 --> 00:31:22,631
too, because the lungs feed
directly into the bloodstream.

780
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:24,939
Sadowski mentioned hitting
the bars with Lieutenant Sanders

781
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,316
in Brazil for a cerveza
and a cigar. So...

782
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
Wait, boss,

783
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:30,767
I need
to show you something.

784
00:31:32,952 --> 00:31:34,492
I really hope it's not
that YouTube clip

785
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,618
I sent him this morning
'cause it's a little...

786
00:31:38,372 --> 00:31:40,478
Now, I downloaded
the security camera

787
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:42,579
feed from the shooting range.

788
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:43,967
Here's the isolated footage of

789
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,548
Mark Sadowski
and Lieutenant Sanders.

790
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:52,821
If you had laced
a cigar with thallium,

791
00:31:52,822 --> 00:31:54,749
would you stick around
to breathe in the smoke?

792
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,793
It's not likely.

793
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:57,569
It's like pulling the pin
on a grenade,

794
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,504
handing it to someone
and then standing beside them.

795
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:03,488
Sadowski didn't know they were
contaminated with radiation.

796
00:32:08,736 --> 00:32:09,776
No, stay here.

797
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:18,525
Explains why you
couldn't break him.

798
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:19,786
He didn't do it.

799
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:34,371
Where are they?

800
00:32:34,372 --> 00:32:35,372
What are you talking about?

801
00:32:35,373 --> 00:32:36,437
The cigars you smoke
when you go

802
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:38,173
outside to get some fresh air.

803
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:39,945
Okay, I had a puff or two.

804
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:41,444
- I know the doctor said not to.
- No !

805
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:42,545
Where are they?

806
00:32:45,145 --> 00:32:47,461
I had no idea
you were so antismoking.

807
00:32:47,462 --> 00:32:48,508
I mean, honestly, at this point,

808
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:51,500
I'd consider myself lucky
to live long enough to die of cancer.

809
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:54,915
Look, Roy, these cigars
are laced with thallium.

810
00:32:56,783 --> 00:32:57,853
Were they a gift?

811
00:32:57,854 --> 00:33:01,110
I, uh... I bought them myself,
duty-free, Sao Paulo airport.

812
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:02,300
Who else had access to these?

813
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:05,033
They were in my desk
until I stuck them in my bag.

814
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:07,671
Oh, man.

815
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,032
Okay, okay, you need to relax.

816
00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:11,251
- You need to stay calm.
- It's all right, Roy.

817
00:33:11,352 --> 00:33:12,352
It's all right.

818
00:33:13,253 --> 00:33:15,253
Deep breaths now,
take deep breaths.

819
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:17,069
Keep breathing.

820
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,619
Two out of three
inspectors poisoned.

821
00:33:21,628 --> 00:33:23,314
Someone's targeting
the agency.

822
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:25,064
Make a lot of enemies
wherever they've been, boss.

823
00:33:25,065 --> 00:33:26,252
Or wherever they're going.

824
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:28,002
You stick with Sadowski,
DiNozzo.

825
00:33:28,003 --> 00:33:29,688
McGee, get Diane Russio in here.

826
00:33:29,689 --> 00:33:31,911
She's the only inspector
who isn't sick.

827
00:33:31,939 --> 00:33:32,939
Yet.

828
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:36,183
We do a dozen inspections
a year, Agent Gibbs.

829
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:38,601
In a dozen different countries.

830
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:40,232
People don't like us,

831
00:33:40,504 --> 00:33:41,559
but I can't
believe

832
00:33:41,941 --> 00:33:43,885
any government
would sanction this.

833
00:33:44,503 --> 00:33:45,503
Thank you.

834
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,375
We all got tested after Roy.

835
00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:48,764
My results were negative.

836
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:50,996
Am I still at risk?

837
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:53,306
Low-level exposure.

838
00:33:53,941 --> 00:33:55,829
Lieutenant Sanders
was the target.

839
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:57,709
You have an inspection next week?

840
00:33:58,129 --> 00:33:59,740
Roy insisted we still go,

841
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:02,101
but now that Mark's sick..

842
00:34:02,318 --> 00:34:03,318
Where?

843
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,319
That's classified.

844
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:07,565
We prefer it if they don't know
we're coming.

845
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:08,566
Need to know.

846
00:34:10,877 --> 00:34:12,599
Russia,Pakistan and Uzbekistan.

847
00:34:15,752 --> 00:34:17,085
Names of the facilities?

848
00:34:19,004 --> 00:34:20,837
- MTAC Operations.
- I need satellite time.

849
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:22,409
I'll get the schedule, sir.
When do you need it?

850
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,941
Now.

851
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:25,693
Last one, boss.

852
00:34:25,694 --> 00:34:26,860
Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

853
00:34:27,507 --> 00:34:29,840
Image of the Tashkent reactor
stabilizing.

854
00:34:30,132 --> 00:34:31,690
Before the fall
of the Soviet Union,

855
00:34:31,691 --> 00:34:32,913
Uzbekistan was the top

856
00:34:33,258 --> 00:34:35,258
producer of weapons-grade
materials.

857
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:37,690
- Yeah? And After?
- They dismantled the centrifuge,

858
00:34:37,691 --> 00:34:39,382
but if they wanted
to put it back together...

859
00:34:39,383 --> 00:34:42,005
They'd bring the pieces in
with heavy equipment trucks,

860
00:34:42,006 --> 00:34:43,006
like these.

861
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,380
Lot of activity.

862
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:46,992
Looks like they're building something.

863
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:48,122
Or pulling it down.

864
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:49,879
I need a shot
from earlier this week.

865
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,105
Try the same location

866
00:34:51,148 --> 00:34:53,061
- 96 hours ago.
- Accessing now.

867
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:56,089
Someone's expecting guests.

868
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:57,805
Get that footage to DOD

869
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,616
and IAEA headquarters in Vienna.

870
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,453
- DiNozzo.
- Hey.

871
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:06,319
Someone tipped off Uzbekistan.

872
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,060
Ask Sadowski who knew.

873
00:35:10,105 --> 00:35:11,278
Sadowski's out of it, boss.

874
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:12,462
The doctor sedated him.

875
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:13,851
Lieutenant Sanders, then.

876
00:35:14,094 --> 00:35:15,094
Checking.

877
00:35:15,964 --> 00:35:16,964
McGee,

878
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:18,650
I want bank records
for everyone

879
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:19,873
working at the agency.

880
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,034
I want details
for every inspection

881
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:23,781
ever done on that facility.

882
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:34,153
Feel like I'm running
a marathon.

883
00:35:34,154 --> 00:35:36,635
- You are.
- I called my parents.

884
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,081
Mom's taking it bad.

885
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:41,061
The good news is,
Dad's going to fix it.

886
00:35:41,465 --> 00:35:42,778
They're on their way here,

887
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:44,714
and he's going to
turn it all around.

888
00:35:44,715 --> 00:35:45,826
Call in some favors.

889
00:35:45,966 --> 00:35:47,276
Ask the right questions.

890
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:49,832
- Because every problem has a solution.
- Exactly.

891
00:35:50,403 --> 00:35:52,340
God, he sounds a lot
like my father.

892
00:35:52,341 --> 00:35:53,396
He was tough on me,

893
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:55,910
but I made him proud.

894
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,905
Do they have far to travel?

895
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:00,034
Too far.

896
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,280
They'll need to be here anyway.

897
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:03,281
Decisions to make.

898
00:36:04,654 --> 00:36:06,320
I'd like for you to meet them.

899
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,665
- Is that weird?
- No.

900
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:09,661
I would like to meet them.

901
00:36:14,844 --> 00:36:15,844
How is he?

902
00:36:16,594 --> 00:36:17,594
He's fighting.

903
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:19,390
Gibbs has a question for him.

904
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:21,022
I think he just fell asleep.

905
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:28,029
Lieutenant?

906
00:36:28,906 --> 00:36:29,961
Lieutenant Sanders?

907
00:36:30,406 --> 00:36:31,461
- Ziva?
- I'm here.

908
00:36:31,654 --> 00:36:33,688
Agent DiNozzo needs
to ask you a question.

909
00:36:35,345 --> 00:36:36,622
Who knew you were going

910
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:37,987
to Uzbekistan
next week?

911
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:39,966
Classified.

912
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:41,593
Who decided where you'd go?

913
00:36:42,842 --> 00:36:43,842
My decision.

914
00:36:44,342 --> 00:36:45,342
Short list.

915
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:47,183
Kept everyone guessing.

916
00:36:47,467 --> 00:36:48,633
But who did you tell?

917
00:36:50,093 --> 00:36:51,093
Roy?

918
00:36:51,621 --> 00:36:52,879
Lieutenant?

919
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,752
Who did you tell, Roy?

920
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:57,637
Mark. Told Mark.

921
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,842
You done?

922
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,752
Who else did you tell?

923
00:37:07,093 --> 00:37:09,668
Roy? Anyone else?

924
00:37:09,907 --> 00:37:10,907
Diane.

925
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,095
Just...

926
00:37:12,341 --> 00:37:14,240
Just Mark and Diane.

927
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:16,468
Diane.

928
00:37:16,594 --> 00:37:17,594
Okay.

929
00:37:18,843 --> 00:37:19,843
Thank you.

930
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:30,657
Hey, boss, the lieutenant says

931
00:37:30,658 --> 00:37:33,324
only two others knew
he was going to Uzbekistan,

932
00:37:33,342 --> 00:37:35,064
Mark Sadowski and Diane Russio.

933
00:37:35,343 --> 00:37:36,343
How is he?

934
00:37:36,469 --> 00:37:37,469
He's fading fast.

935
00:37:41,287 --> 00:37:43,720
Boss, inspectors have
been back to Uzbekistan

936
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:45,554
six times in the past four years.

937
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:48,405
Next week's inspection would
have been lucky number seven.

938
00:37:48,406 --> 00:37:50,405
Sanders has been
at every one of them.

939
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:51,500
Makes him an expert.

940
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,531
If anything had changed,

941
00:37:52,575 --> 00:37:54,595
he's the guy
that would have noticed.

942
00:37:54,596 --> 00:37:56,318
Explains why they targeted him.

943
00:37:56,592 --> 00:37:57,593
What makes you think

944
00:37:57,594 --> 00:37:58,649
it was them, McGee?

945
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,300
Dr. Mallard.

946
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:01,301
Hey, Doc.

947
00:38:01,302 --> 00:38:03,025
I need you to check something.

948
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:06,426
The other side.

949
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,049
Well, you know you've been
in the hospital too long

950
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,050
when you've figured out
the vending machine.

951
00:38:18,051 --> 00:38:19,939
You think I've
been here too long?

952
00:38:20,987 --> 00:38:22,209
You want some of this?

953
00:38:22,362 --> 00:38:23,473
That's Roy's sister.

954
00:38:24,113 --> 00:38:25,425
The woman in the photo,

955
00:38:25,426 --> 00:38:27,259
the one with the kid
and the dog.

956
00:38:28,176 --> 00:38:29,453
I had to ask him, Ziva.

957
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:30,676
I know.

958
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,984
Are you okay?

959
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,724
Part of me just wants to run.

960
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:39,436
You know, I can't
believe this is happening to me.

961
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:41,403
To me, of all people.

962
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,014
Well, you shouldn't take it
as a sign of weakness.

963
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:46,986
Well, then how should
I take it, Tony?

964
00:38:46,987 --> 00:38:48,931
Character-building?
Life-affirming?

965
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,498
Somehow I don't think
Roy sees it that way.

966
00:38:54,487 --> 00:38:55,487
I'm sorry.

967
00:38:56,053 --> 00:38:57,053
Sorry.

968
00:38:58,359 --> 00:38:59,359
Ziva?

969
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,718
I'm dying of boredom in there.

970
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,601
It's okay, I got you.

971
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:10,682
Hey...

972
00:39:11,802 --> 00:39:13,690
what's a guy got
to do to get a...

973
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:17,145
pretty girl to take a walk
in the garden?

974
00:39:18,118 --> 00:39:20,679
Roy, you shouldn't
be out of bed.

975
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,680
You need
to be back in bed.

976
00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:23,430
- It's okay, Doctor, I can manage.
- No, he needs to be back in...

977
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,883
Dr. Hass, excuse me.

978
00:39:24,925 --> 00:39:26,250
Can I speak to you for a second?

979
00:39:26,293 --> 00:39:27,711
I think... I think
I may have been exposed.

980
00:39:27,778 --> 00:39:29,393
I don't know how,
and I don't mean

981
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:30,436
to be an alarmist, but I got

982
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:32,438
the burning sensation
and the headaches

983
00:39:32,477 --> 00:39:33,767
and the vomiting
and the...

984
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,407
- whole thing.
- Diarrhea? You got the diarrhea?

985
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,803
Yeah, like a tap,
and it just hit me, and I...

986
00:39:37,804 --> 00:39:39,054
Okay, let's, uh,
sit you down.

987
00:39:39,055 --> 00:39:40,468
We're going to need
to run some tests.

988
00:39:41,994 --> 00:39:42,994
Ah, Jethro.

989
00:39:43,305 --> 00:39:44,416
As per your request,

990
00:39:44,617 --> 00:39:46,554
I've reviewed the
results of the tests

991
00:39:46,555 --> 00:39:48,277
carried out on the agency staff

992
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:50,992
after it was confirmed that
the lieutenant had been exposed.

993
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:53,381
And I... I found what
you were looking for.

994
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:56,110
Trace amounts
of ferric ferrocyanide.

995
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,930
Prussian blue.

996
00:39:58,555 --> 00:40:00,721
Someone was taking it
prophylactically.

997
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:03,759
As a preventative
measure, Jethro.

998
00:40:03,824 --> 00:40:04,824
Who?

999
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:07,198
Her.

1000
00:40:11,514 --> 00:40:12,514
Got her, boss.

1001
00:40:12,515 --> 00:40:15,459
$50,000 in cash deposited
over the past three months.

1002
00:40:15,762 --> 00:40:17,385
Closed the account this morning.

1003
00:40:17,386 --> 00:40:18,511
Shifted the funds offshore.

1004
00:40:18,512 --> 00:40:20,265
Looks like she's
about to do a runner.

1005
00:40:20,266 --> 00:40:21,266
Where is she now?

1006
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,208
Just checked. Still in the office.

1007
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:25,940
No, I don't want to travel
via London.

1008
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:27,290
I want a direct flight.

1009
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:30,019
Yeah. Yes, I know
it's last minute, but I...

1010
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:31,769
Look, there must be other carriers...

1011
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:32,983
Miss Russio?

1012
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:34,912
Agent Gibbs.

1013
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:36,070
Your travel
coordinator,

1014
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:37,725
- Holly Stegman...
- Okay, she just

1015
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,018
left me here with this mess,
flight plans...

1016
00:40:40,077 --> 00:40:41,077
Which way?

1017
00:40:41,078 --> 00:40:42,567
- I'm trying to...
- Which way?!

1018
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:45,321
Parking garage.

1019
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:51,651
Come on.

1020
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:54,589
Stop!

1021
00:40:58,467 --> 00:40:59,467
Stop!

1022
00:41:12,466 --> 00:41:13,466
No.

1023
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:15,541
No. Wait. W- Wait.

1024
00:41:15,652 --> 00:41:16,652
Out of the car.

1025
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:18,466
No. I didn't mean to do it.

1026
00:41:18,716 --> 00:41:19,771
I couldn't kill Roy

1027
00:41:20,216 --> 00:41:22,160
any more than I could run over you!

1028
00:41:22,402 --> 00:41:23,790
I wanted to
make him sick

1029
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:26,040
so he couldn't travel, that's all.

1030
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:27,576
He would have known.

1031
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:30,901
He would have realized
it was either Mark or me.

1032
00:41:30,902 --> 00:41:31,902
Just tell me... Wait!

1033
00:41:32,585 --> 00:41:34,132
Tell me I didn't kill him.

1034
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:39,218
No. No. No.

1035
00:41:39,795 --> 00:41:41,071
I didn't mean to kill him.

1036
00:41:41,114 --> 00:41:42,662
She could have
killed you, boss.

1037
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:04,005
What a perfect
day for a run.

1038
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:08,586
I'd even consider
a double loop.

1039
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:11,753
I have something of yours.

1040
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:20,933
I remember you now.

1041
00:42:25,184 --> 00:42:27,461
All those mornings,
I ran right past you.

1042
00:42:28,058 --> 00:42:29,058
Youblastedpast me.

1043
00:42:31,962 --> 00:42:33,116
I, uh...

1044
00:42:33,122 --> 00:42:36,399
I used to put in a little extra
kick to impress the ladies.

1045
00:42:37,997 --> 00:42:38,997
Well, it worked.

1046
00:42:46,502 --> 00:42:48,668
I'm sorry we never
got to run together.

1047
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,310
Me, too.

1048
00:42:55,872 --> 00:42:57,983
Do you think you
would have noticed...

1049
00:42:59,935 --> 00:43:01,435
that I was no longer there?

1050
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,198
That I'd stopped running?

1051
00:43:07,748 --> 00:43:09,192
Yes, I would have noticed.

1052
00:43:10,873 --> 00:43:12,595
I would have missed seeing you.

1053
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:18,373
But eventually, you
would have forgotten me.

1054
00:43:18,374 --> 00:43:19,374
Yes.

1055
00:43:23,498 --> 00:43:24,775
I won't forget you now.
