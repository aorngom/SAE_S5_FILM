1
00:00:34,732 --> 00:00:36,505
Driver's license and
registration, please, sir.

2
00:00:36,506 --> 00:00:38,927
Sorry, Officer. My wife...

3
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:41,141
....pregnant. Hm...

4
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:43,800
She's always calling
me when I'm driving.

5
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:45,645
And registration, sir.

6
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,132
Gun!

7
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,511
Sir, put your hands up on the dashboard!

8
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:51,663
But... my wife.

9
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:54,329
Hands on the dashboard!
I want to see your hands!

10
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:56,119
All right, nice and
slow, I want your hands

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,449
through the window opening
the door from the outside

12
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,932
and step out of the car.

13
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,046
Now!

14
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:05,241
- Charlie.
- I got it.

15
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:07,490
On the hood, sir, now.

16
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:08,737
Hands behind your back.

17
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,180
You just fired this gun, sir?

18
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:23,269
Damn.

19
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,680
You okay, sir?

20
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:27,080
Sir?

47
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:28,492
Men are such bad liars.

48
00:02:28,493 --> 00:02:30,424
But if a good liar
was telling you a lie,

49
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:31,830
you would not know it was a lie.

50
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:33,470
Ha! I would.

51
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:34,779
How would you know?

52
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,551
Know what?

53
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:38,182
When an expert liar
is telling Ziva a lie.

54
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,371
And this started how?

55
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:41,895
Well, I told her that I
went to the gym this morning.

56
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:45,044
No great skill in guessing
you were fibbing there, probie.

57
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:46,479
You may have lost some
weight, and personally,

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,280
I'm very proud of you,

59
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:49,296
but "gym" is definitely
not your middle name.

60
00:02:49,297 --> 00:02:51,434
Okay, well, Ziva ...

61
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:53,723
....thinks that all men are liars.

62
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:55,928
Really?

63
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:58,342
So if...

64
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:01,970
.... I were to lie to you,
you would be able to tell?

65
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:05,473
Particularly you.

66
00:03:05,474 --> 00:03:06,554
You think?

67
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:07,630
Wouldn't go there, Tony.

68
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,838
Oh, watch and weep.

69
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,449
True or false:

70
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:14,027
I had eggs for breakfast this morning.

71
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:15,297
True.

72
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:16,987
Lucky guess.

73
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:18,673
Last night,

74
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:21,984
I had a date with a
very beautiful woman.

75
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:22,717
False.

76
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:23,649
She's good.

77
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,973
My first car was a
shiny new red Corvette.

78
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,070
False.

79
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:29,640
Strike three.

80
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:30,886
I win.

81
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,474
How did you do that?

82
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:35,094
When you said you had a red Corvette,
you looked down and to the left

83
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:37,592
a telltale sign when people lie.

84
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,278
And the date?

85
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:38,583
Gibbs.

86
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:39,662
Tony...

87
00:03:40,323 --> 00:03:42,096
if you'd gone out with a
beautiful woman last night,

88
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,638
you'd have talked about it all day.

89
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,444
- I would?
- Oh, yeah.

90
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:47,788
Okay, but how could you possibly know

91
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:49,585
that I had eggs for
breakfast this morning?

92
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:50,300
Gear up.

93
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:51,843
Got a message from a dead guy.

94
00:03:51,844 --> 00:03:52,928
Ready to roll, boss.

95
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:53,852
Dinozzo ...

96
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:54,929
Yeah, boss?

97
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,697
You got egg on your shirt.

98
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:58,623
Not just your shirt.

99
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:05,988
It's amazing what the
human body can endure.

100
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:09,036
This poor fellow probably
lasted longer than he should.

101
00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:10,416
How much longer?

102
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,554
Several minutes.

103
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,848
Not much when you stack it against

104
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:17,183
a lifetime of minutes,
but minutes nonetheless.

105
00:04:17,184 --> 00:04:19,433
He could've driven a couple of miles.

106
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:21,251
More like a couple city blocks.

107
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:22,884
Traffic sucks this time of day.

108
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:24,509
According to his military ID,

109
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,118
he's Chief Petty Officer Jack T. Vale.

110
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:28,207
You know him?

111
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:28,790
No.

112
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,405
Well, he knows you guys.

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,995
Jackpot.

114
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:38,871
Got to be 50 or 60 bucks there.

115
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:41,360
Yeah, there's more
in his trouser pocket.

116
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:43,337
What do you think, illegal slots?

117
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:46,015
Maybe he was on his
way to a video arcade.

118
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:47,446
Maybe he was doing laundry.

119
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:48,885
That's a lot of laundry.

120
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:51,604
Maybe he was a once-
a-month kind of man.

121
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,200
I do it once a week.

122
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:54,876
Laundry.

123
00:04:55,482 --> 00:04:56,894
Who's the fare?

124
00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:59,732
Oh, that's Robert John Stevens.

125
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:03,406
But the guy's got an accent as thick
as Polish sausage, so I ain't buying it.

126
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:06,763
Found a loaded .38 on
the seat, recently fired.

127
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:08,393
Got an exit wound?

128
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:10,869
Well, there doesn't
appear to be an exit wound.

129
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,549
So I dig out the bullet,
you match it to the weapon

130
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,437
and, hey, presto, justice prevails.

131
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:18,187
Open and shut case, boss.

132
00:05:18,188 --> 00:05:20,871
No such thing, DiNozzo, only watertight.

133
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,087
Give me a call when you're finished.

134
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:24,733
You got it, Ducky.

135
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:30,729
Doesn't look like a fake ID.

136
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:31,564
Fake.

137
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,700
What are you talking about?

138
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,220
You barely got a look at it.

139
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:36,783
I can spot a fake a mile away.

140
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,504
I had the best fake ID in college.

141
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,492
Never got turned away from a bar.

142
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:44,494
Never?

143
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:46,377
Never.

144
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:48,538
Once.

145
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:49,798
Once?

146
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:52,027
- Or twice.
- A month?

147
00:05:52,575 --> 00:05:55,553
A week. But, listen, we went out
every night, and it was a college town.

148
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:57,578
And they're very tough
there, eagle-eyed bouncers.

149
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:59,104
You really had to act
the part, too, you know?

150
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:01,335
You had to be mature,
worldly, kind of grown up.

151
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:03,254
So it wasn't really the ID, it was you.

152
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:04,904
Are you kidding me?

153
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,701
No, I was...

154
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,991
I was the master of fake.

155
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:15,648
Last call dialed was 911.

156
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:17,475
Cops will have it on tape.

157
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,385
Maybe this one will be easy.

158
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:33,139
Fake name...

159
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:35,060
fake plates.

160
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:36,763
Real weapon.

161
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:38,229
Real guy dead.

162
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:44,155
When he first saw you, he called 911.

163
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:50,606
When you realized he was
trailing you, you shot him.

164
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:59,780
Even the very, very good ones

165
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:02,393
slip up eventually.

166
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:04,570
And you...

167
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,661
Mister... Stevens?

168
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,360
You're not very good.

169
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:16,811
- Women want men to lie to them.
- Not true.

170
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:20,427
"Honey, does my butt look
big in these pants to you?"

171
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:22,271
"Actually, yes, sweetheart,

172
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:24,246
"your butt looks as big as Alabama.

173
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:26,968
"Didn't want to say anything, but
you got the 'Bama butt going on."

174
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:28,080
See ?

175
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,019
You want us to lie to you, so we do.

176
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,339
Especially if your
butt is as big as 'Bama.

177
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:35,021
Not that...

178
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,542
not that your butt is big.

179
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,812
- And not that I've even looked.
- Liar.

180
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:40,886
Okay,

181
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,616
I have looked, but, you know, I never...

182
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:44,635
Never what?

183
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:45,872
Oh, no.

184
00:07:47,097 --> 00:07:49,340
I... I'm catching on to you.

185
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:50,877
And you're not going to
get me to say something

186
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:53,676
and then do your little
Mossad true-or-false trick.

187
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:55,263
I'm too smart for that.

188
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,710
Of course you are.

189
00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:02,454
-Ziva...
- Gibbs.

190
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,886
How many languages do you speak?

191
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,980
<i>Comment
vous-appelez-vous?</i>

192
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:17,274
Ah, French.

193
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:19,769
<i>Was wir nur wissen
wollen ist ihre naame.</i>

194
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,345
<i>Und German.</i>

195
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,950
<i>Mi dica il suo nome.</i>

196
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:27,781
Italian. Of course.

197
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,619
<i>Lee ma betellna essmak?</i>

198
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:34,962
Greek?

199
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:36,188
Arabic.

200
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,128
Nice, boss.

201
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:40,399
<i>Skah-zhee-teh,
kahk vahs zah-voot?</i>

202
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:45,315
Ah. Got him. He's Russian.

203
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,767
Looked down and to the
left. Sure sign of a liar.

204
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:49,809
That's very good, DiNozzo.

205
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,579
Thanks, boss.

206
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,112
Ziva tell you that?

207
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:02,688
Tell me you found a match
on our suspect's prints, Ab.

208
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:03,388
Negative.

209
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:04,927
Still processing.

210
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:08,870
What we do have is $73.65.

211
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:10,496
That's what the victim was carrying.

212
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:12,432
And there's no pennies.

213
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:13,787
He probably threw them out.

214
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:15,132
A lot people do, you know.

215
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:16,789
I mean, I don't, but other people do.

216
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,755
Do you know how many pennies are
thrown out or put into jars every year?

217
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:21,669
Enlighten me.

218
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,885
Three and a half
billion. Billion, Gibbs.

219
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:26,456
That's, like, $35 million in pennies.

220
00:09:26,457 --> 00:09:28,516
That's a lot of pennies in any language.

221
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:29,940
Including Russian.

222
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,661
No, Russians don't have
pennies, they have kopecks.

223
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:33,583
What's it have to do with Russia?

224
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:36,061
Run his prints through
Immigration and let's find out.

225
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:38,005
Oh, because he's a foreigner

226
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:40,525
and every visitor is printed
when they enter the U.S.

227
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:42,101
Clever, Gibbs.

228
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,304
Okay, I reviewed the 911 call.

229
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:46,308
Ready?

230
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,519
My name is Jack Vale.

231
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,355
This is really important, okay?

232
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:53,766
I've identified a
terrorist, a known terrorist.

233
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,029
I'm following him downtown right now.

234
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,276
Get someone over here. Call NC...

235
00:09:58,277 --> 00:09:59,833
NCIS.

236
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:03,293
I'm guessing an overtaxed
relay tower in the downtown area

237
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:05,704
caused the line to drop
off before he finished.

238
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,616
But, Gibbs, this guy works
in the supply department.

239
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:10,277
What would he know about terrorists?

240
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:11,622
That's a good question.

241
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:14,120
I also isolated the background noise.

242
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:24,420
It's kind of a Pac-Man-
retro-meets-Vegas sort of thing.

243
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:26,170
Not really something you hear in a car.

244
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:28,239
He was on foot when he made the call.

245
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:30,261
We have a winner.

246
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:33,636
Nikolai Aleksandrovich Puchenko.

247
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:34,846
Russian.

248
00:10:37,957 --> 00:10:40,228
And there's a Homeland Security alert.

249
00:10:41,243 --> 00:10:44,832
You're not the only one
interested in Mr. Nikolai Puchenko.

250
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:05,753
I want lawyer.

251
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,480
Get a good one.

252
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:10,653
Tell him the charge
is going to be murder.

253
00:11:12,702 --> 00:11:15,582
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

254
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,905
Normally matching the
bullet to the weapon

255
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:22,999
shouldn't present us with any great
difficulty, but this is far from normal.

256
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,099
How far?

257
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,695
I haven't seen anything like it
in 25 years of slicing and dicing.

258
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:31,729
The bullet entered below the rib cage,

259
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,405
traveling from left to right.

260
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:34,549
It nicked the pancreas,

261
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,772
missed the liver,
deflected off the fifth rib

262
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:38,996
and gouged its way through soft tissue

263
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:41,443
and perforated the stomach.

264
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:43,083
No exit wound.

265
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:48,327
And so that's where it
appears to have, um...

266
00:11:49,384 --> 00:11:51,671
To have um, what, Dr. Mallard?

267
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:53,584
Vanished.

268
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:56,021
It's not in the bullet furrow

269
00:11:56,022 --> 00:11:58,887
and it's not showing
up on any of the X rays.

270
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:01,039
I don't know where it's gone.

271
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:05,240
I'm afraid we don't have a bullet.

272
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:16,947
The 911 call was routed
through this tower here.

273
00:12:16,948 --> 00:12:18,820
Anyone ever heard of Operation Sunburst?

274
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:23,215
That locates Vale somewhere in
this area when he made the call.

275
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:24,894
Anywhere outside of the
circle would have meant that

276
00:12:24,895 --> 00:12:26,409
the call was routed through
a different cell tower.

277
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,447
Back in '91.

278
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:29,468
Come one, anyone, Operation Sunburst.

279
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:32,016
About three city blocks...

280
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,041
Less.

281
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:35,090
Abby said the signal dropped
out. That probably puts him

282
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:37,891
at the outside edge of the
reception area of that tower.

283
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:40,451
That's pretty clever, boss.
How'd you figure that out?

284
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:41,878
Too much time around you.

285
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,800
Boss...

286
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:44,828
Operation Sunburst,  you know it?

287
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:45,838
It was a sting.

288
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,938
One of our ops. Chief
Vale was part of it.

289
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:49,301
He was just a P.O. Three back then

290
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,848
detailed from the Supply Department

291
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:52,771
to NIS for five weeks.

292
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,398
Get that file from archives.

293
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,820
I can't.

294
00:12:56,405 --> 00:12:59,483
I mean, it's not possible,
boss. I got the index reference,

295
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:02,143
but when I called the archive,
they said the file was missing.

296
00:13:02,144 --> 00:13:04,491
Check the log. Who booked it out last?

297
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:06,367
CIA.

298
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,670
So I guess that's not a
"who," it's more of an "it."

299
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:10,306
Who was the NIS case agent?

300
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,866
What time is it in Mexico right now?

301
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:19,307
Cantina time.

302
00:13:29,496 --> 00:13:30,516
<i>Si.</i>

303
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:32,808
<i>Si.</i>

304
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,682
Washington, senor.

305
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:45,324
Only one person in Washington DC

306
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,877
knows where to find me this time of day.

307
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:49,184
How you doing, probie?

308
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:50,917
Well, I'm surviving.

309
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:52,044
You?

310
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:53,114
Sun's hot,

311
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:54,276
ocean's warm,

312
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:55,550
beer's cold.

313
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:56,921
Got no complaints.

314
00:13:56,922 --> 00:13:58,316
You change your mind?

315
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,538
Every day.

316
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,381
But then something stops me.

317
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,289
What's stopping you this time?

318
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,570
Operation Sunburst.

319
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:08,004
That was a long time ago.

320
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:10,477
Do you remember a petty
officer named Vale?

321
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:13,669
Right guy, right place, right time.

322
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,303
Went undercover for us.

323
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:17,487
Well, he was shot dead this morning.

324
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,210
And you think this has
something to do with Sunburst?

325
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:22,959
Well, you tell me.

326
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,193
We got a suspect.

327
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:25,355
Russian.

328
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:28,093
Arkady Kobach?

329
00:14:28,094 --> 00:14:29,343
Nikolai...

330
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:29,904
....Puchenko.

331
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:33,074
Arkady Kobach is the man
you need to worry about.

332
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:34,989
Puchenko and he served together.

333
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,607
When the Soviet Union
started started falling apart,

334
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:38,953
they got into the arms trade.

335
00:14:38,954 --> 00:14:42,560
Wanted to buy some of our Stingers
to sell to Chechen terrorists.

336
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:44,764
Tried to bribe Vale in
the Supply Department.

337
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:46,091
So you sent him undercover?

338
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:47,545
Someone tipped them off.

339
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:49,493
They hightailed it
back to Easter Europe.

340
00:14:49,494 --> 00:14:50,075
A month later,

341
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:54,772
the CIA stuck its nose in and our
file conveniently went missing.

342
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,315
What happened to Vale?

343
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,339
He bumped into Puchenko in the street.

344
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,539
Recognized him, tried to follow him.

345
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:04,238
Puchenko shot him.

346
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:09,160
I hope you've got an ironclad case.

347
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:11,997
This piece of scum is way overdue.

348
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,099
Yeah.

349
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:15,800
Working on it, boss.

350
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,744
Good luck with the fishing down there.

351
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,323
Thanks for the tip.

352
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:20,910
Good luck.

353
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,831
We got a case yet, DiNozzo?

354
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:29,610
Like you said, working on it, boss.

355
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:31,406
We've narrowed down the
area where he was shot,

356
00:15:31,407 --> 00:15:34,027
and we do have a suspect
in possession of a gun.

357
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:35,317
Which means murder one.

358
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:36,263
With a bullet.

359
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:37,962
If we can find one.

360
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:48,883
Hi, Ducky.

361
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,163
Penny for your thoughts.

362
00:15:53,164 --> 00:15:55,888
Or three and a half billion pennies.

363
00:15:57,368 --> 00:15:59,435
That was an in-joke.

364
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:02,332
So I have a pristine

365
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,030
bullet sample fired
from our suspect's .38.

366
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,610
All I need is the bullet
you pulled from him.

367
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:08,524
I'll make a match

368
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:11,410
and we'll send the bad guys wherever
the bad guys go when we catch 'em.

369
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:13,329
Where do the bad guys
go when we catch 'em?

370
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,002
The bullet's disappeared, Abby.

371
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:17,994
I thought there was no exit wound?

372
00:16:17,995 --> 00:16:19,934
There is no exit wound.

373
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:22,146
Well, maybe it fell out, like
in his clothes or something.

374
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,304
I already checked.

375
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:24,653
Or an evidence bag.

376
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:26,056
- Checked.
- Or a body bag.

377
00:16:26,057 --> 00:16:27,438
Ditto.

378
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:30,669
Well, bullets don't
just disappear, Ducky.

379
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:32,492
Unless it's an ice bullet.

380
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:35,579
I saw this really cool movie one
time where this guy carved a bullet...

381
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,200
- It's not an ice bullet.
- .. out of ice...

382
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,822
Do you really think you lost a bullet?

383
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:45,023
I didn't lose it.

384
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,168
At least, I don't think I did.

385
00:16:49,252 --> 00:16:51,274
Oh, Ducky.

386
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:54,185
I'd be sick to my
stomach if I lost evidence

387
00:16:54,186 --> 00:16:57,807
or screwed something up like
a DNA sample or a fingerprint.

388
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,202
Of course!

389
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:01,057
That's got to be it.

390
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:04,516
Nothing else makes any
sense. Abby, you are a genius.

391
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,797
Probie.

392
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:13,493
Yeah

393
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,466
What's this?

394
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:17,741
Number three?

395
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:18,738
Four.

396
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:21,769
Would have thought you'd have
been done practicing by now.

397
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,756
There's always something to learn, Mike.

398
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:26,036
Hard lessons.

399
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:27,752
Some harder than others.

400
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:29,903
Got any extra fine?

401
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:35,975
You didn't waste any time getting here.

402
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:38,741
You were expecting me?

403
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:41,206
Well, I would have been
disappointed if you didn't come.

404
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:44,015
Yeah, well, let's just say I...

405
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:45,843
don't like loose ends, probie.

406
00:17:45,844 --> 00:17:49,630
Take more than loose ends to
get you off that beach in Baja.

407
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:55,457
These scumbags have been selling
weapons to tyrants and terrorists

408
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,781
ever since they gave us the slip.

409
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,929
Guns...

410
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,787
....and bombs...

411
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,471
.... and RPGs used to kill
American soldiers and marines

412
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:07,889
in every hellhole from
Mogadishu to Baghdad.

413
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:09,989
It's time it ended.

414
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:12,883
You know who tipped them?

415
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,003
Rumor was they'd agreed to supply

416
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:18,563
some new high-tech
Soviet missile to CIA.

417
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:23,119
Guess they figured they wouldn't get their
missile if their arms dealers were in prison.

418
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:26,521
Which is exactly where
I was going to send them.

419
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,559
You've got a chance here, probie.

420
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:33,346
Don't screw it up.

421
00:18:38,662 --> 00:18:40,572
Same to you, Nikolai.

422
00:18:40,713 --> 00:18:41,739
Who's that with him?

423
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,254
Marty Allen. His lawyer.

424
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,253
Hope he's not a good lawyer.

425
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,430
Enjoy your tour?

426
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:48,440
Yeah,

427
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:50,752
place is like a video arcade.

428
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,758
You've got more technology in one room

429
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,152
than we had in every office
across the whole damn country.

430
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:58,010
You know...

431
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,208
....if I needed to interrogate someone
when I worked at Camp Pendleton,

432
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:03,253
I'd take them into the broom closet

433
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:04,655
with a telephone directory.

434
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:07,633
No broom closet, no
telephone directory...

435
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:09,676
No smoking.

436
00:19:09,826 --> 00:19:12,638
Another three reasons
why I left just in...

437
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:14,153
.... time.

438
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:16,954
Special Agent Gibbs,

439
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,577
may I have a moment?

440
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:20,397
Ooh-rah, Gunny.

441
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:22,192
You know that guy?

442
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:23,374
Yeah...

443
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:26,083
....Like a rat knows a snake.

444
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:28,725
Director Shepard...

445
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:30,336
Special Agent Gibbs,

446
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,792
this is Roy Carver, Homeland Security.

447
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:34,135
Agent Gibbs.

448
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:37,646
Mr. Carver is here in relation
to a suspect we're holding.

449
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:39,012
Nikolai Puchenko.

450
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:42,502
I'd like you to transfer him
into Mr. Carver's custody.

451
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:44,591
Why?

452
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:46,302
He's working for us.

453
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:51,689
He's providing valuable intel on the arms
trade among terrorist groups in Eastern Europe.

454
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:55,364
Was he working for you when
he killed a sailor yesterday?

455
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:59,352
I read the preliminary autopsy
report on that, Agent Gibbs.

456
00:19:59,353 --> 00:20:02,453
Seems there's a lack of evidence
linking Puchenko to the crime.

457
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:04,369
He was carrying an illegal firearm.

458
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,056
Not connected to the shooting.

459
00:20:06,057 --> 00:20:06,941
Yet.

460
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:07,695
Well..

461
00:20:07,696 --> 00:20:12,364
Well, find evidence that he was involved in
any serious criminal activity and I promise,...

462
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:14,190
I'll hand him right back to you

463
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:17,261
Do we have anything yet, Agent Gibbs?

464
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:19,078
We will.

465
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,581
Until we do,

466
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:22,997
I'm releasing him to Homeland Security.

467
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,398
Ziva, get Puchenko.

468
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:42,265
Hello, this is Special Agent DiNozzo.

469
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:45,054
I have Ziva David coming down
to pick up Nikolai Puchenko.

470
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:54,076
If he walks out of here,
you won't see him again.

471
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:57,450
Any evidence you have
won't be worth spit.

472
00:20:57,571 --> 00:21:00,465
We haven't got enough evidence
to even clear our throat.

473
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:02,467
We can't charge him with anything.

474
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:06,687
Mr. Carver, if you'll just sign
these custody transfer forms.

475
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,907
Director...

476
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:16,999
may I draw your attention to
an NIS case code name Sunburst.

477
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,021
Which dealt with serious allegations of
arms smuggling by this man Nikolai Puchenko.

478
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:23,720
I'm aware of the case, Mr. Franks.

479
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:26,902
As I recall, the file was lost, Mike.

480
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:29,138
I made a copy, Roy.

481
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:32,100
Jack Vale was the key witness.

482
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,370
He's dead.

483
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,574
You don't have anyone to testify.

484
00:21:36,285 --> 00:21:37,915
I was the case agent.

485
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,637
I'll testify.

486
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:42,716
Serious enough charges
for you, Director Shepard?

487
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:46,945
Take him back into custody.

488
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:48,380
I'm sorry, Mr. Carver.

489
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:51,005
NCIS is not through with this man.

490
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:53,393
Homeland Security looks
forward to reviewing the file.

491
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:54,844
This is an outrage.

492
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:58,739
I strongly protest your
department's treatment of my client.

493
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,561
Come on.

494
00:22:06,817 --> 00:22:08,831
What did he just say?

495
00:22:10,023 --> 00:22:11,957
He said you're a dead man,

496
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,540
Mike.

497
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:22,342
We're taking Puchenko's threat
to kill Franks seriously,

498
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:24,517
so right now this is who
we have to worry about.

499
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:25,531
McGee?

500
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:27,972
Arkady Mikhailovich Kobach,

501
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:29,035
late 40s.

502
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:33,076
Served with Puchenko in the Spetsnaz
That's the Soviet Special Forces.

503
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:35,232
First Afghanistan then Chechnya.

504
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:38,702
In 1990, Arkady executed three
clerks in a payroll office

505
00:22:38,703 --> 00:22:40,559
because they could not pay his men.

506
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,085
Then shot the colonel
who came to arrest him.

507
00:22:43,086 --> 00:22:45,112
Been dealing arms ever since.

508
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:48,443
I want a 24-hour protection
detail. DiNozzo, you're team leader.

509
00:22:48,444 --> 00:22:49,982
You're in safe hands, Mike.

510
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:52,984
I've seen your hands,
DiNozzo. They don't impress me.

511
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:56,270
I don't need babysitting,
Gunny. I can look after myself.

512
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:59,737
After spending four months in that
crap hole you call a home in Baja,

513
00:22:59,738 --> 00:23:01,902
I find that highly debatable.

514
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:03,644
- Safe house, boss?
- Yep. Mine

515
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,772
Make yourself at home, Tony.

516
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:06,975
Won't touch a thing, boss.

517
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:08,008
McGee.

518
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:09,924
We'll be right down.

519
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,012
Boss, Ducky found the bullet.

520
00:23:12,562 --> 00:23:15,619
It's fascinating where
bullets can end up.

521
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,542
I once found a .22 caliber
slug in a woman's knee

522
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:20,384
and she'd been shot in the chest.

523
00:23:20,385 --> 00:23:22,164
See, the bullet entered her heart,

524
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:24,223
was pumped down through the aorta

525
00:23:24,224 --> 00:23:27,702
into the iliac and on down
into the femoral artery.

526
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:28,835
Extraordinary.

527
00:23:28,836 --> 00:23:30,271
So the missing bullet's in his knee?

528
00:23:30,272 --> 00:23:31,338
No, no. Good heavens, no.

529
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:33,533
That's much to easy, and
anyway, it would have...

530
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:34,903
.... shown up on the X rays.

531
00:23:34,904 --> 00:23:36,282
So where is it?

532
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:37,292
I have no idea.

533
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:38,755
None at all.

534
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:39,985
You said you found it.

535
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:42,617
Well, I have. I just don't know where.

536
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:45,551
I can, however, tell you how.

537
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:47,747
It was Abby who gave me the idea

538
00:23:47,748 --> 00:23:52,135
when she said that she would be sick to
her stomach if she ever lost evidence.

539
00:23:52,136 --> 00:23:54,232
"Sick," that's the key word.

540
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,105
So I had Abby run some tests of material

541
00:23:57,106 --> 00:24:01,369
I took from his esophagus and we
found traces of protease pepsin

542
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:05,144
along with all sorts of
other things such as sulfides,

543
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:07,320
oleic acid, polyphenols.

544
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:08,010
But...

545
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:10,390
.... the smoking gun, so to speak,

546
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:13,236
was the presence of triticum durum.

547
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:13,977
Pasta?

548
00:24:13,978 --> 00:24:17,905
Specifically spaghetti cooked
with garlic and olive oil.

549
00:24:17,906 --> 00:24:20,982
Spaghetti aglio y
olio, as the Romans say.

550
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:23,259
Very nice with a glass of Sangiovese.

551
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,801
Anyway, anyway, when the bullet
became lodged in his stomach,

552
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:30,088
he became sick. What you might call...

553
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:31,594
....projectile vomit.

554
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,757
He puked up the bullet?

555
00:24:32,758 --> 00:24:35,069
Yeah. Find the puke and
you'll find the projectile.

556
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,167
So you want us to look for
a pile of dried-up vomit.

557
00:24:38,168 --> 00:24:40,167
Yes, and I'll need a generous sample

558
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:43,642
so I can positively match it
to what I found in the victim.

559
00:24:43,643 --> 00:24:45,372
Oh, and of course,...

560
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:46,879
....the bullet.

561
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:49,693
Ziva, McGee, get onto it.

562
00:24:49,694 --> 00:24:53,087
Well, uh, boss, we have narrowed
it down to a few city blocks.

563
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:55,151
Vale must have still been
on foot when he was shot

564
00:24:55,152 --> 00:24:56,903
or he would have gotten sick in the car.

565
00:24:56,904 --> 00:24:59,885
So maybe a parking garage or a
parking lot. That narrows it down.

566
00:24:59,886 --> 00:25:02,885
Go, go. Don't come
back without the bullet.

567
00:25:07,888 --> 00:25:09,414
Where is Mike?

568
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:14,728
I thought you were supposed
to be protecting him.

569
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:16,375
I was. I mean, I...

570
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:19,088
He was right here.

571
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:21,068
Couldn't have gone far, boss.

572
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:22,459
Don't count on it.

573
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:24,831
Franks?

574
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,027
Franks?

575
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:39,093
Couldn't find a broom closet.

576
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,145
How do you know Carver?

577
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:47,686
Just another spook from the old
days that made my job difficult.

578
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:50,964
You never mentioned you made
a backup copy of that file.

579
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:52,362
It was a long time ago, probie.

580
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:53,881
Is it enough?

581
00:25:53,975 --> 00:25:55,481
Should do the trick.

582
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:56,710
What's in it?

583
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,110
Where'd you learn to be
such a pain in the ass?

584
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:01,754
Working with you.

585
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,558
There's a lot of people who want
to see what's in that file, Mike.

586
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,481
Guess they're going to be disappointed.

587
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:09,846
There's nothing to see.

588
00:26:11,218 --> 00:26:13,601
But there's plenty to listen to.

589
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:15,825
Vale was wearing a wire?

590
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:19,272
And I was on the other end
of it listening to every word.

591
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:20,470
Dubbed a copy.

592
00:26:20,471 --> 00:26:23,051
I tell what I heard,
audiotape backs me up

593
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:24,706
and everybody's happy

594
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,333
except for Nikolai.

595
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,536
Where's the tape?

596
00:26:27,537 --> 00:26:28,265
Safe.

597
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:29,803
How safe?

598
00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:33,855
Safe enough that no one's
found it for 15 years.

599
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:36,011
This director,...

600
00:26:37,271 --> 00:26:39,107
....she's okay, I guess, but...

601
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:40,562
.... I get the feeling that ...

602
00:26:40,563 --> 00:26:43,187
....you've been working
under her a little too long.

603
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:45,952
The world's changing, Mike.

604
00:26:47,043 --> 00:26:50,468
All the lines are
getting blurred, probie.

605
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,311
Hard for a man not to step over them.

606
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:58,511
And you can call off
this protection detail.

607
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:01,798
- I can take care of myself just fine.
- No, I can't do that, Mike.

608
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,339
All you have to be is half a
second slower and you're dead.

609
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,304
Or the other guy just has to be a
half-second faster just like it's always been.

610
00:27:10,848 --> 00:27:12,758
I found him, boss!

611
00:27:13,862 --> 00:27:15,916
Nice work, DiNozzo.

612
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:28,059
No Italian restaurants. Must have
eaten somewhere else and driven here.

613
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,758
It couldn't have been this public.

614
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:32,399
You don't shoot someone where
everyone can see you, do you?

615
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,621
I never do.

616
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:36,254
Unless, of course, it can't be helped.

617
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:40,831
Alleys, service lanes, parking lots.

618
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:44,658
You hear that?

619
00:27:45,561 --> 00:27:46,818
What am I listening for?

620
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:48,758
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

621
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:52,112
That's Abby's mystery sound.

622
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,873
That explains all the coins.

623
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,183
Coin counter.

624
00:28:02,184 --> 00:28:04,977
Vale must have been waiting
to use it when he saw Nikolai.

625
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:06,339
In the market?

626
00:28:06,881 --> 00:28:09,505
Even arms dealers need groceries.

627
00:28:09,831 --> 00:28:13,208
Okay, so he made the 911 call,

628
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:16,214
followed Nikolai...

629
00:28:18,423 --> 00:28:20,294
....into the parking lot.

630
00:28:22,603 --> 00:28:24,097
Ground zero.

631
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,578
I got puke.

632
00:28:40,445 --> 00:28:42,700
That's a lot of regurgitation.

633
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:44,175
It doesn't look fresh.

634
00:28:44,176 --> 00:28:46,095
It doesn't smell fresh.

635
00:28:46,164 --> 00:28:47,705
Does it ever?

636
00:28:48,128 --> 00:28:49,325
That could be blood.

637
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:52,074
Or the Colonel's special dipping sauce.

638
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:54,639
Ah!

639
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:57,400
Well, we could toss a coin.

640
00:28:58,627 --> 00:28:59,952
Or not.

641
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,900
All right, give me some gloves.

642
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:05,804
You didn't pack the gloves.

643
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:08,072
I thought you packed the gloves.

644
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:10,649
I didn't pack the gloves.

645
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,921
Give me something.

646
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:26,323
Uh!

647
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:28,395
There's nothing here.

648
00:29:28,986 --> 00:29:29,948
Hey!

649
00:29:29,949 --> 00:29:31,114
Ugh!

650
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:34,337
Uh, you have a tissue or something?

651
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:39,114
We have got to buy some gloves.

652
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,288
This is going to be a long day.

653
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,082
Need-to-know
basis,

654
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,970
and this one you didn't need to know.

655
00:30:20,606 --> 00:30:22,180
How well you know Carver?

656
00:30:22,265 --> 00:30:26,392
- Um, been with Homeland Security since the startup.
- Before that?

657
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:27,959
NSA?

658
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,502
Try CIA.

659
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,862
In '91, he was trying to get a sneak
peek at top-secret Soviet hardware

660
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:37,400
which links him directly
to Puchenko and Kobach.

661
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:40,263
Sounds speculative.

662
00:30:40,264 --> 00:30:41,854
And if I'm right?

663
00:30:42,765 --> 00:30:44,708
If you're right, it probably was Carver

664
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,927
who tipped off Kobach and Puchenko when
we were going to arrest them in '91.

665
00:30:47,928 --> 00:30:51,930
Hey, and look who pops up
to get Nikolai off the hook.

666
00:30:52,168 --> 00:30:55,804
The CIA has a shopping
list, Carver is the buyer.

667
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,444
I want him taken out of the loop.

668
00:30:59,445 --> 00:31:04,294
You don't seriously think that Carver's
leaking information to Kobach on Mike Franks.

669
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,986
He did it in '91.

670
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:07,621
No Mike, no case.

671
00:31:07,622 --> 00:31:10,407
Puchenko walks, probably
right into a deal with Carver.

672
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:11,396
Jen.

673
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:13,023
Listen to me.

674
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:16,790
Take him off the
need-to-know list.

675
00:31:18,054 --> 00:31:20,557
Too late. Carver's already been briefed.

676
00:31:32,397 --> 00:31:34,264
You're supposed to be
inside the house, Mike.

677
00:31:34,265 --> 00:31:35,846
Nice catch.

678
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:37,157
I must be getting sloppy.

679
00:31:37,158 --> 00:31:39,369
Well, I smelled the cigarette smoke.

680
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,261
I can smoke inside if you want.

681
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:43,188
I don't think that's a good idea.

682
00:31:43,189 --> 00:31:44,266
Nope.

683
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:49,736
- Hello.
- DiNozzo, it's Gibbs.

684
00:31:49,737 --> 00:31:51,355
Oh, hey, boss, we were
just talking about you.

685
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:52,826
We got a security problem.

686
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,436
Time to go off script. Where's Franks?

687
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:55,699
He's right...

688
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:00,825
Mike?

689
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:03,109
Mike?

690
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,954
Tony?

691
00:32:06,938 --> 00:32:08,155
DiNozzo?

692
00:32:08,377 --> 00:32:09,526
Tony !!!!

693
00:32:20,444 --> 00:32:22,014
I lose any hair?

694
00:32:22,015 --> 00:32:23,097
No.

695
00:32:23,098 --> 00:32:24,022
- How is he?
- He'll live.

696
00:32:24,023 --> 00:32:26,799
Well, I've been hit
harder, boss, by you.

697
00:32:29,462 --> 00:32:30,811
How many were there?

698
00:32:31,353 --> 00:32:32,402
I didn't see.

699
00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:33,742
Came up real fast from behind.

700
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,543
The rest of our guys deployed from
the house in less than 30 seconds.

701
00:32:36,544 --> 00:32:37,914
But they were already gone.

702
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:39,124
With Mike?

703
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:44,795
There must have been two teams. One to
take me down, and the other to snatch him.

704
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,331
Whoever did it, they were good.

705
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:49,347
Sorry, boss.

706
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:51,087
So...

707
00:32:51,088 --> 00:32:54,344
....why grab him when all
they had to do was kill him?

708
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:56,773
He was holding evidence.

709
00:32:56,955 --> 00:32:57,886
Where?

710
00:32:57,887 --> 00:32:59,190
He wouldn't tell me.

711
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:02,243
Well, I guess you didn't hold a
blowtorch to his eyeballs to find out.

712
00:33:02,244 --> 00:33:03,930
These guys will.

713
00:33:04,104 --> 00:33:05,550
Yeah. Gibbs.

714
00:33:06,677 --> 00:33:08,094
Tell her I'm on my way.

715
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:10,719
Jenny?

716
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,400
"Jenny?"

717
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,073
Just, uh..

718
00:33:18,074 --> 00:33:20,899
.... how cozy did you two get

719
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,610
while I was away?

720
00:33:24,945 --> 00:33:27,037
Well, that knock to the head must
have been harder than I thought,

721
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,206
'cause I'm saying crazy things
that I don't even understand.

722
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:31,805
You think she's single?

723
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,247
He's fine.

724
00:33:39,252 --> 00:33:41,022
People should really
chew their food more.

725
00:33:41,023 --> 00:33:43,114
And drink in moderation.

726
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:46,488
What's that look like?

727
00:33:50,225 --> 00:33:51,758
Not puke.

728
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:00,408
Blood.

729
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,856
This Dumpster could have
just been moved here.

730
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:20,270
You didn't waste any time.

731
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,813
Bad news travels fast.

732
00:34:21,814 --> 00:34:23,435
Especially in this town.

733
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,335
How's your agent?

734
00:34:27,705 --> 00:34:28,601
Do you really give a damn?

735
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:31,323
- Any update on Mike Franks?
- No.

736
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,112
You expect to find him, Agent Gibbs?

737
00:34:34,454 --> 00:34:36,628
He's a resourceful man.

738
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:38,060
No doubt.

739
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:41,082
In the meantime, I'd like Nikolai
Puchenko released into my custody.

740
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,268
I'm not finished with him.

741
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:44,339
But you are, Agent Gibbs.

742
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:48,327
Perhaps your time would be better
spent finding out who in your department

743
00:34:48,328 --> 00:34:51,818
leaked the location of the safe house
where you were keeping your key witness.

744
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:52,631
Did you?

745
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,950
Gibbs.

746
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:55,781
No.

747
00:34:55,947 --> 00:34:57,801
You did in '91.

748
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:05,906
If you would like to have this request
formalized, Director Shepard, that can be arranged.

749
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,176
I'm sure you didn't mean for that
to sound like a threat, Mr. Carver.

750
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:16,405
But in the meantime, Mr. Puchenko
will remain in our custody

751
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:20,293
pending our investigation into
the disappearance of Mike Franks.

752
00:35:20,294 --> 00:35:22,742
I think you need to look closer to home.

753
00:35:22,763 --> 00:35:24,477
Maybe there was no leak.

754
00:35:24,478 --> 00:35:27,006
Maybe Franks just lost
his nerve and ran away.

755
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:28,953
Or Kobach met his asking price.

756
00:35:28,954 --> 00:35:30,977
You don't know Mike Franks.

757
00:35:31,455 --> 00:35:33,197
And you really think you do?

758
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,946
Director.

759
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:44,258
You've got about an hour and then
all hell is going to break loose.

760
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,428
Jethro...

761
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:53,792
I really hope you know Mike
Franks as well as you think you do.

762
00:36:11,744 --> 00:36:13,414
Marty Allen, please.

763
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,459
Hello. Mr. Allen?

764
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:17,923
Mike Franks.

765
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:19,494
NCIS Mike Franks?

766
00:36:19,495 --> 00:36:20,737
One in the same.

767
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:21,783
What can I do for you?

768
00:36:21,784 --> 00:36:25,855
I have something that your
client's associate, Arkady Kobach,

769
00:36:25,856 --> 00:36:27,746
might be interested in buying.

770
00:36:27,747 --> 00:36:29,736
What might that be?

771
00:36:29,943 --> 00:36:32,824
A one-off copy of the audio tape

772
00:36:32,998 --> 00:36:36,912
that will send him and your
client to prison for 30 years.

773
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,541
If he's interested,
what would the price be?

774
00:36:39,771 --> 00:36:41,785
$500,000.

775
00:36:41,786 --> 00:36:43,512
You get the tape,

776
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:48,196
and I get to go back to Mexico and retire with
a sweet little waitress named Camila Charo.

777
00:36:48,197 --> 00:36:50,084
I'll have to contact my client.

778
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:51,630
Can I get back to you?

779
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:53,518
Sure. You got a pen?

780
00:36:55,871 --> 00:36:56,480
Hey,

781
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:58,343
-.. what kept him?
- Business.

782
00:36:58,344 --> 00:37:00,470
God, I hate lawyers.

783
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,304
I demand you release
my client, Agent Gibbs.

784
00:37:11,305 --> 00:37:13,488
You got no grounds to hold him. Your...

785
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:15,984
....key witness has disappeared.

786
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:18,008
You have no case.

787
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:20,706
Oh, you're right. I don't
have a case against your client

788
00:37:20,707 --> 00:37:22,168
for arms dealing.

789
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:26,336
But I do have one for murder.

790
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:34,467
We deserve a medal.

791
00:37:34,468 --> 00:37:35,786
That look...

792
00:37:35,863 --> 00:37:38,275
.... is as close as you're
ever going to get, probie.

793
00:37:40,744 --> 00:37:42,736
Nikolai, you have a choice.

794
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:46,775
You can spend the rest of your life
in prison, or you can cut a deal.

795
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:50,353
And you can tell me...

796
00:37:50,712 --> 00:37:53,271
.... where to find your friend, Arkady.

797
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:02,024
Clear.

798
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:03,218
Clear.

799
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:05,081
Clear.

800
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:06,753
McGee.

801
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:10,351
Smoke's from a Russian cigarette.
Arkady hasn't been gone long.

802
00:38:10,573 --> 00:38:12,195
Come on, double time.

803
00:38:21,794 --> 00:38:23,051
Okay, we're on.

804
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:25,392
Ten calls made in the last day.

805
00:38:25,393 --> 00:38:27,083
Three in the last hour and a half.

806
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:29,179
First was to a cell phone, Marty Allen.

807
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,796
Second call was to Merchant Bank.

808
00:38:31,797 --> 00:38:33,263
The last call ...

809
00:38:33,264 --> 00:38:36,452
....was to a hotel in the
port district El Ejecutivo.

810
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:37,991
Call was made to room seven.

811
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:42,050
Mexican hotel. Names and numbers,
McGee, starting with the hotel.

812
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,745
Are you sure?

813
00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:49,485
That's what the manager said.

814
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:52,643
Room seven is booked in
the name of a Camila Charo,

815
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:56,638
but it was not a woman that paid cash
for the room. It was some old guy.

816
00:39:06,036 --> 00:39:07,489
Franks's brand.

817
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:32,727
Beer's cold.

818
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:35,845
But they're all out of lime.

819
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:40,261
I sent the bar man to buy some.

820
00:39:41,276 --> 00:39:43,211
I told him to take his time.

821
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,828
You've got what I want?

822
00:40:01,535 --> 00:40:03,389
And I've got what you want.

823
00:40:06,272 --> 00:40:08,054
Truth is, Arkady,...

824
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:10,110
....you've got nothing I want.

825
00:40:11,149 --> 00:40:13,861
You think you are the
first to point a gun at me?

826
00:40:14,022 --> 00:40:15,187
No.

827
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:17,480
No, but I will be the last.

828
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:58,926
I knew he was over there.

829
00:40:59,938 --> 00:41:01,920
I figured I could take them both.

830
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:04,333
Arkady first,

831
00:41:04,346 --> 00:41:05,899
then the big guy.

832
00:41:06,803 --> 00:41:09,302
Maybe I am a half second slower.

833
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:11,406
There was no leak, was there?

834
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:15,009
DiNozzo okay?

835
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,143
Boss?

836
00:41:16,317 --> 00:41:17,481
Clear!

837
00:41:22,236 --> 00:41:23,721
Secure the room.

838
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:48,184
You set yourself up as bait.

839
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:50,693
The bigger the bait,

840
00:41:50,694 --> 00:41:52,534
the bigger the fish you catch.

841
00:41:53,932 --> 00:41:57,830
Arkady never would have got to
court, probie, and you know it.

842
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:03,469
Carver or whoever else is pulling the
strings would have made sure of that.

843
00:42:03,795 --> 00:42:05,545
Another crappy deal.

844
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:07,954
More innocent people die.

845
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,917
If you think I'm not
going to sleep well tonight

846
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:14,037
because of what I just
did, then you're wrong.

847
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,652
I'm going to sleep like a baby,

848
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:22,902
because Arkady Kobach was a scary S.O.B.

849
00:42:22,903 --> 00:42:26,938
who kept me awake nights
for the past 15 years.

850
00:42:26,939 --> 00:42:29,274
Someone else will take his place.

851
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,204
That's your problem, probie.

852
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:34,424
I got my guy.

853
00:42:36,403 --> 00:42:37,489
Hey.

854
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:40,823
You got that audio tape?

855
00:42:44,343 --> 00:42:45,985
Beer's getting warm.

856
