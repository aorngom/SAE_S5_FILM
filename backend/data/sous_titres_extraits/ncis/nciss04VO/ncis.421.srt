1
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:19,951
Are you alone?

2
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:43,328
You bring it?

3
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:47,700
You're doing the right thing.

4
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:50,076
I know I'm doing the right thing.
I'm just...

5
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:52,928
I'm still not sure you're the one
I should be doing it with.

6
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:56,024
You're not exactly a man
with many options.

7
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,836
Come on.

8
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:04,920
Get down!

9
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:16,006
You hit?

10
00:01:24,853 --> 00:01:30,720

15
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:21,455
What's wrong with this picture?

16
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:24,205
You mean aside from the Director
being out at 4:00 a. m.

17
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:26,267
and a dead homeless man in her car?

18
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:27,579
No, that about covers it.

19
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,681
Not quite.

20
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,712
His alley-mates don't think he's homeless.
Said he showed up last night.

21
00:02:31,713 --> 00:02:34,954
He looked dirty, but smelled like
he had just taken a bath.

22
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:38,167
- Said he didn't talk to anyone.
- He talked to somebody.

23
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,428
It's a nice phone.

24
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:42,320
The Director's on another Op.

25
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:44,075
If she is, I'm not in on it.

26
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,747
Would you tell us if you were?

27
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,033
Name's Troy Webster.
He had information I needed.

28
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:55,137
The Frog.

29
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:58,703
Getting La Grenouille
on ARES is off-limits,

30
00:02:58,704 --> 00:03:00,783
but with what Webster had,

31
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:02,348
I still could have nailed
Grenouille to the wall.

32
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,311
And the reason I'm finding out
about this right now...

33
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:08,177
or you gonna quote Rule
Number Four to me again?

34
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:10,564
Are you gonna quote Rule
Number One back at me?

35
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,509
What were you doing
out here alone?

36
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,086
- I can take care of myself, Jethro.
- Right.

37
00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:16,815
Who was taking care of him?

38
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:20,084
Well, from this point forward,
that would be me.

39
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:25,737
Well, it's not anything I said.

40
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,565
Any witnesses get an
I.D. on the vehicle?

41
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:29,949
All I got is some kind of truck.

42
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:31,135
Plates were missing.

43
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:35,584
It was a dark Limited Edition,
Ford Excursion. Tinted windows.

44
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:38,313
Off-road tires.
Broken taillight.

45
00:03:38,314 --> 00:03:41,039
And, uh...
now missing a rear window.

46
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,954
You got off a few rounds.

47
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:45,475
I don't take kindly to being shot at.

48
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:47,535
Was he shooting you or him?

49
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:50,557
Director of NCIS is a high-value target.

50
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:52,872
Whereas this guy is..

51
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:58,402
His name is Troy Webster.

52
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:00,192
Troy Webster.

53
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:02,379
Never met a dollar he couldn't launder.

54
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,510
A certified CPA with offices in
the Isle of Man, Dubai and the Caymans.

55
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:08,115
His number one client...

56
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:10,808
The Frog.

57
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:12,569
La Grenouille.

58
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,816
Your favorite international
arms dealer and mine.

59
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:16,712
Wasn't Webster's favorite.

60
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:18,026
At least not anymore.

61
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:19,251
They had a falling out?

62
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:23,000
Webster woke up one day, and realized
he had sold his soul to the devil.

63
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:25,252
Too bad the devil doesn't give refunds.

64
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:26,881
Webster knew the risks.

65
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:28,314
What was the reward?

66
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:31,878
He was bringing me a file
on La Grenouille's entire operation,

67
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,767
down to the last dock invoice,
past and future.

68
00:04:34,768 --> 00:04:36,941
Next arms shipment he made,
we could have nailed him.

69
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:39,963
France would have had no choice
but to extradite him to the U.S.

70
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:41,695
And he'd never know how we got to him.

71
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:43,753
The only thing we found
on Webster was his cell.

72
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:44,757
No file.

73
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,487
The cell's flash drive was empty, but

74
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:48,439
that doesn't mean there
couldn't be a hidden directory.

75
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,560
- McGee, get the drive down to Abby...
- Down to Abby and see if she can pull

76
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,457
- anything off of it.
- DiNozzo, Ziva,

77
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,624
- Follow up every lead...
- Follow up every lead...

78
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,940
you have on the shooter,
and report directly to me.

79
00:05:09,554 --> 00:05:12,143
I sure would like to be a fly
on the wall up there.

80
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:15,391
Never mind.

81
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:32,270
I suppose I should say thank you.

82
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:33,302
For ?

83
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:37,423
For not calling me out
when you had a right to.

84
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:43,165
I apologize. It's your team.
I was out of order.

85
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,369
Whose team?

86
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,123
Your team.

87
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:53,274
Want me to get the shades?

88
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,435
I'm through sitting in the dark
looking at photos.

89
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:58,377
Yeah. I noticed.

90
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,483
You think I'm being reckless.

91
00:06:01,484 --> 00:06:03,000
What do you think?

92
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,634
I think I'm taking the same chances
that you did when you were after Ari.

93
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:08,811
I wasn't the Director of NCIS.

94
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:09,914
But I am.

95
00:06:10,688 --> 00:06:12,230
It gives me prerogatives.

96
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:23,616
Troy Webster initiated contact with me
three months ago.

97
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:25,411
Then he got cold feet.

98
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,874
Until last night.

99
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,074
He called after midnight.

100
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:31,469
Said he had information
on an arms shipment

101
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,302
to an American supplier happening soon.

102
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:35,940
It was an opportunity
I could not pass up.

103
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,201
Which Webster would have known.

104
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:40,874
It wasn't a trap.

105
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,875
You sure?

106
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,503
You're still assuming
Webster was the target.

107
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:50,974
He could have been the bait.

108
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,308
Do you get it now?

109
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:57,795
The real question
is, why didn't you get it sooner?

110
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:03,564
You think my personal feelings about
La Grenouille are clouding my judgment?

111
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,961
You don't know what
my personal feelings are.

112
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:09,962
Right.

113
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:12,429
I have no need to know.

114
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:21,175
How far are you willing to go
to get this guy, Jen?

115
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:28,645
As far as you went to get Ari, Jethro.

116
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:36,742
It was 1917 before Mata Hari
was finally arrested,

117
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:41,524
although the French had no concrete proof
that she was spying for the Germans.

118
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:45,710
Yeah, but who needs proof
when accusation will suffice?

119
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:49,722
Strange to say, it was
the Germans who deliberately

120
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:52,001
leaked that she was working for them,

121
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:56,056
thus reinforcing the spy world's
oldest maxim...

122
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:57,296
Don't be a spy?

123
00:07:57,698 --> 00:07:59,521
Trust no one.

124
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,136
You would have made a lousy
agent provocateur, Jethro.

125
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:05,197
Well, thank you, Duck.
I'll take that as a compliment.

126
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:08,114
I'm just taking my own advice,
trying to confirm

127
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:10,978
Abby's fingerprint I.D. somehow.

128
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,112
You got a reason to think
they won't match?

129
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:15,356
Well, you never know in this game.

130
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,434
Duck, I also don't know
what I'm doing here.

131
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,129
Oh. Oh, yes.
Well, I do have some information

132
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,915
that you may find useful as well
as inexplicable.

133
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:27,908
Take a look at this.

134
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:31,970
One bullet perfectly bisected
the inferior vena cava.

135
00:08:32,281 --> 00:08:36,585
Another, the superior vena cava.
Also a perfect bisection.

136
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:37,916
Two in the chest.

137
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:39,935
And one in the head.

138
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:42,379
Almost dead center.

139
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:46,724
Standard execution-style,
but with astounding accuracy.

140
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:49,204
- Troy Webster was the target.
- Yeah.

141
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:53,992
If the shooter had wanted the Director
dead, he would not have missed.

142
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:59,828
As for Troy Webster,
the shooter may have wasted his bullets.

143
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:03,442
The patient suffered
from an elevated protein level

144
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,123
in his cerebral spinal fluid.

145
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:09,348
I didn't think much of it at the time
until I opened up his cranium.

146
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,071
And I found this.

147
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,244
It's almost certainly malignant.

148
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:17,098
- Brain tumor.
- And inoperable.

149
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:19,652
He would have been dead in six weeks.

150
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:21,989
That might explain
why he had a change of heart.

151
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,281
If he knew about it.

152
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:28,044
I also took the precaution of
acquiring his medical records.

153
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:31,206
Given the size of this tumor,

154
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:34,349
I'd think he would have
known something was amiss.

155
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,350
He would have said
something to his doctor,

156
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:41,472
but there's no mention
of any abnormality, far less cancer.

157
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:43,369
Any chance they could have missed it?

158
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,858
No. I am at a loss to explain it.
Hence the word "inexplicable".

159
00:09:48,865 --> 00:09:51,856
Hello, hello. What is this?

160
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,789
The backup generators is kicking in.

161
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,211
<i>Sorry!</i>

162
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,072
<i>That was me.</i>

163
00:09:58,586 --> 00:10:00,328
I think it's out.

164
00:10:01,422 --> 00:10:03,793
Have you ever seen anything like this?

165
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:05,476
What's going on?

166
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:07,476
You two okay?

167
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:08,900
Well, we're fine.

168
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,801
Bertha...

169
00:10:10,965 --> 00:10:13,419
- She's toast.
- What happened?

170
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,739
Well, we were trying to access
Webster's smartphone.

171
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,709
Turned out there was
some sort of hidden partition.

172
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,194
We must have triggered
some sort of fail-safe.

173
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:22,228
Which uploaded a virus on Abby's system.

174
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:23,568
A virus did this?

175
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:26,486
No. But it tricked our
surge protector into thinking

176
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:29,240
that there was a lightning strike
that killed the power.

177
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:32,076
When the backups kicked in,
it overloaded our distribution node.

178
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:35,888
Were you able to pull anything off
the phone before it self-destructed?

179
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:38,111
No. Surge took care of that.

180
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:40,331
Pretty Mission: Impossible, huh?

181
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:43,181
Can you retrieve any data?

182
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:46,226
There's no data left to retrieve.

183
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:50,369
Anything that Webster would have had
on La Grenouille, it's gone.

184
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:53,053
Aw, somebody need...

185
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:55,853
- This was careless!
- Jen.

186
00:10:55,854 --> 00:11:00,221
How many more lives are going to be ruined
before we bring that monster in?

187
00:11:00,222 --> 00:11:02,337
How many have been ruined so far?

188
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:08,300
It's not over. We still have Troy Webster.

189
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,868
Not sure how much
talking he's going to do.

190
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,355
He doesn't need to.

191
00:11:11,356 --> 00:11:14,291
Webster was going to bring us
La Grenouille for arms dealing.

192
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:17,384
Now he's going to bring him
to us for murder.

193
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:30,302
This ever happened before?

194
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,606
No.

195
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,135
What'd you say to them?

196
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:35,854
I told them to send someone over.

197
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:37,252
You want to see the CIA,

198
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,293
you always do it on their turf
and their terms.

199
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:43,306
Maybe they've finally figured it out
that we're all on the same team.

200
00:11:43,307 --> 00:11:45,002
It doesn't mean
they're going to play ball.

201
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:48,573
After the way we salvaged ARES
for them, they owe us.

202
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:50,813
Yes, Cynthia?

203
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:52,858
<i>You appointment's arrived, Director.</i>

204
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,763
Send them in.

205
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:01,656
Agent Fornell?

206
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:03,588
Jenny. Jethro.

207
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,360
Get lost on your way to work, Tobias?

208
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:08,360
We were expecting someone
from the CIA, not FBI.

209
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,546
As you know, I'm on attachment to
Homeland Security.

210
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:12,090
That doesn't make you CIA.

211
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:13,919
And yet here I am, just the same.

212
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,901
Langley hates the FBI.

213
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,367
Yeah, but not so much as
they hate you right now.

214
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:20,221
You really pissed them off over something.

215
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:22,978
And so you volunteered
to smooth things out.

216
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:25,532
Not exactly "volunteered".

217
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:27,287
I just drew the short straw.

218
00:12:27,977 --> 00:12:29,780
So you guys want to tell me
what this is all about?

219
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:31,403
'Cause they didn't tell me squat.

220
00:12:31,404 --> 00:12:34,127
I need face time with one of
their undercover assets.

221
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,894
- Name?
- Trent Kort. Alias.

222
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:42,152
- They're gonna want to know why.
- On going NCIS investigation.

223
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:43,994
That's it?

224
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:46,205
One of my informants was killed.

225
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:49,174
I believe Kort has information
to help me find the killer.

226
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:52,412
That sounds reasonable.
On the other hand, this is the CIA,

227
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:55,298
so they're probably going to tell me
to tell you to go to hell.

228
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:57,600
Remind them they owe us.

229
00:12:58,274 --> 00:13:02,104
And if you want to know why, ask them.

230
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:11,485
And who said the old days were dead.

231
00:13:12,612 --> 00:13:13,710
Not them.

232
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:20,531
Well, I guess hell hasn't
frozen over after all.

233
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:34,143
Thank God you're here.

234
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,645
I told you to come alone.

235
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:39,888
Look, I'm through keeping
secrets on this one, Abs.

236
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:42,186
- If it's about the case...
- We are all ears.

237
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:44,357
Is that like being a fly on the wall?

238
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:46,553
Okay, but don't say I didn't warn you.

239
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:48,490
Per strict instructions
from Director Shepard,

240
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:51,301
I'm going over all the crime scene
evidence with a fine-tooth comb.

241
00:13:51,302 --> 00:13:54,319
- Anything good?
- Tire marks confirm the make and model

242
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,476
- of the drive-by vehicle.
- Which we already know from the Director.

243
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:59,366
I'm just getting warmed up here.

244
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,157
The striations on the slugs

245
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:04,275
from the Director's car match
the slugs from Troy Webster.

246
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,358
I didn't find any of the Director's slugs.

247
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,738
That's 'cause she didn't miss.

248
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:11,127
I did find something interesting
on the window she shattered.

249
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,426
Blood.

250
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:21,430
Even though blood spatter can
travel for several meters,

251
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:24,761
the SUV was too far away for this
to be Troy Webster's.

252
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:27,368
She hit one of La Grenouille's men.

253
00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:30,553
Through a tinted window.
In a car going 40 miles an hour.

254
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:31,812
Rock on, Jenny.

255
00:14:31,813 --> 00:14:33,635
But was it the shooter or the driver?

256
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:35,865
- Enough to pull DNA?
- I'm running it now.

257
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:37,178
Let us know.

258
00:14:39,138 --> 00:14:42,758
Actually, it's what I found inside
the Director's car

259
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:45,120
that I'm not really sure
what to do with.

260
00:14:45,806 --> 00:14:46,991
What'd you find?

261
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,562
They were in her glove compartment.

262
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:56,182
What was that doing
in her glove compartment?

263
00:14:56,183 --> 00:14:59,683
I don't know. But I'm sure the Director
doesn't want her...

264
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:02,119
personal business on an inventory log

265
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,242
for the entire federal government to read.

266
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:05,250
Not this business.

267
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:07,118
And I can't take it off the log.
That would be a crime.

268
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:08,682
Maybe you should ask
the Director what to do.

269
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:10,571
I am not having that conversation.

270
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:14,080
But you could.

271
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,214
Me?

272
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,858
Yes, you are the senior field agent.

273
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:21,448
And you never hesitate to remind us.

274
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:28,475
As your senior field agent,
I say we draw straws.

275
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,536
Here, hold that... thought for a second.

276
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:36,180
Hey, what are you wearing?

277
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:37,372
Scrubs.

278
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:39,808
Scrubs can be sexy.

279
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:41,988
You've got sex on the brain,
you know that?

280
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:44,562
Well, why fight a billion years
of evolutionary drive?

281
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:47,206
I don't know, you're the one
who made me wait, remember?

282
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,998
Well, the good news is, those
dark days are long behind us.

283
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:52,809
I've got some good news myself.
My mother is in town.

284
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,200
And she wants to meet you.

285
00:15:58,428 --> 00:16:01,756
Apparently you and I have very
different definitions of the word "good".

286
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:04,723
I would think you'd be the kind of guy that's
had a lot of practice meeting parents.

287
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:06,601
Actually, no.

288
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:10,071
Right. Never made it that far.

289
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:13,590
There's a first time for everything.

290
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,709
Hey, hey, you...

291
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:19,060
What was that?

292
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,929
Uh, kind of hard to explain.

293
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:24,608
Maybe explain it to my mother
and me over dinner.

294
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,152
Oh, Jeanne, I'm sorry I'm, I'm...

295
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:29,024
I'm going to have to work late tonight.

296
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:31,041
What kind of a lame excuse is that?

297
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:37,103
Well, it is lame, but it's not an excuse.
I'll see what I can do.

298
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:39,752
I promise I'll make it worth your while.

299
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:42,221
Bribery will get you everywhere.

300
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:44,619
Bye.

301
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,005
Bye.

302
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:53,950
Director.

303
00:16:57,522 --> 00:17:00,222
Schedule a briefing in an hour
and get me Agent DiNozzo.

304
00:17:00,223 --> 00:17:02,318
- Yes, ma'am.
- You got him.

305
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:06,549
I know Gibbs teaches you to anticipate,

306
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:08,847
but I didn't even know
I need you until a second ago.

307
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:11,286
You know, when you're good, you're good.

308
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,398
What's on your mind?

309
00:17:16,097 --> 00:17:17,246
You first.

310
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:24,010
The GPS marker you tagged with Regine
Smidt's luggage with has gone dark.

311
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:25,715
Maybe it's out of batteries.

312
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:29,702
Well, that means she found it.

313
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:32,947
How? Little bugger's supposed
to be undetectable.

314
00:17:32,948 --> 00:17:34,712
I'm more concerned with when.

315
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:36,883
She told La Grenouille.

316
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:40,384
And if she managed to ascertain
the time her luggage was tagged...

317
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:43,573
He might be able to figure out
who tagged it.

318
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:49,566
Just when I thought my day
couldn't get any worse.

319
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:52,473
Fornell.

320
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:54,414
- Forward that file to my office, please.
- Yes.

321
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:55,661
Fornell?

322
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:58,375
He's been assigned
as our liaison with CIA.

323
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:01,209
They chose him because they thought
it'd make you easier to handle?

324
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,350
Actually, he said the agents
drew straws for the duty.

325
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:07,430
Apparently, my reputation precedes me.

326
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:12,898
It's hard to imagine grown adults drawing
straws just to deal with little old me.

327
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:19,110
What was it you wanted to ask me again?

328
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:34,784
Come to Mama.

329
00:18:46,098 --> 00:18:47,293
Beautiful.

330
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:50,757
- Hi.
- Hi.

331
00:18:51,293 --> 00:18:53,566
It's kind of a tradition
when I get new equipment.

332
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,441
So I guess you're here
for the results of the blood I found?

333
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:59,314
- I heard you got a hit on the DNA.
- Yes, and no.

334
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:01,293
Let's start with the yes part, Abs.

335
00:19:01,294 --> 00:19:04,351
I'm down here by myself all day long,
and I finally have some company.

336
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,793
So, don't make me rush this.

337
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:09,427
I isolated the DNA from the blood
on the SUV's glass fragments.

338
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:11,943
The blood spatter indicated
that it came from the driver.

339
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:15,663
So I ran the DNA through every database
I could think of, and I got nothing.

340
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:18,981
- So, ask me why I'm smiling.
- You're always smiling, Abby.

341
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:20,731
Well, that's 'cause I'm
a happy person, Gibbs.

342
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:23,979
And I was especially happy when
I found out that our driver was a mutant.

343
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,491
I mean, we all have mutations
in our DNA technically...

344
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:27,950
Abby.

345
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,541
The owner had a genetic defect at position
370 on his glucosidase beta acid gene.

346
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:36,252
It's called Gaucher's Disease.

347
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,664
- Rare?
- It's rare enough.

348
00:19:38,665 --> 00:19:41,796
It's treated with an enzyme-replacement
drug called Ceredase.

349
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:45,330
There's only three pharmacies within
a hundred-mile radius that carry it,

350
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:47,356
and there's only one patient taking it.

351
00:19:47,357 --> 00:19:48,595
You got an address?

352
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,279
Do you even have to ask?

353
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,398
Thank you.

354
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,058
- Nice place.
- Apartment 212.

355
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:08,457
- Warrant.
- Right here.

356
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:10,026
Federal agents!

357
00:20:10,027 --> 00:20:11,667
Boss, Agent Lee wanted
me to remind you

358
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,934
we need to wait at least 15 seconds...

359
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,162
Clear!

360
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:23,297
Well, this guy was either practicing
for his plastic surgery finals...

361
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:25,363
Or he was injured in a drive-by.

362
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:27,715
Not injured.

363
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:35,888
Dead.

364
00:20:48,361 --> 00:20:49,524
Come in.

365
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:52,736
Ducky.

366
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:55,743
I was just reading your autopsy report.

367
00:20:57,606 --> 00:21:02,438
Lucky we don't have to worry about
finding this one's killer since it was me.

368
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:06,789
Your bullet tore through his
brachial and carotid arteries

369
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,585
and lodged against his clavicle.

370
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:13,238
Someone tried to stitch up his wounds,
but without proper medical knowledge.

371
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:16,510
I had La Grenouille by the throat.

372
00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:19,172
Then he had my informant killed.

373
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:21,836
Fine. I'll make a murder case.

374
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:24,411
And then I kill the star witness

375
00:21:24,412 --> 00:21:27,099
who could tie the murder
back to La Grenouille.

376
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,363
Perfect.

377
00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:31,948
There's always the shooter.

378
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,419
If we can find him.

379
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:38,400
Though I doubt he would be able
to give you what you want.

380
00:21:49,553 --> 00:21:52,077
Is there something
I can do for you, Dr. Mallard?

381
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:55,155
Yeah, I came to discuss
my preliminary findings.

382
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,241
Isn't that what I just read?

383
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:03,928
No, no, no. Not that.
My psychological profile of La Grenouille.

384
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:07,459
It's not complete,
but under the circumstances,

385
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,201
I thought it prudent
to avail you of what I've gathered so far.

386
00:22:12,675 --> 00:22:14,299
Avail me.

387
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:17,254
Well, La Grenouille is not
your ordinary arms dealer.

388
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:22,155
He's educated, refined,
has a keen appreciation of opera.

389
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:24,922
And let's not forget cognac.

390
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:28,299
Oh, I haven't.
I will forever remember his gift to me.

391
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:31,033
Do you know that it was
a unique and rare bottle

392
00:22:31,034 --> 00:22:33,119
- of Napoleon br...
- Ducky, your point?

393
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:38,360
He's not the type to settle
disputes with violence.

394
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:39,800
He's an arms dealer.

395
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:41,861
Who fancies himself a businessman.

396
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:44,617
Now, he may be a merchant of death,

397
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:49,120
but he's... he's no more likely
to solve a problem with violence

398
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:52,555
than your typical tobacco company CEO.

399
00:22:52,556 --> 00:22:55,814
And we both know how many
people those products kill.

400
00:22:55,815 --> 00:23:00,842
So La Grenouille was going to let Troy
Webster turn state's evidence against him?

401
00:23:00,843 --> 00:23:03,489
I'm not suggesting he wouldn't have dealt
with those problems, but

402
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,973
a man whose favorite opera

403
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:09,598
is La Forza del Destino is sophisticated.

404
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:13,493
And he's far more likely to use
that sophistication as his weapon.

405
00:23:13,494 --> 00:23:17,541
Violent murder just...
is not his style.

406
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,253
You liked him, didn't you?

407
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,468
Excuse me?

408
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:24,256
La Grenouille.

409
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:28,487
You found him charming?

410
00:23:28,488 --> 00:23:31,364
Well, I don't see how that's relevant.

411
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,562
Well, I admit, for a mass murderer,

412
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:38,760
he may have a certain... gracious charm.

413
00:23:38,888 --> 00:23:41,113
Perhaps it's clouding your judgment.

414
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:45,263
Perhaps it's not my judgment
that's being clouded.

415
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,440
You don't know him like I do.

416
00:23:50,953 --> 00:23:54,458
And exactly how is that, Director?

417
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:56,774
Good night, Doctor.

418
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,764
The dead driver appears to be a dead end.

419
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:12,365
Which makes the shooter
our last link La Grenouille.

420
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:14,389
Better hope he's not dead, too.

421
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,890
I'll start running down
his known associates.

422
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:33,704
Jethro.

423
00:24:34,225 --> 00:24:35,429
Hey, Duck.

424
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:41,336
You and the Director have a nice chat?

425
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:44,260
Well, I wouldn't call it "nice".

426
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:47,579
Illuminating, perhaps.

427
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,767
- For who?
- Well, not for her.

428
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:51,737
As you expected, she didn't...

429
00:24:51,738 --> 00:24:54,466
appreciate my thoughts on La Grenouille.

430
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:57,822
She still thinks of him
as a prime suspect.

431
00:24:57,823 --> 00:24:59,354
- So do I.
- Yes, but

432
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:02,126
you listen to my perspective,
and I have no doubt

433
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,268
that your mind would change
if the facts were to change.

434
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:06,765
And the Director's won't?

435
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,898
It does not seem likely.

436
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:11,811
- But why?
- Well, you don't need a degree

437
00:25:11,812 --> 00:25:15,278
in psychology to see that
there's a history between those two.

438
00:25:15,477 --> 00:25:18,028
Something that is consuming her.

439
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:20,967
Her every... action, every thought.

440
00:25:21,332 --> 00:25:22,353
How far?

441
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:23,773
Will she go?

442
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,997
Well, as far as any obsessed person.

443
00:25:28,022 --> 00:25:29,369
As far as it takes.

444
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:33,071
<i> Jeanne,</i>

445
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:35,617
what is taking you so long?
Your mother could be here any second.

446
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:38,006
Relax, Tony. I'm 20 feet away.

447
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:41,207
Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do
if she comes in here while you're gone?

448
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,835
Uh, say hello and introduce yourself.

449
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:45,536
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

450
00:25:45,537 --> 00:25:48,259
What woman can resist
your usual charming self?

451
00:25:48,524 --> 00:25:49,524
Thanks.

452
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:53,861
Hello. Hi.

453
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,430
Show time.

454
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:01,164
Hello, Dr. Berkley.

455
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:02,969
- I'm, I'm Tony.
- I know who you are.

456
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,033
My daughter told me you'd be the
one in the overpriced shoes.

457
00:26:06,635 --> 00:26:08,788
Zegna Oxfords?

458
00:26:09,754 --> 00:26:10,958
Good eyes.

459
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:14,495
- What else did she tell you about me?
- Everything.

460
00:26:15,462 --> 00:26:17,412
I'm not quite sure
what worries me the most.

461
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,114
Hi, baby.
Hi, Mom.

462
00:26:22,338 --> 00:26:23,724
I see you two have met.

463
00:26:26,838 --> 00:26:27,838
Thank you.

464
00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:33,463
Thank you.

465
00:26:45,034 --> 00:26:46,374
You got to be kidding.

466
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:50,103
Old habit.

467
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,023
So, you're the overzealous Fed

468
00:27:09,024 --> 00:27:12,747
who nearly mucked up 18 months
of undercover work.

469
00:27:12,748 --> 00:27:15,104
I prefer to think of it as doing my job.

470
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:16,342
Gibbs.

471
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:18,388
I'm not my Director's keeper.

472
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:20,401
I don't have a lot of time.

473
00:27:20,402 --> 00:27:25,222
Grenouille thinks I'm in DC getting
dirt on a troublesome customs inspector.

474
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:26,653
Well?

475
00:27:26,654 --> 00:27:29,325
Your boss killed
my informant two days ago.

476
00:27:32,462 --> 00:27:34,008
Informant got a name?

477
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:35,528
Troy Webster.

478
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,362
I need your help to take
La Grenouille down for it.

479
00:27:39,105 --> 00:27:40,836
You sure it was my boss?

480
00:27:40,837 --> 00:27:43,062
You have any information
to the contrary?

481
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:45,975
No, but I've been working
with Grenouille a long time.

482
00:27:45,976 --> 00:27:48,054
I've never known him to order a hit.

483
00:27:48,055 --> 00:27:49,768
And if he did, you'd know?

484
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,135
Not necessarily.

485
00:27:51,591 --> 00:27:55,293
Grenouille keeps information
as compartmentalized as possible,

486
00:27:55,294 --> 00:27:57,404
- where everything is...
- Need to know.

487
00:27:57,518 --> 00:28:01,683
Yeah. And accounting is not my department.

488
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,686
Still, I doubt Grenouille had
anything to do with the murder.

489
00:28:05,923 --> 00:28:07,583
It's just not his style.

490
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:10,063
This isn't a fashion contest.

491
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:12,306
I'm not asking for your opinion.

492
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:15,746
I'm asking who La Grenouille
would have gotten for the hit.

493
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:21,846
Andre Jones.

494
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,379
He's Grenouille's American small
arms distributor.

495
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,183
The kind of guy that's not afraid
to get his hands dirty.

496
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:33,422
If Grenouille were to contract
a kill in the States,

497
00:28:33,423 --> 00:28:36,363
Jones would be the only man he'd trust.

498
00:28:39,956 --> 00:28:43,328
So, I told the rep from the HMO that
if he didn't authorize the transplant,

499
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:46,173
that I'd give his number to the
family, and he could take it up with them.

500
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:48,487
My mother is used
to getting what she wants.

501
00:28:48,488 --> 00:28:50,055
I don't doubt that for a second.

502
00:28:50,056 --> 00:28:54,069
I didn't become a doctor to do paperwork.
I became a doctor to be a doctor.

503
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:56,719
As it is, the delay caused
a rupture in the bile duct.

504
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,820
Which increases post-op susceptibility
to intestinal parasites.

505
00:29:00,093 --> 00:29:01,607
Very good, honey.

506
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:04,548
Speaking of intestinal
parasites, how's your father?

507
00:29:04,597 --> 00:29:06,045
Mom, be good.

508
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:08,124
I think I earned that segue.

509
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,240
I saw him last month... he's fine.

510
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:13,115
Good for him. So...

511
00:29:15,097 --> 00:29:17,641
how long have you been
sleeping with my daughter?

512
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,994
Mother.

513
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:25,137
We're all adults here.
Two of us are even doctors.

514
00:29:30,163 --> 00:29:33,593
Well, we've been sleeping together
for a few months,

515
00:29:33,594 --> 00:29:37,622
and before you ask,
yes, we are using protection.

516
00:29:37,623 --> 00:29:39,786
How'd you know I was gonna ask that?

517
00:29:39,787 --> 00:29:40,787
Because...

518
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:43,876
you said that Jeanne told
you everything about me.

519
00:29:44,976 --> 00:29:45,976
And so...

520
00:29:46,664 --> 00:29:48,333
you know that I'm...

521
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:51,214
A player?

522
00:29:52,545 --> 00:29:55,463
Actually, I was gonna say
"new at commitment".

523
00:29:55,888 --> 00:29:59,043
But as her mother,
naturally you're concerned

524
00:29:59,044 --> 00:30:00,994
that your daughter's
being taken advantage of.

525
00:30:00,995 --> 00:30:03,511
Oh, I know you're not
taking advantage of her.

526
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:04,987
And how do you know that?

527
00:30:05,462 --> 00:30:06,934
The way you look at her.

528
00:30:07,413 --> 00:30:11,221
Love doesn't show up on an X ray,
but I do recognize it when I see it.

529
00:30:11,913 --> 00:30:13,524
And still you worry about me.

530
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:16,536
A leopard doesn't change
its spots overnight

531
00:30:17,238 --> 00:30:20,040
And I can see the doubt in your eyes.
Even you're wondering

532
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:23,288
- how long this is gonna last.
- Ok, I think it's time for another segue.

533
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,789
I made the same mistake
with Jeanne's father.

534
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:29,244
Mom... Tony is not Dad.

535
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:33,321
And I don't want to see her
hurt the way that I was.

536
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:37,355
'Kay?

537
00:30:39,394 --> 00:30:41,854
Could've used one of these last night.

538
00:30:41,855 --> 00:30:44,521
- Dinner went well?
- Barely got out of there alive.

539
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:48,705
Hopefully, we all do. This Jones guy's got
a pretty serious record.

540
00:30:48,978 --> 00:30:51,542
Besides being Grenouille's
American distributor,

541
00:30:51,543 --> 00:30:54,355
we've got suspected murder,
aggravated assault...

542
00:30:54,356 --> 00:30:58,340
Don't forget assault with a deadly weapon,
arson and kidnapping.

543
00:30:58,668 --> 00:31:00,668
He's not going down without a fight.

544
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:02,551
He did not look so tough to me.

545
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:05,370
- Suspect is on-site, alone.
- Armed?

546
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,027
There was. I took care of it.

547
00:31:07,028 --> 00:31:09,308
<i>You two take the back.
McGee, you're with me.</i>

548
00:31:11,387 --> 00:31:15,226
Just make sure Jones can still
talk after he's taken care of.

549
00:31:15,227 --> 00:31:17,348
To get extradition, we need an actual

550
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:20,317
confession that La Grenouille
ordered the hit.

551
00:31:20,318 --> 00:31:21,481
Copy that.

552
00:31:33,732 --> 00:31:34,856
Not so tough.

553
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:37,357
The bigger they are,
the louder they fall, McGee.

554
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:39,116
The harder, Ziva.

555
00:31:44,046 --> 00:31:45,294
Get ready to move.

556
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,139
Move. Now.

557
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:51,110
- Freeze.
- Federal agents.

558
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,711
<i>La Grenouille told you
where to find me?</i>

559
00:31:58,258 --> 00:31:59,419
<i>I said freeze.</i>

560
00:32:00,107 --> 00:32:03,384
You try to do a guy a favor,
and this is how he repays you.

561
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:04,696
Get down on the ground.

562
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:06,395
Stop!

563
00:32:06,396 --> 00:32:07,940
Hold your fire.

564
00:32:10,422 --> 00:32:11,422
Hold it!

565
00:32:23,826 --> 00:32:24,829
<i>Don't do it!</i>

566
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,616
I need him alive.

567
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:34,455
Tango Eight... sitrep!

568
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:39,491
I repeat, I need your sitrep,
Tango Eight.

569
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:49,415
We're fine, Director.

570
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,574
Uh, suspect isn't.

571
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,536
Staring's not gonna
change anything.

572
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:10,933
Trust me.

573
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:17,674
As far as I'm concerned,
Andre Jones got exactly what he deserved.

574
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:19,335
This isn't about Jones.

575
00:33:21,622 --> 00:33:22,622
You're fishing.

576
00:33:22,994 --> 00:33:24,549
It's not like you, Jethro.

577
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:29,781
You and me are gonna
have a little talk.

578
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:33,225
Doesn't make sense.

579
00:33:33,226 --> 00:33:36,122
Why does Jones think
that La Grenouille sold him out?

580
00:33:36,123 --> 00:33:37,985
Jones was the last link to The Frog.

581
00:33:37,986 --> 00:33:42,142
With him out of the way, we'd never make a
murder charge against La Grenouille stick.

582
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:44,294
He tricked us into doing his dirty work.

583
00:33:44,295 --> 00:33:46,764
Ducky says he uses his
sophistication as a weapon.

584
00:33:46,765 --> 00:33:50,740
Even I was unaware of just
how sharp that weapon is.

585
00:33:50,748 --> 00:33:53,683
I just got off the phone with
Troy Webster's physician.

586
00:33:53,684 --> 00:33:55,629
Did you let him know
he missed Webster's cancer?

587
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,455
I did. And I got two
distinct impressions.

588
00:33:58,456 --> 00:34:02,208
One, he was scared. And two,
he was well aware of that tumor.

589
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:04,124
I mean, how could
he have missed it?

590
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:08,336
Yeah, the good doctor was bribed
to keep it a secret. Or threatened.

591
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:11,239
La Grenouille worried his employee
health premiums were going to go up?

592
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,543
Being diagnosed with a terminal
illness, Tony, tends to make one

593
00:34:15,544 --> 00:34:17,601
eager to atone for one's sins.

594
00:34:18,062 --> 00:34:20,663
And Grenouille didn't want
Webster atoning for his.

595
00:34:20,664 --> 00:34:23,287
Webster still tried, so he must
have known he was dying.

596
00:34:23,288 --> 00:34:24,997
With that tumor I found?

597
00:34:24,998 --> 00:34:28,404
No, the neurological deficits
would have been pronounced.

598
00:34:28,405 --> 00:34:31,687
He must have suspected
the end was near...

599
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:35,305
regardless of what any doctor told him.

600
00:34:42,628 --> 00:34:46,172
Normally, when someone says that
they need to have a little talk,

601
00:34:46,173 --> 00:34:47,850
they actually talk.

602
00:34:48,215 --> 00:34:49,509
Director...

603
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,844
of NCIS.

604
00:34:52,901 --> 00:34:53,939
Yes.

605
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:56,252
That's a job I wouldn't want.

606
00:34:56,253 --> 00:34:58,187
Don't worry, no one's offering.

607
00:34:58,188 --> 00:34:59,188
You know why?

608
00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:03,744
You mean besides your impatience,
total lack of respect for authority

609
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:06,510
and the fact that you still haven't
learned to play nice with others?

610
00:35:06,511 --> 00:35:08,673
Yeah. Yeah, besides all that?

611
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,920
I already told you,

612
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:21,708
I am not allowing my personal
feelings to interfere with my job.

613
00:35:22,428 --> 00:35:23,441
Tell me again.

614
00:35:23,442 --> 00:35:26,817
Is there something wrong with wanting
to put an arms dealer out of business?

615
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,011
No.

616
00:35:28,318 --> 00:35:30,065
Is that what you're really after?

617
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:31,754
What else would I be after?

618
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,065
I don't know, but
at the rate you're going,

619
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:37,560
the name "Director" is not gonna
be on that door much longer.

620
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:50,022
It's good to know you're
watching my back, Jethro.

621
00:35:55,756 --> 00:35:56,840
Yeah. Gibbs.

622
00:36:00,815 --> 00:36:02,220
Be right down.

623
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:07,478
Well, you just may get a chance to put
that arms dealer out of business yet.

624
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:11,744
You can run, La Grenouille...

625
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:14,298
...but you can't hide.

626
00:36:17,271 --> 00:36:18,601
Or maybe you can.

627
00:36:18,602 --> 00:36:21,187
- What do you got, Abs?
- Oh, your usual incriminating evidence,

628
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:23,759
all circumstantial, but
beggars can't be choosers.

629
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,532
I'll take what I can get at this point.

630
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:27,945
McGee asked me to parse
Andre Jones's old

631
00:36:27,946 --> 00:36:31,257
phone and bank records, and
when I did, I saw a pattern.

632
00:36:31,258 --> 00:36:33,646
An encrypted satellite
phone call comes in,

633
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,381
and then a large payment to an
offshore account goes out.

634
00:36:37,382 --> 00:36:38,794
Jones is paying for a shipment.

635
00:36:38,795 --> 00:36:43,828
And then, like Swiss clockwork, 48 hours
later, his GPS signal goes off the grid.

636
00:36:44,156 --> 00:36:46,570
- Picking up the shipment.
- He doesn't want to be followed.

637
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,694
I haven't been able to trace
the satellite call yet,

638
00:36:48,695 --> 00:36:52,634
but I did recognize
the encryption algorithm.

639
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,856
- The Frog.
- It's the same as the one

640
00:36:57,857 --> 00:37:00,209
La Grenouille's people used
to call Charles Harrow.

641
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,718
- That's a good job, Abby.
- I have a grand finale.

642
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:06,584
Jones made his last phone
call exactly one day ago.

643
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:09,879
Which means a shipment
is coming in less than 24 hours.

644
00:37:10,556 --> 00:37:14,805
Ten bucks says that that is what
Troy Webster was planning on

645
00:37:14,806 --> 00:37:17,036
telling us this entire time.

646
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,073
An arms shipment.

647
00:37:22,671 --> 00:37:24,641
What happened to your murder case?

648
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:27,650
Our key witness didn't
survive his deposition.

649
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:30,760
Wouldn't have done you
any good if he did.

650
00:37:31,143 --> 00:37:34,170
After our conversation, I made some

651
00:37:34,626 --> 00:37:37,234
interdepartmental inquiries.

652
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:40,906
Grenouille was not
happy to hear about Webster's murder.

653
00:37:40,907 --> 00:37:42,886
You're saying he didn't authorize it?

654
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:48,585
I'm saying, Grenouille specifically spread
the word to not touch Webster.

655
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:50,747
She's pretty fired up.

656
00:37:53,764 --> 00:37:55,208
You know what her beef is?

657
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:57,012
No.

658
00:37:57,387 --> 00:37:58,998
Would you tell me if you did?

659
00:38:01,576 --> 00:38:04,027
Jones disobeyed La Grenouille.

660
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:07,215
Didn't care about the orders
to leave Webster alone.

661
00:38:08,076 --> 00:38:11,271
He knew Webster could hurt him
as bad as he could hurt La Grenouille.

662
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:15,430
That's why Jones thought
La Grenouille had sold him out.

663
00:38:15,701 --> 00:38:17,589
As punishment for killing Webster.

664
00:38:17,892 --> 00:38:21,220
Grenouille must have had
his own plans for Webster.

665
00:38:21,327 --> 00:38:23,363
Sap's probably better off dead.

666
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:27,042
One thing Grenouille is good at,
it's ruining people's lives.

667
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,992
Okay, tell me this.

668
00:38:31,454 --> 00:38:33,342
Is she hot after all arms dealers,

669
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:35,766
or is there something about
this one in particular?

670
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:38,279
You're CIA for now, Tobias. You tell me.

671
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,778
Something about this one.

672
00:38:42,143 --> 00:38:44,198
And you don't know what it is either.

673
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:46,049
As for your arms shipment,

674
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:50,937
as far as I know,
Grenouille has no upcoming deliveries.

675
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:52,886
As far as you know.

676
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:55,610
Like I said, not my department.

677
00:38:58,268 --> 00:38:59,268
However,

678
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,196
every arms shipment requires
an end-use certificate.

679
00:39:03,644 --> 00:39:05,366
It's a guarantee from the buyer

680
00:39:05,598 --> 00:39:07,969
that the arms won't be resold illegally.

681
00:39:08,534 --> 00:39:11,391
That's why we've had
so much trouble getting to La Grenouille.

682
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:13,392
His buyers always manage to get one.

683
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:18,419
All it takes is a third-world
general on the payroll

684
00:39:18,892 --> 00:39:20,669
or an exceptionally good forger.

685
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:25,282
Which one did Andre Jones have?

686
00:39:26,705 --> 00:39:28,517
Guy looks like an English teacher.

687
00:39:28,518 --> 00:39:30,126
Actually, an art teacher.

688
00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:32,095
<i>You know why you're here.</i>

689
00:39:32,894 --> 00:39:33,894
No.

690
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,373
It wasn't a question.

691
00:39:38,206 --> 00:39:40,650
Do you know how long
you're going to prison?

692
00:39:43,082 --> 00:39:44,193
That was a question.

693
00:39:44,418 --> 00:39:46,752
Get the feeling these guys
have done this before?

694
00:39:46,753 --> 00:39:47,755
<i>Agent Gibbs</i>

695
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:53,626
What's the going rate for forging an EUC
certificate for arms smuggling?

696
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:54,648
20 years.

697
00:39:55,611 --> 00:39:56,633
I'm an art teacher.

698
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
Good.

699
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,480
Then you can draw us a picture...

700
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,020
Walked right into that one.

701
00:40:05,587 --> 00:40:10,066
...of the EUC document you
forged for Andre Jones's guns.

702
00:40:11,149 --> 00:40:12,260
And please make sure

703
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:15,900
that I can read the time
and location of shipment.

704
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:17,895
It's going down either way.

705
00:40:17,896 --> 00:40:20,897
If you help us, I can put in
a good word with the judge.

706
00:40:20,898 --> 00:40:22,286
And if you don't, then...

707
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:25,550
<i>I hear Gitmo is lovely this time of year.</i>

708
00:40:26,044 --> 00:40:27,484
Definitely done this before.

709
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:29,308
Though you will be wearing a hood.

710
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:32,021
And that's certainly
going to kill your view.

711
00:40:35,837 --> 00:40:38,163
What kind of good word
could you put in with the judge?

712
00:40:38,164 --> 00:40:41,318
Well, it depends
how good your drawing is.

713
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:49,264
Yeah, okay.
I forged the EUC for Jones, but

714
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:50,962
I don't have a location or a date.

715
00:40:50,963 --> 00:40:53,337
- No, not good enough.
- No, he makes me leave it blank.

716
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:54,522
I swear.

717
00:40:54,523 --> 00:40:56,596
It's added by his shell company.

718
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:58,547
Name?

719
00:40:58,548 --> 00:40:59,774
Abbot Imports.

720
00:40:59,775 --> 00:41:01,839
- Yeah, you got an address?
- Still working on it.

721
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,844
- What's the problem?
- Problem is, it doesn't exist.

722
00:41:03,845 --> 00:41:05,285
There's no federal tax I.D.

723
00:41:05,286 --> 00:41:07,918
- Mail goes to a P.O. box.
- The number's a payphone.

724
00:41:07,936 --> 00:41:09,511
Who owns the box?

725
00:41:10,441 --> 00:41:12,901
Bills are paid by Andre Jones.

726
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:14,761
I'm really starting to
wish we didn't kill him.

727
00:41:14,762 --> 00:41:16,152
McGee, did you try Customs?

728
00:41:16,153 --> 00:41:18,186
- Trying now.
- There has to be some record

729
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:20,292
of his imports, even
if it is through a shell company.

730
00:41:20,293 --> 00:41:21,627
Oh, there is.

731
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:24,362
Next shipment is scheduled
to arrive today.

732
00:41:24,363 --> 00:41:26,876
- Norfolk Port Authority.
- Got the container number.

733
00:41:30,842 --> 00:41:32,839
Ever seen anyone walk
that quickly in heels?

734
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,653
Only at the end of a really hairy date.

735
00:41:34,654 --> 00:41:36,646
Import company missed the pickup.

736
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:39,265
No one claims the container
within the next 12 hours,

737
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,828
orders are "return it to sender".

738
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:42,846
Lucks yours guys called when you did.

739
00:41:43,026 --> 00:41:45,211
Luck had very little to do with it.

740
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:48,791
I really hope the Director
relaxes a bit after this.

741
00:41:49,528 --> 00:41:51,848
- Don't get your hopes up, McGee.
- Why?

742
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:53,562
Once we get the weapons
and trace them back

743
00:41:53,563 --> 00:41:55,076
to La Grenouille, he'll go underground.

744
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:57,102
Interpol will issue a red notice.

745
00:41:57,103 --> 00:41:59,341
But it'll still be up to us to find him.

746
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:00,897
So, in other words...

747
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:03,545
- There.
- Cancel your dinner plans, Probie.

748
00:42:03,546 --> 00:42:05,501
- Open it.
- Yes, ma'am.

749
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:19,596
I got you.

750
00:42:42,886 --> 00:42:44,254
Squirt guns.

751
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:55,162
"Dear Webster, best wishes
on your new career.

752
00:42:56,015 --> 00:42:57,456
La Grenouille".

753
00:43:00,988 --> 00:43:02,575
We have nothing.

754
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:04,219
We never did.

755
00:43:12,032 --> 00:43:13,032
He's good.

756
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,113
He's really good.

757
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,334
He'd better be.
