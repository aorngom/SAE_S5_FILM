1
00:00:02,951 --> 00:00:06,380
In pain, we may find comfort,
in sorrow, hope,

2
00:00:06,452 --> 00:00:08,945
in death, resurrection.

3
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,641
Fire!

4
00:00:16,953 --> 00:00:18,674
Aim... fire!

5
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:22,166
Aim... fire!

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,452
They're almost finished out
there, Ken.

7
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:26,453
What do you want me
to tell you, Jack?

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,028
I can't get the damn thing open.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,202
- Stripped?
- Nah, it's catching.

10
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:31,629
It's just stuck or something.

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,581
When was the last time
you opened one of these things?

12
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:35,490
First one we've had
since I've been with the VA.

13
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,304
That's, like, what,
a decade?

14
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:39,064
Yeah. Let me try.

15
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:45,651
Okay, it's moving.

16
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:47,903
What's that smell?

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
You okay?

23

Give me a dollar!

24
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,832
Okay. What's wrong
with that one?

25
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,396
The machine wouldn't take it
and I want a candy bar.

26
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:04,832
What's wrong
with that candy bar?

27
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,944
It has nougat in it.

28
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:07,256
But you hate nougat.

29
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,585
I know!

30
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:10,102
It was a mistake, McGee!

31
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,743
Do you have a dollar?!

32
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,919
All I have are big bills.

33
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,034
What is nougat?

34
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:17,574
It's whipped dolphin fat.

35
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,269
No, that's the filling
in Klowny Kake.

36
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,470
That is a myth!

37
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:24,001
Would someone please give me
a dollar?!

38
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:30,747
Sure, I got one.

39
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:35,559
Thanks.

40
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:38,499
God, it's like some kind
of crime to not like nougat.

41
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,870
I don't even know
what nougat is.

42
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:42,371
It's a cream made from sugar,
honey and nuts.

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
Grab your gear.

44
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:47,187
Got an explosion at a Marine's
funeral in James River National.

45
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:50,443
Did anyone else see what
just happened there with Abby?

46
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,445
Yeah, she stole my dollar.

47
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,538
Last ones to the party.

48
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:58,936
It's not really a party
until the bomb squad says it is.

49
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:03,574
What'd you find?

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,637
We got nothing.

51
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:05,638
No ordnance,

52
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,658
no residue, no electronics,

53
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:08,751
no time device,

54
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:10,804
no wiring, no remote.

55
00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:12,484
No evidence of a bomb.

56
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:14,026
Except for the explosion.

57
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:16,673
We got two employees injured,
both vets.

58
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:18,074
They were taken to the VA

59
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:19,663
with concussions and shrapnel wounds.

60
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:20,664
Got names?

61
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,640
Former Lance Corporal Lloyd Jackson,

62
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,972
36, and PFC Kenneth Dixon, 25.

63
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:27,203
Veterans keep getting younger.

64
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:29,315
The kid they were burying
was only 22.

65
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:30,439
It's a family crypt.

66
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,263
- Tandem?
- His grandfather was in the back slot.

67
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:35,076
Still there as far as we could tell.

68
00:03:35,077 --> 00:03:36,077
Your men cleared?

69
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,909
Fire readings are clean.

70
00:03:37,955 --> 00:03:39,951
Air's safe to breathe,
not that I would recommend it.

71
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:40,952
Anything else?

72
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:43,542
Yeah. You might want
to cover your shoes.

73
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:55,911
That is truly appalling.

74
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:59,488
"Chief Warrant Officer
Mitchell Waller."

75
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,018
Died, 1978. Should be the one
in the back of the crypt.

76
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,630
He appears to be undisturbed.

77
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:07,318
He would be the only one.

78
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,235
This is really the most
disgusting thing I've ever seen.

79
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:12,747
And believe me, that says a lot.

80
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:14,186
It's like porridge.

81
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,741
The word is "effluvium",

82
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,200
the result of decomposing
human organs and tissue.

83
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:21,280
This is people?

84
00:04:21,356 --> 00:04:22,832
Yes, two, I'd say,

85
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,110
judging bye the volume.

86
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,830
And the two skulls, of course.

87
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:29,613
Mr. Palmer,
we have to recover all of this.

88
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,610
One Wet Vac for the Soylent
Green coming right up.

89
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:35,306
Somewhat claustrophobic.

90
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,176
And for all eternity.

91
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:39,769
Our friends here
might agree with you.

92
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,645
They obviously needed
to get out.

93
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:43,397
They didn't belong
there in the first place.

94
00:04:43,398 --> 00:04:45,270
Vents are definitely clogged.

95
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:47,022
Careful, Doctor, we still haven't

96
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:48,833
found traces of what
caused the explosion.

97
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:53,058
If my suspicions are correct,
Officer David,

98
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,844
the bomb is all around us.

99
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:58,210
It's a phenomenon
in the death industry

100
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:03,481
informally referred to as
"exploding casket syndrome."

101
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:05,771
Well, the floor's all yours,
Duck.

102
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,072
Thank you, Jethro.

103
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,139
All bodies contain enzymes
and bacteria.

104
00:05:11,148 --> 00:05:14,899
Immediately upon death,
they start to break down tissue.

105
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,524
Yes, a body can liquefy
within a week,

106
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,584
especially if it hasn't been
embalmed.

107
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,551
It's possible that these remains

108
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:24,894
were human in appearance

109
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:26,772
as recently as two weeks ago.

110
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:28,436
And someone dumped
them in here.

111
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:30,712
Yes, and in such
a confined space,

112
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:33,608
as the gases were
given off the bodies,

113
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,025
without any proper ventilation

114
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:38,901
the crypt itself could become
a pressure cooker.

115
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:40,732
The bodies were the bomb.

116
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,026
Not our first meat puzzle,
Doctor.

117
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:47,149
And it certainly
won't be the last.

118
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,713
Never forget, Mr. Palmer,

119
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:51,144
experience is the ultimate teacher.

120
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,275
Corner pieces
are not as reliable

121
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:54,839
as the singular components.

122
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,215
Yes, as experience
has taught us.

123
00:05:57,216 --> 00:05:58,516
Skulls and torsos.

124
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:01,561
And judging by these
pelvic structures,

125
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,900
we have a man
and a woman.

126
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:05,287
Yes, well, let's
put Adam

127
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:07,015
on the left and Eve
on the right.

128
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:08,641
This reminds me of a summer

129
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:11,390
when I assisted at an
archaeological dig

130
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:12,871
in North Africa.

131
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,856
Our team unearthed

132
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:19,253
two fossilized Neanderthals
from a primitive burial mound:

133
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:21,742
one man, one woman.

134
00:06:21,777 --> 00:06:23,642
This rib structure's
fractured, Doctor.

135
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:25,955
Possibly from the force
of the explosion?

136
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:27,018
Oh, no, no, no.

137
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,518
It's a clean,
serrated edge.

138
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,524
Very unlikely.

139
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:32,810
Did you know that
the Zulus burn

140
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:36,425
all the possessions
of a dear departed

141
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,239
to ward off evil?

142
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:40,211
Some tribes even
throw spears

143
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:44,358
and shoot arrows into the air
to kill hovering spirits.

144
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:46,278
Right ulna.

145
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:49,344
That evolved into the modern
military tradition

146
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,620
of firing a volley into the air.

147
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,578
Uh, right hand.

148
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,705
Yes, after the death
of an African king,

149
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:58,706
right hand,

150
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:02,458
some of his subjects used
to cut off fingers and toes.

151
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:05,859
It was considered
a mark of respect.

152
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,083
Humerus.

153
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,511
I suppose it depends
on what you find funny.

154
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:15,044
Oh, right,

155
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,450
humerus.

156
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:20,271
Right hand.

157
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:30,337
Didn't this happen
the last time?

158
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:32,583
We're gonna need another table.

159
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,337
The mausoleum doesn't get
many visitors

160
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:35,896
which makes it
a creative place

161
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:37,396
to get rid of a few bodies,

162
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:38,468
- but...
- Whoever deposited them

163
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,700
would first have to know that a portion

164
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:41,648
of Chief Waller's crypt was vacant.

165
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:43,337
That would suggest an inside job.

166
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,983
With the knowledge to access
a sealed tomb.

167
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:48,505
Which would point to Jackson...

168
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:50,367
or Dixon.

169
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:52,486
If they hadn't practically
blown themselves up.

170
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:55,729
What do you think, McGee?

171
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,274
She definitely seemed un-Abby.

172
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:00,275
Who?

173
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:01,276
Abby.

174
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:02,288
Abby's unhappy?

175
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,745
No, Abby's un-Abby.

176
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,200
I need you to focus here,

177
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:06,645
okay? Pitch in?

178
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:08,426
I'll talk to her when I can.

179
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:09,464
Why you?

180
00:08:09,465 --> 00:08:10,666
Because dealing with an angry

181
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:12,906
woman requires a great
deal of sensitivity.

182
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:16,416
Clearly not an area
of expertise for you.

183
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:17,998
Well, I don't doubt that you have

184
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,027
more experience
with angry women.

185
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:22,627
Now, you see, that wasn't
very sensitive, was it?

186
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,465
The man has one serious
relationship

187
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,152
and all of a sudden
he's an expert.

188
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:28,413
All right, there is one
clear-cut undeniable reason

189
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:30,841
why I should be the one
to talk to Abby.

190
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:32,907
She owes me a dollar. Now...

191
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:38,277
We ran down I. D.'s
on the remains,

192
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:39,966
got a hit on the woman.

193
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,092
Classic DiNozzo.

194
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,590
One intact fingerprint

195
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:45,842
off her left hand
matches driver's license.

196
00:08:45,843 --> 00:08:48,591
Marilyn Torrance, age 58
of Tyson's Corner.

197
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:50,924
There's no case file because

198
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:53,455
her nephew and his wife never
reported her missing.

199
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:55,279
They're on their way in.

200
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
That it?

201
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,828
McGee?

202
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,180
Is there Jethro right there?

203
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:02,490
Be right there, Ducky.

204
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,170
Saved by the bell.

205
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,010
They were dismembered

206
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:11,619
by severing tendons, muscles
from ligaments at every joint.

207
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:14,092
The neck, shoulder,
elbow, wrist, hip,

208
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:15,319
knee, ankle,

209
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,306
et cetera.

210
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:20,346
There's very little
damage to the bones themselves,

211
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:22,405
except the rib cages,
they were cut.

212
00:09:22,406 --> 00:09:24,910
Probably using a bone saw.

213
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:26,331
Were they murdered?

214
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:27,905
One of them at least was.

215
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:30,594
Blunt-force trauma to the female skull.

216
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:32,094
A blow to the back of the head

217
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:34,406
that was certainly enough
to kill a woman of her age.

218
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,637
Fourth-rib-phase analysis suggests

219
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:37,833
that she was in her 70s.

220
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:40,347
According to the DMV,
Marilyn Torrance was 58.

221
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:41,595
Women lie about their age.

222
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:43,186
But this is her hand.

223
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,783
Not her head.

224
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:46,659
Well, maybe that's her head.

225
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,847
That's a man's skull.

226
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:50,347
Well, maybe you reassembled
the pieces incorrectly.

227
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:52,534
The problem is we can't
reassemble the pieces.

228
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:53,659
We don't have two

229
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,255
full sets of remains.

230
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:56,782
We're missing pieces.

231
00:09:56,783 --> 00:09:58,986
Yes, and these unrelated pieces, well,

232
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:02,143
they belong to at least
three different people.

233
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:03,521
Three more bodies?

234
00:10:03,722 --> 00:10:05,221
We're missing
a lot of pieces.

235
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:06,382
This is more than someone

236
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:07,664
just dumping two bodies.

237
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:11,351
I think you're looking
for a mass murderer.

238
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:21,245
<i>Can't we talk about this ?</i>

239
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:24,548
<i> There's no point...</i>

240
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:27,313
What do you got, Abs?

241
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:30,597
Decaying flesh,
organs and human tissue.

242
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:33,351
- The DNA confirms that...
- Five different people.

243
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:35,163
Well, if you already
talked to Ducky,

244
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:36,639
there's not much
I can tell you.

245
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,664
You didn't give me much
to work with, Gibbs.

246
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:40,038
There's barely any blood.

247
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,601
The bodies were probably drained.

248
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,242
So what, you think
we're looking for a vampire?

249
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:49,100
There are traces of
cellulose, fiber,

250
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:50,816
common paper and string.

251
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:52,413
The parts were wrapped.

252
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:54,700
Yeah, but they're too degraded to
get any fingerprints off of.

253
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:55,977
There was one thing.

254
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:58,413
The screws from
the marble frontispiece.

255
00:10:58,414 --> 00:11:02,301
They've been collecting rust
since the interment in 1978.

256
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:03,601
But look at the heads.

257
00:11:03,602 --> 00:11:04,854
They're scratched.

258
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:06,702
That's from the screwdriver.
it dislodged the rust.

259
00:11:06,703 --> 00:11:08,728
But look at the other crypts.

260
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,699
See the screws?

261
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:16,289
Yeah. They're all rusted.

262
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,500
Except for these two crypts.

263
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:22,727
Anson Gage, USMC, Colonel;
Raymond Dalton, U. S. Army.

264
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:25,343
Might be vandalism, but
it might be something.

265
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:27,790
- DiNozzo.
- Contact next of kin

266
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,168
and get permission to open
those two crypts. On it, boss!

267
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:32,409
Nice catch, Abby.

268
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,980
Yeah.

269
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:36,889
I couldn't help but notice
how quiet it is in here.

270
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:39,104
- Where's the music?
- I just wasn't in the mood.

271
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:40,230
Anything...

272
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,638
you want to talk about?

273
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:44,520
Why would there be?

274
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:47,567
Yeah, I don't know,
it's just that McGee said

275
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:49,057
that you weren't really
acting like yourself,

276
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,595
- and so I thought...
- So you guys have been

277
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:52,058
talking about me?

278
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:53,158
Yeah. No.

279
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:57,217
We're wondering if there
was anything bothering you.

280
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:58,858
You want to know
what bothers me?

281
00:11:58,859 --> 00:12:02,910
It bothers me when people
gossip about other people

282
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,280
behind their backs.

283
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,419
Do you really think
that that is okay?

284
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,631
Yeah. 'Cause...

285
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:12,419
I mean, it's the only way to gossip.

286
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,983
'Cause if we talked
about you in front

287
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,731
of your face, then that
would just be talking about you.

288
00:12:15,732 --> 00:12:17,357
You know what, we're
just not gonna...

289
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:19,041
we're not gonna do that anymore.

290
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:20,573
Sorry.

291
00:12:21,795 --> 00:12:23,047
Your aunt lived with you?

292
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:24,993
When she was in town, yes.

293
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:27,358
You're sure she was murdered?

294
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:30,421
Preliminary findings have been
inconclusive, Mr. Torrance,

295
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:31,977
but it's probable.

296
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:33,795
When was the last time
you saw her?

297
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:36,336
It's been almost
three months now.

298
00:12:36,362 --> 00:12:38,672
And you never filed
a missing persons report?

299
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:40,148
Well, she does this.

300
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:44,137
She would meet a new man
with a yacht or a jet...

301
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:46,734
and disappear for a while.

302
00:12:46,735 --> 00:12:50,235
We always expected
she would resurface eventually.

303
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:52,459
Just never like this.

304
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:58,111
Here.

305
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:02,550
I know how difficult it is
to lose a person you care about.

306
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:03,551
Thank you.

307
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:06,987
We'll also need a list

308
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:09,175
of anyone who has
access to your home.

309
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:12,061
Contractors,
workmen, employees.

310
00:13:12,113 --> 00:13:14,675
And also the names
of any of her travel companions

311
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:16,511
- or associates.
- Of course.

312
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:19,866
Thank you for coming in so quickly.

313
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,052
If you learn
anything...

314
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:23,428
Please call.
As soon as we know more.

315
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:28,695
They were really cut up.

316
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:30,552
Sorry.

317
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:32,166
It's a poor choice of words.

318
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:34,366
How many more of these
are we going to do?

319
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:35,722
Uh, at least five.

320
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:36,979
So pace yourself.

321
00:13:37,491 --> 00:13:39,478
What do you mean
by that, McGee?

322
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,179
Nothing. Just, you know,

323
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:44,059
you got a little emotional in there.

324
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,386
I will meet you upstairs,
Miss Dalton, okay?

325
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:48,455
Okay.

326
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:52,928
Next of kin?

327
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:54,169
Abby thinks there might be more

328
00:13:54,211 --> 00:13:56,239
body parts hidden in her
grandfather's crypt.

329
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,241
You talked to Abby?

330
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:59,616
- Yeah, McGee.
- I was right, wasn't I?

331
00:13:59,617 --> 00:14:00,741
There's something wrong.

332
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:02,097
Let it go, probie.

333
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:05,114
-Why?
-Because I'm pretty sure

334
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:06,679
it's something you did.

335
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,754
Well, what did I do?

336
00:14:07,802 --> 00:14:09,449
Well, think about it, probie.

337
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:10,954
I'm sure you'll come up
with something.

338
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:18,959
I don't understand what
I'm supposed to be looking at.

339
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,954
These photos are
of your grandfather's tomb.

340
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:24,555
I get that.

341
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,548
I assure you this has nothing
to do with your grandfather.

342
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:30,305
How could it?
He's been dead 13 years.

343
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:32,431
- I was at the funeral.
- Right.

344
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:34,981
It's been tampered with, okay?

345
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:37,868
And we believe that
there's evidence hidden inside

346
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:39,995
relating to an ongoing
murder investigation.

347
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:41,591
What kind of evidence?

348
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:44,995
I run my own business,
Agent DiNozzo.

349
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:47,071
That means I'm losing
money every minute that

350
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:48,462
I have to spend here.

351
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:50,044
So why don't you just tell me

352
00:14:50,045 --> 00:14:51,620
what it is that you want from me?

353
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:59,173
We need you to give us
permission to open it.

354
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:00,452
So if you could just sign...

355
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:03,218
these authorization forms.

356
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:06,409
My dad put me to work right
after my grandpa died.

357
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,608
You know the first lesson
that I learned?

358
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:10,809
What's that?

359
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:15,064
Don't sign any papers without
having a lawyer look at 'em.

360
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:16,776
That's a good lesson.

361
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,531
But if it's necessary,

362
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:20,955
we'll get a federal warrant.

363
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,435
Oh, that would be
much easier for me.

364
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:24,794
You should just do that.

365
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,216
Okay.

366
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:28,902
Anything else you need?

367
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:30,654
Just a federal warrant.

368
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Great.

369
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:42,569
Company, boss.

370
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:44,597
Special Agent Gibbs.

371
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:47,878
Colonel Mann.

372
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:51,188
I got a call your case might be
venturing into CID territory.

373
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:52,904
That call was premature.

374
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:56,739
Really? Here I thought
it was four weeks overdue.

375
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,377
I understand you were
denied permission

376
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,308
by the family to access
Colonel Dalton's crypt.

377
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:07,686
Got a warrant.

378
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:09,829
And that got my attention.

379
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,343
Why don't you fill me in.

380
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:16,690
Wouldn't want to make
a bad situation worse, would you?

381
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:20,814
Don't look so nervous, Jethro.

382
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:22,627
- Do I look nervous?
- No.

383
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:24,343
You actually look, um...

384
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:26,226
you look pretty good.

385
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:31,532
David, DiNozzo, perimeter.

386
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:35,567
Sure you don't want us
to help you in there, boss?

387
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:38,504
'Course not, 'cause if
you did, you would've said,

388
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:40,381
"David, DiNozzo, follow me."

389
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:41,462
Probie, stop it.

390
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:43,924
We're not going anywhere.

391
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:46,039
Why? What'd I miss?

392
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:50,316
Not like you to leave
something unfinished.

393
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:51,497
The crime scene.

394
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:53,482
Ever worry you're slipping?

395
00:16:53,483 --> 00:16:54,483
No.

396
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,682
Any suspects yet?

397
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:58,192
Nothing concrete.

398
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,195
What does your gut say?

399
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:02,376
Theory is it's an inside job.

400
00:17:02,383 --> 00:17:04,194
But you don't like that.

401
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:06,080
So how else would he know

402
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:09,629
which crypts are vacant?

403
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:12,478
Ah, read the faceplates.

404
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:15,351
So the warrant didn't
exactly specify

405
00:17:15,397 --> 00:17:16,884
what we're looking for here.

406
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:19,756
Well, it's best
to not have expectations.

407
00:17:19,757 --> 00:17:21,772
It staves off disappointment.

408
00:17:23,696 --> 00:17:25,406
What are we hoping for?

409
00:17:25,757 --> 00:17:29,592
You throw that "we" word around
pretty casually.

410
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,045
The last time someone tried to remove
one of these, it blew up in his face.

411
00:17:40,073 --> 00:17:42,696
You might want to step back a little bit.

412
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:44,647
Thank you for your concern.

413
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,259
I see what you mean.

414
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,460
Expectations.

415
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:01,411
Gibbs did not look happy
to see her.

416
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:03,635
His body language suggested

417
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:05,821
he was not comfortable at all.

418
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:07,947
Eh, nothing makes
Gibbs uncomfortable.

419
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:09,368
Nothing job-related.

420
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,822
You think he ended it with her?

421
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:14,011
Assuming that he started something.

422
00:18:14,012 --> 00:18:15,242
I don't buy it.

423
00:18:15,324 --> 00:18:17,073
- Why not?
- For one, she's not a redhead.

424
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:18,323
People do change, Tony.

425
00:18:18,324 --> 00:18:20,219
It's true, even you
have a girlfriend.

426
00:18:21,762 --> 00:18:22,949
I haven't changed.

427
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,137
Really? What about
the pretty girl in the office.

428
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,200
- Natalie Dalton?
- Well, you noticed she was pretty,

429
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:28,449
but you didn't flirt with her.

430
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,761
That would've been unprofessional.

431
00:18:29,762 --> 00:18:30,762
I don't know.

432
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,514
Might have gotten her
to sign the authorization.

433
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:34,762
Then we would not have
need the warrant.

434
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:36,889
Then Colonel Mann
wouldn't have been here.

435
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,215
And we would be inside
doing our job.

436
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:41,390
- Like professionals.
- All because

437
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:43,451
you don't flirt anymore.
Why is that?

438
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:46,103
- Enough gossip, McGee.
- Tony, you like to talk about

439
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,655
everyone's private lives.

440
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:50,052
Talk, yes.

441
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:52,815
But I don't write entire
books about them, do I?

442
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:55,139
Does create a bit of a trust...

443
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,140
issue, McGee.

444
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,263
Excuse me. Hi.

445
00:18:59,078 --> 00:19:00,827
Am I able to go inside today?

446
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:02,958
The mausoleum is closed, sir.

447
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,391
Here it is.

448
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:16,140
Are you gonna let me in?

449
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:19,080
I think we should be clear
on the implications first.

450
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:21,017
You're interfering
with my investigation.

451
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:23,266
- Is that what I'm doing?
- Honestly, I'm not sure.

452
00:19:23,267 --> 00:19:24,893
If there's evidence in here,

453
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:27,143
I'm gonna be obligated
to see this through to the end.

454
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:28,767
- And if there's not?
- Then I don't see

455
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,563
why my involvement
shouldn't end right here.

456
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,206
If you wanted to see me,

457
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:41,706
you didn't have
to manufacture a reason.

458
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:44,144
I follow the orders
of the United States Army,

459
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:46,520
even when they don't
exactly make sense.

460
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:48,830
- You could've called.
- So could you.

461
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:50,644
I distinctly remember
the last thing you said

462
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:52,082
as you were slinking
out of my bedroom...

463
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,942
- I don't slink.
- "I'll call you."

464
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,644
 For the record,
I didn't think the last time

465
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:58,369
we saw each other was gonna be
the last time we saw each other.

466
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,700
Neither did I.

467
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:01,652
Well, here we are.

468
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:03,232
Lucky for us.

469
00:20:03,398 --> 00:20:04,798
Call it fate.

470
00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:07,141
You're just gonna let fate decide

471
00:20:07,183 --> 00:20:09,075
whether we go our separate ways?

472
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,493
Five bodies in total.

473
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:14,334
We've only recovered portions.

474
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:15,770
You're hoping the rest

475
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:16,822
- are in here.
- Aren't you?

476
00:20:18,023 --> 00:20:20,053
Honestly, I'm not really sure.

477
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,559
That the answer
you're looking for?

478
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:40,248
If the bodies recovered
from the mausoleum were, in fact,

479
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:42,143
the result of mass murder,

480
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:45,466
one might expect a certain modicum

481
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:47,608
of consistency in the manner of death.

482
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,610
One might.

483
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,401
Yes. And one would be wrong.

484
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:54,798
Shot, stabbed, strangled, bludgeoned,

485
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:59,563
and poor Miss Undetermined Torrance.

486
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,202
Three women, two men,

487
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:04,998
ages ranging from 19 to 70. 

488
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:06,318
Three are Caucasian,

489
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:08,907
one Asian, and one black.

490
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:10,902
- No common traits.
- Not in life.

491
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:14,403
But the blood, however,
settled on different surfaces

492
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:15,775
on each of the bodies.

493
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,462
Her left thigh and back,

494
00:21:17,463 --> 00:21:19,651
his chest and buttocks, meaning...

495
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:21,962
The bodies were moved repeatedly.

496
00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:23,775
Precisely. They were killed and then moved

497
00:21:23,776 --> 00:21:25,846
for some sort of preparation.

498
00:21:25,964 --> 00:21:27,776
You can see the indentations
on the ankles

499
00:21:27,777 --> 00:21:30,746
here and here, here.

500
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,792
Chain-link.

501
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:33,452
Yes. I believe the bodies

502
00:21:33,453 --> 00:21:37,088
were suspended and drained
prior to being, well,

503
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,776
there's only one word for it.

504
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:39,777
Butchered.

505
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,029
We sent the tissue samples to Abby.
Hopefully, she can...

506
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,445
Speak of the devil.

507
00:21:44,655 --> 00:21:47,675
What we have here is
paradoxical behavior.

508
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:49,551
On one side, we have...

509
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:51,906
An emotional, unrestrained murderer

510
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:53,965
using whatever means at hand.

511
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:56,606
Yes. And, on the other,
someone tidy, meticulous,

512
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,467
and almost flawless

513
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,376
in the way he dissected these bodies.

514
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,342
That wasn't Abby.

515
00:22:03,343 --> 00:22:06,093
That was the Director.
She wants to see you.

516
00:22:07,468 --> 00:22:08,668
Both of you.

517
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,155
As far as we can tell,

518
00:22:17,156 --> 00:22:19,032
the only thing that brought
these people together

519
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,719
is how they were taken apart.

520
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,468
In addition to Marilyn Torrance,

521
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:25,843
we have a 19-year-old runaway
from Florida. He was shot.

522
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,499
30-year-old prostitute.

523
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,156
She was strangled.

524
00:22:29,157 --> 00:22:31,096
No next of kin on either of them.

525
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:33,781
Wade Carlin, 26-year-old
Georgetown graduate

526
00:22:33,782 --> 00:22:36,344
- from Michigan.
- He broke off contact with his parents

527
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:38,970
after his girlfriend dumped him
six months ago.

528
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:41,597
They thought he was Jack
Kerouac-ing around the country.

529
00:22:41,598 --> 00:22:43,157
When, in fact,
he was stabbed to death

530
00:22:43,158 --> 00:22:44,597
a few weeks after the breakup.

531
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:48,045
All missing persons cases.
All have led to nowhere.

532
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:49,046
Until now.

533
00:22:50,347 --> 00:22:51,347
Gloria Grady,

534
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,846
age 72. Ducky says
she was the first victim.

535
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:54,847
Blunt trauma.

536
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:56,658
Only one relative, her son,

537
00:22:57,901 --> 00:22:58,901
Len Grady.

538
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:00,749
He was at James River.

539
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,159
With a bouquet of flowers.

540
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,468
Lilies. For who?

541
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:07,347
No record of any Grady
at James River.

542
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:08,722
Could be under a different name.

543
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:09,872
Could be a friend.

544
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:11,847
But lilies. They're feminine.

545
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,472
The kind you give to a woman.

546
00:23:13,473 --> 00:23:14,713
Like your mother.

547
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,470
Grady's mother.
I don't know your mother.

548
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:21,785
Could be visiting his trophies.

549
00:23:21,786 --> 00:23:25,386
Fits the classic profile:
30s, single, white.

550
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:27,724
We should tell Gibbs.

551
00:23:27,725 --> 00:23:29,285
Yeah? Why don't we wait
till he gets out?

552
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:32,038
Unlessyouwant to be the one to
interrupt his meeting.

553
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,219
Campfire's over.

554
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:36,414
Okay. Well, thank you, Colonel.

555
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,955
I will get her back to you
as soon as possible.

556
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,225
Your superiors have agreed

557
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:44,601
to loan us your services
for the interim.

558
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:46,949
I trust that there's
not a problem with that?

559
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,350
No. Of course not, Director.

560
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:50,851
As long as Special Agent Gibbs
continues to be forthcoming

561
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:52,692
with pertinent information.

562
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:54,476
Agent Gibbs?

563
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:58,299
As long as she follows my lead,
I can't foresee a problem.

564
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:03,152
You two have worked cases
together successfully in the past. 

565
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:04,351
Nothing's changed

566
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,647
to interfere with that professional
relationship, has there?

567
00:24:11,478 --> 00:24:13,229
What do we have so far?

568
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,605
Four confirmed homicides.
Likely, five.

569
00:24:15,606 --> 00:24:17,417
- That's all you know?
- I know we're wasting time

570
00:24:17,418 --> 00:24:19,352
debating jurisdictional protocol

571
00:24:19,353 --> 00:24:21,852
and discussing who's entitled to what.

572
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:23,278
Well, then, why don't
you get back to it?

573
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,418
Yeah. Thank you.

574
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:25,419
Not you,

575
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:26,479
Colonel Mann.

576
00:24:27,107 --> 00:24:29,532
I'd like to have
a private word with you.

577
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,466
Breaking in a new pair?

578
00:24:42,532 --> 00:24:45,419
No. I always wear these.
Why do I always wear these?

579
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,545
- Let me see your shoes.
- Okay.

580
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:53,425
Flat, sensible, functional.
Not very sexy, but..

581
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:56,590
- But they do the trick.
- What do I want three-inch platforms?

582
00:24:56,593 --> 00:24:57,670
I'm already five-ten.

583
00:24:57,671 --> 00:25:00,044
I love these shoes... just all wrong.

584
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:01,105
Wrong for who?

585
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,530
The tissue samples.

586
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,221
I don't follow.

587
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:07,733
You don't want to hear about shoes.

588
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:10,108
- You want to hearabout tissue samples.
- Sure.

589
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,422
I ran the Torrance tissues
through the mass spec,

590
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:14,734
and I found abnormal levels
of chlorine.

591
00:25:14,735 --> 00:25:16,009
- Chlorine?
- Yeah.

592
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,380
Like in a swimming pool.

593
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:19,646
Len Grady's Website.

594
00:25:19,796 --> 00:25:21,733
He's a jack-of-all-trades. Basically,

595
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:22,857
a guy with a big van.

596
00:25:22,858 --> 00:25:24,235
And a little initiative.

597
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:26,295
Something of an amateur entrepreneur.

598
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:27,733
That's not easy to say.

599
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,093
Carpenter, plumber,
gardener, electrician,

600
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,110
TV installations,

601
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:32,700
- snow shoveling..
- But, most importantly,

602
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:33,710
pool cleaning.

603
00:25:33,711 --> 00:25:35,110
That supposed to mean something?

604
00:25:35,111 --> 00:25:36,172
Well, he's not just any pool man.

605
00:25:36,173 --> 00:25:37,611
 He's the Torrances' pool man.

606
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:38,859
Grady's got his own key.

607
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,659
Heated. Indoor. Regular
monthly maintenance. I looked into it.

608
00:25:41,737 --> 00:25:44,111
Royalty checks burning a hole
in your pocket, McGee?

609
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:45,736
Already tied Grady to his mother.

610
00:25:45,737 --> 00:25:46,917
Body number one.

611
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:48,984
- And now Torrance.
- Body number two.

612
00:25:48,985 --> 00:25:50,455
Let's bring him in.

613
00:25:58,626 --> 00:25:59,674
A lot of people

614
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:02,798
were pleased to see
Sharif off the streets.

615
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,270
My superiors acknowledged
your letter of commendation.

616
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,174
I want you to know I appreciate it.

617
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:10,174
The two make an effective team.

618
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:11,415
Gibbs and myself?

619
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:14,100
Well, it wasn't just a flash
in the pan, was it?

620
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:17,625
Your service at CID is up in six months.

621
00:26:18,363 --> 00:26:20,175
You must have started considering life

622
00:26:20,176 --> 00:26:21,487
after the military.

623
00:26:21,488 --> 00:26:22,862
Yes. It has crossed my mind.

624
00:26:22,863 --> 00:26:25,615
The question is how
to best serve your future.

625
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:28,641
Where the opportunity for
advancement lies.

626
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:32,552
It's not too early
for a cocktail, is it?

627
00:26:32,553 --> 00:26:34,798
The sun must be down somewhere.

628
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,428
You drink bourbon?

629
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:38,350
No. Not regularly.

630
00:26:39,394 --> 00:26:42,491
Spend enough time around Gibbs,
and you'll learn.

631
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:44,178
Believe me.

632
00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:47,028
It's an acquired taste.

633
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:50,094
And when did you first acquire it?

634
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,340
It's been a while.

635
00:26:54,617 --> 00:26:57,387
But it's something
that stays with you though.

636
00:27:08,932 --> 00:27:10,118
Nobody's home, Boss.

637
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,303
Neighbor said he went out
about an hour ago.

638
00:27:12,304 --> 00:27:13,419
What do we do?

639
00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:14,804
We wait.

640
00:27:16,743 --> 00:27:17,743
Okay.

641
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:20,179
Colonel Mann still in with the Director?

642
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,667
What do you think
they're talking about?

643
00:27:22,368 --> 00:27:23,798
We wait... 

644
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,826
...silently.

645
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:28,244
Okay.

646
00:27:32,495 --> 00:27:33,495
I got him.

647
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,461
Len Grady?

648
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:37,682
Freeze!

649
00:27:37,883 --> 00:27:38,948
Federal agents.

650
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,588
Up, up, up!

651
00:27:49,746 --> 00:27:51,521
What? What?

652
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:03,496
Bachelor living.

653
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:05,044
Not every bachelor.

654
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:12,121
This guy's got a card for everything.

655
00:28:12,122 --> 00:28:13,602
"Len Grady, Painter."

656
00:28:13,686 --> 00:28:15,701
"Len Grady, Fountain Design."

657
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:18,061
"Cottage cheese ceilings removed

658
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:19,302
and made smooth."

659
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,937
Anything with a blade on it,
we should get to Abby.

660
00:28:22,938 --> 00:28:24,428
Not really what she wants.

661
00:28:25,126 --> 00:28:27,191
She's upset about her shoes.

662
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:28,438
Doesn't sound like Abby.

663
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:31,062
Wrong pair of shoes
can reduce a woman to tears.

664
00:28:31,063 --> 00:28:32,183
She was crying?

665
00:28:32,187 --> 00:28:33,187
Practically.

666
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:35,096
It's not the shoes.

667
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:38,547
Got something.

668
00:28:38,937 --> 00:28:39,950
Yep.

669
00:28:40,811 --> 00:28:42,171
White paper package

670
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,842
tied with brown string.

671
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:46,064
What's that?

672
00:28:47,627 --> 00:28:48,977
It's a pork chop.

673
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:52,263
- Hear you got our guy in there.
- Maybe.

674
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:55,581
- What?
- Nothing.

675
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:57,688
It seems like you
were thinking something.

676
00:28:57,689 --> 00:28:59,000
That's been known to happen.

677
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:00,361
Something about me.

678
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:02,189
Thought I recognized your perfume.

679
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,780
I don't wear perfume.

680
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:05,743
Must have been something else.

681
00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:10,164
So... can I just go ahead

682
00:29:10,212 --> 00:29:11,342
and pay the fine and get out of here?

683
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:12,437
Fine?

684
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,074
I know I shouldn't have cashed

685
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:16,881
my mother's Social Security checks.

686
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:18,664
We're not the IRS.

687
00:29:20,503 --> 00:29:22,254
She went missing last March.

688
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:23,495
She had dementia.

689
00:29:23,691 --> 00:29:26,383
It was getting worse. She must have
gotten out one day.

690
00:29:26,654 --> 00:29:29,002
We're talking about
a person here, not a dog.

691
00:29:29,003 --> 00:29:31,067
I keep hoping she'll come back.

692
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:33,268
You already know where to find her.

693
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:35,315
How do I know that?

694
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,691
You went to visit her.

695
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,112
Brought her flowers.

696
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:42,504
My mother's at the cemetery?

697
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:45,060
What's left of her.
She was dismembered.

698
00:29:46,693 --> 00:29:49,100
Look at his mind spinning.

699
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,394
He's trying to figure out
how to play it.

700
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:56,544
I didn't do that.

701
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,257
I took care of my mother.

702
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,881
I fed her.

703
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:06,904
I cleaned up after her.

704
00:30:08,882 --> 00:30:11,006
You must have been praying for it to end.

705
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:12,362
I loved my mother!

706
00:30:12,758 --> 00:30:14,224
Maybe you were right the first time.

707
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:16,006
It must have been
like putting down a dog.

708
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:17,819
Only no one ever noticed.

709
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,233
Getting away with it must have
been the real shocking part.

710
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:23,853
And a new career is born.

711
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,050
You did it again...

712
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,448
and again.

713
00:30:27,048 --> 00:30:29,498
Kelly Camarda, Wade...

714
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:31,929
Something's not right.

715
00:30:32,073 --> 00:30:33,368
What do you mean?

716
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:35,296
He looks relieved.

717
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:37,573
Gloria Grady.

718
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:41,134
Okay.

719
00:30:41,534 --> 00:30:42,737
Stop.

720
00:30:42,772 --> 00:30:45,135
You have something
you want to tell us?

721
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:47,561
All these people
were chopped up?

722
00:30:48,322 --> 00:30:49,622
That's disgusting.

723
00:30:51,822 --> 00:30:54,574
What kind of person
do you think could do that?

724
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:57,350
I mean, you're
looking for a monster.

725
00:30:58,199 --> 00:31:00,259
What do you want me to say?

726
00:31:00,451 --> 00:31:01,451
It's not me.

727
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,200
What now?

728
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:16,386
Want me to do a lie-detector test
or something?

729
00:31:16,652 --> 00:31:18,022
You just did.

730
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:21,262
He's telling the truth.

731
00:31:21,263 --> 00:31:22,793
You think I'm wrong?

732
00:31:22,913 --> 00:31:24,824
No. But he was relieved when

733
00:31:24,825 --> 00:31:26,700
you connected her with
the rest of the bodies.

734
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:29,000
He has no feelings about them at all.

735
00:31:29,077 --> 00:31:31,387
- Doesn't mean he wasn't involved.
- Maybe.

736
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:33,452
But that doesn't look like
a man who feels trapped.

737
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:36,687
That looks like a man who
knows he has a way out.

738
00:31:36,888 --> 00:31:38,702
There's something much worse than

739
00:31:38,703 --> 00:31:40,178
Len Grady out there.

740
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:43,774
Only he knows what it is.

741
00:31:50,273 --> 00:31:52,435
We've got to push Grady harder
to tell us what he knows.

742
00:31:52,436 --> 00:31:53,450
He won't.

743
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:54,960
You think he's protecting
the real killer?

744
00:31:54,961 --> 00:31:56,021
He's protecting himself.

745
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:58,172
I can prove that
he's not acting alone.

746
00:32:00,561 --> 00:32:02,336
Trying to run down Grady's van.

747
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,398
No luck so far.

748
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:04,713
He was on foot
when you apprehended him.

749
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,774
So what did he do
with his ride?

750
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:07,146
And when did he do it?

751
00:32:07,147 --> 00:32:09,026
After he spotted us
at the cemetery.

752
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,777
What, he just happened to be visiting?

753
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:12,466
There's no such thing
as a coincidence.

754
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:15,215
Well, he wanted information.
He was there to watch us.

755
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:17,404
But he got there
as quickly as I did,

756
00:32:17,405 --> 00:32:19,151
so how did he know
about the investigation?

757
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:20,402
He's got a friend
on the inside.

758
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:23,009
One person's a psychopath,

759
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:24,340
two people's a conspiracy.

760
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:26,226
So who was he talking to?

761
00:32:26,514 --> 00:32:27,904
Grady doesn't leave here

762
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:29,904
until we know everything about him.

763
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:32,340
You start with yesterday
and you work backwards.

764
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:38,029
Go.

765
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,030
Forensics?

766
00:32:41,969 --> 00:32:43,214
- Boss...
- Yeah.

767
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:50,594
If you're going
to go see Abby,

768
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:52,093
I think you should know
she's going through something...

769
00:32:52,094 --> 00:32:54,634
I'm not going empty-handed, McGee.

770
00:32:55,781 --> 00:32:56,781
Gibbs.

771
00:32:57,532 --> 00:32:59,905
- And Lieutenant Colonel Mann.
- Abby.

772
00:32:59,906 --> 00:33:02,218
Can I interest you in some knives?

773
00:33:02,219 --> 00:33:05,470
I've got kitchen knives,
pen knives, pocket knives,

774
00:33:05,471 --> 00:33:08,719
Swiss army knives,
razor blades, X-acto blades,

775
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,570
scissors, saws, scalpels, hedge clippers,

776
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:15,432
an adze, an awl, a fish scaler

777
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:17,409
and even a golf-hole cutter.

778
00:33:17,858 --> 00:33:20,343
All recovered from Grady's pigsty?

779
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:25,608
Reflected in the care he used
to maintain his cutlery,

780
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:28,504
there's dings and nicks and dull edges.

781
00:33:28,547 --> 00:33:31,422
None of these correspond
to any of the precise incisions

782
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:33,110
used to dismember the corpses.

783
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,346
For such a slob,

784
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:37,233
he certainly is careful when it counts.

785
00:33:37,234 --> 00:33:39,547
There wasn't a single trace
of human blood anywhere.

786
00:33:39,548 --> 00:33:40,853
Human blood...

787
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:43,171
Your boy Grady is something
of a carnivore.

788
00:33:43,172 --> 00:33:44,799
From the remnants on his silverware,

789
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,299
I could pretty much tell you
every meal he had for a week.

790
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,845
Liverwurst, knockwurst,

791
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,487
pastrami, roast beef, rack of lamb.

792
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:52,963
Which leads us to...

793
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:55,492
this.

794
00:33:56,173 --> 00:33:58,478
The pork chop from his freezer.

795
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:03,816
Probably his next meal.

796
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:05,574
When I pull it up,
it gets really interesting.

797
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:08,552
It matches the incisions on the bodies.

798
00:34:08,553 --> 00:34:10,276
Tool mark analysis isn't as precise

799
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:11,802
as say fingerprints or ballistics,

800
00:34:11,803 --> 00:34:14,237
but I can conclusively tell you
that none of the blades

801
00:34:14,238 --> 00:34:16,713
in Grady's possession
carved that pig.

802
00:34:16,714 --> 00:34:18,149
Well, why would they?

803
00:34:19,051 --> 00:34:21,141
He probably had it carved.

804
00:34:23,052 --> 00:34:26,030
His partner's a butcher.

805
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:31,928
Don't you have work to do?

806
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,010
Look, it's not something

807
00:34:34,176 --> 00:34:37,900
that you can fix in the classic
Gibbs hit-and-run style, okay?

808
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,275
I got time, Abs.

809
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,740
It's stupid.

810
00:34:47,178 --> 00:34:48,717
It's just... 

811
00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:50,743
... a guy.

812
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:53,429
I'm not going to start spilling my guts

813
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:56,035
just because you
keep standing here.

814
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:03,117
All right, apparently
I am too much for him.

815
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,241
Can you imagine that?

816
00:35:04,242 --> 00:35:05,242
Me?

817
00:35:05,555 --> 00:35:07,241
And it's not what you think.

818
00:35:07,242 --> 00:35:09,335
It's not all this.

819
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,543
He likes...

820
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,141
he likes small women.

821
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:16,192
I got dumped 'cause
I'm too... too big.

822
00:35:17,368 --> 00:35:18,617
And don't even bother

823
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:21,556
with the, "No, it's him.
He's too small."

824
00:35:21,557 --> 00:35:23,618
or "If he can't accept you
for who you are

825
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:25,679
then it's his problem," thing.

826
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,742
He just doesn't think
that we could make it work

827
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:30,983
and I've done everything I can

828
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,846
to try to convince him
that he's wrong.

829
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,524
So I guess. I'm just going to have
to accept it.

830
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,125
And let it go.

831
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:53,364
Thanks, Gibbs.

832
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:56,687
You always know what to say.

833
00:35:58,184 --> 00:36:00,745
Metro P. D. responded
to the BOLO on Grady's van.

834
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:03,171
So far 13 possibles and counting.

835
00:36:03,435 --> 00:36:04,435
McGee.

836
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:06,326
Supermarkets, slaughter houses,

837
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:07,659
any place with a butcher on site

838
00:36:07,705 --> 00:36:09,981
within a 20-block radius
of Grady's residence.

839
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,620
Narrow the search to boutique shops.

840
00:36:14,635 --> 00:36:16,325
They'd need their privacy.

841
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:20,947
There's just one.

842
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:21,948
Just one?

843
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,635
Boutique butcher's a dying industry.

844
00:36:23,636 --> 00:36:26,250
- Where?
- Le Cochon, Mass Avenue.

845
00:36:26,325 --> 00:36:27,699
All right, get a list of employees,

846
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,315
owners past and present.

847
00:36:31,137 --> 00:36:32,137
Let's roll.

848
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,325
Ms. Dalton.

849
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,449
I thought you said
you didn't need me.

850
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,450
What's your relationship
with Len Grady?

851
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:51,514
Len, he's my boyfriend.
Why? What's going on?

852
00:36:51,515 --> 00:36:53,326
You told Grady you spoke
with us earlier?

853
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:54,862
Yeah, I mentioned it.

854
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:58,801
Is this about the investigation?

855
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:02,451
Where is Len?

856
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:03,452
In custody.

857
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,129
We suspect he's committed
at least five murders.

858
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:09,516
That's impossible.

859
00:37:09,517 --> 00:37:11,467
Len would never hurt any...

860
00:37:12,203 --> 00:37:13,203
Five?

861
00:37:13,392 --> 00:37:14,392
At least.

862
00:37:16,264 --> 00:37:17,799
Where's your freezer?

863
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:28,953
Nothing in here, Boss.

864
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:30,704
Just pork, beef and lamb.

865
00:37:30,705 --> 00:37:32,535
What else would there be?

866
00:37:33,143 --> 00:37:34,143
Human blood.

867
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:36,766
Human?

868
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:38,442
What's in here?

869
00:37:38,643 --> 00:37:40,393
It's a freezer I use
for overflow to store

870
00:37:40,394 --> 00:37:42,479
geese and turkeys
in the holidays.

871
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,330
Got a key?

872
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,267
What kind of evidence
did you say that you found

873
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:54,519
in my grandfather's crypt?

874
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,829
Does Grady has access to your store?

875
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,595
He's here all the time.

876
00:37:58,644 --> 00:37:59,956
Look, this can't be happening, okay?

877
00:37:59,957 --> 00:38:02,082
There must be some kind of...

878
00:38:19,146 --> 00:38:21,036
He was a regular customer.

879
00:38:21,146 --> 00:38:22,981
Every week like clockwork.

880
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,645
It was the only time that he
could get away from his mother.

881
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:27,826
He felt trapped.

882
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:32,433
I could tell that he needed
to get on with his life.

883
00:38:33,334 --> 00:38:35,275
It started with a few words
here and there.

884
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:36,377
And then...

885
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,210
before long we were...

886
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:40,211
Together.

887
00:38:40,523 --> 00:38:41,583
Not fully, no.

888
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:44,084
We didn't trade keys until...

889
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:47,356
after she disappeared.

890
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:52,620
He learned your trade.

891
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:55,712
I taught him.

892
00:38:57,901 --> 00:39:00,441
He always wanted to try new things.

893
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:03,048
I never suspected that...

894
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:08,581
How could I not have seen it?

895
00:39:09,462 --> 00:39:10,997
Love makes you blind.

896
00:39:14,826 --> 00:39:17,026
I must be some kind of monster.

897
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:25,226
Is she the monster
you were talking about?

898
00:39:25,588 --> 00:39:27,091
No,

899
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:29,338
she loves me.

900
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:30,405
How?

901
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:33,954
We're in love.

902
00:39:34,276 --> 00:39:36,216
Then she had to know about it.

903
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:38,839
She had to know the real you.

904
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,550
She didn't do anything.

905
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:41,716
You're right.

906
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,775
She could have stopped you.

907
00:39:43,776 --> 00:39:45,786
She should have stopped you.

908
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,265
If it was real.

909
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,074
She didn't know!

910
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:51,594
I hid it. I hid everything.

911
00:39:52,778 --> 00:39:54,663
Just leave her out of it.

912
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,473
Natalie!

913
00:39:57,508 --> 00:39:59,454
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, Natalie!

914
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,358
I'm so sorry!

915
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:05,129
I love you!
I love you so much!

916
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:08,310
I'm sorry!

917
00:40:09,044 --> 00:40:11,237
Let's try this again.
Marilyn Torrance.

918
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:13,465
She was swimming in her pool.
I drowned her.

919
00:40:13,466 --> 00:40:14,466
Wade Carlin.

920
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,778
Natalie was at the wholesale market.

921
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:18,406
He came in for a sandwich.
I stabbed him.

922
00:40:18,407 --> 00:40:19,466
She was a hooker.

923
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:21,031
I was lonely.
Natalie was out of town.

924
00:40:21,032 --> 00:40:22,154
I strangled her.

925
00:40:22,155 --> 00:40:23,833
And the kid was nobody.

926
00:40:23,876 --> 00:40:25,843
Nobody. I just shot him.

927
00:40:25,844 --> 00:40:27,407
You kept them in the freezer
for over a year.

928
00:40:27,408 --> 00:40:28,883
Why'd you move the bodies?

929
00:40:29,357 --> 00:40:31,168
Why did you move them?

930
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:33,507
He needed the space.

931
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:36,246
No one could stop me.

932
00:40:36,345 --> 00:40:38,235
You were gonna kill again.

933
00:40:40,968 --> 00:40:42,088
He already did.

934
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:45,349
What did you do with the body?

935
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:46,966
Doesn't matter.

936
00:40:48,722 --> 00:40:49,842
Doesn't matter.

937
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:52,967
No, no... No. No!

938
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,156
No! Natalie!

939
00:40:56,722 --> 00:40:58,847
Find the van. Find the body.

940
00:41:01,535 --> 00:41:02,535
Let her go.

941
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:08,345
Still at work?

942
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:11,347
Yeah, I was just catching up
on some things.

943
00:41:11,348 --> 00:41:12,348
Cheek swabs.

944
00:41:13,912 --> 00:41:16,792
Hey, your music's back on.

945
00:41:17,097 --> 00:41:18,283
You're feeling good again.

946
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:19,404
Maybe not good.

947
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:22,610
Not yet. But better.

948
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,081
You know how sometimes a guy

949
00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:27,912
can get you all tied up inside.

950
00:41:28,013 --> 00:41:29,013
Yes.

951
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:31,723
And then you can't get the knots out?

952
00:41:31,724 --> 00:41:32,724
Yes.

953
00:41:33,162 --> 00:41:36,538
Well, it just really helped me
to talk things out with Gibbs.

954
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:38,489
You know, unknot the knots.

955
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,413
'Cause even if you
don't let it show,

956
00:41:41,414 --> 00:41:43,009
people can still tell.

957
00:41:45,598 --> 00:41:47,114
So, you know, if you ever want

958
00:41:47,158 --> 00:41:48,465
to talk about Lieutenant Sanders...

959
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,474
I liked him.

960
00:41:49,475 --> 00:41:51,127
He died. And,

961
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:53,750
what else is there to say?

962
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Well,

963
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:05,230
I am glad you feel better.

964
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:12,915
With the right partner,

965
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:14,916
you can make the perfect, monster ?

966
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:15,917
Oh yeah,

967
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,364
give me a little old-time romance.

968
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:22,618
Someone's got hidden
skeletons of his own.

969
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:27,056
You know, if I ever find myself
in a dire situation,

970
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:29,101
the proverbial body
I need to get rid of...

971
00:42:29,102 --> 00:42:30,987
I think I would tell you.

972
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,415
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

973
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:40,289
What makes you think
I wouldn't turn you in?

974
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,780
If there's one thing you're
good at, Jethro,

975
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:43,696
 it's keeping your mouth shut.

976
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,478
You made the right call
letting the girl go.

977
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:49,805
Seems you always make the call
when it involves a case.

978
00:43:09,498 --> 00:43:10,498
Oh, son of a...

979
