1
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:09,701
Let's move! Let's go!

2
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:11,907
Get those VA's on!

3
00:00:12,196 --> 00:00:14,588
Pull it two and a half,
let's get ready to roll.

4
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:17,428
Davis, get those utilities turned off.

5
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:18,655
Quickly! Move it!

6
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:19,741
I'm on it, sir!

7
00:00:19,742 --> 00:00:21,277
We're in front!
You take the back!

8
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:23,190
Scotty, you're with me! Let's move!

9
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,534
Fire Department.

10
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:25,917
Let's go.

11
00:00:28,056 --> 00:00:29,155
You two spread out.

12
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:30,891
Clear the bedrooms,
I'll take the kitchen.

13
00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:32,155
We'll cover this side here.

14
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:33,744
All right! I'm going right!

15
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:43,095
Every damn time.

16
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:45,032
False alarm, fellas!

17
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:46,680
Just another over cooked bird.

18
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:48,283
Or something.

19
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:54,483
Tough to tell after six hours in the...

20
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:56,283
...oven.

Double Americano for Thom.

27
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,383
Aren't you Thom?

28
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,555
Yes. Thank you. Sorry.

29
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:13,819
Must need that badly. Don't even
recognize your own name.

30
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,172
Medium mocha coming up.

31
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:16,972
It's... my other name.

32
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:19,848
- Two names?
- Well, two jobs.

33
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:20,915
It's Thom when I'm writing.

34
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,456
Not that I've actually
written anything in weeks.

35
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:24,599
Writer's block?

36
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:29,567
Creative stifling.

37
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:32,920
I am crumbling under
the pressure of expectations.

38
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:35,409
You're Thom E. Gemcity.

39
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,658
Your photo's on the back cover.
I loved Deep Six.

40
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,003
Thanks.

41
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:41,062
Landon. Thank you.

42
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:43,354
Can't wait to see what happens next.

43
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:44,695
You and me both.

44
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:47,634
Two weeks until my deadline,
I'm stuck here in Chapter Seven.

45
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:48,992
Well, could be worse.

46
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,386
How's that?

47
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:51,928
Could be Chapter Six.

48
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:57,381
Okay, we got a half-caf percent latte
and a medium double decaf...

49
00:02:57,382 --> 00:02:58,453
McGee.

50
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:00,545
<i>- And there you go.
- Yeah.</i>

51
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:04,872
- The other job.
- Good luck.

52
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:09,518
Ferris Bueller's Day Off...

53
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,105
John Hughes masterpiece.

54
00:03:11,462 --> 00:03:14,134
Now, there's a guy who didn't have time
for writer's block, probie.

55
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:18,087
Sixteen Candles, Uncle Buck,
The Breakfast Club.

56
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:19,877
I do not have...

57
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:25,727
...I'm just struggling to find out the
most efficient way to tell my next story.

58
00:03:25,728 --> 00:03:28,253
Now, do you think Hughes writes
on a computer

59
00:03:28,254 --> 00:03:30,626
or does he use an old-fashioned
typewriter, like you?

60
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:34,273
Well, I'm sure he uses a computer, Tony.
Most writers do.

61
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:36,183
You ever consider converting?

62
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:39,241
I don't think that's the reason for my...

63
00:03:39,993 --> 00:03:42,071
Were you gonna say writer's block?

64
00:03:43,512 --> 00:03:44,748
I like my typewriter.

65
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:46,549
But it doesn't Iike you.

66
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:51,942
It's a classic tale of unrequited love
between a boy and his machine.

67
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:55,460
You can use that if you want.
But remember you got to have a love story.

68
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:57,043
I can see the poster already.

69
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,577
The house is leased to
Petty Officer Darren Cove.

70
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:03,795
No roommates, but according
to the neighbors, he's rarely alone.

71
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:07,103
I can tell. Got a fridge full of beer.

72
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:09,118
No hard alcohol.

73
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,334
Except for this.

74
00:04:12,612 --> 00:04:15,376
If smells could kill,
I think we just found our murder weapon.

75
00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:17,120
I'm more concerned
with where they came from.

76
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:20,145
Neighbors said this was
a notorious party house.

77
00:04:20,146 --> 00:04:22,196
Maybe someone brought in the mixers.

78
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:23,730
Then they left with them, too.

79
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:26,393
Seems like a lot of effort
for a couple of drinks.

80
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:28,157
Wasted effort.

81
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:30,503
The blood search at the Ping-Pong table.

82
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:32,338
Beer-pong.

83
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:36,875
This is tragic, don't tell me you've
never played beer-pong before, probie.

84
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:40,767
What did you do at MIT?

85
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:41,807
Studied.

86
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:44,775
That figures.
Beer-pong is a drinking game,

87
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:47,681
the object of which is
to take the Ping-Pong ball,

88
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,789
and try and get it
into the other team's cups.

89
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:54,813
Show me how it's done.

90
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,813
This is a crime scene, not a frat house.

91
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:01,607
You hearing voices, probie?

92
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,537
Figured you saw Gibbs coming.

93
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:09,078
I just don't think this is the time or
the place to showcase my beer-pong skills.

94
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:12,823
What?

95
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:14,686
Seems out of character.

96
00:05:15,443 --> 00:05:17,639
Yeah, yeah.

97
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,496
No, you may not use me
to get over your writer's block.

98
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:23,296
McGee has writer's block?
No, McGee does not.

99
00:05:24,274 --> 00:05:27,386
Just do what you did last time...
write about us.

100
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:30,646
Okay, I've told you guys a million times,
the book is not about you.

101
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:33,835
No, of course not...
it's about Special Agent Tommy.

102
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:35,689
And Officer Lisa.

103
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,922
DiNozzo!

104
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:38,291
And L.J. Tibbs.

105
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:46,149
Get this.

106
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,023
Looks like McGee wasn't
the only writer here today.

107
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:56,008
Bag it.

108
00:05:58,128 --> 00:06:02,129
Petty Officer Cove joined the Navy
three years ago, right out of high school.

109
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,089
His CO says he's a little immature,
but basically a good kid.

110
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,918
Good kid with a criminal record.

111
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,481
Since enlisting, he's been arrested
twice,both misdemeanors.

112
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:14,015
Public intox in '04,
and a noise ordinance violation last July.

113
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:16,778
"Works to live, and lives to party".

114
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,786
His... CO's words.

115
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:23,475
Guys in his command call him
Darren "Diddy" Cove.

116
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:25,300
Why?

117
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,063
It's a reference to Sean Diddy Combs.

118
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:29,880
The Puff Man, P Diddy.

119
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:32,587
Rap impresario. Went out with J-Lo.

120
00:06:34,154 --> 00:06:36,009
Petty Officer Cove was on duty yesterday.

121
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,278
Left the base at 1800,
hasn't been seen since.

122
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,654
And neither has his blue Ford Ranger.

123
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:42,540
Should be in his garage, but it's not.

124
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,194
Which means his attacker took it.

125
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,224
went Petty Officer Cove for a drive.

126
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:48,595
With that amount of blood loss,
it's doubtful he was conscious.

127
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:50,438
If it was all his blood.

128
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:54,937
Well, Abby'll tell us, because Cove's
blood sample is in his medical records.

129
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:59,827
I'm gonna go check the BOLO,
see if he's got a hit on the pickup.

130
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:01,216
That's not necessary, McGee.

131
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:04,452
Norfolk Police just found it
abandoned along Highway 5.

132
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:13,340
I've noticed oversized dice like these
in numerous vehicles.

133
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:15,039
Do they serve a purpose?

134
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:17,476
Hello?

135
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:18,529
Tony?

136
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:21,593
- What?
- Do they serve a purpose?

137
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:23,775
Fuzzy dice... pretty good
redneck indicator.

138
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,347
Other than that,
no, they don't serve a purpose.

139
00:07:26,348 --> 00:07:28,467
Got a lot more blood back here, boss.

140
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:30,529
Think this was used to cover the body?

141
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,132
Yeah.
Or bodies.

142
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,599
Yeah, Abs... I'm listening.

143
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:47,101
McGee, you look like you've seen a goat.

144
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:51,654
Ghost.
"Seen a ghost".

145
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:53,510
Yeah.

146
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:55,533
Do you know what déjà vu is?

147
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:58,546
Bien sûr. My French is
better than my English.

148
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:00,004
Right.

149
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:01,328
So...

150
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:02,351
What?

151
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:05,833
- The déjà vu.
- I can't place it.

152
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:14,604
By any chance, did you start
dating someone, McGee?

153
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:19,360
Dating? Please, I spend every spare
minute I have writing.

154
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:21,284
Hang on a second.
McGee.

155
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:24,233
Get this towed back to
lockup. Yeah, go on, Abs.

156
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:25,857
Abby's got something.

157
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,695
Watch out! It's Halloween at Coyote
Ugly, Piper Perabo.

158
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:44,474
Oh, if you like that one,
you're gonna love this.

159
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:46,655
It's a, uh, it's a Sciuto original.

160
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,775
I like to call it "Bottoms Up".

161
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:52,952
I had no idea you were a bartender, Abby.

162
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:55,213
Well, my Uncle Teddy used to own
a bar on Canal Street,

163
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:57,409
and I used to bartend there
on the weekends.

164
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:01,424
The case, Abby?

165
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:05,934
But, Gibbs, you haven't even
seen my famous Fire Bomb.

166
00:09:09,288 --> 00:09:10,430
It can wait.

167
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:14,035
So, uh, I tested the blood that was
in Petty Officer Cove's house.

168
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:16,722
Most of it was his,
but one sample did not match.

169
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,412
It could've been from a prior accident or
an altercation at one of his parties.

170
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:23,462
- Or it could be the killer's.
- I also ran...

171
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:26,529
the prints from our mystery cocktails.

172
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,912
One half of our drinking duo
was definitely Petty Officer Cove.

173
00:09:29,913 --> 00:09:32,912
- The other half?
- Well, it's a work in progress, Gibbs.

174
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:34,954
Tell me you have more than this, Abby.

175
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:38,014
Have I ever let you down?
Don't answer that.

176
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:42,349
I'm using my mass spectrometer
to break down the molecular structure

177
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,042
of the cocktails in question.

178
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:46,946
- Guessing that's where all these come in.
- Well, you guessed correctly.

179
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:51,713
I think I've made over 100
delightful beverages trying to find...

180
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:54,480
the match.

181
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:58,263
The weirding is, this baby isn't in
any bartending guide anywhere.

182
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,399
It's made out of Jagermeister...

183
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,140
Cherry soda, vanilla vodka,
lemon juice and a splash of Tabasco.

184
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:08,373
It's called a "Hairy Hangover. "

185
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,835
And you came to know this how, McGee?

186
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:14,572
I created it.

187
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:20,087
Our missing petty officer is
a character in my next book.

188
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:32,793
"Cameron Meyer is a good old boy
from Northern Virginia.

189
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:35,415
"He was born with not much,
raised with even less.

190
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,168
"All he wants out of life is
a good girl and a great truck.

191
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:40,009
"As of yesterday, he's halfway there.

192
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,949
"He dropped his life savings
on a blue Ford Ranger".

193
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,845
- That's it?
- Tony, it's all here.

194
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,035
The fuzzy dice, the cinnamon rolls,
red track jacket.

195
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:52,260
Petty Officer Cove is Cameron Meyer.

196
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,711
But how is that possible, McGee?

197
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:02,604
My writing isn't entirely fiction. Okay.

198
00:11:02,605 --> 00:11:07,014
My stories are, but sometimes
I base my characters on people I...

199
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:08,295
Work with.

200
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:11,230
See. People I see.

201
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,245
You've seen Petty Officer Cove before?

202
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:15,064
Every morning at my coffee shop.

203
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:17,245
But how come you didn't
recognize his photograph?

204
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:18,733
He only uses the drive-through.

205
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:22,331
To me, he's just the large coffee with
acinnamon roll guy in the blue pickup.

206
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:23,504
I never saw his face.

207
00:11:23,505 --> 00:11:25,609
Whoa, whoa, wait-wait a minute. Back up.

208
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,044
Your coffee shop has a drive-through?

209
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:29,868
That's... That's not important.

210
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:32,899
Just because you based your character
on a person who is missing,

211
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,854
does not necessarily mean
the two of them are related, McGee.

212
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:37,283
Yeah, it does.

213
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:39,283
You created the drink.

214
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:40,862
Made it up about a month ago.

215
00:11:40,863 --> 00:11:45,430
How did two glasses of it get from your
head to inside Petty Officer Cove's house?

216
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:46,874
Someone's read your book.

217
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,934
Your papers under lock and key?

218
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:53,514
Well, I sent my publisher a copy
a couple weeks ago, but,

219
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:55,675
- you know, I'm sure she...
- Address.

220
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:03,974
Boss, there's more.

221
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:07,429
After Deep Six hit the stores,

222
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,271
my publishing firm received a ton
of e-mails addressed to Thom E. Gemcity.

223
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:14,181
Tons?

224
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:24,074
Most of them are autograph requests
or feedback on the novel,

225
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:27,086
but in the last couple weeks,
my publisher says that we've gotten

226
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:29,627
some really weird letters,
borderline obsessive.

227
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:32,289
I didn't say anything because
I assumed they were harmless.

228
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,837
DiNozzo, with me.

229
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:36,626
McGee, you stay here with Ziva.
Start going through your book.

230
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:39,634
- What exactly am I looking for?
- Answers, McGee.

231
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,043
Miss Crawshaw will be with you shortly.

232
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:50,774
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

233
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:53,618
Is there anything else
I can get you while you wait?

234
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:55,939
- Yeah, a barf bag.
- I'm sorry.

235
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,043
<i>Todd,</i>

236
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,642
black tea, lemon, crab salad,

237
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:02,364
arugula.

238
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:05,526
You're Timothy's people.

239
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:08,605
A few weeks ago,
he sent you a draft of his next book?

240
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,431
Partial. It wasn't finished yet

241
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:12,581
Yeah, it still isn't, is it?

242
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:14,550
How many of your people
here have read the book?

243
00:13:14,638 --> 00:13:15,686
Zero.

244
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:20,343
No one in my agency has access to advance
material without the writer's consent.

245
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,310
Except you.

246
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:29,361
Writers are notoriously insecure.
Soft, even.

247
00:13:29,362 --> 00:13:32,573
Well, thatoesn't sound
like our little Timmy McGee, does it?

248
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:38,248
Whether they ask for it or not, I provide
coddling, prodding, protection.

249
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:42,552
Anything it takes to keep those elusive
muses singing.

250
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:44,143
Agent...?

251
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:45,374
Gibbs.

252
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,727
Here we go. Rock Hollow:

253
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,347
The Continuing Adventures of L.J. Tibbs.

254
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:54,850
How is this connected
with your investigation?

255
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:58,027
A person's missing. We believe
it's related to the contents of that book.

256
00:13:59,457 --> 00:14:02,012
Guess I just made myself
your prime suspect.

257
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:03,363
Sounds about right.

258
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:08,118
I may be the only one in the firm
who's read it, Agent Gibbs, but

259
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:11,188
I can guarantee you I'm not
the only one in the city.

260
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:14,786
McGee hasn't given the book
to anyone else, Miss Crawshaw.

261
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:19,722
Obsessed fans always find a way
to get material early.

262
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:22,252
They dig through trash, hack computers,

263
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:24,276
anything short of writing it themselves.

264
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:28,054
And believe me, Timothy has some
of the craziest fans I've ever seen.

265
00:14:28,055 --> 00:14:29,394
Yeah, we know about the letters.

266
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:32,437
Yeah, there are three that stand out.
Todd, bring me those three...

267
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,064
Gemcity letters?

268
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:35,422
No return addresses.

269
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:37,620
Each one's stranger than the last.

270
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:41,184
I bet the psychopath you're looking for
is somewhere in that envelope.

271
00:14:41,226 --> 00:14:43,337
What makes you think
we're looking for a psychopath?

272
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,091
Don't you read crime novels?

273
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:48,383
There are always psychopaths.

274
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:54,016
"I am sending this letter
to express my gratitude

275
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:56,959
"for the literary gift
you've given me.

276
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,746
"The majesty of your
writing is far beyond

277
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:01,809
anything this planet
has ever seen".

278
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,212
A rave review.

279
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:04,839
Rave, indeed, Jethro.

280
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,051
Yeah. In fact, it's quite possible
that Michael

281
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:10,809
is Timothy's greatest admirer.

282
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,215
Admirer, or stalker, Duck?

283
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:18,048
At this point, I'd say he is no immediate
threat to himself or anyone else.

284
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,052
At this point?

285
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:22,443
Well, one does not become
a predatory stalker overnight, Jethro.

286
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:25,470
The mind typically goes through
three stages.

287
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:28,859
This letter, strange as it may seem, is
only at stage one...

288
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,811
the attraction stage.

289
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:31,870
And the other two?

290
00:15:31,873 --> 00:15:36,882
Well, on the surface this letter,
written by Andrew,

291
00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:38,470
would appear more normal,

292
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,286
but phrases like
"I breathe for your words"

293
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:43,814
and "you need me", might suggest...

294
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:45,375
Otherwise.

295
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,966
Yeah, because of that
sense of desperation,

296
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:52,384
I categorized that letter as stage two...

297
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,874
obsession.

298
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,069
What's stage three?

299
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,220
Well, read for yourself.

300
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:03,614
"I know you think of me often,
just as I think of you.

301
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:06,561
Please don't make me
do something we'll both regret".

302
00:16:06,562 --> 00:16:10,314
Now, that letter as an aggressive,
and threatening tone.

303
00:16:10,315 --> 00:16:13,824
For that reason,
it falls into the final stage...

304
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:16,286
destruction.

305
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:18,690
Three letters. Three stages.

306
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:22,003
I know what you're thinking, Jethro,
but it's no coincidence.

307
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:24,751
Although the letters may
appear to be very different,

308
00:16:24,752 --> 00:16:28,205
the writing style is
nearly identical in all three.

309
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,653
The same person wrote all three.

310
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:34,219
And judging by the postmarks, the letters
were written and sent over

311
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,639
a period of several weeks.
During which time,

312
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:40,597
the writer became increasingly delusional.

313
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:41,753
Motive?

314
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:43,127
I can't say for certain,

315
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,440
but I'd say the answers can be
found in Timothy's new book.

316
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:48,184
The writer believes

317
00:16:48,185 --> 00:16:52,669
that Timothy's fiction is very much real.

318
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:09,290
Tony, you about...

319
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
Done.

320
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:19,415
So?

321
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:20,724
I'm confused.

322
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:23,817
This isn't a critique, okay?

323
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:26,170
We're trying to find
something useful...

324
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:28,009
Confused by what?

325
00:17:29,557 --> 00:17:32,458
The plot, the back story,

326
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:34,234
pretty much everything.

327
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:36,201
The whole thing doesn't make sense.

328
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:38,706
Ziva, what about you?

329
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,062
Not as confused as Tony.

330
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,432
Well, I haven't finished it yet.
It's just a rough draft.

331
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:46,509
Very rough.

332
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,068
I'm sorry, McGee.

333
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,821
Who's the killer, anyway?

334
00:17:50,822 --> 00:17:51,987
I don't know yet.

335
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:55,298
It's your problem,
I mean you always have to know

336
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:58,382
It's your problem where your story
is going. That's Fiction Writing 101.

337
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:00,165
Not the way I choose to write, Tony.

338
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,821
And he wonders why he has writer's block.

339
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:04,763
Can we focus on the problem here?

340
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:08,132
We've got a missing person
and our only lead is my book.

341
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:09,782
Well, that's not much of a lead.

342
00:18:09,783 --> 00:18:12,159
She's right. We don't even know
how the book factors in.

343
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,635
We do now.

344
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:15,883
The letters were written
by the same person.

345
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,945
He thinks the book is real.

346
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:21,027
And believes Petty Officer Cove
is a part of it.

347
00:18:21,028 --> 00:18:24,903
It means we're going to have to go
everywhere he's been.

348
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:28,351
Well, we've already done that, though.
His home, work, hang out spots.

349
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:30,822
I'm not talking about Petty Officer Cove.

350
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:34,592
I'm talking aboutyour good old boy...
with the pickup truck.

351
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:36,884
Cameron Meyer.

352
00:18:37,295 --> 00:18:40,097
High Side Creek, where Cameron
goes to clear his head.

353
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:43,267
Thematically, this location
is very important, boss.

354
00:18:43,268 --> 00:18:45,419
You've been saying the same thing
all morning, McGee.

355
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,420
Spread out.

356
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:49,032
Why would Cameron come
to a picnic area to think?

357
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:52,219
In his book, it's not a picnic area.
It's his favorite fishing hole.

358
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,072
- Thank you, Ziva.
- Don't you think it's kind of a cliché

359
00:18:55,073 --> 00:18:59,947
to have your character alone,
staring into the serene wilderness?

360
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:02,771
No. If it was, I wouldn't
have written it, Tony.

361
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:05,224
I mean, knowing Cameron, if he
was bummed out,

362
00:19:05,225 --> 00:19:09,272
wouldn't he just go to the Wing Shack with
his buddies, and toss back a few brews?

363
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,917
Or talk to a priest?

364
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:13,960
Don't forget that he's very religious,
now that his father died.

365
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:15,014
Good point.

366
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:16,336
No, it isn't.

367
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:19,382
Cameron keeps his emotions bottled up.

368
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:23,071
When he's upset, he comes here.
Afterwards, he always feels better.

369
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:24,685
Not always.

370
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:38,511
That's him.

371
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,412
That's Petty Officer Cove.

372
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,619
Then who is this?!

373
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:55,563
That's Jared Brenner.

374
00:19:58,006 --> 00:20:00,468
That's another character from my book.

375
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:13,289
Two bodies, both with nearly identical

376
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,799
stab wounds in the chest and abdomen.

377
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,627
It appears that Petty Officer Cove
may have put up a bit of a struggle.

378
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:25,162
Note the remnants of skin tissue
and blood under the fingernails.

379
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:29,736
Both men have been deceased
for less than 24 hours.

380
00:20:29,768 --> 00:20:31,511
That is not all they have
in commun, Ducky.

381
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:34,454
They're also both characters
in McGeek's next book.

382
00:20:34,455 --> 00:20:37,893
Yes. From what I hear, Timothy,
in your next novel,

383
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:40,893
L.J. Tibbs has a love interest.

384
00:20:41,502 --> 00:20:44,304
Yes. I hear that it's an Army...

385
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:46,539
Ducky, I don't think we need
to talk about that.

386
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,645
Army what?

387
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:49,400
McGee?

388
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,254
Lieutenant.

389
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,816
Colonel.

390
00:20:57,722 --> 00:20:59,023
Lieutenant colonel.

391
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:02,540
You got a murder weapon, Duck?

392
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,252
Yes, well, that's where
things get interesting, Jethro.

393
00:21:05,253 --> 00:21:09,738
Cove wounds are circular,
about one inch in diameter.

394
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,042
- Javelin.
- Javelin.

395
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:12,696
Chapter Four.

396
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:14,709
My characters Cameron
Meyer and Jared Brenner...

397
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,811
they murder a convenience store clerk
to cover up an extortion.

398
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:19,693
Javelin. Believe it or not.

399
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:23,489
That is for what they were
originally intended, Anthony.

400
00:21:23,857 --> 00:21:26,065
A javelin as a modern-day murder weapon.

401
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:29,475
I applaud your creativity, McGee.

402
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:34,851
Of course, well...
given the circumstances...

403
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:38,773
Oh, dear.

404
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,557
Now I'm gonna have to read his new book.

405
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:47,032
Petty Officer Darren Cove
and Adrian Corbett, the inspiration

406
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:51,239
behind two of McGee's characters:
Cameron Meyer and Jared Brenner.

407
00:21:51,536 --> 00:21:53,474
- Any other connection?
- Not that we've found.

408
00:21:53,475 --> 00:21:56,104
Corbett worked as a valet
at Alfonso's Steakhouse.

409
00:21:56,118 --> 00:21:57,515
Your favorite.

410
00:21:57,798 --> 00:21:59,273
That's how I got to know him.

411
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:02,397
For my book, I borrowed his physical
details... the nose ring,

412
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:04,525
birthmark on the face and the neck.

413
00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:06,144
What was his job?

414
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,125
Valet at a steakhouse.

415
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,026
But I did change the name
of the restaurant.

416
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:12,080
From Alfonso's to Alfredo's.

417
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,584
Don't need to be Sherlock
Holmes to figure that one out.

418
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,613
The note from Petty
Officer Cove's apartment.

419
00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:19,613
"One down, two to go".
Means the killer's not finished.

420
00:22:20,113 --> 00:22:22,958
How many more of your characters
did you base on real people?

421
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:30,098
How many?

422
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:33,947
Just the team.

423
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:36,729
You. Tony, Ziva, everyone.

424
00:22:37,677 --> 00:22:39,849
You happy, Tony?
I finally admitted it.

425
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,680
- I based both my novels on you.
- That means we're all potential targets.

426
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:44,534
- Boss, I'm sorry.
- Ducky, Abby, Palmer...

427
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:47,276
24-hour security detail
until we find this psycho.

428
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:50,339
27 javelins sold in the DC area
in the past six months.

429
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,281
21 were paid for by credit cards,

430
00:22:52,716 --> 00:22:54,499
all by track coaches
and athletic directors.

431
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,901
What about the last six?

432
00:22:55,902 --> 00:22:57,620
Cash transactions.

433
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:01,101
<i>- Yeah. Gibbs.
-  Got them for you, Gibbs.</i>

434
00:23:01,107 --> 00:23:03,445
Got it, Abs. We'll be right down.
Go, go.

435
00:23:04,987 --> 00:23:06,289
Not you.

436
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:10,141
Two men are dead because of me, boss.

437
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:11,747
You got a javelin, McGee?

438
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,742
No, but I own a typewriter.

439
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,467
It's a typewriter, not a shotgun.

440
00:23:17,468 --> 00:23:21,854
It cost two men their lives because
I based my fictional book on real people.

441
00:23:22,137 --> 00:23:23,276
Then put these on.

442
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:27,466
You just confessed, right?

443
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:28,703
Not exactly.

444
00:23:29,071 --> 00:23:30,778
There's no mid ground, McGee.

445
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:33,654
You either put on the cuffs
or you find who's responsible.

446
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:35,764
- How?
- This guy's inside your head.

447
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,031
- You get inside his!
- Boss, it's not that simple.

448
00:23:38,032 --> 00:23:40,895
- I still don't even know what my story is.
- You figure it out, McGee!

449
00:23:42,692 --> 00:23:46,269
You write the ending to this
or the killer will!

450
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:53,343
Well, McGee feels bad enough.

451
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,696
Only makes it worse that he admitted it.

452
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,844
It was no secret he was writing about us.

453
00:23:57,845 --> 00:23:59,532
Oh, come on. It's not about us.

454
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:02,282
I mean, the whole part about Lisa and her
broken heart.

455
00:24:02,636 --> 00:24:06,005
The moment she keeps from her relationship
that never had a chance to happen.

456
00:24:06,006 --> 00:24:09,474
Yeah, whe's he getting that?
Or the scene between Lisa and Tommy

457
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:13,188
where they pool out their hearts
to each other and spill their secrets?

458
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:17,869
When he tries to explain the profound
nature of his identity crise.

459
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,507
Yeah. I mean, the hidden struggle
between who he is and what he's becoming.

460
00:24:21,511 --> 00:24:23,515
- I don't even know what that is.
- Yeah, totally unrealistic.

461
00:24:23,516 --> 00:24:25,104
Would never happen.

462
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,270
What do you got, Abs?

463
00:24:31,657 --> 00:24:32,845
Three hours sleep.

464
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:34,533
My apartment flooded last night.

465
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:37,859
Did you know tt trying to flush voodoo
dolls down the toilet is a bad idea?

466
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,118
I do now.

467
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:41,983
- Where's Gibbs?
- He's chomping up McGee.

468
00:24:42,238 --> 00:24:43,412
Chewing.

469
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:47,678
So a little birdie told me
that both of you

470
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,829
have read the first half of
McGee's new book.

471
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:51,760
A little birdie?

472
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:55,991
And don't even ask because I will not
reveal my source even if you torture me.

473
00:24:56,147 --> 00:24:57,803
- Ducky?
- Yes!

474
00:24:57,804 --> 00:24:59,981
All right, let's hear it.

475
00:24:59,982 --> 00:25:01,274
Hear what?

476
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:03,879
The book. At the end of Deep Six,

477
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,785
goth forensic specialist "Amy Sutton",

478
00:25:06,786 --> 00:25:09,949
she broke up with her boyfriend because
she was digging somebody else.

479
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:12,468
Who's the somebody else?

480
00:25:13,274 --> 00:25:14,274
Oh, yeah...

481
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,882
Yeah, that part really didn't come up yet.

482
00:25:18,147 --> 00:25:20,687
Yeah, I think he's planning
on revealing it,

483
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:23,569
you know, the second part of the book.

484
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:26,751
You guys are so lying.

485
00:25:28,473 --> 00:25:29,780
He's gay!

486
00:25:30,813 --> 00:25:32,610
The somebody else! I had a feeling

487
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:35,926
'cause Amy always wants
what Amy cannot have.

488
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,415
- Does she know?
- Know what?

489
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:41,382
Forensic specialist Amy,
she fell in love with a gay guy, Gibbs.

490
00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:43,280
- That why I'm here?
- No.

491
00:25:43,478 --> 00:25:45,374
Then Amy's on her own.

492
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:47,186
We'll talk later.

493
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,177
I ran the blood samples that
we pulled off the two bodies.

494
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:54,939
Petty Officer Cove had unidentified
blood on his right forearm and hand.

495
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,038
It matched the blood from his house.

496
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,303
Our killer's DNA.

497
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:01,204
I'm no investigator,
but odds a you're right.

498
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:03,412
- That's good work, Abs.
- I also checked

499
00:26:03,413 --> 00:26:09,032
Petty Officer Cove's Gord Ranger and
Thom E. Gemcity's c-mail for prints.

500
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:12,048
- C- mail?
- Yeah, it's like cuckoo mail.

501
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:15,137
No, no, no, I just made it up.
Nothing on the truck.

502
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:17,796
All the latent prints
belong to Petty Officer Cove.

503
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:20,605
But on the c-mail,
there's dozens of different prints.

504
00:26:20,606 --> 00:26:24,227
Well, that makes sense 'cause paper mail
gets processed through post offices,

505
00:26:24,228 --> 00:26:26,250
- delivery trucks, mailrooms.
- Exactly.

506
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:31,508
The's still one spot that only the
sender touches.

507
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:34,922
The back of the stamp. You pulled a print?

508
00:26:34,923 --> 00:26:38,405
Not only did I pull a print,
I already got a match.

509
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,139
Todd Ryder, arrested last year
for possession of marijuana.

510
00:27:16,597 --> 00:27:18,706
Looking for something Timothy?

511
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,543
I'm just looking.

512
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,628
Petty Officer Cove...

513
00:27:27,597 --> 00:27:29,268
.. wasn't just a partier.

514
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:31,304
I called his elderly parents.

515
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:33,913
Visited them every day for two hours.

516
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,858
This guy,

517
00:27:38,244 --> 00:27:39,829
Adrian Corbett,

518
00:27:40,848 --> 00:27:42,596
he just got married.

519
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,050
Yes,

520
00:27:45,596 --> 00:27:47,673
I took off his wedding ring.

521
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:52,610
Not quite the notorious playboy
I made him out to be?

522
00:27:52,611 --> 00:27:54,316
Appearances can be deceptive.

523
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:57,355
Every single word I wrote was wrong.

524
00:27:57,615 --> 00:27:59,895
No, every word you wrote was fiction.

525
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,094
That's why they call them "characters".

526
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:05,586
But they are not just
characters in a book.

527
00:28:05,987 --> 00:28:07,281
They're real people...

528
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,703
and real families.

529
00:28:12,176 --> 00:28:13,176
Were.

530
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,456
I sympathize with the way
you feel, Timothy...

531
00:28:26,262 --> 00:28:29,141
...but you are not to blame
for any of this.

532
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,177
Tell them that.

533
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:42,871
Todd!

534
00:28:44,697 --> 00:28:45,990
Oh, God.

535
00:28:47,668 --> 00:28:48,716
Look out!

536
00:28:48,717 --> 00:28:50,053
What do you call that?

537
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:51,234
Running, I think.

538
00:28:55,337 --> 00:28:57,035
Todd! Hey!

539
00:28:58,535 --> 00:28:59,616
Where's his car?

540
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:02,157
Where's his car?!

541
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:04,150
Employee lot around back.

542
00:29:05,213 --> 00:29:07,738
Get out of the building!
They know!

543
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:09,108
They're chasing me!

544
00:29:13,215 --> 00:29:14,842
You should've left the top down.

545
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:17,800
Put your hands on top
of your head.

546
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:21,939
Nice of you to join us, DiNozzo.

547
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:25,419
I thought I was gaining ground.

548
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,598
He got a very unorthodox running style.

549
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,492
It's very effective, though.

550
00:29:29,493 --> 00:29:31,016
Not effective enough.

551
00:29:31,624 --> 00:29:33,138
I didn't want to do it.

552
00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:35,204
I told her it was a bad idea.

553
00:29:43,775 --> 00:29:45,280
I actually trusted her.

554
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:47,329
There was no way you could have
known, McGee.

555
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,904
Ziva's right, probie, it's not your fault.

556
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:53,532
But if you evenn think  about writing
a third novel, I'll kill you.

557
00:29:53,815 --> 00:29:56,618
When Abby finds out who her character
really fell in love with,

558
00:29:57,057 --> 00:29:58,911
you will already be dead.

559
00:30:02,785 --> 00:30:06,125
I have been sitting here
half the night, Agent Gibbs.

560
00:30:06,635 --> 00:30:08,106
What am I beg charged with?

561
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:10,438
Tampering with a federal investigation.

562
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:12,679
That's ridiculous. I've answered
every question you've asked.

563
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,806
Resisting arrest.

564
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:16,667
I told you already, I wasn't running.

565
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:18,599
I was late for an appointment.

566
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,684
And murder.

567
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,259
You think I murdered someone.

568
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:30,366
Their names are Petty Officer Darren Cove
and Adrian Corbett.

569
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,115
Never heard of them.

570
00:30:32,824 --> 00:30:33,828
Okay.

571
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:38,236
Well, how about Cameron Meyer and
Jared Brenner?

572
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:40,730
- Have you heard of them?
- I think so.

573
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,332
They're characters in Tim's next book.

574
00:30:45,294 --> 00:30:46,950
A book someone is killing over.

575
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:48,585
Too bad you can't find them.

576
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:50,060
I think we have.

577
00:30:51,844 --> 00:30:54,074
- You wrote the letters.
- What?! Why would I...?

578
00:30:54,075 --> 00:30:55,503
Todd gave you up.

579
00:30:55,815 --> 00:31:00,209
He said you told him to mail the letters
back to the agency.

580
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:06,803
Well, I can explain.

581
00:31:06,804 --> 00:31:09,265
Well, I sure hope so.

582
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:13,364
I wrote the letters, but only
to create a bigger buzz.

583
00:31:13,365 --> 00:31:16,717
Stalkers mean more press.
More press means increased revenue.

584
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,694
You made up a stalker to sell more books?

585
00:31:20,949 --> 00:31:22,312
Yes, I did.

586
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:25,440
She's lying.

587
00:31:25,873 --> 00:31:27,820
If she is, she's quite good.

588
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:30,777
She publishes fictional novels
for a living, Ziva.

589
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:32,716
She knows how to tell a good story.

590
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:34,853
I'm with Ziva.

591
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:37,558
This woman lives to sell books.

592
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,374
Look, it may sound unorthodox,
but I do one interview

593
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:43,154
about those letters and Gemcity's book
sales jump to the roof.

594
00:31:43,155 --> 00:31:44,632
I didn't think he needed that help.

595
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:47,859
Well, there's no such thing
as enough sales.

596
00:31:49,585 --> 00:31:54,263
What I did might be wrong, but there's
no way I could ever kill anyone.

597
00:31:57,204 --> 00:31:58,973
Why should I believe you?

598
00:31:58,974 --> 00:32:02,496
Those letters were
a strategic business move.

599
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:06,317
I would do anything to help
my client sell more books.

600
00:32:07,406 --> 00:32:08,822
Anything.

601
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:13,413
Well played, boss.
You get her in round two?

602
00:32:13,823 --> 00:32:15,931
I won't be a round two, DiNozzo.

603
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:18,364
- She didn't break.
- I know. I was there.

604
00:32:18,365 --> 00:32:20,104
She didn't do it, did she?

605
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,378
She's your publisher. You tell me.

606
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:24,886
I think she's telling the truth.

607
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:26,303
That makes two of us.

608
00:32:26,304 --> 00:32:30,871
I compared Crawhaw's DNA to the mystery
blood pulled off of Petty Officer Cove.

609
00:32:31,098 --> 00:32:32,343
She did not do it.

610
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:42,689
I read this a thounsand time and
I have come up with nothing.

611
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:45,701
Then maybe we should spitball
ideas and see what sticks.

612
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:50,053
What? Did I say it wrong?

613
00:32:50,054 --> 00:32:51,482
No, you got that right.

614
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:54,218
No, that's good.
So start with what we know.

615
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:55,830
Campfire.

616
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,056
Well, we know there's
killer on the loose.

617
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:02,055
One down, two to go.
And he's already killed number two.

618
00:33:02,056 --> 00:33:06,393
In your book, Cameron Meyer and Jared
Brenneronly have two things in common.

619
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,179
They extorted money and both murded
a convenience store clerk.

620
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,669
Maybe the killer was seeking
revenge for the clerk's death.

621
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,883
No. The clerk's a throway character.
I didn't even bother to name him.

622
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:18,019
Besides, the stalker letters are fake, so
we don't even know that he's delusional.

623
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,050
He murdered two characters
from a work of fiction, McGee.

624
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:23,683
Ok, so he's probably delusional,

625
00:33:23,684 --> 00:33:25,382
but that doesn't mean
he's looking for revenge.

626
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,006
You've got to have a motive, probie.

627
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:29,529
Well, I am not convinced that
the answer is in my book, Tony.

628
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:32,289
Maybe the answer is in
how he got the book.

629
00:33:32,671 --> 00:33:34,189
He dinitely didn't get it from Crawshaw.

630
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,508
She'd never do anything
to jeopardize sales.

631
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:38,156
It means he got it from you.

632
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,789
- But I keep everything locked up.
- It wasn't a question.

633
00:33:41,048 --> 00:33:43,369
It's you or Crawshaw.

634
00:33:44,048 --> 00:33:47,079
Trust your instincts, Tim.
They're usually right.

635
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,480
Take the lead on this one.
All we can do is assist.

636
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:51,602
Okay.

637
00:33:53,612 --> 00:33:54,899
From the beginning...

638
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:58,009
page one.

639
00:34:03,014 --> 00:34:06,956
I'd say we played that one nicely, boss.
The whole good guy, bad guy technique.

640
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:08,385
- DiNozzo.
- Yeah?

641
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:10,026
Assist.

642
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,436
Hold the elevator!

643
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,203
I am using muscle
I didn't even know I had.

644
00:34:24,204 --> 00:34:26,499
No wonder you only got to chapter six.

645
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:28,765
Chapter seven.

646
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:37,197
It's jazz.
Helps me clear my mind.

647
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:39,560
Coltrane is jazz, McGee.

648
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:44,177
This is a soundtrack to a bad '70s porno
shot in the San Fernando Valley.

649
00:34:44,178 --> 00:34:47,234
I'm just trying to reenact every detail
of my writing process here, okay?

650
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:50,720
I'm sorry, did you say something?
My ears are bleeding and I can't...

651
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:52,387
I can't...

652
00:34:53,055 --> 00:34:54,228
Thank you.

653
00:34:54,229 --> 00:34:56,248
I'm trying to show you what
I do when I get stuck.

654
00:34:56,249 --> 00:34:57,826
Blocked.
Whatever.

655
00:34:58,336 --> 00:34:59,510
Up. Come on.

656
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:00,996
- I'm in the middle.
- Up.

657
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:05,946
Okay.

658
00:35:06,526 --> 00:35:10,489
Now, sometimes when I'm in trouble,
I take a few minutes to free write.

659
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:12,425
Free write?

660
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:14,614
Stream of consciousness.

661
00:35:14,977 --> 00:35:18,550
About my characters, my story arcs,
my possible plotines,

662
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,910
- everything... no filter.
- No filter...

663
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:23,499
Whatever pops in my head
goes right to the page.

664
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:27,009
Write... be free.
Just do it.

665
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:28,933
Free write!

666
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:30,768
Be free...

667
00:35:31,925 --> 00:35:33,014
I get it.

668
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:36,807
If I like it, I put it in my binder.

669
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:38,768
If not...

670
00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:43,474
You always use your shredder?

671
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,516
Always.

672
00:35:46,046 --> 00:35:49,443
You ever just take a stack of pages
and toss it in the trash?

673
00:35:49,444 --> 00:35:52,101
-  Never.
- You ever misplaced a binder or

674
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:53,768
lost a copy of a book?

675
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:55,444
No and no.

676
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,764
The only way the killer got my book

677
00:35:57,765 --> 00:36:01,353
is if he broke into my apartment,
made a copy and returned the original.

678
00:36:01,354 --> 00:36:03,631
I'm a federal investigator
so I'm sure I would know

679
00:36:03,632 --> 00:36:06,348
if someone was trying
to break into my place.

680
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:08,994
We're missing something.

681
00:36:09,475 --> 00:36:10,801
While we are trying to figure it out,

682
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:13,537
he is planning on how
to kill his next victim.

683
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:16,042
Or he's already killed them.

684
00:36:17,206 --> 00:36:19,735
Sorry. I was just free thinking.

685
00:36:21,673 --> 00:36:25,771
It's like he's here in the room with me
looking over my shoulder as I write.

686
00:36:25,772 --> 00:36:26,772
Type.

687
00:36:29,414 --> 00:36:32,816
'Cause technically, what you do is type.
You don't really write. That would be...

688
00:36:33,283 --> 00:36:34,619
I type.

689
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,815
That's how he does it.

690
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,049
Looked over your shoulder?

691
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:43,285
I type.

692
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,506
Tony, I type!

693
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:49,369
Boss, I got it.

694
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,671
Film?

695
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:52,332
It's from my typewriter.

696
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,056
- Typewriter ribbons.
- It's how the killer read my book.

697
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:58,563
- Well, where did he get theibbons?
- Trash.

698
00:36:58,673 --> 00:37:01,051
The killer must have picked
them out of McGee's Dumpster.

699
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:04,153
Means he had access
o all my notes and my ideas.

700
00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:07,091
Which means the murdersmay not be based
on just the book.

701
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:09,893
All these pages are a product
of my free writing.

702
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,838
- Free writing?
- I'll explain it later.

703
00:37:11,948 --> 00:37:14,323
And one of my many possible endings
involved Cameron Meyer

704
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:16,367
and Jared Brenner killing me...

705
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:19,769
Agent McGregor.
It's a character I based on myself.

706
00:37:19,878 --> 00:37:23,421
If the killer's confusing fiction
with reality, then you've got a motive.

707
00:37:23,544 --> 00:37:24,897
He's protecting you.

708
00:37:25,512 --> 00:37:28,218
He's already killed two of the
characters... who's the third?

709
00:37:29,188 --> 00:37:30,729
I haven't decided yet, but

710
00:37:30,835 --> 00:37:34,392
Meyer and Enner are the only characters
that wanted me... McGregor... dead.

711
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:36,210
Then why does he think
there are three?

712
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,791
I don't know. I decided it
would be stupid to kill McGregor.

713
00:37:38,955 --> 00:37:41,306
- Everyone likes him too much.
- Well, not everyone.

714
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:43,865
"Forensic Specialist Amy
Sutton offered her heart

715
00:37:43,984 --> 00:37:45,568
"to Agent MsGregor,
only to be rejected.

716
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:47,832
"Using sign language,
she tells her deaf mother

717
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:50,269
"that she can't live without him.

718
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:51,994
He's going to have to go".

719
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:55,501
Yeah, "go", as in leave the agency.
Not "go" as in go.

720
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,725
Does the killer know that?

721
00:37:58,701 --> 00:37:59,777
Abby?

722
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:01,681
She's not answering her cellphone.

723
00:38:01,804 --> 00:38:02,945
Security detail.

724
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:05,503
Shift change. They just arrived
on duty outside her apartment.

725
00:38:05,504 --> 00:38:07,250
- She's gone.
- She's not answering

726
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,110
-  her home phone either, Gibbs.
- Send them in.

727
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:10,408
Secure the apartment.

728
00:38:10,545 --> 00:38:12,898
No, she's not there.
Her apartment's flooded.

729
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:14,783
She's staying with Sister
Rosita and the girls.

730
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,936
Sister Rosita?

731
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:17,548
From her bowling team.

732
00:38:17,674 --> 00:38:18,973
The bowling nuns.

733
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:49,080
Hi, Amy.

734
00:38:51,222 --> 00:38:53,537
- Still no answer.
- Call again, McGee.

735
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,046
I can't believe I let this happen.

736
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,008
Abby knows how to take
care of herself, McGee.

737
00:38:57,118 --> 00:38:59,231
And she's got a crew
of nuns watching herback.

738
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,281
Nuns are on a spiritual
retreat. She's on her own.

739
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:07,292
Are you...
here to see someone?

740
00:39:09,356 --> 00:39:12,185
I'm... because the sisters,
they're gone...

741
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:14,180
for a minute.

742
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:18,350
They went to the church and
they shod be back any time.

743
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,083
If you were smart...

744
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:24,770
you would've just
let him go, Amy.

745
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,313
My name's Abby.

746
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:31,877
I know rejection is hard.

747
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,925
But let's face it, you're not
good enough for him anyway.

748
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:41,230
Good enough for who?

749
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:44,305
Special Agent McGregor.

750
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:52,327
You two take the back.
McGee, you're with me.

751
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:58,078
I'm sure there's some sort
of communication problem here.

752
00:39:58,207 --> 00:40:00,225
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.

753
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:05,566
I know what you said.

754
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:07,876
That makes one of us.

755
00:40:09,352 --> 00:40:11,232
How were you planning
to do it?

756
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,845
Do what?

757
00:40:13,343 --> 00:40:14,536
Kill him.

758
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:16,706
Was it poison?

759
00:40:17,102 --> 00:40:19,104
I bet with your forensic traing,

760
00:40:19,344 --> 00:40:22,301
I bet you could come up
with something pretty...

761
00:40:24,037 --> 00:40:25,339
I wouldn't do that.

762
00:40:34,072 --> 00:40:35,347
I will say

763
00:40:36,328 --> 00:40:38,636
I've always respected
your courage, Amy.

764
00:40:40,674 --> 00:40:42,164
Drop your weapon!

765
00:40:42,944 --> 00:40:44,857
He said drop it! Now!

766
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:47,181
Officer Lisa...

767
00:40:47,372 --> 00:40:48,875
Agent Tommy.

768
00:40:51,981 --> 00:40:53,812
I'm afraid I can't do that.

769
00:40:54,482 --> 00:40:55,831
You don't know it yet,

770
00:40:56,177 --> 00:40:58,194
but your partner's in danger.

771
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:01,776
Landon?

772
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,274
Landon, what are you doing?

773
00:41:05,383 --> 00:41:06,463
I'm protecting you.

774
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:09,063
McGee, who is this guy?

775
00:41:09,282 --> 00:41:10,349
He's a friend.

776
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,161
Don't!

777
00:41:14,243 --> 00:41:15,487
I have to do this!

778
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:18,102
Landon, she's not going to hurt me.

779
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:21,299
It's just a book.

780
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,063
- It's not...
- Finished yet.

781
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:29,364
Tell him the ending,
Agent McGregor.

782
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,740
Tell him what happens.

783
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:42,810
It's not what you think.

784
00:41:43,179 --> 00:41:44,226
Landon...

785
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,686
Amy and I...

786
00:41:51,857 --> 00:41:53,511
Amy and I get married.

787
00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:00,312
You... you marry her?

788
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:03,210
Yeah, I do.

789
00:42:03,675 --> 00:42:04,939
That means that if you kill her,

790
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,634
you're killing the only
woman I ever loved.

791
00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:12,237
Landon, I really do love her.

792
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,645
It just took me a while
to figure it out.

793
00:42:36,077 --> 00:42:37,540
I was only trying to help.

794
00:42:37,651 --> 00:42:39,346
You killed two people.

795
00:42:39,674 --> 00:42:40,945
I had no choice.

796
00:42:43,637 --> 00:42:44,990
They set a wedding date yet?

797
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,353
The guest list is full, budy.

798
00:42:48,851 --> 00:42:49,874
You okay, Abs?

799
00:42:49,977 --> 00:42:51,472
With the amount of bad guys after me,

800
00:42:51,592 --> 00:42:53,505
I feel like I'm dating Spiderman.

801
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:55,241
Abby, I'm so sorry.

802
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,416
We need to talk.

803
00:43:01,228 --> 00:43:02,527
Look I know this is all my fault.

804
00:43:02,636 --> 00:43:06,081
Agent McGregor cannot marry
Amy in the end.

805
00:43:06,549 --> 00:43:09,514
McGee, they're all wrong for each other.
