1
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:16,883
Corporal Liam Michael O'Neill.

2
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:18,618
That's a good Irish name.

3
00:00:19,264 --> 00:00:21,211
I'm from Scotland, myself.

4
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:24,090
I hope you won't hold that against me.

5
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:26,541
24 years old.

6
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:31,150
Too young for us to be meeting
on this chilly morning.

7
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,506
United States Marine Corps,

8
00:00:33,544 --> 00:00:37,700
found facedown in a snowdrift
in Montrose Park?!

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,210
Now, how did you end up there

10
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:43,665

at 6:00 in the morning?

11
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:46,223
Not stumbling home from

12
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,674
a big night out, I trust.

13
00:00:48,873 --> 00:00:49,889
Now, that

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,086
would be a tragic waste of a young life.

15
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:55,904
This is the place

16
00:00:56,652 --> 00:01:00,938
where death rejoices
in teaching the living.

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,199
Liam, what can you teach us?

18
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:18,763
A wee bump.

19
00:01:18,802 --> 00:01:21,017
Well, perhaps I spoke too soon.

20
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,266
Perhaps you weren't the architect

21
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,432
of your own destruction.

27
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:22,518
There is nothing lucky about waking up
during your own autopsy, probie.

28
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,213
Least you know you're not dead.

29
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:27,107
Ducky's the one who's lucky.

30
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:28,730
Why is Ducky lucky?

31
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:30,291
Well, well,

32
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,084
look who's finally here.

33
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:34,614
Like you've never been late,

34
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:36,892
left early, or gone mysteriously missing?

35
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:40,189
Oh, no. That's my point exactly.
Tardiness is my middle name.

36
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,004
In fact, it's expected of me.

37
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:45,267
You, on the other hand, have become
the poster girl for punctuality.

38
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,091
Late night?

39
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:49,273
Early morning. Run.

40
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:51,563
New route.
Took longer than I expected.

41
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:54,560
Will run faster tomorrow.
Now, why is Ducky lucky?

42
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:56,548
We found a dead man walking.

43
00:02:57,943 --> 00:03:00,240
I've had enough of dead men walking.

44
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:02,228
Uh, this one was really dead.

45
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:05,674
Ducky was about to start the autopsy,
and he came back to life.

46
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:07,390
Like Lazarus.

47
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:09,053
No, like Liam.

48
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:11,692
Liam O'Neill.
Corporal.

49
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,866
He was a communication
specialist attached to a Marine

50
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:18,098
supply division combat
support hospital in Baghdad.

51
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,448
On a 15-day leave from his unit in Iraq.

52
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,283
Third tour.

53
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:23,494
Hardcore Marine.

54
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:26,430
Due to fly back to Baghdad
day after tomorrow.

55
00:03:26,504 --> 00:03:29,938
How does a man who is not dead end up
on Ducky's autopsy table?

56
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:33,637
It was the Metro police.

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,315
They reported a dead man,
not an unconscious one.

58
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:39,603
You know, there's an old
paramedic's saying.

59
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:42,641
"They're not dead
until they're warm undead".

60
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,513
Can't really blame them.

61
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:46,813
Facedown in a snowdrift,

62
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,094
core temperature
20 degrees below normal.

63
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:52,587
No discernible heartbeat.

64
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:54,458
Could have been there for hours.

65
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:58,477
It's not an unreasonable conclusion,
under the circumstances.

66
00:03:58,589 --> 00:03:59,687
CPR.

67
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,353
By their estimation,
he was long dead.

68
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:04,814
CPR is for the recent dead.

69
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:07,181
Never crossed their minds.

70
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,473
You know, the physiology
is very interesting.

71
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:14,539
Faced with imminent death,
the brain begins

72
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,795
to switch off the lights to preserve
the last flicker of life and hope.

73
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:20,245
Prognosis?

74
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:24,726
Well, children have been known
to make a full recovery

75
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:27,728
after being pulled from freezing rivers,

76
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:30,844
two hours after they apparently drowned.

77
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,736
Adults are rarely so lucky.

78
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,430
He'll be on a ventilator,

79
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,151
and the hospital will
constantly check his condition.

80
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:41,056
Got nothing for us here, Duck.

81
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,419
On the contrary.

82
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:47,000
He had a lump on his left temporal area.

83
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:50,733
And bruising on the back and
sides of his neck.

84
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:53,129
He didn't fall into
that snowdrift.

85
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,518
No, he was struck on
the side of the head.

86
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,076
His face was pushed into the snow,

87
00:04:59,702 --> 00:05:03,049
violently held by his neck
and the back of the head.

88
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:05,249
Probably until he stopped thrashing.

89
00:05:06,803 --> 00:05:08,875
How's that for starters?

90
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:14,250
Not much to see.

91
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:16,484
I wouldn't say that.

92
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:21,354
He sure calls her a lot.

93
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,938
Oh, well, she calls him more
often than he calls her.

94
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:24,939
Meaning?

95
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:26,240
Commitment issues.

96
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:28,395
She is,

97
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:30,230
he's not.

98
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:31,876
What time?

99
00:05:32,551 --> 00:05:36,403
Okay, you gonna give me a clue
about this mystery date?

100
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:40,014
Jeanne, "gym shoes"
is not a clue.

101
00:05:40,398 --> 00:05:41,440
"Naked" is a clue.

102
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,877
You want me naked?

103
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,836
All right. You don't want
to see me naked?

104
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:47,969
All right.

105
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,763
I'll bring the gym shoes.

106
00:05:50,193 --> 00:05:51,195
Bye.

107
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,681
Glad you could join us.

108
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,185
Well, there's not much to see.

109
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:58,339
Appreciate it.

110
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:03,150
Corporal O'Neill was wearing
a light shirt and no jacket.

111
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:04,651
What's that tell you, McGee?

112
00:06:05,013 --> 00:06:06,014
Jacket was stolen?

113
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:07,719
Or he left it close by.

114
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:09,567
Or someplace warm.

115
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,343
There's no houses nearby.
Service road's close.

116
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,295
Car.

117
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:18,833
Silver '97 Mustang.

118
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:22,324
License plate Delta-Zulu-one-five
Lima-three-seven.

119
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,561
Bingo on the jacket.

120
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:36,137
Motive wasn't robbery.

121
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:39,329
Sequentially-numbered bills.
Freshly minted.

122
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:41,181
$500.

123
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:43,222
Heater is set high, ignition is on.

124
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:45,238
Must have sat there with
the engine running.

125
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,573
Guess he left in a hurry.

126
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,806
Well, he didn't leave fast enough.

127
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:52,016
Good afternoon, Gibbs.

128
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:55,498
Well, good afternoon, Abs.
How'd you know it was me?

129
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,932
Because I found something,
and whenever I find something,

130
00:06:57,946 --> 00:06:59,629
you always know, and then you come see me.

131
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,075
I do?

132
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:03,417
Well, yeah. If I didn't,
then you wouldn't be here.

133
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:05,524
- Haven't you been listening?
- You found what, Abs?

134
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:08,602
This.

135
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,170
In his left trouser pocket.

136
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,114
- It's organic.
- Illegal?

137
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:13,953
We could smoke it and find out.

138
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,705
Kidding. I'm gonna let the mass spec
smoke that, but I also found this:

139
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,897
a receipt from a restaurant in Baghdad.

140
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:23,059
Corporal's on his third tour, Abs.

141
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,355
But he's been on leave

142
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:27,911
for three weeks, so what was he doing
in Baghdad three days ago?

143
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:30,524
See the date?
I think he had a falafel.

144
00:07:31,706 --> 00:07:33,048
That's a good catch, Abby.

145
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:34,518
Do you think it's ESP?

146
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:36,855
I mean, that you always know
when I find something?

147
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,043
And if it is ESP, are you reading my mind,

148
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:41,706
or am I sending you some
sort of weird brain thoughts

149
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:43,500
out of my head and into yours?

150
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:47,498
Come back, Gibbs.

151
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:50,807
Come back... Gibbs.

152
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,106
Boss, we got it.

153
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,375
Cross-checked it with ICE.

154
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,753
O'Neill left the country eight days ago,
using his own passport.

155
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:02,669
He was traveling as a private citizen.

156
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,542
Arrived back in the country two days ago.

157
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:05,696
A record of travel?

158
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:07,754
Direct to Frankfurt, then on to Baghdad.

159
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:09,666
- Came back the same way.
- Wouldn't call Baghdad

160
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,376
one of your top ten
tourist destinations.

161
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:13,795
Especially if you've just come
from there and you're going back.

162
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:15,298
And people are shooting at you.

163
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:16,687
Or trying to blow you up.

164
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,731
- Airline?
- Didn't fly commercial.

165
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:22,304
He flew there and back with an air
freight company called Fast Flight.

166
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:24,735
Operates out of a warehouse
near Dulles airport.

167
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:25,813
Address.

168
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:27,357
Ziva.

169
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:30,590
The landing fees are a rip-off. They...

170
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:33,046
Damascus, then.

171
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,665
Look, what about Cairo?

172
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,172
You're just gonna have
to find me a better

173
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:41,153
gas station right now, or I'm gonna have

174
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,097
to push that damn plane all the way home.

175
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:44,974
I'll find you something,
Taylor, don't sweat it.

176
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:46,059
You do that.

177
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:49,176
Who are you?

178
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:50,346
Federal agents.

179
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:52,835
NTSB?

180
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:54,838
NCIS.

181
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:59,259
Right.
Gotta love those acronyms.

182
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:01,505
Maybe that's what this company needs.

183
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:03,743
An acronym.

184
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:06,330
Bad day, Mr. Taylor?

185
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,342
Guess that depends on what you want.
Excuse me.

186
00:09:10,787 --> 00:09:11,863
Liam O'Neill?

187
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:14,263
You flew him to Baghdad
and back this week.

188
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:15,578
All legal.

189
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:18,178
Had a passport, cleared Customs,
filed the paperwork.

190
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:19,512
Why did he fly with you?

191
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:23,588
Fast Flight.

192
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:27,060
FF: there's an acronym for you.

193
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,010
Stands for Free Flights.

194
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:30,982
You flew him free of charge?

195
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,538
Ex-Royal Air Force,
doing a good deed for a serving Marine.

196
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:37,542
Don't get a lot of people hitching
a ride to Baghdad.

197
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:39,607
Why was he going to Baghdad?

198
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:41,068
I said he was on leave.

199
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:43,428
He just found out his unit had been hit.

200
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:45,151
One of his buddies was wounded.

201
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:47,179
Wanted to see him.

202
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:48,900
What's he done?

203
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:50,749
Someone tried to kill him.

204
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:54,977
Is he gonna be okay?

205
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:57,292
- Maybe.
- Something you want to add?

206
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:03,352
Some guys met him outside
Baghdad International Airport.

207
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,703
What guys?

208
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:09,805
<i>Yes?</i>

209
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:11,888
B. A. G.'s.

210
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,115
"Bad Ass Guys."
With guns.

211
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,187
Plenty of them in Baghdad.

212
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:21,249
You ask him about it
on the flight home?

213
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,265
Wasn't very talkative.

214
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:25,195
His buddy didn't make it.

215
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:29,129
Someone's with Corporal O'Neill
at the hospital.

216
00:10:30,353 --> 00:10:31,368
Next of kin?

217
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,300
He has no next of kin.

218
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:46,493
Hello, probie.

219
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:48,809
Hello, Mike.

220
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,036
You know this Marine?

221
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,996
He's my son.

222
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,208
Here you go.
Black, no sugar.

223
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:13,266
Thanks.

224
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:19,897
You never told me you had a son.

225
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,698
Didn't find out till
a couple of years ago.

226
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:27,990
Got a phone call one day.

227
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:29,935
It was him.

228
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:31,989
He tracked me down.

229
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,834
We met, had a few beers.

230
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:38,249
He was just about to deploy.

231
00:11:40,752 --> 00:11:43,749
Didn't hear from him again
until a couple of days ago.

232
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:46,465
Said he was in trouble.

233
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:48,287
What kind of trouble?

234
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:50,478
Didn't say.

235
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:57,819
You wouldn't know it now, but

236
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:01,370
he's got his mother's hair.

237
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,108
Used to blow across her face
and get in her eyes.

238
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:09,473
She'd get so pissed and I'd laugh.

239
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,380
She died a few years ago.

240
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,833
We were only together six months.

241
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:21,289
Didn't even know
she was pregnant when she left.

242
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:24,148
What do the doctors say?

243
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:27,302
What doctors always say.

244
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:29,874
Not much that makes any sense.

245
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,085
Doing tests.

246
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,049
Brainwaves and...

247
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:39,151
reflexes, all that neurological stuff.

248
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:43,290
Do you know who did this, probie?

249
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:45,001
Not yet.

250
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:48,676
Guess you wouldn't tell me if you did.

251
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:51,419
No.

252
00:12:56,521 --> 00:12:58,637
Need a place to stay tonight, Mike?

253
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,222
Might just stay here with my boy.

254
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:15,565
There any hope?

255
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:17,630
As I was just explaining
to your colleague,

256
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,676
the patient is unresponsive
to external stimuli.

257
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:22,803
His name is Corporal O'Neill.

258
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:24,006
Corporal O'Neill.

259
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,003
There's still more testing
to do, which will determine

260
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:30,429
if there is any cerebral
circulation present,

261
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:33,697
but at this point, it would be
wrong to offer any hope.

262
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,963
When will you know for certain?

263
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:37,444
Tomorrow.

264
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:38,596
Thank you.

265
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,629
Sure.

266
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:49,693
He knows?

267
00:13:51,494 --> 00:13:52,509
He knows.

268
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:59,155
Didn't I say gym shoes?

269
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,198
Ah, yeah.

270
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:03,215
Well, you know me, always
following doctor's orders.

271
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:04,881
You ever climb one of these before?

272
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:05,882
No.

273
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,027
Nervous?

274
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,421
Should I be?

275
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,451
Well, it's a long way up.

276
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:12,395
Ah, yes, it is, and once you're up,

277
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:13,952
it's a long way down.

278
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:16,285
Oh, you're all strapped in.
You'll be fine.

279
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:21,486
- Can you please let that go?
- Okay.

280
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:22,970
Thank you.

281
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:26,519
I'll be climbing beside you.
Let me just...

282
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,626
- Okay.
- Good look for you.

283
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:30,920
Okay...

284
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:32,884
Is this going to be a race?

285
00:14:32,947 --> 00:14:35,353
No, speed climbing is for the experts.

286
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:37,007
Experts like you.

287
00:14:42,884 --> 00:14:44,197
When you're ready.

288
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:47,433
Okay.

289
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:03,240
So what do I get
if I beat you to the top?

290
00:15:03,241 --> 00:15:04,950
You get to tell me you love me.

291
00:15:05,298 --> 00:15:07,343
And if I don't beat you?

292
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:09,696
You still get to tell me you love me.

293
00:15:10,294 --> 00:15:13,910
So, is that followed
by other physical pursuits?

294
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:16,166
If you're not too tired.

295
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,586
I'm never too tired.

296
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,073
Hey, wait.

297
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:27,379
Cheater!

298
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:30,020
You told me you'd never climbed before.

299
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:34,550
No, I said I'd never climbed
one of these before.

300
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:38,881
Oh, I'm gonna beat you.

301
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:40,591
And I'm there.

302
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,673
- You're good.
- You're better.

303
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,237
How can I ever trust you again?

304
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:50,614
Where did you learn to climb?

305
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:53,099
There was this big,
old pine tree in my backyard.

306
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,714
It was about three times higher
than we are now, and I used

307
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:58,939
to climb it all the way
to the tippity-top.

308
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,011
One day, I refused to come down.

309
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,734
And my mom called the fire department.

310
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:07,153
Why didn't you want to come down?

311
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:10,143
The view was too beautiful.

312
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:12,787
Just like it is now.

313
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:30,770
You beat me to the top.

314
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,504
You know what that means.

315
00:16:33,748 --> 00:16:35,472
Other physical pursuits?

316
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:40,527
Last one down's on top.

317
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:49,311
It's just so sad, you know?

318
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:52,287
You have a son you never knew about
for all those years,

319
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,730
and then right when you find out...

320
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:56,658
It doesn't seem fair.

321
00:16:57,304 --> 00:17:01,238
Maybe you should call all your old
girlfriends, you know, just to check.

322
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:03,346
That won't take long.

323
00:17:03,563 --> 00:17:05,565
What I mean is, uh, I can't imagine

324
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,741
any of them having a baby
without telling me.

325
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:10,022
Tony, on the other hand...

326
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:14,129
Last ten numbers called and received.

327
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,569
And voice mail.

328
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:18,851
Great.

329
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:23,406
Voice mail's protected by a PIN number.
That's going to take some time.

330
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,629
Okay... a bunch of international calls...

331
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,717
Prefix 964,
that's Iraq's country code.

332
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:35,148
Five calls back and forth
to Fast Flight...

333
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:38,346
Second-to-last dialed and second-to-last
received are the same number.

334
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:40,477
And the name of...

335
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:42,021
"Pagoda Investments".

336
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:45,970
Well, looks like we might have
a money trail.

337
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,115
Company's owned by Jalil Shaloub.

338
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:53,576
Known to his friends
and enemies as "Jimmy".

339
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:56,762
Small-time investment advisor,
big-time loan shark.

340
00:17:56,978 --> 00:17:59,226
Also on Homeland
Security's watch list.

341
00:17:59,314 --> 00:18:02,679
Iraqi father, Lebanese mother.
Moved here after the first Gulf War.

342
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,875
Any active surveillance?

343
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:06,060
None that anyone is admitting to.

344
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,106
Shaloub channels money into
a Beirut investment bank,

345
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:11,830
which may or may not support Hezbollah.

346
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:12,887
Hezbollah?

347
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:14,791
He walks a dangerous path.

348
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:17,058
What's the connection
with Corporal O'Neill?

349
00:18:17,135 --> 00:18:21,265
Could be software, hardware,
troop deployments, timetables...

350
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:23,712
O'Neill could be a seller.

351
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:24,727
Or a buyer.

352
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,833
Either way, he keeps bad company.

353
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:28,179
Think Franks knows?

354
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:33,656
Know him, Mr. Shaloub?

355
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,921
Marine Corporal Liam O'Neill.

356
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,902
He came to see me.

357
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:39,737
When?

358
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:40,935
<i>Two days ago.</i>

359
00:18:41,797 --> 00:18:42,874
About?

360
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:46,177
What all of my clients come
to see me about, Agent Gibbs:

361
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:47,609
money.

362
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,541
Did you give him any?

363
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:52,705
No, I decided he was too
risky a proposition.

364
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:54,541
What interest rate do you charge?

365
00:18:55,652 --> 00:18:57,112
Why? Do you need a loan?

366
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:00,876
Fifty percent?

367
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:03,578
One hundred percent?
Two hundred percent?

368
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:05,955
I would say the risk is theirs.

369
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:08,881
How much did Corporal O'Neill want?

370
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,615
$25,000.

371
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:15,069
For?

372
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,709
My policy is not to ask.

373
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,701
Maybe you didn't have to.

374
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:22,494
We met, we drank coffee,

375
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:24,590
we did not do business.

376
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:27,455
He told me nothing about
why he needed the money.

377
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,961
How soon did he need it?

378
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:32,391
Immediately.

379
00:19:32,864 --> 00:19:34,143
- Cash?
- Of course.

380
00:19:34,144 --> 00:19:35,784
All my clients prefer cash.

381
00:19:35,785 --> 00:19:37,938
Even the ones in Beirut
and Baghdad?

382
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,266
I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.

383
00:19:44,698 --> 00:19:46,452
From all the questions you are asking,

384
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:49,288
I can only assume that
Corporal O'Neill is

385
00:19:49,594 --> 00:19:52,400
involved in some criminal
activity, Agent Gibbs.

386
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:53,754
You mean like you?

387
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,315
If you believed that, Officer David,

388
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:01,634
we would be meeting in your office,
not mine.

389
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:08,656
There someone you can call?

390
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:10,692
- Might have a friend in Tel Aviv.
- Make it happen, Ziva.

391
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:12,729
- Shared intelligence.
- I'd settle for any.

392
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,465
- Okay, thanks.
- McGee!

393
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:16,744
Turn over a rock on this guy:

394
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:19,491
company records, IRS, bank details.

395
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:21,368
I'll check the access the Homeland Security file.

396
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:22,755
What am I looking for?

397
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:25,103
You'll know it when you see it.

398
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:27,441
How is he?

399
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:29,359
They're done testing.

400
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:34,595
Liam mixed up with him?

401
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:36,344
McGee.

402
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:37,485
Who is he?

403
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:38,639
I can't say.

404
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:44,419
Whatever he's done, good or
bad, he's still my boy.

405
00:20:45,818 --> 00:20:47,373
Nothing else I can tell you.

406
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:50,981
It's not why I'm here.

407
00:20:57,143 --> 00:20:58,382
That's everything,

408
00:20:59,228 --> 00:21:02,623
apart from his clothing and his car.
We're still checking these for prints.

409
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,406
This belonged to his mother.

410
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,742
Her religion... and mine.

411
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,536
War and peace.

412
00:21:18,124 --> 00:21:19,605
Can you release these?

413
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,363
I need one more thing, probie.

414
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:27,385
A witness.

415
00:21:48,836 --> 00:21:49,865
That's okay.

416
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:45,927
Been waiting for you, Gibbs.

417
00:22:45,928 --> 00:22:47,263
You got something?

418
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:48,264
I do.

419
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:50,938
And you're not gonna like it.

420
00:22:51,275 --> 00:22:55,130
The print on the left was lifted from
inside Liam's car.

421
00:22:56,222 --> 00:22:57,543
The print on the right

422
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,284
is the match from our database.

423
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:10,461
Franks was in the car, Gibbs.

424
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:20,781
How much did Franks know?

425
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,110
Not enough to save his son.

426
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:25,042
Maybe not much at all. You ever tell
your dad what you were up to, probie?

427
00:23:25,043 --> 00:23:26,725
- Every day.
- Wrong person to ask.

428
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:29,154
Liam flew to Baghdad, met some bad guys,

429
00:23:29,155 --> 00:23:30,795
flew back, and someone
tried to kill him.

430
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:31,991
Succeeded.

431
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:33,545
Deal gone wrong, maybe?

432
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:34,582
Dealing what?

433
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:38,285
He was a communications specialist.
Equipment, software, secrets.

434
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:41,502
Only had limited access;
didn't know any secrets.

435
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,510
Yeah. Gibbs.

436
00:23:43,895 --> 00:23:45,231
Any news for me, probie?

437
00:23:45,963 --> 00:23:47,006
Could be, Mike.

438
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:49,018
Come on in, I'll brief you.

439
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:50,595
Why don't you come to me.

440
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:53,339
<i>-  Where?
-  Fourth and H; by the southeast freeway.</i>

441
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,629
I'll be right there.

442
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:56,553
Need any backup, boss?

443
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:58,095
Friend, not foe, DiNozzo.

444
00:23:58,596 --> 00:23:59,596
We hope.

445
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:10,089
Hey, you've reached Jeanne.
Leave a message.

446
00:24:10,895 --> 00:24:14,232
This is your friendly neighborhood stalker
leaving his third message of the day.

447
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:16,173
Hope everything's okay.

448
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:18,487
Call me when you can. Ciao.

449
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:23,301
Did she give you the cold elbow?

450
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,333
Shoulder.

451
00:24:25,105 --> 00:24:27,209
And no, she has very
warm shoulders to me.

452
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,210
You two fighting?

453
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,520
We don't fight.

454
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,763
Well, maybe she does and
you haven't even noticed.

455
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,023
Or maybe you said something that hurt her,

456
00:24:34,024 --> 00:24:36,390
or maybe you said nothing

457
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:39,004
when you should have
said something.

458
00:24:40,552 --> 00:24:41,710
She's just busy.

459
00:24:42,318 --> 00:24:43,458
High-stress job.

460
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:45,975
Not a lot of time for phone calls.

461
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:47,273
Do you mind?

462
00:24:47,768 --> 00:24:49,252
- Of course.
- Thanks.

463
00:24:56,524 --> 00:24:58,569
Hi, I'm trying to contact
Dr. Jeanne Benoit.

464
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,906
- I was wondering if...
- I'm sorry, she's already left for the day.

465
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,650
- She has?!
- Yes, sir.

466
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:03,994
- What time?
- About an hour ago?

467
00:25:03,995 --> 00:25:05,813
- Would you like to leave a message?
- No message.

468
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:07,718
- Okay, then.
- I'll call her at home, thanks.

469
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,802
<i>You're welcome.</i>

470
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,786
Found your prints in his car, Mike.

471
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:30,783
Figured you probably would.

472
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:32,523
You should have told me you saw him.

473
00:25:32,524 --> 00:25:34,589
Didn't want you asking me
too many questions.

474
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,590
About?

475
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,516
What my son was involved in.

476
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:43,124
Are you gonna tell me?

477
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,125
I saw him a couple of days ago.

478
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,030
He needed money.

479
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,034
Just about cleaned me out.

480
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:53,568
But I got it for him.

481
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,355
$25,000.

482
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:58,623
He took $500, asked
me to hold the rest.

483
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,338
Said it was safer that way.

484
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:03,641
Said he would call me when he needed it.

485
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:04,900
Never called.

486
00:26:05,123 --> 00:26:06,216
What's this about?

487
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:08,655
Wouldn't tell me.

488
00:26:08,656 --> 00:26:10,394
He wouldn't tell you,
or you won't tell me?!

489
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:16,528
We're getting more alike,
you and me, probie.

490
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,992
Even feeling the same pain.

491
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,787
I don't know how you didn't go crazy

492
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,255
when you lost your little girl.

493
00:26:23,256 --> 00:26:24,847
Maybe you did for a while.

494
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,576
Maybe you still are.

495
00:26:27,157 --> 00:26:29,926
I just know I got to do
what's right for my boy.

496
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:33,965
I owe him that.

497
00:26:34,878 --> 00:26:35,921
Let me handle it.

498
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,612
You got to be somewhere?

499
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:44,511
I want the body sent
to my place in Mexico

500
00:26:44,525 --> 00:26:46,039
when Ducky's done with it.

501
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:48,460
Can you arrange that for me?

502
00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:51,218
I don't want to have
to come after you, Mike.

503
00:26:51,422 --> 00:26:52,499
Then don't.

504
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,501
- Hey
- Hey back.

505
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:14,922
I left some messages.
I was getting kind of worried.

506
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:16,907
I'm fine.

507
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:21,091
I'm not getting that "I'm fine" feeling
from you, Jeanne.

508
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:27,886
I was gonna bring you flowers.

509
00:27:28,172 --> 00:27:29,284
Where are they?

510
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:32,259
I didn't want to stop.

511
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:34,469
Big mistake.

512
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,725
Jeanne, this is about, uh...

513
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:44,881
about what I didn't say when
I beat you to the top, right?

514
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,901
I wanted to believe
that...

515
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,877
you didn't understand
what I was saying.

516
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:53,401
I wanted to give you
a second chance.

517
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:55,870
And a third chance, and a fourth chance.

518
00:27:55,871 --> 00:27:59,179
I've said it now, Tony,
and you never have.

519
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,821
Well, that's not true.

520
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:07,204
"Love you," after other physical pursuits

521
00:28:07,205 --> 00:28:09,707
is not the same as "I love you."

522
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:14,219
And please, don't insult either
of us by saying it now.

523
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:19,535
Even if I mean it?

524
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:21,790
I don't think you know if you mean it.

525
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:25,973
I love you.

526
00:28:28,101 --> 00:28:30,989
Now you need to figure out
if you feel the same way.

527
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:33,252
I don't want to hurt you.

528
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:40,404
Then just go now and figure out
what it is that you want for us.

529
00:28:46,913 --> 00:28:47,915
Ziva...

530
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,041
Talk to your friend yet?

531
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:52,520
Shaloub is a person of interest,
but that is all.

532
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:55,941
No known terrorist links.
More concerned with money than ideology.

533
00:28:56,205 --> 00:28:58,179
That's Mike Franks' rental.
Put out a BOLO on it.

534
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,572
If he has been here, he's probably
booked into a hotel or motel.

535
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,913
Start checking.

536
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:04,092
McGee.

537
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:07,290
I'm still trying to crack Liam's
voice mail security code, so...

538
00:29:07,777 --> 00:29:10,015
- matter of time.
- Something we don't have.

539
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,031
DiNozzo.

540
00:29:11,656 --> 00:29:12,656
Boss.

541
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:15,976
You help Ziva.

542
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:20,476
Hey.

543
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:21,706
Not good?

544
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,929
Not good.

545
00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:30,828
Gibbs!
You shouldn't be here!

546
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:34,614
I don't have anything for you, and I didn't
send out any "calling Gibbs" vibes.

547
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:36,338
I'm not psychic, Abs.
Just checking.

548
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,411
Did Mike try to get
any information about the case?

549
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:39,477
I barely saw him.

550
00:29:40,442 --> 00:29:41,477
Hasn't phoned?

551
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:42,606
No.

552
00:29:42,607 --> 00:29:44,800
You thought he might try to
sneak a peek at the evidence?

553
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:45,801
I would've.

554
00:29:45,802 --> 00:29:47,180
Well, then why didn't he?

555
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:49,231
Seeing as you two are so much alike.

556
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:50,460
Peas in a pod, Gibbs.

557
00:29:50,611 --> 00:29:51,993
Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum.

558
00:29:54,302 --> 00:29:57,013
Gibbs... you knew before I knew it knew.

559
00:29:57,014 --> 00:29:58,384
Before it knew it knew!

560
00:29:58,876 --> 00:30:02,042
The green compound we found in
Corporal O'Neill's pants pocket.

561
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:03,794
That's what I was gonna call you about.

562
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:05,461
This is getting really spooky.

563
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:10,595
Lawsonia inermis.

564
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:11,985
More commonly known as henna.

565
00:30:11,986 --> 00:30:14,107
It's used in body art,
mostly in the Middle East.

566
00:30:14,108 --> 00:30:15,518
It's beautiful, but it doesn't last,

567
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,553
- not like a real tattoo.
- Other uses?

568
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,980
Hair dye. But the tattoos
are really cool.

569
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:22,479
They have a lot of intricate
patterns and shadings.

570
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:23,732
I should probably get one.

571
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:24,733
What do you think?

572
00:30:24,734 --> 00:30:26,018
Don't answer out loud.

573
00:30:26,232 --> 00:30:27,232
Just think it.

574
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,272
I'll take that as a no.

575
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:40,873
Well, here we are again, dear boy.

576
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:43,999
Not the outcome for which
either of us had hoped.

577
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:47,090
No more miracles, just answers.

578
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:50,928
You're two hours early, Jethro.

579
00:30:50,956 --> 00:30:52,568
I'm only just beginning.

580
00:30:52,698 --> 00:30:53,880
Any tattoos, Ducky?

581
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:57,715
Ah, a direct query,
demanding a direct response,

582
00:30:57,735 --> 00:30:59,735
which, in this case, is a direct no.

583
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,468
Somewhat surprising for a young Marine.

584
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:07,525
Autopsy.

585
00:31:07,526 --> 00:31:08,734
Is Gibbs with you, by any chance?

586
00:31:08,735 --> 00:31:10,813
- Yes, he is.
- Tell him I cracked the code, okay?

587
00:31:10,814 --> 00:31:12,007
Indeed.

588
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:16,461
Timothy says to tell you
that he's cracked the code,

589
00:31:16,462 --> 00:31:18,018
whatever that may mean.

590
00:31:20,484 --> 00:31:23,017
No peace, even for the dead.

591
00:31:26,132 --> 00:31:27,773
Just wanted to make sure.

592
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:31,485
There's only one message
in Liam's in box.

593
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:34,806
Hey, buddy, your package arrives
at the end of the week.

594
00:31:34,807 --> 00:31:37,587
You want to pick it up,
the price just doubled.

595
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,114
Nick Taylor.

596
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:43,318
The last call that Liam made was to Fast
Flight. Maybe it was to arrange a meeting.

597
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,223
They meet, they argue, they fight.

598
00:31:46,266 --> 00:31:48,129
Logged into FAA, Gibbs.

599
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:52,214
Fast Flight FF-716 freight
service from Baghdad.

600
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:53,862
We have a problem.

601
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,383
It landed an hour and a half ago.

602
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,140
- Clear!
- Clear !

603
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:13,394
Clear!

604
00:32:22,183 --> 00:32:23,705
Somebody beat us to it.

605
00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:38,042
Multiple victims. Multiple wounds.

606
00:32:38,442 --> 00:32:39,530
Pray and spray.

607
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:40,531
Possibly.

608
00:32:41,115 --> 00:32:45,307
But dead only a matter of 15 or 20
minutes before you arrived.

609
00:32:45,553 --> 00:32:46,656
Jethro, do you think...?

610
00:32:46,657 --> 00:32:47,989
I'm not speculating, Duck.

611
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,485
- I want evidence.
- Gibbs...

612
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:52,544
blankets, pillows, water bottles.

613
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:55,255
All the comforts of home.

614
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:56,490
Human cargo.

615
00:32:57,696 --> 00:32:59,181
Looks to be three of everything.

616
00:32:59,182 --> 00:33:00,364
But only two bodies,

617
00:33:00,365 --> 00:33:02,866
assuming Taylor was already
here at the office.

618
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:03,867
One got away.

619
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:05,659
- The shooter?
- Maybe.

620
00:33:06,391 --> 00:33:07,406
Boss.

621
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:15,931
Arabic.

622
00:33:17,934 --> 00:33:19,244
It's a Koran.

623
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:23,053
The FAA says all the paperwork was
in order when the flight landed.

624
00:33:23,054 --> 00:33:24,566
- Customs?
- Only checked

625
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:27,822
the cargo manifest. No X-ray,
no physical search of air containers.

626
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:29,714
It was unloaded and taken
straight to the warehouse.

627
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:31,223
- Air crew?
- Oblivious.

628
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:33,732
Still at the airport overseeing
an engine inspection.

629
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,992
Got an I. D. on the other
two victims here.

630
00:33:35,993 --> 00:33:39,340
Peter Thomas McLean,
Private, United States Army.

631
00:33:39,354 --> 00:33:42,059
Reported missing three weeks ago
from the U. S. Army base

632
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,804
at Wuerzburg, near Frankfurt.

633
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:45,307
- Missing?
- Deserted.

634
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:48,056
Unit was shipped to Iraq
two days after he disappeared.

635
00:33:48,057 --> 00:33:50,983
Second victim is Franz Bernhard Schuler.

636
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:54,946
He's a German national wanted
by Interpol for murder... killed a cop.

637
00:33:54,948 --> 00:33:58,057
Believed to be trying to flee Europe
for the United States.

638
00:33:58,058 --> 00:33:59,260
Made it.

639
00:34:00,095 --> 00:34:01,096
Almost.

640
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:03,362
Taylor was running
a passenger service for bad guys.

641
00:34:03,687 --> 00:34:05,245
Wonder how much the tickets were?

642
00:34:05,246 --> 00:34:07,174
- Too much.
- Which leads us

643
00:34:07,187 --> 00:34:10,229
to passenger number three:
Muslim and missing.

644
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,537
- Terrorist?
- Might explain all the dead bodies.

645
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:14,448
Left no one alive to identify him.

646
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:16,454
Or maybe just a frightened
witness who got away.

647
00:34:16,482 --> 00:34:17,497
Anything?

648
00:34:17,595 --> 00:34:20,380
Phone company can't track him.
Franks must have his cell phone off.

649
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:22,869
He knows we'd be trying
to get ahold of him.

650
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:26,707
McGee.

651
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,334
This is Metro.
We have a hit on your BOLO.

652
00:34:28,335 --> 00:34:30,096
- Where?
- 2615 Linden.

653
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,711
Got it. Thank you.

654
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:36,249
Metro police just found Franks' car.

655
00:34:40,008 --> 00:34:41,954
We could fall back
and set up surveillance.

656
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,061
It's too late.

657
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,091
Must be a dozen hotels
within a mile of here, boss.

658
00:34:46,147 --> 00:34:47,190
Parked and walked?

659
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:48,743
That's what I'd do.

660
00:34:49,764 --> 00:34:52,540
I'll start checking them
as soon as we get back.

661
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:05,653
Oh, boy.

662
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:14,691
Recently fired.

663
00:35:18,064 --> 00:35:19,281
Think he did it?

664
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:21,204
Mike Franks is a very capable man.

665
00:35:21,606 --> 00:35:23,706
- That extend to murder?
- Revenge.

666
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,222
Taylor killed his son.

667
00:35:25,805 --> 00:35:26,939
Still murder.

668
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:28,086
DiNozzo.

669
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:33,017
17 hotels and motels within 15 minutes
walk of where we found the car.

670
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:35,947
I'm e-mailing the photo of Franks now.

671
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,185
Glock?

672
00:35:37,186 --> 00:35:40,445
Registered to Nick Taylor.
He was a licensed shooter.

673
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:42,940
McGee, you found anything
under that rock yet?

674
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,615
- Still working, boss.
- IRS?

675
00:35:44,712 --> 00:35:45,982
Clean bill of health.

676
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:48,901
Shaloub pays his taxes, files his returns.

677
00:35:49,237 --> 00:35:52,550
Pagoda's got a modest turnover.
The more you look, the less you see.

678
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:54,441
Gotta hide his money somewhere, probie.

679
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:56,330
No association with any charities?

680
00:35:56,331 --> 00:35:57,331
I know where you're headed,

681
00:35:57,332 --> 00:36:00,420
but he's not making any big
donations to suspect charities.

682
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:01,422
Travel?

683
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,949
In and out of the country seven
times over the last four months...

684
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:08,483
which is odd, 'cause this guy's
meticulous with his tax returns.

685
00:36:08,484 --> 00:36:09,860
He lists all his deductions.

686
00:36:09,861 --> 00:36:12,321
All that travel and he didn't
claim it as a business expense.

687
00:36:12,322 --> 00:36:14,066
Well, someone must have
been paying for him.

688
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:15,567
Or he wasn't paying at all.

689
00:36:15,818 --> 00:36:18,002
Check when and where he flew, against
FAA records.

690
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:20,795
All that's going to tell us
is what airline he flew with.

691
00:36:20,962 --> 00:36:21,977
Typing.

692
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:26,204
It's the same airline
every time: Fast Flight.

693
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:27,581
Go get him.

694
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
Sometimes I fly Fast Flight

695
00:36:31,597 --> 00:36:33,941
instead of a scheduled commercial flight.

696
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,880
I wasn't breaking the law, Agent Gibbs,

697
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:37,966
or any FAA regulations.

698
00:36:38,244 --> 00:36:40,819
Fast Flight is only registered
to carry freight,

699
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,820
not passengers.

700
00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:44,686
I wasn't a paying passenger.

701
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,556
Taylor was doing you a favor?

702
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:52,111
Let me tell you what you clearly
don't know, Agent Gibbs.

703
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,309
I helped finance Fast Flight.

704
00:36:54,822 --> 00:36:57,528
What you might call a silent partner.

705
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,660
Not one of my wiser investment decisions.

706
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:03,321
When?

707
00:37:03,323 --> 00:37:04,323
12 months ago.

708
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:05,446
How much?

709
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:08,662
The initial outlay was
half a million dollars.

710
00:37:08,663 --> 00:37:11,624
I pumped in as much
again in the last six months.

711
00:37:12,238 --> 00:37:16,254
Free flights to Europe were the only
return I was seeing on my money.

712
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,356
The company's failing.

713
00:37:18,878 --> 00:37:20,230
Taylor is incompetent.

714
00:37:20,825 --> 00:37:21,923
Was.

715
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:25,662
Something's happened?

716
00:37:25,663 --> 00:37:27,748
You should know.
You were there.

717
00:37:28,383 --> 00:37:29,383
Where?

718
00:37:29,486 --> 00:37:30,793
The warehouse.

719
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:33,169
Three men shot dead...

720
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:35,201
including Taylor.

721
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,920
I had nothing to do with this.

722
00:37:37,962 --> 00:37:39,073
Why'd you do it?

723
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:41,087
I just told you I didn't.

724
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:44,329
Because Taylor was smuggling people
into the country and didn't tell you?

725
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,650
- No...
- Or you just found out and

726
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:47,096
wanted to cut of the action?

727
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,200
No !

728
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,000
I had nothing to do with this,
Agent Gibbs.

729
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,922
You got the wrong man.

730
00:38:02,921 --> 00:38:04,471
What's this white stuff?

731
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,010
Calcium oxide.

732
00:38:07,762 --> 00:38:08,762
Lime?!

733
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,624
Did you use it to dust for prints?

734
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:14,196
No. It was already there.

735
00:38:14,197 --> 00:38:16,292
There were no prints.
It must have been wiped.

736
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,117
So how'd the lime get on here?

737
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:21,079
Same way the crystalline silica did.

738
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,246
And it wasn't just on the grip,
it was in the slide action.

739
00:38:24,247 --> 00:38:26,585
I had to clean it off
before I could fire it.

740
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:32,070
Bad?

741
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:33,814
- Bad.
- How bad?

742
00:38:36,512 --> 00:38:38,512
The striations on the bullets match.

743
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:42,284
The Glock found in Mike Franks' car,
it's the murder weapon.

744
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,771
Thanks.

745
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,445
Found Franks, boss.

746
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:51,314
Booked into a hotel 15 minutes.
Walked from where we found the car.

747
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:54,969
False name, paid cash, manager I. D.'d
him from the photo I e-mailed.

748
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:57,694
Hotel's at 1127 Church Avenue.

749
00:38:57,766 --> 00:38:58,988
Franks is still there.

750
00:38:59,386 --> 00:39:00,485
Will we bring him in?

751
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,391
It's glass, boss.

752
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:06,188
Crystalline silica and calcium oxide,
used in glassmaking.

753
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,766
It was all over the Glock,
even in the slide action.

754
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:10,704
Abby had to clean it
before she could fire it.

755
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:14,722
Anyway, there is a glass manufacturer
right next to the Fast Flight warehouse.

756
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:25,792
Agent Gibbs...

757
00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:27,065
Take off your shoes.

758
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,830
What?

759
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:31,516
Need to look at your shoes.

760
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:41,785
Wallet.

761
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:53,837
Sequential serial numbers.

762
00:39:54,638 --> 00:39:55,770
Where's the rest?

763
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:57,989
You think you can
intimidate me, Agent Gibbs?

764
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,081
McGee?

765
00:39:59,894 --> 00:40:03,403
Looks like traces of calcium oxide
and crystalline silica in the treads.

766
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:05,557
It's used in glass manufacture.

767
00:40:05,642 --> 00:40:08,661
Hollander Glass Company's right
next door to Fast Flight.

768
00:40:09,134 --> 00:40:10,747
You ever notice all that white stuff

769
00:40:10,748 --> 00:40:12,283
<i>on the ground behind the
back of their building?</i>

770
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:15,926
<i>That is crystalline silica and
calcium oxide.</i>

771
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:18,606
You got it on your shoes

772
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:23,319
when you dumped this into
the Dumpster behind their building.

773
00:40:23,431 --> 00:40:25,391
You should have left
it at the scene.

774
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:27,370
It wasn't me.

775
00:40:27,772 --> 00:40:28,772
I got a witness!

776
00:40:30,985 --> 00:40:32,242
Hope we got a witness.

777
00:40:32,243 --> 00:40:33,451
If we can find him.

778
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:37,034
I had nothing to do with the murder
of that Marine.

779
00:40:37,794 --> 00:40:40,700
Taylor was out of control
trying to cash-flow

780
00:40:40,754 --> 00:40:43,137
his business by people-smuggling.

781
00:40:43,537 --> 00:40:46,824
He wouldn't let them leave
because he wanted more money.

782
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:48,365
And then he pulled that gun on me.

783
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:50,986
I took it off him. I was defending myself.

784
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,726
What about the other two?

785
00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:12,461
Hey.

786
00:41:14,485 --> 00:41:15,500
We got him.

787
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:18,059
Knew you'd figure it out
eventually, probie.

788
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,798
Unfinished business;
that why you went there?

789
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,179
I owed him that.

790
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:26,267
Paid the rest of the cash,
picked up the package.

791
00:41:26,714 --> 00:41:27,935
Came back to the hotel.

792
00:41:27,936 --> 00:41:29,465
But you went back again,

793
00:41:30,132 --> 00:41:31,161
didn't you, Mike?

794
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,344
Shaloub was already there.

795
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,838
I heard the shots.

796
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:38,020
I saw him come out of the
building in a panic.

797
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,321
I saw him wipe the weapon
and toss it over into the Dumpster.

798
00:41:41,322 --> 00:41:43,645
You were going to plant it in
his car and give me a call?

799
00:41:44,277 --> 00:41:45,277
That was the idea,

800
00:41:46,178 --> 00:41:49,459
but you found my rental
and I didn't get a chance.

801
00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:50,961
Well, you were a witness.

802
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:54,444
You didn't need to do that unless
you had something to hide, Mike.

803
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:00,154
She's from Mexico.

804
00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:21,958
We left in a bit of a hurry.

805
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,009
They were going to be married.

806
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,260
Her family in Baghdad said
that she shamed them.

807
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:32,092
She's been in hiding for six months.

808
00:42:32,673 --> 00:42:34,745
He was desperate to get her out.

809
00:42:36,233 --> 00:42:39,869
I don't think any of this is relevant to
your case, probie.

810
00:42:44,997 --> 00:42:46,593
I guess not Mike.

811
00:43:23,232 --> 00:43:33,000
