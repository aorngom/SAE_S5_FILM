1
00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:17,936
We're not here to eat.

2
00:00:17,937 --> 00:00:19,304
We're here to protect the Director.

3
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:21,550
Ziva, this is probably
the most secure building

4
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:22,885
in the whole country right now.

5
00:00:22,886 --> 00:00:25,394
CIA, DSS, ATF, FBI,

6
00:00:25,395 --> 00:00:26,422
the whole alphabet's here.

7
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:28,251
Not to mention state troopers,

8
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:32,497
metro cops and NCIS's finest... me.

9
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:35,346
And you.

10
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:37,218
But me is hungry.

11
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:39,197
These are public servants like us.

12
00:00:39,198 --> 00:00:40,225
And this is free food.

13
00:00:40,226 --> 00:00:41,723
Some are defense contractors.

14
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:45,084
Beltway bandits who make a career
of stealing from the public trough.

15
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:45,956
Politicians.

16
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:48,085
You ever seen a skinny politician?

17
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:49,787
Too late.

18
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:51,453
Our guest of honor has just arrived.

19
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:52,544
Ladies and gentlemen,

20
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:54,337
the retiring Secretary of Defense

21
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:56,523
of the United States of America.

22
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:00,317
I'm going to get something to eat.

23
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:07,208
Director!

51
00:02:15,778 --> 00:02:17,372
Morning, Gibbs, McGee.

52
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:18,329
Director Shepard.

53
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,335
Our gatecrasher was a marine.

54
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:22,526
Sergeant Brian Wright.

55
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:25,071
The hotel was in lockdown and
he wasn't a registered guest.

56
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:28,359
He took a dive from up there somewhere.

57
00:02:28,864 --> 00:02:30,362
SecDef staff are worried

58
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:32,438
that it was an attempt
on the life of their boss.

59
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,775
Are we worried?

60
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:36,767
If it was an assassination
attempt, he's a lousy assassin.

61
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:39,568
He used his body as a
weapon and missed by 75 feet.

62
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:40,878
Ducky's doing preliminaries.

63
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,060
I've got Tony liaising between
Metro and hotel management.

64
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,311
And we have a witness.

65
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:47,800
Andy Nelson.

66
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:48,913
Ziva's with him.

67
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:50,724
He's an aide to a congressman.

68
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:52,975
Nelson claims he was
attacked by the deceased

69
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:55,534
on the sixth floor just
before the incident.

70
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:56,250
You believe him?

71
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,046
He works for a politician,
what do you think?

72
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,925
I'm officially handing over.

73
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:02,764
I've got my own fires to put out.

74
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,639
This happened in our backyard.
It's making a lot of people nervous.

75
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,743
I'd appreciate a quick
result on this one.

76
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:13,897
The question is: Did he
jump or was he pushed?

77
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:16,977
I guess that's what
we're here to find out.

78
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,132
Go.

79
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:25,197
Enough. It's okay.

80
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:29,049
Mr. Nelson has been
explaining how he got injured.

81
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:32,676
He just came at me.

82
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:34,030
He hit me,...

83
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:35,448
I fell down and he ran away.

84
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,744
You see him fall?

85
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:38,372
I just got out of there.

86
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:41,328
I was down in the lobby
to report it when he fell.

87
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,604
Why were you on the sixth floor?

88
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,079
I was delivering a briefing paper

89
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,885
to a defense contractor
in one of the suites.

90
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:48,944
Norforce Systems.

91
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:51,036
I was walking towards the elevator.

92
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:52,467
You seen him before?

93
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:54,208
Every day.

94
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:56,476
Congressman Getz.

95
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:59,734
Well, not the deceased.

96
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:00,620
Just...

97
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:02,623
sad souls like him.

98
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:03,871
The homeless.

99
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:05,252
Unconfirmed.

100
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:06,904
And a war veteran,...

101
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:10,732
or we'd be talking to
metro police and not NCIS.

102
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:11,420
Agent?

103
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:13,277
Special Agent Gibbs.

104
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:14,843
And he was a marine.

105
00:04:15,844 --> 00:04:17,729
We need to do more to...

106
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,955
help the ones who come back broken.

107
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:21,343
Yes, you do.

108
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,228
Let's get that X-rayed, Andy.

109
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:27,283
Unless Agent Gibbs

110
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:30,760
has more questions about
this unfortunate incident.

111
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:37,143
Did I just miss something?

112
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:42,983
The Congressman thinks our
marine was crazy and jumped.

113
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:44,403
DiNozzo...

114
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,319
- Boss?
- Stop eating the evidence.

115
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,778
Right, boss.

116
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,763
Got preliminaries?

117
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:52,431
I find the ones who
fall are the saddest.

118
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:55,384
It's a long last moment
to contemplate one's end.

119
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:58,389
And no chance to change one's mind.

120
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,991
Well, the injuries are
consistent with a fall.

121
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:02,450
But...

122
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,631
scraped knuckles possibly in a fight

123
00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:06,254
before he went over the edge.

124
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:07,928
Missing a shoe. No wallet.

125
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:10,723
Although he had some
dollars in his pocket.

126
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:14,246
And a begging note asking for help.

127
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:18,554
The only real surprise is this.

128
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:22,807
A Bronze Star for valor.

129
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:23,913
And a Purple Heart.

130
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:25,777
With two Marine Stars.

131
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:28,527
It means he was wounded
three times in battle.

132
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,278
I can't tell you why he died,

133
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,044
but I can perhaps tell you how he lived.

134
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:34,935
The man was a hero.

135
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:38,615
Yeah. Gibbs.

136
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:40,011
Hey, boss.

137
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:42,554
Looks like this is where he launched.

138
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:45,264
The shoe must have come off
when he went over the side.

139
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,505
Okay.

140
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:49,126
Nelson said he was back
downstairs when Wright fell.

141
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:51,591
The question is: What
was Sergeant Wright doing?

142
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:53,187
Deciding whether to jump.

143
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:54,073
Photographs.

144
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:55,050
Got it.

145
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:56,595
DiNozzo.

146
00:05:57,477 --> 00:05:58,878
The stairs.

147
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,721
Maybe the Congressman was right.

148
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:05,152
Maybe Sergeant Wright
was crazy and jumped.

149
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:06,698
Or the Director was right.

150
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,285
Politicians lie.

151
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:13,506
And we will need a copy
of his medical records.

152
00:06:14,348 --> 00:06:15,772
You're disgusting.

153
00:06:15,773 --> 00:06:17,789
How can you eat that?

154
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,723
You see, Ziva, the human
body is a finely tuned engine.

155
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:24,295
None more finely tuned than mine.

156
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:26,932
Even the best engine needs oil.

157
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:28,570
DiNozzo.

158
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:31,300
Boss.

159
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:34,005
Anything from the hotel registry?

160
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:42,833
702 names, none of them Sergeant Wright.

161
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,123
Ziva, Congressman's aide.

162
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,612
Single. No criminal record.

163
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,871
He worked for the Congressman
for the past seven years.

164
00:06:48,872 --> 00:06:51,701
And according to Norforce
Systems,a briefing paper

165
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,735
from the Congressman's office
was delivered to their suite,

166
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:56,642
but they can't put a time on it.

167
00:06:56,643 --> 00:06:59,695
Boss, just got off the phone
with Wright's doctor in Bethesda.

168
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:01,449
He did two tours in Iraq.

169
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,821
He was wounded three times.

170
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:03,957
The last time was the worst.

171
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,678
His Humvee was hit by an IED.

172
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:08,041
Suffered shrapnel wounds to the head.

173
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:09,774
He's been in medical
leave for four months.

174
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:11,507
But according to the hospital records,

175
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:13,811
he's missed his last
three weekly appointments.

176
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:15,066
No one noticed?

177
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,657
Said he fell through the cracks.

178
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:17,558
Family?

179
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,273
Divorced, no kids.

180
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:22,251
His doctor said he stayed
with friends, at hostels...

181
00:07:22,252 --> 00:07:23,392
sometimes on the street.

182
00:07:23,393 --> 00:07:24,540
What kind of doctor?

183
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,498
Psychiatrist.

184
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:27,687
- Treated for?
- Depression.

185
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:30,006
Some way to treat a war hero.

186
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:32,218
Thought marines looked after their own.

187
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,508
How does a homeless man

188
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:36,074
get past the security
agents, local cops,

189
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:39,047
hotel staff, into a
locked-down building?

190
00:07:42,154 --> 00:07:44,616
Maybe he was already there.

191
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,109
Luis Romero?

192
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:54,236
Yep.

193
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:57,086
Special Agent Gibbs. NCIS.

194
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:58,256
Is this about the jumper?

195
00:07:58,257 --> 00:07:59,773
So you saw him jump?

196
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:00,743
No.

197
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:03,247
- But you saw him.
- No.

198
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:04,870
Corporal Luis Romero,

199
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:06,770
United States Marine Corps.

200
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:10,541
One tour Afghanistan, honorable
discharge 18 months ago.

201
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:12,785
Since then, hotel
maintenance supervisor.

202
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:14,691
So I'm a former marine.

203
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:16,053
A lot of guys are.

204
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:17,247
Not at this hotel.

205
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,448
We look after our own, don't we...

206
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,732
Luis?

207
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:25,418
All right.

208
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:28,789
We served in the same unit three years
ago. He didn't have a place to sleep.

209
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,906
So where did you put him?

210
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:32,192
We've always got a couple
rooms down for maintenance.

211
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:33,411
I didn't see any harm in it.

212
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,517
How long had he been here?

213
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:37,164
A couple times a week
for the last month.

214
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:40,241
Didn't cause any trouble.

215
00:08:40,242 --> 00:08:41,743
Semper Fi,...

216
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,849
you know.

217
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,379
Show us the room.

218
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:52,908
Wait at the door, please.

219
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:56,187
Anyone else been in here?

220
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:57,711
No, just him.

221
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:06,829
Luis! Luis!

222
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:08,736
Yeah.

223
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:11,173
Luis, algo ha passado !
Tienes que venir pronto!

224
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,946
Um... something's happened.

225
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:20,454
No lo creo, No lo creo !

226
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,488
Luis, ahi, ahi, en el cuarto, en la cama!

227
00:09:25,112 --> 00:09:26,985
Dios mio que...!

228
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:40,186
I understand, Chief,

229
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:42,650
but we believe the two cases are linked.

230
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:44,163
NCIS have any proof?

231
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:47,063
No, not yet, we're still
collecting evidence.

232
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:47,984
You'll send us a report?

233
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:49,526
Yes, absolutely.

234
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:50,448
Okay.

235
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:51,729
And if anything changes,

236
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,472
we will hand over everything we have.

237
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,070
So if you can't tie it together,

238
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:57,472
you'll turn it over to my people.

239
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:58,525
That's right,

240
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:01,740
and cause of death hasn't
been determined yet either.

241
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:02,988
Fair enough. Let me know.

242
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:05,313
Thank you, Chief. I will.

243
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,507
Thank you.

244
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:08,698
You get all that, Jethro?

245
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:09,696
Got it.

246
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:11,813
Metro police will want to see results.

247
00:10:11,814 --> 00:10:12,994
Add him to the list.

248
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,422
It's a long list.

249
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:15,968
And it's getting longer.

250
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:17,484
Working on it.

251
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:19,841
There's something on her cheek.

252
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:22,954
Looks like saliva.

253
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,236
Kiss and kill.

254
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:26,576
Well, no bag. Maybe the killer took it.

255
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:28,372
Maybe she just didn't have a bag.

256
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:30,278
Every woman has a bag.

257
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,722
Do I have a bag, McGee?

258
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,447
No, but you're not a...

259
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,673
I mean, you're a woman.
You're just, you're not a...

260
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,705
not a normal...

261
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,681
You're right. Every
woman does not have a bag.

262
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:49,613
How old?

263
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:52,568
No I.D., no pocketbook and no bag

264
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,570
either.

265
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:55,838
The room was booked to Michael Lo.

266
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,807
Sounds Asian. Single occupancy.

267
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:01,097
Room was paid for in cash in advance.

268
00:11:01,098 --> 00:11:02,311
Sounds fake.

269
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:05,312
They're gonna review the security
tapes to send us what they got.

270
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,444
Boss?

271
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:16,473
Mr. Romero,

272
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:18,637
recognize this?

273
00:11:18,638 --> 00:11:21,322
It's, um, key card I
gave Sergeant Wright.

274
00:11:21,323 --> 00:11:24,248
It's a master key. It opens
up every room in the hotel.

275
00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:36,099
You okay?

276
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,668
Never better.

277
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:39,917
You look run-over.

278
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:42,027
The term is "run-down."

279
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,374
I do?

280
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:47,801
Maybe you need servicing.

281
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:49,605
Clearly, we're still
having some problems

282
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:51,997
with the idiosyncrasies
of the English language.

283
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:55,303
The "finely tuned engine,"
I think you called it.

284
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,128
You should see a doctor.

285
00:12:10,238 --> 00:12:11,540
Hello.

286
00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:12,738
Hi.

287
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:14,862
Yeah.

288
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:17,452
No, it's not a bad time.

289
00:12:17,913 --> 00:12:19,742
This afternoon would be great.

290
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,896
Well, I will see you then.

291
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:25,281
Okay, bye.

292
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,512
Two cell phones, huh?

293
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,202
Uh, one for each ear.

294
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,408
No, it's a spare.

295
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:38,245
This one sort of been on the fritz.

296
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,982
That's another word you probably
don't know the meaning of.

297
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:41,655
Acts up?

298
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:43,109
I'm impressed.

299
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:45,329
All right.

300
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,120
I'm heading out...

301
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,988
to go see the doctor
about being run over...

302
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,251
down.

303
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:56,094
Don't forget Fritz.

304
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:04,278
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

305
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:09,833
Fingerprints solve ten
times more cases than DNA.

306
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:11,584
Did you know that, McGee?

307
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:13,463
Yeah, I told you.

308
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:14,472
You did?

309
00:13:14,473 --> 00:13:15,554
Yeah.

310
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:17,109
You did!

311
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:18,778
Got to love fingerprints.

312
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,060
Especially this one from the key card.

313
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:22,890
Pristine index...

314
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:25,442
with an almost perfect whorl and three,

315
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:27,692
count 'em, three, McGee,

316
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:29,758
equally spaced deltas.

317
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:31,498
It's a work of art.

318
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:33,395
Then we have the short and curlies.

319
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,102
The hair, there's no
follicle and no DNA,

320
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:39,292
so I am checking it for drug history.

321
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:41,055
If it is Sergeant Wright's,

322
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:43,328
considering his
extensive medical records,

323
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:45,934
this should read like
a drugstore inventory.

324
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:49,811
And if it doesn't, he ain't our man.

325
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:54,028
What price valor?

326
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:55,438
18 bucks.

327
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:56,350
For real.

328
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,970
I looked it up on eBay,
Bronze Star, 18 bucks.

329
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:03,028
No wonder he got depressed and
started living on the streets.

330
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:04,537
And begging.

331
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:06,478
One minute you're a
hero, the next you're a...

332
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,661
...suspect.

333
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:10,250
But don't give up on him yet, McGee.

334
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:14,734
Nope.

335
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:17,910
Where's Gibbs?

336
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:20,874
What am I looking at?

337
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:21,981
Nothing.

338
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:23,116
Nothing.

339
00:14:23,546 --> 00:14:25,261
Nothing's good, right?

340
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:26,502
Oh, yeah, nothing is very good.

341
00:14:26,503 --> 00:14:28,624
If this was Wright's hair,

342
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,282
then it'd be like looking in
a window of his drug history,

343
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:32,851
but all this shows is...

344
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:34,508
Unknown trace elements.

345
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:37,171
Too minute to be picked up
by the mass spec equipment.

346
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:38,531
So it's probably not Wright's.

347
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:40,002
But we can't be sure they're not there

348
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:41,420
unless we get a better microscope.

349
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:43,504
We're talking nanoparticles here, Gibbs.

350
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:44,204
We need a...

351
00:14:44,205 --> 00:14:46,539
An infrared microspectroscopy unit.

352
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,829
It's the only thing that
gets down to the nano level.

353
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,043
Okay, get one.

354
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:51,917
They cost about a hundred grand.

355
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:52,741
Yeah, so?

356
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:54,310
So it's not in the budget.

357
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,551
Maybe next year.

358
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:57,228
She needs one now.

359
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,817
Sorry.

360
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,121
I could haggle.

361
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:03,318
My Uncle Horace, he was a great haggler.

362
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,463
They used to call him
Horace the Haggler.

363
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:09,728
I could borrow one.

364
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:13,827
I'll try and borrow one.

365
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:17,775
It's the fingerprint from the key card.

366
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:21,278
It's not good. It puts him
in the dead girl's room.

367
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,262
Sorry, Jethro.

368
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:24,044
Find out who owns that.

369
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:25,540
Come on.

370
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,347
Don't start.

371
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:27,814
Do you know how many
people want money from me?

372
00:15:27,815 --> 00:15:29,692
Did I say anything?

373
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:31,088
How are you going to get loaned

374
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:34,039
an infrared microspectroscopy unit?

375
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:36,627
Good question, McGee.

376
00:15:37,655 --> 00:15:39,338
Good question.

377
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:40,857
I love playing windows-shopping.

378
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,054
How about you?

379
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:45,143
Oh, yeah, me, too.

380
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:48,386
Only when I'm with you.

381
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:49,737
Cold?

382
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:52,048
It's invigorating.

383
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:52,970
Chilly.

384
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:54,001
Freezing.

385
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,940
Oh Poor Tony.I drag you out
here to go window-shopping.

386
00:15:56,941 --> 00:15:59,049
Next time maybe you should choose.

387
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:01,379
Hot tub.

388
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,981
I know something else
we could do to stay warm.

389
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:06,134
- Really?
- Mm.

390
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,608
- I wonder what that could be.
- One cappuccino,

391
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:09,018
one latte.

392
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:09,826
Coffee?

393
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:11,838
Mm, dancing.

394
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:14,390
Dancing.

395
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,148
Dancing would make you warm.

396
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:17,833
Then tonight we dance.

397
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:20,438
Tonight?

398
00:16:21,076 --> 00:16:23,114
Don't tell me you have to work.

399
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:26,995
Tonight, dancing, tomorrow, work.

400
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,888
You don't seem too happy about that.

401
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:31,417
I'm worried.

402
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:33,521
Worried about what?

403
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:35,546
Well,...

404
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:39,348
we're going dancing tonight and
I haven't got a thing to wear.

405
00:16:40,114 --> 00:16:42,408
Has anyone ever told
you you're an idiot?

406
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,713
Yeah, my boss, all the time.

407
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:11,685
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

408
00:17:11,686 --> 00:17:12,988
Excuse me.²²

409
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,581
Yes!

410
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:19,389
Just leave it on the table.

411
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:24,218
That's not juice.

412
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:29,863
Well, the coffee bean comes
from the coffee cherry, so

413
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:32,286
that's technically a fruit,

414
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:34,306
so the case could be made that...

415
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:36,956
coffee is more fruit than bean.

416
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,374
It's coffee juice.

417
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,261
Caf-Pow.

418
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:41,009
Caf-Pow!?

419
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,784
Yeah, two words
hyphenated in the middle.

420
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:45,604
Can I help you with something?

421
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:46,814
I was hoping to get a...

422
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:51,520
demonstration of your infrared
microspectroscopy unit.

423
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,595
You don't work here?

424
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:55,524
Like this place would hire me?

425
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:57,753
Sorry. I'll set up a sample.

426
00:17:57,754 --> 00:17:59,911
No, no, I have one.

427
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,095
I brought my own.

428
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:06,831
I work for NCIS in D.C.,

429
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:08,708
but we don't have
anything that can get down

430
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:09,848
to the nanogram level,

431
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:12,798
which is what I need to figure out what
the hell is going on with my sample.

432
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,155
You don't mind that
I said "hell," do you?

433
00:18:15,156 --> 00:18:15,864
Hell, no.

434
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:18,199
Oh, good. I mean,
some people do, then...

435
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,257
you get into the whole hell and death and
dying mortality thing and it freaks them out.

436
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:23,845
Can you help me?

437
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:25,230
If you want to leave it with me...

438
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:26,596
No, I can't.

439
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:27,651
Chain of evidence.

440
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:29,991
I have to do it with you.

441
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:32,723
Uh, not with you, but alongside you.

442
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:35,183
I have to be with you. I have to...

443
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:38,625
be with you while you
do it. While you test it.

444
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:40,996
I normally like to know
who it is I'm working with.

445
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:42,134
Marty Pearson.

446
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:44,554
Abby Sciuto.

447
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:46,449
Nanograms, eh?

448
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,889
Yes.

449
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,595
Pesky little nanograms.

450
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,448
- Is that a...?
- Yes, it is.

451
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:52,994
Cool.

452
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:03,117
Wright, Sergeant
Brian. Records, medical.

453
00:19:03,118 --> 00:19:04,672
Oh, splendid.

454
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:07,942
Uh, I'm a little post-autopsy.

455
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:09,752
Mr. Palmer will sign it.

456
00:19:09,753 --> 00:19:10,603
Sure.

457
00:19:10,604 --> 00:19:13,810
We must get you down here
more often, Agent Lee.

458
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:16,585
Always room for another
bright young mind.

459
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:18,839
Not that there's anything
wrong with the legal department.

460
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,078
It's an essential cog in
the engine, so to speak.

461
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,774
It can't be much fun for
a hands-on type like you.

462
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:28,289
You think?

463
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:33,383
Done?

464
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:34,829
Done indeed.

465
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:38,289
Intrigue, mystery and a surprise or two.

466
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:43,388
Yes, I've estimated our
victim's age at about 14.

467
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:46,994
Death was due to strangulation.
She had bleeding in her throat

468
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:50,628
and the hyoid bone was fractured.

469
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:56,427
Some bruising on the sternum
that has me a bit puzzled.

470
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,017
Possibly postmortem.

471
00:19:58,018 --> 00:19:58,708
Conscious?

472
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:02,111
Superficial scratching
and ante mortem bruising

473
00:20:02,112 --> 00:20:05,469
suggests that she put
up a struggle of sorts.

474
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,863
But toxicology indicates
that she was drugged

475
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:10,414
and for some time.

476
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:11,633
Hours?

477
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:13,223
Possibly days.

478
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:16,134
There are traces of
sedatives and Rohypnol,

479
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:18,884
the drug of choice for date-rapists.

480
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:22,902
And before you ask the
question, yes, she was,

481
00:20:22,903 --> 00:20:25,651
but he must have worn a condom.

482
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:30,031
The really good news is
that I've identified her.

483
00:20:30,032 --> 00:20:30,758
By name?

484
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,131
No, by country.

485
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:33,895
She's Chinese.

486
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:36,247
Yes, you're less than impressed.

487
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:38,388
But what if I told you
that four weeks ago,

488
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:40,443
she was working on the family farm

489
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:43,044
in a coastal region of southern China

490
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:46,043
in Fujian province, to be precise?

491
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,948
Well, now you have my attention, Doctor.

492
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:50,279
It was her extremities
that gave her away.

493
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,646
The Chinese dentistry
is quite distinctive.

494
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:59,207
Her dental work is very new.
Five or maybe six weeks ago and...

495
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,333
her feet are calloused.

496
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:04,049
Indicates that she was a farm worker.

497
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:09,430
We also found traces of chromium
six in her digestive tract.

498
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:11,194
It's a byproduct of chlorate.

499
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:13,781
Causes cancer and respiratory problems.

500
00:21:13,782 --> 00:21:19,262
Guess where the biggest chlorate
chemical factory is in Asia.

501
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:20,529
Fujian province.

502
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,082
Well, there you have it,

503
00:21:23,773 --> 00:21:26,005
the body as road map.

504
00:21:26,006 --> 00:21:27,202
Anything else?

505
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,390
Yes.

506
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:30,862
Her likely killer...

507
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:34,370
Sergeant Brian Wright.

508
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:39,318
We had a positive DNA match from
the saliva we swabbed from her.

509
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:43,308
I'm afraid our hero is
more than a little tarnished.

510
00:21:49,803 --> 00:21:51,061
How does a homeless guy

511
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:53,878
staying illegally in a
hotel order room service?

512
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,770
This wouldn't be a trick
question, would it, Probie?

513
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:56,842
No.

514
00:21:56,843 --> 00:21:58,625
He calls room service.

515
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,548
Room service, hi.

516
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:05,411
This is the homeless guy
staying illegally in room 607.

517
00:22:05,412 --> 00:22:07,041
Yes, the room shut down for maintenance.

518
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,512
I'd like to order some breakfast.

519
00:22:08,513 --> 00:22:10,382
That was definitely a trick question.

520
00:22:10,383 --> 00:22:12,231
So give me a tricky answer.

521
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:14,002
Somebody brought it to him.

522
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:15,482
Not very tricky.

523
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:17,183
I got to talk to Ducky.

524
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:19,515
I'm gonna go talk to Ducky.

525
00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:24,601
What is with everybody today?

526
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:28,243
Hallway camera D.

527
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:30,670
The title needs work, who's in it?

528
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:32,846
Hopefully, the Asian
guy who booked the room.

529
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,662
Looks like the doctor kept you...

530
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:36,373
Busy waiting room.

531
00:22:36,603 --> 00:22:39,433
Lot of sleeping sickness going around.

532
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:41,241
Or lack of sleeping sickness.

533
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:43,509
Ducky thinks our victim
is a Chinese national.

534
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,552
Probably in the country
less than a few weeks.

535
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:48,733
Well, her fingerprints drew a
negative on the immigration database,

536
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,037
so she's here illegally.

537
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,729
Smuggled in, maybe for the sex trade.

538
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,807
Asian, cute, underage.

539
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:56,110
It's a gold mine.

540
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:57,121
Pimp pays cash,

541
00:22:57,122 --> 00:22:59,433
sets her up in a room during
a nice, big convention,

542
00:22:59,434 --> 00:23:00,744
feeds her clients.

543
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:01,940
And then one of them kills her.

544
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:04,076
Sergeant Wright doesn't
fit that profile.

545
00:23:04,077 --> 00:23:05,831
Wright didn't need to
pay to get into the room.

546
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:07,435
He had a magic key.

547
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:10,128
He saw an opportunity, he took it.

548
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:12,981
Perhaps because of his
mental state, he lost control,

549
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:15,064
and afterwards, regret,
and he took his own life.

550
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:16,198
Fits the facts, boss.

551
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,289
Only the facts we know, DiNozzo.

552
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,361
Any word from Abby?

553
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:20,758
Not a peep.

554
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:23,442
I've got to get one of these babies.

555
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,406
Looks like trace elements of
aluminum hydroxide and formalin.

556
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:29,179
Aluminum hydroxide stimulates
the immune system and..

557
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,801
formalin is a preservative.

558
00:23:30,802 --> 00:23:34,320
It's also used to initiate
antibody formation in vaccines.

559
00:23:36,155 --> 00:23:38,032
- Did I just say something funny?
- No.

560
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:39,428
No, I-I just...

561
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:41,661
it's just that we're having
this conversation about stuff

562
00:23:41,662 --> 00:23:44,071
that usually makes people
run screaming from the room,

563
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:45,091
but...

564
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:48,223
we're talking about it like it
was last night's football game.

565
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,822
You don't like football, do you?

566
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:51,923
- No.
- Oh, good.

567
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:53,877
It's just nice that you understand

568
00:23:53,878 --> 00:23:56,180
without having to go find a dictionary.

569
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:57,620
So you said vaccines?

570
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:58,941
I said vaccines.

571
00:23:58,942 --> 00:24:00,364
That's got to be it.

572
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,170
A vaccine for what?

573
00:24:02,171 --> 00:24:03,951
Aluminum hydroxide
is used as an adjuvant

574
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:05,945
in hepatitis A and Lyme disease.

575
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,726
There's traces of chloride.

576
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:09,642
Not just any old chloride.

577
00:24:09,854 --> 00:24:11,271
Benzethonium chloride.

578
00:24:11,272 --> 00:24:12,612
It's a preservative.

579
00:24:12,613 --> 00:24:14,837
Aluminum hydroxide,formalin

580
00:24:14,838 --> 00:24:16,955
and benzethonium chloride.

581
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,541
I know that combination.

582
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,765
- How do you know that combination?
- I don't know.

583
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:22,856
It must have come through
my lab or something.

584
00:24:22,857 --> 00:24:23,964
The only thing I can think of using

585
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:27,301
benzethonium chloride for
as a preservative is...

586
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:30,176
anthrax vaccine.

587
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,407
Ooh, anthrax.

588
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:33,463
Breathe in the spores and you die.

589
00:24:33,464 --> 00:24:35,851
You don't have an unhealthy
obsession with death now, do you?

590
00:24:35,852 --> 00:24:38,377
Oh, no, no, it's just a hobby.

591
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:40,786
Anthrax vaccine, that's why I knew it.

592
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:42,861
I got one right here.

593
00:24:42,923 --> 00:24:44,881
Ow, pain-memory response.

594
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:47,171
So, good or bad for your Marine?

595
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:48,270
It's bad.

596
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:49,165
It's very bad.

597
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,999
A lot of Marines were vaccinated

598
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,470
for anthrax after 9/11.

599
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:54,505
I have to make a phone call.

600
00:24:58,625 --> 00:24:59,838
Boss, hey.

601
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,415
Sergeant Wright's autopsy report?

602
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,562
Yeah, just, um, checking something.

603
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:06,107
Something didn't fit.

604
00:25:06,108 --> 00:25:09,412
It's just a theory, but
it's about what Wright ate.

605
00:25:09,413 --> 00:25:10,210
What'd he eat?

606
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:11,380
Nothing.

607
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:14,091
Not since the night
before. I asked Ducky.

608
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:17,303
But the room service tray
on the bed was half-finished,

609
00:25:17,304 --> 00:25:18,629
which raises another question.

610
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,443
How did he get room service
if he wasn't supposed

611
00:25:20,444 --> 00:25:22,313
to be in the room in the first place?

612
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:23,810
Yeah, go on.

613
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:26,216
People leave trays outside their doors.

614
00:25:26,217 --> 00:25:28,183
I think that he found one
that was half-finished.

615
00:25:28,184 --> 00:25:30,044
He took it back to his room.

616
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:32,438
Something must have happened
before he could eat it.

617
00:25:33,926 --> 00:25:35,592
Wright's begging note.

618
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:40,294
Or somebody else's.

619
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:42,564
Hidden under a plate on the tray?

620
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,682
And he found it.

621
00:25:43,683 --> 00:25:45,472
Must be why he went back to the room.

622
00:25:45,473 --> 00:25:47,555
Once a hero, always a hero.

623
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:52,228
McGee.

624
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:53,620
McGee, it's Abby.

625
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:55,848
I need you to pull
Wright's medical records.

626
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:57,347
One second.

627
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:00,550
Got it. What do you need?

628
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:02,234
Check it for an anthrax vaccine.

629
00:26:02,235 --> 00:26:03,689
Let's see.

630
00:26:06,138 --> 00:26:06,926
It's a negative.

631
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:07,839
Yes!

632
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,010
Oh, McGee, it's not Wright's sample.

633
00:26:10,011 --> 00:26:11,646
I'll tell him. Thank you.

634
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:12,460
Boss.

635
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:14,273
A hair found on the victim

636
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:15,788
indicates the killer
had an anthrax vaccine.

637
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:17,350
Wright never had one.

638
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,780
Chalk another one up to science.

639
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:25,980
Ah, I could not have
done it without the IMS.

640
00:26:25,981 --> 00:26:27,044
And...

641
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:28,061
and you.

642
00:26:28,062 --> 00:26:30,498
So... who do I make the receipt out to?

643
00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:32,321
Oh, um...

644
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:33,980
Well, I feel really bad, Marty,

645
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:35,994
and you worked really hard on this.

646
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:37,413
I, um...

647
00:26:40,656 --> 00:26:42,029
Hmm. Do you bowl?

648
00:26:43,606 --> 00:26:45,130
Are you kidding me?

649
00:26:45,131 --> 00:26:47,314
I am the queen of the alley.

650
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:49,011
You know, they got a bowling
alley right downstairs.

651
00:26:49,012 --> 00:26:50,278
In the hotel?

652
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,334
Right next to the indoor pool.

653
00:26:52,884 --> 00:26:54,018
Or...

654
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:56,331
we could do dinner.

655
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:57,957
Oh, no.

656
00:26:58,382 --> 00:27:01,088
You're just afraid of getting
your butt kicked on the lanes.

657
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:02,870
You are on, lady.

658
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:06,950
I can't believe you bowl.

659
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:07,756
Why not?

660
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:10,606
Well, it's just, it's
such a coincidence.

661
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,829
Are you a three-quarter
or a full-roller?

662
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,305
Makes no difference to me.

663
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:16,610
I got a delicate touch.

664
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:19,878
So the hair wasn't Wright's,

665
00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:22,643
but the saliva
definitely was. DNA match.

666
00:27:22,644 --> 00:27:24,069
He was kissing the girl.

667
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,001
There's more than one
reason to kiss a girl.

668
00:27:26,002 --> 00:27:27,261
There is?

669
00:27:35,408 --> 00:27:36,462
Autopsy.

670
00:27:36,463 --> 00:27:38,074
- Got a question for you.
- I can't guarantee...

671
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:39,275
I got an answer.

672
00:27:39,276 --> 00:27:40,170
The bruising on the girl's

673
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:42,244
sternum could it be from CPR?

674
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:43,848
Very possibly.

675
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,318
This is most

676
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:47,516
probable when you weigh
all the other evidence.

677
00:27:47,517 --> 00:27:49,235
It would explain how Wright's

678
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:51,734
saliva came to be on her.

679
00:27:51,735 --> 00:27:53,249
I'll have to confirm that, of course,

680
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,240
but yes, that could
be your answer:CPR.

681
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,863
Which means Wright
wasn't trying to kill her.

682
00:27:58,872 --> 00:28:00,865
He was trying to save her.

683
00:28:00,866 --> 00:28:03,008
Let me know when you get a confirmation.

684
00:28:03,927 --> 00:28:06,252
So we're looking for someone
with an anthrax vaccine.

685
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:07,338
Instead of one suspect,

686
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:10,116
we now have half a million,
all of them military.

687
00:28:10,117 --> 00:28:10,975
Maintenance guy?

688
00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:12,344
Fixing a leak in the kitchen.

689
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:14,174
Chefs were tripping over him all day.

690
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:15,787
Scratch Romero.

691
00:28:15,788 --> 00:28:18,197
After 9/11, anthrax was
sent through the mail.

692
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,563
Most people at risk were vaccinated.

693
00:28:20,564 --> 00:28:22,628
Pentagon officials,
senators, congressmen.

694
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:24,023
Everybody at the reception.

695
00:28:24,024 --> 00:28:26,315
And people who open their mail.

696
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,622
Yes, I had an anthrax vaccination,

697
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,951
Along with...

698
00:28:29,952 --> 00:28:32,441
most everyone on the Hill, Agent Gibbs.

699
00:28:32,442 --> 00:28:34,804
They were troubling times.

700
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,438
They still are.

701
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:37,976
After you delivered the briefing papers

702
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:39,991
to Norforce Systems, what did you do?

703
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:41,882
I walked down the hallway

704
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:43,690
toward the elevator and...

705
00:28:43,691 --> 00:28:45,579
that's where Wright attacked me.

706
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:48,715
Norforce Systems' suite was
right next to the elevator.

707
00:28:48,716 --> 00:28:50,642
Do you want to try this again?

708
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:52,334
Do I need a lawyer?

709
00:28:52,335 --> 00:28:54,515
Only if you're feeling guilty.

710
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,368
You were walking towards
the elevator, because

711
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:58,875
you were not coming
from Norforce Systems,

712
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:00,861
you were coming from a
room down the hallway.

713
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:01,757
- No.
- Yes,...

714
00:29:01,758 --> 00:29:04,042
a room where an
underage girl was killed.

715
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:05,619
And you think I'm responsible?

716
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,958
If you're not...

717
00:29:07,588 --> 00:29:10,325
then you won't mind
giving us a hair sample.

718
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:12,221
The killer left a calling card and...

719
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:14,216
we think your name is on it.

720
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:33,210
This is outrageous.

721
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:34,140
I was attacked

722
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:36,510
by a violent, unstable man.

723
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:37,653
If you're looking for a murderer,

724
00:29:37,654 --> 00:29:39,576
you should be looking at him and not me.

725
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,061
Are you refusing to voluntarily

726
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:42,912
give us a hair sample, Mr. Nelson?

727
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:44,755
'Cause if you are, we can
just get a court order.

728
00:29:44,756 --> 00:29:47,008
I didn't kill anyone.

729
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:49,905
Boss.

730
00:29:56,976 --> 00:29:58,136
8:17.

731
00:29:58,137 --> 00:29:59,975
They're all reacting to the same thing.

732
00:29:59,976 --> 00:30:01,450
Wright dropping in for breakfast?

733
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:02,514
Nelson might have killed the girl,

734
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:04,871
but there's no way he killed Wrigth, boss.

735
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,954
I want to make a phone call.

736
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:22,606
Lawyer?

737
00:30:22,607 --> 00:30:24,741
Someone much more powerful.

738
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:26,098
Your boss?

739
00:30:27,223 --> 00:30:30,151
Underage, illegal, dead.

740
00:30:30,152 --> 00:30:32,597
You really think your
boss wants to talk to you?

741
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:35,699
Did you kill her before or after

742
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,285
you pushed Sergeant Wright?

743
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:38,932
I didn't kill her.

744
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:40,492
I didn't push Sergeant Wright.

745
00:30:40,493 --> 00:30:43,416
I was on the ground
floor when he jumped.

746
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:45,038
He went to the room.

747
00:30:45,517 --> 00:30:47,540
Trying to save her, you attacked him.

748
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:48,542
No.

749
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:49,872
You raped her.

750
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:52,446
You killed her.

751
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:55,733
You threw Sergeant
Wright off of the balcony.

752
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:58,848
I never saw Sergeant Wright!

753
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:02,029
Then how did he attack you?

754
00:31:09,596 --> 00:31:11,598
She hit me with the lamp.

755
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,998
I was just trying...

756
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:14,855
just trying to stop her.

757
00:31:14,856 --> 00:31:17,854
I- I had to explain this
somehow,so I said...

758
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:20,286
Wright... attacked me.

759
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:21,944
Who took you up to her room?

760
00:31:21,945 --> 00:31:22,825
No one.

761
00:31:22,826 --> 00:31:24,129
I, uh...

762
00:31:25,432 --> 00:31:27,561
I met him o-outside the hotel.

763
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:28,785
Pais him,

764
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:31,035
and he gave me the key card.

765
00:31:31,036 --> 00:31:32,573
Regular client?

766
00:31:32,574 --> 00:31:34,523
Different girls every time?

767
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,220
Different girls.

768
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:40,229
I ran into him downstairs...

769
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:42,090
at the elevator.

770
00:31:42,139 --> 00:31:43,941
And I told him she was dead.

771
00:31:43,942 --> 00:31:45,440
He went up.

772
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:46,694
Name.

773
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:51,696
Name!

774
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:53,684
Davey Chen Importing Company.

775
00:31:53,685 --> 00:31:54,912
Kept himself pretty clean.

776
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,471
A couple of misdemeanors, no felonies,

777
00:31:56,472 --> 00:31:57,725
nothing to suggest he was involved

778
00:31:57,726 --> 00:31:59,395
in the sex trade of underage girls.

779
00:31:59,396 --> 00:32:00,990
Got enough to arrest him for murder?

780
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:02,177
No physical evidence.

781
00:32:02,178 --> 00:32:03,320
His word against Nelson's.

782
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,522
Let's go kick his door
down and find some evidence.

783
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,454
We do that, Tony, we lose those girls.

784
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:08,570
Could have lost them already.

785
00:32:08,571 --> 00:32:10,724
Slave traders move
their girls all the time.

786
00:32:10,725 --> 00:32:13,409
They could be on their
way to Vegas now, or dead.

787
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,350
Send someone in undercover.

788
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:16,919
I'll do it.

789
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,857
No.

790
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:19,896
We need someone closer to home.

791
00:32:20,162 --> 00:32:21,641
- DiNozzo.
- Boss.

792
00:32:21,642 --> 00:32:23,164
Give me $25,000.

793
00:32:23,165 --> 00:32:23,918
Check or plastic?

794
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,594
- Cash.
- On it.

795
00:32:26,706 --> 00:32:29,001
Mr. Palmer, where did you and...?

796
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:36,444
Oh, sorry, Doctor.

797
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:39,553
Where did you and Agent Lee go?

798
00:32:39,554 --> 00:32:41,561
I didn't go anywhere with Agent Lee.

799
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:43,360
I signed Sergeant
Wright's medical records

800
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,840
and then she left.

801
00:32:45,106 --> 00:32:47,582
Did she sprint out of here?

802
00:32:48,014 --> 00:32:49,531
She was in a hurry.

803
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:51,480
Well, evidently so were you.

804
00:32:51,481 --> 00:32:54,307
When I looked up from washing my hands,

805
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,142
both you and she had disappeared

806
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:58,558
and Agent Gibbs was standing here.

807
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,061
Where did you hurry off to?

808
00:33:03,643 --> 00:33:04,670
The restroom.

809
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:07,679
And you've been in there all this time?

810
00:33:08,078 --> 00:33:12,813
I have a gastrointestinal challenge.

811
00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:15,915
Oh, well, I believe there's a bottle

812
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:17,970
of subsalicylate...

813
00:33:17,971 --> 00:33:19,548
I drank that.

814
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:21,019
What?

815
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,024
All of it?

816
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:23,362
I didn't want to spend the whole day

817
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:24,345
sitting in the restroom.

818
00:33:24,346 --> 00:33:25,656
That won't hurt me, will it?

819
00:33:25,657 --> 00:33:26,978
Well, no, but you're going to feel

820
00:33:26,979 --> 00:33:29,600
as if you've been on
bread and water for a week.

821
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:30,389
Pardon?

822
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,825
Well, the old naval punishment

823
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:33,340
of bread and water for a week

824
00:33:33,341 --> 00:33:34,740
was not to punish

825
00:33:34,741 --> 00:33:37,703
by depriving the
offending sailor of food,

826
00:33:37,704 --> 00:33:40,854
as much as to plug up his
gastrointestinal tract.

827
00:33:40,855 --> 00:33:43,405
Oh! that is awful!

828
00:33:43,406 --> 00:33:44,345
I... aw!

829
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:47,252
Mr. Palmer, I'm not deaf.

830
00:33:47,253 --> 00:33:49,316
I'm sorry, Doctor.
It's just the thought of

831
00:33:49,317 --> 00:33:52,184
punishing someone that
way, just sound so...

832
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:54,186
uncivilized.

833
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:57,697
Did those doors just open and shut?

834
00:33:58,717 --> 00:34:00,391
I don't think so, no.

835
00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:02,585
Strange.

836
00:34:04,277 --> 00:34:06,289
Very strange.

837
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:10,041
It's just that she's never
been undercover, boss.

838
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:12,261
She's a highly trained
NCIS special agent.

839
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:13,741
She's more probie than even Probie.

840
00:34:13,742 --> 00:34:15,645
She's got excellent back-up.

841
00:34:15,646 --> 00:34:16,674
Me?

842
00:34:17,113 --> 00:34:18,265
Ziva.

843
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,383
You are causing quite
a stir on the Hill.

844
00:34:21,384 --> 00:34:22,514
Underage dead girls

845
00:34:22,515 --> 00:34:25,060
and congressional aides
make people nervous.

846
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:26,071
Good.

847
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:28,194
She looks the part.

848
00:34:28,256 --> 00:34:29,190
Just like a...

849
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:30,201
Whore?

850
00:34:30,316 --> 00:34:31,813
Courtesan.

851
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:34,596
Are you sure you're ready for this?

852
00:34:35,225 --> 00:34:36,642
I saw the girl in autopsy.

853
00:34:36,643 --> 00:34:38,424
Yeah, I'm ready.

854
00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:40,683
Okay. McGee.

855
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,119
Separate radio transmitter and GPS

856
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,519
built into the lining.

857
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,650
Pressure switch on
the handle turns it off

858
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:47,944
if they sweep for bugs.

859
00:34:47,945 --> 00:34:49,787
Turns it back on when they're finished.

860
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,975
Chen's going to be
suspicious of everyone.

861
00:34:51,976 --> 00:34:55,211
Particularly if someone
like Agent Lee shows up.

862
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,425
We need something else, McGee.

863
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,066
Got just the thing.

864
00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:08,516
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey.

865
00:35:19,942 --> 00:35:20,845
DiNozzo...

866
00:35:20,846 --> 00:35:22,370
In position, boss.

867
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:24,304
What's the problem?

868
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:26,528
Don't worry, I'll fix it.

869
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:28,186
But tell me this...

870
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:31,336
Why is he asking you about this?

871
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:33,498
How can you be so stupid?

872
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,054
You have to listen to me!

873
00:35:36,138 --> 00:35:38,088
Target has entered the building.

874
00:35:42,926 --> 00:35:44,867
GPS locked on.

875
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,745
MTAC standing by, Agent
Gibbs. It's your call.

876
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,439
We are in play.

877
00:35:52,385 --> 00:35:53,925
Excuse me.

878
00:35:54,024 --> 00:35:55,503
We're closed.

879
00:35:55,504 --> 00:35:57,581
Even for a cash customer,

880
00:35:57,582 --> 00:35:59,275
Mr. Chen?

881
00:36:01,937 --> 00:36:03,373
What do you want?

882
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:07,431
And who are you?

883
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:10,032
I don't know you or your sister.

884
00:36:11,618 --> 00:36:14,108
Maybe this will help you remember.

885
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,923
Lee's killed the transmission.

886
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,641
They're sweeping her for bugs.

887
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:21,091
She'll resume the
transmission when it's clear.

888
00:36:21,642 --> 00:36:22,336
Stand by, Tony.

889
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:24,135
No contact in 30
seconds, we're going in.

890
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:25,292
Got you, boss.

891
00:36:25,293 --> 00:36:27,124
15 seconds.

892
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,147
20 seconds...

893
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,160
25 seconds.

894
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,549
Come on, Lee, turn us back on.

895
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:41,969
$25,000.

896
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,968
Another 25 when I get my sister back.

897
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,558
And what makes you
think I have your sister?

898
00:36:49,218 --> 00:36:52,186
Must be another Davey
Chen I'm looking for.

899
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:54,720
What's her name?

900
00:36:56,604 --> 00:36:59,517
She's 14 years old from Fujian Province.

901
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:01,139
I don't know what you call her,

902
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,027
by my family calls her Xiu Mei.

903
00:37:03,028 --> 00:37:04,551
You're a long way from home.

904
00:37:04,552 --> 00:37:05,716
So is she.

905
00:37:05,717 --> 00:37:08,672
But I wasn't abducted
off my parent's farm.

906
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:12,757
Too old.

907
00:37:13,616 --> 00:37:16,204
That's a lot of money for
the daughter of a farmer.

908
00:37:16,598 --> 00:37:18,617
I work in Shanghai.
I'm good at what I do.

909
00:37:18,618 --> 00:37:21,318
American businessmen
show their appreciation.

910
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:23,570
Do we have a deal?

911
00:37:25,648 --> 00:37:26,915
Come with me.

912
00:37:33,437 --> 00:37:34,721
Game on.

913
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:44,556
We've lost the signal.

914
00:37:44,557 --> 00:37:46,161
She turned it off?

915
00:37:46,546 --> 00:37:48,017
I can't tell.

916
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:50,933
Who do you work for?

917
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:54,433
I'm here for my sister.

918
00:38:01,514 --> 00:38:02,949
Talk to me, McGee.

919
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,837
Yeah, working on it, boss.

920
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,043
FBI?

921
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,514
Police?

922
00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:24,592
You don't think I came alone, do you?

923
00:38:25,586 --> 00:38:27,252
You're alone now.

924
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,276
They can't hear you.

925
00:38:29,418 --> 00:38:30,746
This room...

926
00:38:30,747 --> 00:38:32,901
is protected against bugs.

927
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:37,521
That's her back-up camera.

928
00:38:37,522 --> 00:38:38,841
There's interference.

929
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:41,162
They're in a screened room.
It's jamming the signal.

930
00:38:41,163 --> 00:38:42,766
Gibbs, we've got a problem.

931
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:45,461
DiNozzo, cover the back
door. We're going in.

932
00:38:46,188 --> 00:38:47,340
Got it.

933
00:38:47,588 --> 00:38:48,597
She's moving.

934
00:38:48,598 --> 00:38:50,193
Exiting a door.

935
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:05,207
Clear.

936
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,351
Clear.

937
00:39:16,235 --> 00:39:17,308
Clear.

938
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:19,305
DiNozzo, they're gone. Anything?

939
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:21,436
Nothing, boss. They
didn't come out this way.

940
00:39:21,437 --> 00:39:24,365
We're only getting
intermittent video signals.

941
00:39:24,366 --> 00:39:26,261
Aerial surveillance is negative.

942
00:39:26,262 --> 00:39:28,442
They're definitely on the move.

943
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:33,293
Gibbs, check for a basement entrance.

944
00:39:33,294 --> 00:39:34,781
They've gone underground.

945
00:39:34,782 --> 00:39:36,145
What exactly are we looking for?

946
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:37,324
Trapdoor.

947
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:38,610
Anything.

948
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:44,702
All right, we're getting picture back.

949
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:50,249
Maybe some kind of tunnel.

950
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:00,177
There.

951
00:40:00,762 --> 00:40:02,216
Playing it back.

952
00:40:06,026 --> 00:40:08,392
T-O-L-L...

953
00:40:08,393 --> 00:40:09,737
something.

954
00:40:09,738 --> 00:40:11,262
Could be an I.

955
00:40:11,263 --> 00:40:12,440
Maybe a K.

956
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:14,045
Toll...

957
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:15,940
Toll Bridge Trading.

958
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:17,749
Women's shoes.

959
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,401
2570 Third Street Northwest.

960
00:40:23,402 --> 00:40:25,772
Jethro, 2570

961
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:28,489
- ...Third Street, Northwest.
- Gibbs.

962
00:40:33,752 --> 00:40:34,265
Clear.

963
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,988
Tony, go, go. We've got the tunnel.

964
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:37,753
Okay, two minutes, boss.

965
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:01,264
What is this, a warehouse?

966
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,357
He's shutting down his operation.

967
00:41:09,549 --> 00:41:11,206
Where are the girls?

968
00:41:11,392 --> 00:41:13,637
Put her in the truck
along with the others.

969
00:41:14,142 --> 00:41:15,773
Federal agents!

970
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,501
Freeze!

971
00:41:24,544 --> 00:41:26,068
Stay down.

972
00:41:32,642 --> 00:41:34,268
Put the weapon down.

973
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,089
Nice work, Probie.

974
00:41:49,988 --> 00:41:51,725
They're in the truck.

975
00:42:00,495 --> 00:42:02,188
Unbelievable.

976
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:15,642
"The bum tried to be a hero."

977
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:18,309
Brian Wright.

978
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,648
Sergeant Brian Wright.

979
00:42:21,632 --> 00:42:24,413
Bronze Star, Purple Heart,

980
00:42:24,414 --> 00:42:26,652
United States Marine Corps.

981
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:29,317
He was a hero.
