1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,385
What do you think I said?

2
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:09,026
Ma, I told Sydney she's more than

3
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:10,481
welcome to freeze her own
head when she dies,

4
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:11,699
but mine is being cremated

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,099
and scattered
at the nearest Hooters.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,200
No, I know. She's crazy.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,950
Even if it works,
who wants to live forever?

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,345
Live fast, die young, you know?

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,500
What are you doing?
The sign said "walk"!

10
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:27,400
No way!

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,215
My light was green.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,399
You ever see streetlights
malfunction like that?

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,290
That's not a
malfunction.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,287
That's an S.O.S.

20
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:39,381
The lights went crazy.

21
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:40,848
There was all kind
of blinking lights.

22
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:44,814
My light was green, so it's
frightening that anybody...

23
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,134
City engineers traced
the disturbance

24
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:51,099
to an underground
power node.

25
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,000
Back traced the source,
they found this.

26
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,700
Hey, boss.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,900
Meet Marine Officer
Major John Maguire.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,549
At least that's
what his I.D. says.

29
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:05,099
It's hard to tell
with the, uh...

30
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,965
you know, the one eye.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,499
Yeah, where's the missing one?

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,599
Your guess is as good as mine.

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Major worked
under Marine Corps Systems Command,

34
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:13,800
was liaison to the civilian sector

35
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:15,570
for N.B.C. preparedness.

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,300
Nuclear, biological
and chemical.

37
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:19,165
Very good.

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,365
I'm proud of you,
like a weird uncle.

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,000
Hey, boss, you may not
have noticed, but the...

40
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:24,499
Door locks from the outside.

41
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,365
Oh, so you noticed that.

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,499
Meaning someone else
locked him down here.

43
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,099
Yeah, you really want
to impress me,

44
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,040
Tell me why.

45
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,505
Did he know where
his S.O.S. was going?

46
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,465
Not a chance.

47
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,800
Shorting the power box
was clever,

48
00:02:42,835 --> 00:02:44,067
but a shot in the dark.

49
00:02:44,102 --> 00:02:45,265
Lucky it worked at all.

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,265
And someone was able
to figure it out.

51
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,499
Well, that's precisely
why S.O.S. was chosen,

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,899
'cause it was so very
recognizable.

53
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,970
Dot-dot-dot, dash-dash-dash,
dot-dot-dot.

54
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,000
Unlike the old signal,

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,800
which was CQD,

56
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,465
come quick distress.

57
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,299
Just the S.O.S.?
That's all he sent.

58
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,099
Morse code's a dying art.

59
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,065
Was for him.

60
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,280
Well, he could
have sent a message

61
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,460
and no one would
have recognized it.

62
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,800
Present company excepted.

63
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,165
Cause of death?

64
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,800
Well, he didn't suffocate.

65
00:03:17,835 --> 00:03:19,361
There are no signs of cyanosis

66
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:21,900
to indicate oxygen
deprivation.

67
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,140
No petechial hemorrhages
that would indicate strangulation,

68
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,265
there's no blunt or sharp
force trauma;

69
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,100
in fact,there's no sign of
any trauma at all.

70
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,999
Other than the missing eye.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,599
That would explain
his death, Timothy.

72
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,495
Blood came
from somewhere.

73
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,999
Yes, well, I think the blood
on the hands is superficial.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,800
From several torn cuticles and,

75
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:47,265
uh, pads.

76
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,599
Looks like he literally tried
to climb the walls.

77
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,310
Oh, that's odd.

78
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,500
99.1.

79
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,465
It appears our corpse

80
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,390
is running a slight fever.

81
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,199
What happened down here?

82
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,900
Whatever happened,

83
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:03,000
someone

84
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,480
wanted to watch.

85
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,865
<i>Though the idea</i>

86
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,900
of the artificial eye
was centuries old,

87
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,299
it didn't really take off until
the early 20th century.

88
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,865
A group of Germans

89
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,300
toured the United States
custom-fitting

90
00:04:21,335 --> 00:04:23,767
glass eyes to those
who needed them.

91
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:26,199
Yes, which would've
included you, Major,

92
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,300
had you still been alive.

93
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,200
Sadly, the outbreak of war

94
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:32,440
led to shortages,

95
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,080
resulting in
ill-fitting eyeballs

96
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:37,460
which had a
tendency to pop out

97
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,200
during rigorous interpersonal activity.

98
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,465
Such as?

99
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,340
I leave that
to your imagination, Tony.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,355
But I do have a cause of death.

101
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,465
I was hoping there was

102
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,200
a reason you called
me down here, Ducky.

103
00:04:51,235 --> 00:04:53,417
Yes, the Major's
death occurred

104
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:55,600
as a result of
acute organ failure

105
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:57,900
brought about by hyperthermia.

106
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,100
It wasn't that cold down there. No.

107
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:02,500
Hyperthermia, Tony, not hypo.

108
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,700
His body temperature literally
became too hot to handle.

109
00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:06,865
Wasn't that warm down there.

110
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,499
No, indeed it wasn't, but
the hyperthermia would explain

111
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:14,099
the elevated body temperature
I found at the crime scene.

112
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,600
One mystery solved.
Unfortunately,

113
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,700
the Major does not
appear to suffer

114
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:22,499
from any of the risk factors

115
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,065
involved in heatstroke.

116
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,999
Well, he still managed
to die from it.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,415
Yes, indeed he did.

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,800
You know, certain
medications can interfere

119
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:33,799
with the body's cooling
processes,

120
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,599
but we'll have to wait for Abby's
toxicology report

121
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,660
to see if that is a factor.

122
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,199
I get it.

123
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,340
Rigorous interpersonal activity.

124
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,299
Maybe it was a trophy
for the crypt keeper.

125
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,370
The wound was self-inflicted.

126
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,199
Are you saying that he...
He tore out his own eyeball.

127
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
You know, I found traces

128
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,900
of vitreous fluid
under his fingernails.

129
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,799
Well, where'd it go?

130
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,500
We didn't find an eyeball
at the crime scene.

131
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,740
It was at the crime all right,

132
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,000
hiding...

133
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,200
in his stomach.

134
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,975
You didn't find a toe in there,
too, did you Duck?

135
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,699
How'd it get in his stomach?

136
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,099
Oh, I don't know, Tony.

137
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,600
But there are only two
pathways into the stomach.

138
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,365
Neither possibility

139
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
is particularly appetizing.

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,650
Thank God you're here.

141
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,270
I really need your help.

142
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,199
You've got to stop me
from doing something stupid.

143
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,860
I'm thinking
about getting a tattoo.

144
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,765
All these tattoos.

145
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,865
You know, I get really nervous

146
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,099
'cause it's such a
final decision.

147
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,600
Should I go with something
a little esoteric or...

148
00:06:56,635 --> 00:06:59,099
I don't know,
maybe a little Eastern.

149
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,400
Ah, Ganesh.

150
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,660
The Hindu god of wisdom for me,

151
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:04,620
the wise one.
What do you think?

152
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,099
I don't think I'm the one
to ask about this.

153
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,065
But Gibbs,

154
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,265
you know me better
than anyone else

155
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,599
and when you're gonna make
a decision that's gonna affect

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,100
the rest of your life,
you need the person around you

157
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,525
that knows you best
for guidance.

158
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,400
Please?

159
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,415
Where do you want
to put the tattoo?

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,299
Okay, you're right.
You're not the one to ask.

161
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,465
Toxicology report.

162
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,000
I heard about Ducky's
unexplained hyperthermia.

163
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:33,365
I can explain it.
I found traces of three

164
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,800
quinuclidinyl benzilate
in Major Maguire's blood.

165
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:38,500
NATO calls it BZ gas.
We call it Agent Buzz.

166
00:07:38,535 --> 00:07:39,765
It's an incapacitating agent

167
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,900
that causes hyperthermia,
severe hallucinations

168
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:44,067
and, in large
enough doses, death.

169
00:07:44,102 --> 00:07:46,199
It's a chemical weapon, Gibbs.
Whose?

170
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,165
It's hard to tell.

171
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,999
Chemical weapons are banned,

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,699
but they're still allowed
for research purposes.

173
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,650
Even by our own government.

174
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,000
Can you tell
which lab it came from?

175
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:56,940
No. But I do have a lead.

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,265
The camera that you pulled

177
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,165
from the sewer is
Wi-Fi based.

178
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,300
It works by piggy-backing on local,
unprotected networks.

179
00:08:04,335 --> 00:08:05,665
Once it's on the Internet,

180
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,250
it can be routed
anywhere at will.

181
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:08,800
And it makes it
totally untraceable.

182
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:10,630
But you traced it anyway.

183
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Let me know when you...
I got an address. Yep.

184
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:15,380
<i>No, I mean, I got an address.</i>

185
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,199
The killer watched
the Major die from a bowling alley,

186
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
19 Bella Street.

187
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,535
Of course, whoever was there
is probably long...

188
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,900
...gone... by... now.

189
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,499
I got a bad
feeling about this.

190
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,099
We let the elf lord go in,
we may never get him out.

191
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,299
Getting old, Tony.

192
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,099
Tony, you and Ziva
take the back.

193
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,255
Elf lord, you're with me.

194
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:50,531
<i>This place ain't doing me any good I'm in the wrong town </i>

195
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:54,219
<i>should be in Hollywood Just for a second there... </i>

196
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:02,436
<i>Gonna take dancing lessons.</i>

197
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:03,596
<i>Do the jitterbug rag.</i>

198
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:05,574
<i>Ain't no shortcuts.</i>

199
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:09,148
<i>Gonna dress in drag, only a fool in here.</i>

200
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:11,089
<i>Would think he's got anything to prove Wonder where everyone is.</i>

201
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:13,163
Wonder where everyone is.

202
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:17,490
<i>Lot of water under the bridge...
</i>

203
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,365
Talk to me, Ziva.

204
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,299
Real service entrance clear.
Standing by.

205
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,500
I just want to know what
the heck you want me to say.

206
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,199
Look, we can do this
nice and easy

207
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,699
or not so nice and easy.

208
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
Come on, man!

209
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,000
Federal agents!

210
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:40,065
Drop your weapons!

211
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,250
Federal agents, put 'em down!
Drop 'em!

212
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:44,400
NCIS, drop your weapons.
Drop your weapons!

213
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:46,799
How about we all
drop our weapons?

214
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,870
Since clearly we're all
on the same team.

215
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,400
Mamoun Sharif.

216
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,865
CID was able to trace an old lead from

217
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,900
when Sharif was working
as a paid informant for the CIA.

218
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:08,500
The trail led to an alias
which led to a credit card.

219
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:09,865
Which led to a bowling alley.

220
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,899
Yep. Funny, us running
into each other like that.

221
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,700
Funny?

222
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,199
You have a better word?

223
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,565
A few come to mind.

224
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,599
So the real question:
are our cases connected?

225
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,965
As connected
as McGee

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,999
and his cute,
little writing pipe.

227
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,365
The prints on the computer
that was used

228
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,299
to monitor the sewer
match the prints on file

229
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,190
from Sharif's
CIA report.

230
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,965
The Mad Bomber is back.

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,199
Except he's not using bombs
this time.

232
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,550
So where did he get
the BZ gas?

233
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:38,865
One of the
Major's duties was

234
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,700
to deliver small quantities
of weapons-grade gases

235
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:43,100
to civilian research labs.

236
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:44,165
Ziva, you and Tony...

237
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,900
Run down the list of the Major's deliveries,

238
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:46,965
starting with the most recent.

239
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,799
And find out... If any of
them were BZ gas. On it.

240
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,099
They always finish
your sentences for you?

241
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,050
I teach them to anticipate.

242
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,799
Well, they do it well.

243
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,299
You must be a good teacher.

244
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,190
Well, thank you very much.

245
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,700
Uh, boss, if Sharif was
trying to cover his tracks,

246
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,499
why would he go
to all this trouble

247
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,299
just to kill
Major Maguire?

248
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,765
It does seem unusual

249
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,000
that Sharif would have wasted
the BZ gas

250
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:17,175
the way he did.

251
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,190
He wasn't wasting it.

252
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,755
He was testing it.

253
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,175
Testing it for what?

254
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,300
It's a chemical weapon.

255
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:30,300
Take a guess.

256
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,600
I meant do you have
anything specific?

257
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:34,100
A date, a target?

258
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:34,900
No.

259
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,165
Nothing yet.

260
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,065
Is there any hard intel

261
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,050
suggesting that Sharif
is planning an attack?

262
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:42,142
You mean, other
than the dead guy in our morgue?

263
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:44,199
If you're worried
about the lack of chatter...

264
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,400
- Don't.
- The last time Sharif planned an attack,

265
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:47,995
there was zero uptick.

266
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,965
He certainly proved last time

267
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,500
that he was a pro
at flying beneath our radar.

268
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes, but even if he's planning
on not using

269
00:11:57,035 --> 00:11:58,065
the gas himself...

270
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,170
He'll sell it to someone who will. Yeah.

271
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,500
Homeland Security certainly
loves non-specific threats.

272
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,165
So, how are we going
to handle this?

273
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,700
Our investigations have merged.
Who's gonna take the lead?

274
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:14,360
You'll be working
under Agent Gibbs.

275
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,199
Your boss and I flipped a coin
for it.

276
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,555
Is that a problem?

277
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,765
No problem.

278
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,335
- I'm just...
- Used to being on top.

279
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,400
In command, yes.

280
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,100
But I've worked
with Agent Gibbs before

281
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:28,865
and I'm happy to again.

282
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,199
You two have worked
together a while, huh?

283
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,500
How long?

284
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,270
The reason...
you're asking?

285
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Just curious.

286
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
Forget it.

287
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,199
Major Maguire was here
last week.

288
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,325
Secure delivery.

289
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,120
Shame what happened.

290
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,999
You seem
real broken up.

291
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,899
Hey, I got
my own problems.

292
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,799
We upsized our
operation after 9/11.

293
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,699
Things haven't
quite panned out.

294
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,799
Lines out the door
for GameBox Three

295
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,499
and I got warehouses
of this no one wants.

296
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,510
And creditors
up the wazoo.

297
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,900
Uh, wazoo?

298
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,300
Huh?

299
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,901
Good luck with that one.

300
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh, wait.

301
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,095
Give me a second.

302
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,600
- Hi.
- He's got two cell phones.

303
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:55,895
One for each ear.

304
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,300
Yeah, I can take a rain check.

305
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,240
Everything all right?

306
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,895
All right, I'll talk to you later.

307
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,699
Sounds like you have
something up your wazoo.

308
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,650
A doctor's probe, perhaps?

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,765
Look,

310
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,299
I got a business to run.

311
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,899
If you have any
more questions,

312
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,499
you can ask our
chief engineer.

313
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,555
He's in here.

314
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,800
Dane.

315
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,180
Tell them what
they need to know.

316
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay?

317
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,200
Yeah.

318
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,599
What do you
need to know?

319
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,799
Well, my partner probably needs
to know your home phone number.

320
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,900
So if you'd just let it go, he
would've thought I was kidding.

321
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:42,785
I don't want your number.

322
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,565
What do you want?

323
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,700
You got a delivery
of BZ gas last week.

324
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:48,800
We need to confirm
the shipment details.

325
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:49,900
Invoice number?

326
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,765
So, if chemical weapons are banned,

327
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,900
how come you guys are still
doing research with them?

328
00:14:58,935 --> 00:15:01,017
Well, not everyone plays
by the same rules as us.

329
00:15:01,052 --> 00:15:03,100
We still need to certify
that our safety devices

330
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,799
will be functional
against a rogue attack.

331
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,100
The military provides
us with the samples

332
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:07,695
to certify our devices

333
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,599
and we do the testing.

334
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,250
All right, here we go.

335
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,499
Four kilograms
of BZ concentrate.

336
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,300
Four?

337
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,899
According to SYSCOM records,
it was 14.

338
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,865
We asked for four.

339
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,599
That's what the Major
signed over to us.

340
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,140
Ten kilograms missing.

341
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,570
Is that a lot?

342
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,465
So then the Colonel says to Gibbs,

343
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,849
"Funny, us running
into each other like that"...

344
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:39,199
McGee, you are reading
way too much into this.

345
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,265
Abby, you were not there.

346
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,399
You did not see the look
on Gibbs' face.

347
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,875
Look at what, McGee?

348
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,050
Hi, boss.

349
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:46,000
I was...

350
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,700
I was just... Talking
about us behind our backs?

351
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:51,470
Well, we were trying to.

352
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,200
What do you got on Sharif?

353
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:00,100
On Maguire.

354
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,599
We've been digging all day
trying to find a connection.

355
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,300
Um, one possibility.

356
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,400
A $20,000 deposit.

357
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,899
Wired from an offshore
bank account two days ago.

358
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,899
Is Sharif the source
of that wire?

359
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,899
Well, he didn't sign
his name on it.

360
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,000
If we can track the source,

361
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:16,100
it might give us a lead on him.

362
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:17,040
Yeah, do it.

363
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,500
But wait!

364
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,665
- There's more!
- The Wi-Fi camera

365
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,200
that Sharif used, it streamed
video of Major Maguire

366
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:24,965
in real time to
Sharif's computer.

367
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,350
And we all know
that the Internet was designed

368
00:16:27,385 --> 00:16:29,492
to be a redundant
communications protocol.

369
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:31,263
Yeah, we were able
to use that redundancy

370
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:33,000
to find echoes
of the original stream...

371
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,500
How long will they go on
like this?

372
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,465
Until we stop 'em.

373
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,405
- ...to ISP and rebuilding...
- McGee.

374
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,785
Bottom line?

375
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,220
We've got the video Sharif took
of Major Maguire before he died.

376
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,199
First he tried
to pick the lock.

377
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,970
Then he called for help.

378
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,330
About a half-hour
later,

379
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,500
he gets the idea
to try and signal

380
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:53,965
using the power
box on the wall,

381
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,499
which caused the traffic
lights on the street to blink.

382
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,990
Watch what happens when
the BZ goes into effect.

383
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,735
He looks really agitated.

384
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,450
BZ gas causes severe hallucinations.

385
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,000
He is literally losing his mind.

386
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,599
Now we know how an
eyeball got in his stomach.

387
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,365
How much?

388
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,500
Um, this is the result of roughly

389
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:25,395
ten milligrams of exposure.

390
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,800
What?

391
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,099
We're missing
ten kilograms, McGee.

392
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,520
That's like a million times more.

393
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,900
Good news, boss. Gordon Gear
ran a full inventory.

394
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,200
The only thing unaccounted
for was the BZ gas.

395
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:45,499
Does that mean
you found Sharif?

396
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
I guess he's still
unaccounted for.

397
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:49,167
He's someplace doing something.

398
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,901
Figure out where and find him.

399
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,968
- I got an idea, campfire!
- No!

400
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:54,965
Yes! Campfire's
where we all

401
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,465
get together in
a free environment,

402
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,600
you know, without
hugging and everything,

403
00:17:57,635 --> 00:17:58,700
we, uh...

404
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,899
not a big fan of the campfire.

405
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,999
Then where is he going?

406
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,600
Same place he always
goes to think.

407
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,750
I thought you'd like to know

408
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:13,965
that Sharif made it to the top

409
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,399
of every agency's
Most Wanted list.

410
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,765
Homeland Security's
all over it.

411
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,899
Where's your boat?

412
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,499
Well, had to move it
to make some room.

413
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,799
- Yeah, but...
- They're covering their asses.

414
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,410
- But where...
- Gonna take them days to do anything.

415
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,799
Yeah, well,
they want a briefing.

416
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,200
Chemical weapons are

417
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,990
notoriously difficult
to deal with,

418
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,499
and ten kilograms
is a large amount.

419
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,599
It could be
a land-based attack.

420
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Or worse, something else
we haven't thought of yet.

421
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:46,955
Well, that's what I'm here for.

422
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,200
Is it?

423
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,230
You say that like
you were expecting something else.

424
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,035
Or is it hoping?

425
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,125
What you got in the bag?

426
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,700
Dinner.

427
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,280
Why don't we start with that?

428
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,190
So maybe Sharif is just gonna
to sell the BZ. He's not.

429
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,500
- And you're so sure of that because...?
-  His eyes.

430
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:15,500
His eyes?

431
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,799
He doesn't want the money.

432
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,095
He wants to kill.

433
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,000
Who?

434
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,565
Sharif's sold himself out

435
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,599
to the highest bidder
his whole life,

436
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,599
no matter what side they were on.

437
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,299
I mean, what's changed?

438
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,540
People get older.

439
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,270
Realize they want
something different.

440
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,215
And you can tell this just by
looking into someone's eyes?

441
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,800
Yeah.

442
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,900
Okay.

443
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,660
What do you see in my eyes?

444
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,180
That you want me to kiss you.

445
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,000
So are you going to?

446
00:19:58,035 --> 00:19:59,265
- Yeah.
- When?

447
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,540
After we catch...

448
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,300
Sharif.

449
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,465
- That's probably a good idea.
- Really?

450
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,800
'Cause I was hoping
you would think that.

451
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:10,765
No, no, it's a good idea.

452
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,985
And I'd better go
before I change my mind.

453
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,600
Uh, you know,

454
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,599
we're a distraction
to your team.

455
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,099
We can't have anything
interfering with finding Sharif.

456
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,985
And we're gonna find him.

457
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,200
Then what?

458
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,100
Interfere.

459
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,600
Yeah. Gibbs.

460
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,660
Hello, Agent Gibbs.

461
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,799
What do you want, Sharif?

462
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,925
No pleasantries?

463
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,699
That's not very friendly,
Agent Gibbs.

464
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:54,999
You want friendly?
Front door's open.

465
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,945
Bring coffee.

466
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
I did, but you weren't in.

467
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,300
Nice place.

468
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,150
Got some decorating tips,

469
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:03,592
but first things first.

470
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:04,965
I know you are aware

471
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,080
I have almost ten kilograms
of BZ gas in my possession.

472
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,065
I wasn't expecting applause,

473
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,799
but I was hoping
for a little bit more.

474
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,899
What do you want?

475
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,765
The United States
government is holding

476
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,900
six alleged members
of a Chechen separatist group

477
00:21:20,935 --> 00:21:23,385
in a secret prison
in Afghanistan.

478
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,975
I want them released

479
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,100
within the next 24 hours.

480
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,265
Not gonna happen.

481
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,665
Because the United States

482
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
does not negotiate
with terrorists.

483
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:33,240
But you misunderstand.

484
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,955
We are not negotiating.

485
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,565
Either you release those men

486
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,430
or I will release more
of the BZ gas.

487
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,100
More?

488
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,999
It's hard to say how many
have been exposed.

489
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,260
Airborne weaponry
is a tricky business, but...

490
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
I'm sure the 11:00 news
will have

491
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:51,465
a pretty good figure by now.

492
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,900
Authorities are not certain
what is causing the illness.

493
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:58,765
There are no fatalities
as of yet,

494
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,299
but at least six people
have fallen sick.

495
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,700
Actually, counting you,
Agent Gibbs,

496
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:05,100
that makes seven.

497
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,425
Poor Gibbs.

498
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,165
First he loses
his memory,

499
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,900
and now he might
lose his mind.

500
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Sharif is going to lose
a lot more than that

501
00:22:23,235 --> 00:22:24,855
when Gibbs catches him.

502
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,999
He's not going crazy, is he?

503
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,665
No, he's his usual self.

504
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,500
Which some people might
characterize as unconventional.

505
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,599
I didn't find any trace
of BZ gas in either of them.

506
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,730
Sharif appears to be bluffing.

507
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,870
You're welcome to, ...

508
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,700
Gibbs!

509
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,399
- I was so worried.
- I'm okay, Abs.

510
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,565
Yeah, me, too.

511
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,000
No fatalities at the hospital.

512
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:49,965
The dose
was too low.

513
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,265
They're reporting it
as food poisoning.

514
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,599
But the word is already
beginning to leak out.

515
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,200
How did Sharif deliver the BZ?

516
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:56,265
I can't tell yet.

517
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,799
The pattern of illnesses
appears random.

518
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,699
We're still trying to find a link
between Sharif and the Chechen rebels.

519
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,999
You won't find one.

520
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,100
He's trying to distract us.

521
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:04,865
From what?

522
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,999
I don't know.

523
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,065
Then what makes you so sure?

524
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,800
Never question the gut.

525
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,965
Going somewhere, McGee?

526
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,599
Actually, looking for you, boss.

527
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,499
Might have found a connection
between Sharif's victims.

528
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,400
Neighbors reported
seeing the same truck

529
00:23:25,435 --> 00:23:26,700
outside two of the houses.

530
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:27,899
Well, you got a plate?

531
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,999
Not enough of one.

532
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,799
All I got is a red truck,
some kind of logo.

533
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,405
Ziva, you and Tony
find out if anyone else saw...

534
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,099
Where the hell is DiNozzo?

535
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,040
You tell me.

536
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,099
Oh, that's right, you won't.

537
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,900
Find him!

538
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,100
Now!

539
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,760
Paging Miss Benoit.

540
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,850
Miss Benoit, please report
to your front door, please.

541
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,700
There's a medical emergency
requiring your assistance.

542
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:01,700
Miss Benoit, a patient
at your front door

543
00:24:01,735 --> 00:24:03,355
is dying of loneliness.

544
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,099
So when I said "rain check"...

545
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,865
That's weird.

546
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,899
'Cause I thought
you said "brain Chex."

547
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,800
Like some kind of breakfast
cereal good for your brain.

548
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:12,765
What's wrong?

549
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,765
It doesn't have
anything to do with you.

550
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,125
That's not what I asked.

551
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,265
If you don't want
to tell me, I can always

552
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,514
look at your horoscope
or read some tea leaves or...

553
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:27,699
What is it about "no" that
men refuse to understand?

554
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,760
Is this all men or just me?

555
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,899
I got an e-mail
from an old friend.

556
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,000
And this old friend is not
good at the "no" word?

557
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:36,100
No, this friend isn't.

558
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,799
Starting to sound like this may
have something to do with me.

559
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,799
Not everything is about you.

560
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,200
Okay, then.

561
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
Enough about me,
let's talk about you.

562
00:24:44,035 --> 00:24:45,825
What do you think of me?

563
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,800
<i>Beaches.</i>

564
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
Bette Midler.

565
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:49,900
1987.

566
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,800
1988, actually, but I'm gonna
give it to you anyway,

567
00:24:52,835 --> 00:24:54,399
'cause you're kind of cute.

568
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,699
And you win the prize:

569
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,665
A night with Francois Truffaut.

570
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,199
Actually, probably a couple of nights,
maybe even a long weekend.

571
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,560
<i>We can start with The 400 Blows.</i>

572
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,280
I love Truffaut.

573
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,100
Just so, um, we're clear,

574
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,499
to, you know, make sure there's
no confusion in the future,

575
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,000
when we use the word
"rain check,"

576
00:25:12,035 --> 00:25:14,165
we're saying "no" now, right?

577
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,280
Not "no" with a capital "N,"
more like a lowercase "no."

578
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,100
Yes. Perfectly unclear.

579
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,499
You see, this might be why men have

580
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,165
trouble understanding

581
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,600
the feminine of the "no"...
word... thingy.

582
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,565
I'm digging myself a hole, here.

583
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,499
You know, since I'm here,
it's a shame to waste me.

584
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,325
I vote for a group bath.

585
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,800
Is that a "yes" or...?

586
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,900
It wasn't a "no."

587
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,395
That's very good.

588
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,900
Is this about
the mystery illness?

589
00:26:06,935 --> 00:26:08,165
I don't know. You tell me.

590
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,299
I'm telling you, I just got
the news flash. Sharif?

591
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,300
Yes.

592
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,260
Where are you?

593
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,600
Off duty.

594
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,799
Okay, this is getting old, Tony.

595
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,999
This is why I don't
answer your calls.

596
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,099
McGee found a connection
between the victims.

597
00:26:22,134 --> 00:26:24,199
Their homes were fumigated
by the same firm.

598
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,000
All right.
Text me the address.

599
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:27,060
Where are you?

600
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,980
Tony.

601
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,130
The water's getting cold.

602
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,715
About that rain check...

603
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,000
The pest control firm
didn't realize that one of

604
00:26:39,035 --> 00:26:40,999
their commercial sprayers
was missing

605
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,199
until I sent two of my agents
to question them.

606
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,199
We've ID'd Sharif as
one of their employees.

607
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,325
Former employee.

608
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,865
Call you back.

609
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,799
Sharif hasn't shown
for work since the attack.

610
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,899
Probably because he's too busy
preparing for his next one.

611
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,299
The missing sprayer
is truck-mounted.

612
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,099
But it could easily be adapted
for a small aircraft.

613
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,965
I'm having
mobile sensors deployed

614
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,300
at every Marine and Naval base
on the East Coast.

615
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:08,800
FAA finish grounding
all small aircraft?

616
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,699
In the works.

617
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,365
Ducky says there's an antitoxin.

618
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,599
Needs to be delivered to all
Trauma Ones and base hospitals.

619
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,065
In the works.

620
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,700
I hope "in the works" means
something different here

621
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:19,000
than it does
where I come from.

622
00:27:19,035 --> 00:27:19,885
Keep hoping.

623
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,799
You don't want this being seen?!

624
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,965
It's too late!

625
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,605
<i>Too late! Too late!</i>

626
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,900
Jethro?

627
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,400
Are you okay?

628
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,200
Yeah. Fine.

629
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,900
Colonel Mann.

630
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,105
Yes, Director?

631
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,400
He's not fine.

632
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,999
We're all under a lot of stress.

633
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,295
A word of advice.

634
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,799
Agent Gibbs is one of
the best agents around,

635
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:58,199
but when it comes
to dealing with bureaucracy,

636
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,099
it's not one of
his stronger points.

637
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,150
And your point?

638
00:28:01,185 --> 00:28:02,200
My point...

639
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,665
is that I almost lost

640
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,999
my best agent
six months ago,

641
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:06,299
and I don't want a repeat.

642
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,399
Well, with all
due respect, ma'am,

643
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,199
I think Agent Gibbs
can take care of himself.

644
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,400
I think
you know that.

645
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:13,600
Yes, I do.

646
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,595
That will be all.

647
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,099
<i>Rumors continue to swirl</i>

648
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,865
<i>about a possible
terrorist attack.</i>

649
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,700
<i>There's been no official
confirmation, but the FAA...</i>

650
00:28:25,735 --> 00:28:26,465
Gibbs!

651
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
We have news.

652
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,265
We were able to back trace the wire transfer
to Major Maguire.

653
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,499
It wasn't easy. Most offshore accounts
use a block cipher as a security protocol.

654
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,365
So what we did was
we fooled their system by

655
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,900
- causing a denial - of-service...
- You got a location on Sharif?

656
00:28:37,935 --> 00:28:40,999
Gibbs, the wire transfer
did not come from Sharif.

657
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,590
Who did it come from?

658
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,500
So this is the guy Ziva was
drooling over.

659
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:48,965
- I wasn't drooling.
- Please.

660
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,900
I saw you undressing him
with your bedroom eyes.

661
00:28:50,935 --> 00:28:52,400
At least I'm not
the one asking him

662
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:54,290
if he waxed his eyebrows.

663
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,400
It's important to appreciate
the competition.

664
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,499
I want a lawyer.

665
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,800
Why? You done something wrong?

666
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:05,399
I'm admitting to nothing.

667
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,810
You don't need to.

668
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,825
We already know you wired
$20,000 to Major Maguire.

669
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,900
What we don't know is why.

670
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,399
I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

671
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,800
No lawyer, no trial.

672
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,599
Just a room like this
until you talk.

673
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,300
That's the way it works
for terrorists.

674
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:25,100
I'm not a terrorist.

675
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,605
Well, you'd better hope you
can convince us otherwise.

676
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,700
All right.

677
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,800
I diverted the BZ gas
to Sharif,

678
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,360
not the Major.

679
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,600
When I went to cover
my tracks...

680
00:29:43,635 --> 00:29:45,299
Major Maguire found out.

681
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,100
Yeah.

682
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,799
Sharif said he would take care of it.

683
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,465
I got worried when the Major
disappeared,

684
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,400
because I knew the missing BZ would be
traced back to me.

685
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:54,065
So you made it look
like Major Maguire

686
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,199
sold the gas to Sharif
by putting the money in his account.

687
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,099
How much did Sharif pay you?

688
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,900
Nothing.

689
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,980
I paid him.

690
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,225
What, you just like
killing Americans?

691
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,300
We weren't planning
on killing anyone.

692
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:07,600
The plan was to scare people.

693
00:30:07,635 --> 00:30:08,799
Hey, it's working.

694
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,999
You guys don't get it, do you?

695
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,200
Every time there's
a catastrophe,

696
00:30:12,235 --> 00:30:13,500
someone cashes in.

697
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,600
Katrina- the construction
companies cleaned up.

698
00:30:16,635 --> 00:30:18,400
The tsunami-
traders made a killing

699
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:20,017
on tsunami detection stocks.

700
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:21,599
And during a chemical scare...

701
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,599
Have you checked the
stock market today?

702
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,465
My lab paid me in stock options.

703
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,800
The phony attack that put
the six people in the hospital,

704
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:28,865
well, that worked,

705
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,699
'cause everybody's running out
and buying gas masks now.

706
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,099
The stock prices went
through the roof.

707
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,099
I'll be a millionaire
by tomorrow's bell.

708
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,499
You're going to be in prison
by tomorrow's bell.

709
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:41,899
You gave a terrorist
deadly nerve gas?

710
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,899
Just wait. Now, it's not
what you think.

711
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,499
I built in a safeguard.

712
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,865
I denatured the enzyme,

713
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,365
which makes it useless
for an airborne attack.

714
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,200
It was the only way that
I would give him the BZ gas.

715
00:30:51,235 --> 00:30:52,300
Sharif knew?

716
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,600
Stealing the bug sprayer was
just to scare people.

717
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:58,099
Sharif has the BZ, but
he can't even use it.

718
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,700
I mean, if you ingest it,
it'll kill you,

719
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:01,599
but, yeah, last time I checked,

720
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,400
bleach and bug spray
will do the same thing,

721
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:05,585
and you can buy that anywhere.

722
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,770
There is no terrorist attack.

723
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,780
Then why are there six people in
the hospital right now?

724
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,265
Boss, local LEOs

725
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,199
found the stolen sprayers
in an alley.

726
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,400
No trace of BZ.

727
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,299
I think maybe Dane was right.

728
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,565
Wrong, Probie. This is Sharif.

729
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,799
He wouldn't go to all the
trouble if he didn't have a plan.

730
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,580
And not knowing is
driving boss crazy.

731
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,900
Then explain how Sharif is
going to spread the BZ

732
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:47,017
if it's been modified.

733
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:48,100
Maybe it wasn't modified.

734
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:49,000
It was.

735
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,565
CID's chemical weapons specialists

736
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,700
analyzed the blood of the
victims at the hospital

737
00:31:53,735 --> 00:31:56,420
and confirmed
the BZ's been modified.

738
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,499
It's harmless unless ingested.

739
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,750
Which is basically harmless.

740
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:00,965
It wasn't harmless

741
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,800
for Major Maguire
and those six people.

742
00:32:02,835 --> 00:32:04,165
Sharif was in their houses.

743
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,865
He could've spiked their O.J.
with BZ.

744
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,325
Or Sharif figured out
a way to modify it back.

745
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,585
Yeah, Gibbs.

746
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,657
Why don't I wait for you
to start the trace?

747
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,599
I just called to see
how you're feeling, Agent Gibbs.

748
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,799
Better than those six innocent
people you put in the hospital.

749
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,450
I'd stop by and pay my respect,

750
00:32:27,485 --> 00:32:29,242
but I'm on my way out of town.

751
00:32:29,277 --> 00:32:30,965
How about I send you a postcard?

752
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,080
I'm planning on traveling
quite a bit for my retirement.

753
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,275
And your Chechen buddies?

754
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,515
I'm not even sure
where Chechnya is.

755
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,899
We both know
you're not retiring.

756
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,399
With what I've made,

757
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,200
I plan on doing plenty.

758
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:48,260
Who were they?

759
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,500
Wife?

760
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,800
Family?

761
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,699
Come on, Sharif,
I've been there, I know.

762
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,170
It's not the money.

763
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,700
It's payback.

764
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,315
You won't stop until you get it.

765
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,695
So who were they?

766
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,782
So this is all about payback?

767
00:33:15,817 --> 00:33:17,465
No, he's planning an attack.

768
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,195
And I believe I have a clue

769
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,500
as to what that might be.

770
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,265
Do you see the slight
inflammation

771
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,700
of the stratum corneum
of his fingertips?

772
00:33:30,735 --> 00:33:31,465
Slight?

773
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,900
Looks more like
he was grating cheese

774
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:33,765
and forgot the cheese.

775
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,200
Yes, well most of the damage
occurred when Major Maguire

776
00:33:36,235 --> 00:33:39,065
attempted to scale
the walls of his crypt.

777
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,500
But when I learned that
the BZ gas had been modified

778
00:33:41,535 --> 00:33:43,617
so it was no longer
an airborne threat,

779
00:33:43,652 --> 00:33:45,699
I looked for other methods of exposure.

780
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,565
He ingested it.

781
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,499
That's a good guess
but also a wrong one.

782
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,300
The answer lies in Major's urine.

783
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Smell that.

784
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,010
I'd prefer not to.

785
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,600
Garlic.

786
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,000
Sharif is spiking
garlic with BZ toxin?

787
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:07,065
No. The contents
of his stomach show that

788
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,299
Major Maguire hadn't eaten
anything, much less garlic.

789
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,500
It appears...

790
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,500
that Sharif

791
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,500
may have been testing a topical

792
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,100
method of exposure.

793
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,200
Like, uh, sunscreen

794
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:23,000
or a body oil.

795
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,200
If that is the case,

796
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,900
then that
would explain both the inflammation

797
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:30,099
and the garlic odor by-product.

798
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,300
Of course, all this
will require

799
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:33,465
a specialized

800
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,800
analysis from Abby

801
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,400
to determine that
that is indeed

802
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:38,300
the case,

803
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,000
and I'm fairly certain that...

804
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,035
Where'd they go?

805
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,799
I'm guessing Abby's lab.

806
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,765
And I know Gibbs
always gets his man,

807
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,700
but those two are unusually motivated
to find Sharif.

808
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,600
DMSO are as we professionals
call it

809
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,300
dimethyl sulfoxide.

810
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,265
It's an industrial-strength
solvent

811
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,065
that has a very interesting
side effect.

812
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,000
It carries whatever
it comes into contact with

813
00:35:03,035 --> 00:35:05,075
directly into the bloodstream.

814
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,545
Wow, gold star for the Colonel.

815
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,550
So, it looks like Sharif

816
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:12,565
has mixed BZ with DMSO.

817
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,365
Which means that
all anyone has to do

818
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,600
is come in contact with a
coated surface to be exposed.

819
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:18,317
The more BZ is in the mix,

820
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:19,999
the faster it'll take effect.

821
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,900
Anywhere from ten
minutes to 36 hours.

822
00:35:21,935 --> 00:35:22,565
How many people?

823
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,265
The bad news, about a 100,000.

824
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,999
Oh, well, the good news
better be really good.

825
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,699
Well, Sharif is going to
have some serious distribution problems.

826
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,865
If he were to go door-to-door, right?

827
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,499
There's only so many people
he can get to before we get him.

828
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,335
He could do more damage with a shotgun.

829
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,415
You gonna get that?

830
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,300
Yeah, Gibbs.

831
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,799
We'll on our way up.

832
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,390
Got a lead on Sharif.

833
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,199
Guy's been a busy
little banker.

834
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,799
He spent the last three days
going from bank to bank.

835
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,165
Depositing or withdrawing?

836
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,199
Withdrawing,
and all of it in singles.

837
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,100
12 transactions at
12 different banks.

838
00:36:08,135 --> 00:36:09,899
Which is why it was flagged.

839
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,000
Anti-laundering law used
to say any transaction

840
00:36:12,035 --> 00:36:13,600
over ten grand
needs to be reported.

841
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:15,399
But those were 9,000 each.

842
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,165
Sharif must have known
about the limit.

843
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,900
What he didn't know was that the Fed lowered
the threshold to five grand last month.

844
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:23,900
Since when do you know so much
about anti-laundering laws, DiNozzo?

845
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:26,900
Well, you should read your memos
more often, then, boss.

846
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:27,700
Or not.

847
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:28,905
How much?

848
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,500
108,000.

849
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,050
A lot of singles.

850
00:36:32,085 --> 00:36:33,400
About 108,000.

851
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,000
I have an entirely inappropriate
joke about strip clubs,

852
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:37,700
but I'm gonna save it for
a less terrifying moment.

853
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:39,399
He's putting the BZ
on the money.

854
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,500
By the time that changes hands,
within 36 hours...

855
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:43,700
A lot more than 100,000
will be at risk.

856
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:44,500
DiNozzo.

857
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,599
I'll check casinos
and racetracks.

858
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,365
Best places to get rid of
large amounts cash quick.

859
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,700
Agent McGee, airports, stations, any place
Sharif can hit large groups of people.

860
00:36:52,735 --> 00:36:53,965
On it, boss... Colonel.

861
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,499
Ziva, coordinate roadblocks
with local LEOs.

862
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,250
We're going to have
to issue a warning.

863
00:36:58,285 --> 00:36:59,792
It's going to wreak havoc
on the economy.

864
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:01,265
The economy's not what
I'm worried about.

865
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,500
He could be anywhere. We're
not going to find him now.

866
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:05,100
You reneging on our deal?

867
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:06,460
- McGee!
- Yeah, boss.

868
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,700
What is this?

869
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,699
Well, it looks like the cash.

870
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,600
I can see that, McGee. No, that.

871
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:16,550
Right there, what is that?

872
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,765
That.

873
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,035
Let me see this.

874
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,595
Looks like a GBP.

875
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,965
It's a GameBox Portable.

876
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,099
Pest guy said
Sharif was addicted to it.

877
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,399
Is that a video game?

878
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,600
Actually it's a wireless
handheld game console.

879
00:37:30,635 --> 00:37:32,299
Wireless? Does that mean
it's traceable?

880
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,700
If he's playing it and we know
his online gamer ID, yeah.

881
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:35,500
We do.

882
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,299
Abs... Tony already called. I'm on it.

883
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,500
It looks like while Sharif was waiting
for Major Maguire to pop his cork.

884
00:37:43,535 --> 00:37:45,600
He spent four hours at
the bowling alley

885
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:46,967
playing an online video game

886
00:37:47,002 --> 00:37:48,265
called Killer Kudsuckers.

887
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,780
- Got his handle?
- I'm almost there.

888
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,300
Oh, look,

889
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,915
it's "Agent Gibbs."

890
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,605
Access in the multi-player
registry.

891
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,965
He's online.

892
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,265
He's actually been
online for over an hour.

893
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,200
- He's not in any rush.
- No, he's waiting for something-

894
00:38:02,235 --> 00:38:03,400
a plane or...

895
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,400
Train.

896
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,305
He's at the Amtrak station.

897
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,899
He's still online.

898
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,400
The National Guard is sending in
a response team with antidote.

899
00:38:17,435 --> 00:38:19,100
If someone wants to suggest
waiting for them outside,

900
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:20,395
I won't complain.

901
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,470
Ziva, walk the station down..

902
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,765
Nothing leaves.

903
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,440
Which way, McGee?

904
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,415
I don't know.
He went off-line.

905
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,265
- DiNozzo.
- Yeah, boss.

906
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,000
Have security
block all exits.

907
00:38:35,035 --> 00:38:35,875
I'm on it.

908
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,699
Keep the change.

909
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:52,599
Thank you, sir.

910
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,300
<i>Train 84 to Philadelphia,
30, PA,</i>

911
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:58,365
<i>is now boarding on track 80.</i>

912
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,875
Boss, you all right?

913
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,700
NCIS!

914
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,845
Get down on the ground, Sharif.

915
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,460
Get the money!

916
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,250
What about Sharif?
I got him. I got him.

917
00:39:54,285 --> 00:39:55,792
The money's contaminated.
Put it down.

918
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,300
The money's been poisoned.
Put it down.

919
00:39:57,335 --> 00:39:59,425
Don't touch the money!

920
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,755
It's over, Sharif.

921
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,215
Something wrong, Agent Gibbs?

922
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,100
What did you do?

923
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,615
Those lovely hand tools.

924
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,165
undetectable until
it reaches your bloodstream.

925
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,355
A little early,
but I'm not complaining.

926
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,900
Their names were Cassandra,

927
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:56,267
Dimitri and Bashira.

928
00:40:56,302 --> 00:40:57,599
They were my family.

929
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,299
Until one of your country's

930
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:00,999
smart bombs was not so smart.

931
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,799
Do you know what it's like
to lose your family?

932
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,500
They say everyone you kill,

933
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,300
you just make ten more like me.

934
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,100
I think today

935
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,370
just one will be enough.

936
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,099
Hang on, boss.
National Guard's here.

937
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,965
We got the antidote.

938
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,655
You're going to be
all right, Boss.

939
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,999
<i>...which happened today.</i>

940
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,100
<i>Nation officials have said
certain areas will remain closed</i>

941
00:41:47,135 --> 00:41:48,105
<i>for further...</i>

942
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,800
Hello.

943
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,625
I thought you were
still recuperating.

944
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,100
Oh, I... yeah, I'll buzz you in.

945
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,505
No, you don't need to.

946
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,055
The doors are unlocked.

947
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,280
Yeah, but, uh...

948
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,900
my doorbell works.

949
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,940
Well, then I guess we're even.

950
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,300
So, uh...

951
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,760
You feeling better?

952
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,300
Yeah, I'm sure feeling
better than DiNozzo.

953
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,665
He was about ready
to kill himself

954
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,595
when he had to burn
that hundred grand.

955
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,560
I came by to say thank you.

956
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,920
You're welcome.

957
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,885
Is that all you came for?

958
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,670
Well, it's a start.

959
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,720
Okay... before we do this,

960
00:43:18,755 --> 00:43:21,140
I just need to know one thing.

961
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,499
How'd you get that damn boat
out of your basement?

962
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:40,000
