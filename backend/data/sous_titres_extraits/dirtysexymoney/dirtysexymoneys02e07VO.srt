2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,860
I love sex with you.

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,020
Do you think it's gonna
change after we get married?

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,050
It doesn't have to.

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,140
When i was 7, i loved bana pudding.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,990
I did. I loved it. I ate it every day.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,460
And then one morning, i woke up and i
looked down and i realized i hated it.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,510
Is our sex life gonna be
like that bana pudding?

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,850
I think my bana pudding has more
staying power than you are used to.

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,170
Come here. Come here.

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,890
Thank you.

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,200
- For what?
- For finding me...

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,720
And for making me feel so safe.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,850
so where are you headed today?

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,570
I have to go to the imperial.

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:06,160
I have,um,a meeting with the
caters, you know,final tweaks.

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,330
Are you sure your father's gonna be
okay with us getting married at his home?

18
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,220
No,daddy talks
a big game and--

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,550
Well, and he
handles the money--

20
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,970
But when it comes to ceremonies and
holidays, he doesn't really have a say.

21
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,390
That's mommy's department.

22
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,070
It'll be fine. Trust me.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,580
This wedding cannot
take place. It cannot.

24
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,280
Well,it's tomorrow. People are
flying in from all over the world.

25
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,170
It's all my fault.

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,360
No,it was karen's idea to spy on simon.

27
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,000
I let her do it.

28
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,560
I let her wander into
that den of inequity.

29
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,940
Look,what do you want me to do?

30
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,010
We have to find a way out of it.

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,810
Set up a meeting with simon elder.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,330
All right.

33
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,900
- And,nick.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,580
I find myself enthralled with
our young houseguest wrenn.

35
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,970
Yeah,you told me the other night.

36
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,610
I wonder if you could arrange a
- a luncheon for the three of us.

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,130
Okay.

38
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,000
And could you do one other thing?

39
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,630
Yeah,what's that? Could you please...

40
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,530
Not show up?

41
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,070
Uh,w-- do you think
that's a good idea?

42
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,910
Why,is there something i
should know? Tell me,please.

43
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,430
- I'll set it up.
- Good. Thank you.

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,880
Manhattan had renewable
energy 400 years ago...

45
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,360
And we're ready to do it again.

46
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,940
So you want me to build my biodiesel
plant right here in new york city?

47
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,100
For starters.

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,030
Well,it's a fine idea, senator.

49
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,100
And your tax incentives
are competitive,ms. Lyons.

50
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,350
And there's no way i'm signing with you.

51
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,080
May i ask why exactly?

52
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,330
Ask your father. He burned
me in business deals...

53
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,130
Oh,mr.
O'nnell--

54
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,760
twice,and he did it in a
way a man doesn't forget,

55
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,810
In a way that made me want to come
here and say no to you personally.

56
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,780
Give your dad my best.

57
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,550
I'll take care of this. Mr. O'connell.

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,680
Mr. O'connell.
Mis--

59
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,670
What? Not now.

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,620
Mr. O'connell,please. Sir...

61
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,330
Not interested.

62
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,020
Sir,tripp darling and patrick darling
have nothing to do with one another.

63
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,430
I'm telling you, please reconsider...

64
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,810
Why are you here?

65
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,630
It's my bro's office. N'est pas?

66
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,630
He works for the people. Me people.

67
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,650
Was thattheevan o'connell?

68
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,100
- He's taller in person.
- I am not gonna let you cost me another job.

69
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,020
- Okay,this has gotta stop.
- Or start again.

70
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,450
I'd rather eat glass. Get a life.

71
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,520
I have a life.

72
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,240
Find a better way to spend it.

73
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,250
- Hello.
- How are you?

74
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,200
You look like you're feeling better.

75
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:57,060
I think i'm fine, but tripp keeps
saying i can't leave until i'm 100%,so...

76
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,590
Nobody suspects that
we're meeting for coffee.

77
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,910
So don't worry.

78
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,460
Well,i'm not-- i'm
not worried.I just,uh--

79
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,350
- listen,uh... About the other night.
- Yeah.

80
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,770
I don't normally kiss guys
i just met. just so you know.

81
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,420
I hadn't drawn any conclusions.

82
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,490
But it was nice. You're very sweet.

83
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,160
- He is sweet,isn't he?
- Lisa.

84
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,970
Uh,you remember wrenn from...

85
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,340
Yes,from my battle royale
with karen. How could i forget?

86
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,770
Sorry to break up the sweetness.

87
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,620
You brought her here, to our place?

88
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,120
You know what? Um,
i can go if you two--

89
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:40,860
- No.
- No.

90
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,860
No,stay,please. It's a
free country,obviously.

91
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,050
I e-mailed you ki's midterm grades.

92
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,670
Her teachers says she's
a little distracted,

93
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,150
But i will let you two get
back to your conversation.

94
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,290
Lisa...

95
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,130
It's nice to know mourning our marriage
hasn't gotten in the way of your dating.

96
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,040
- Lisa-- -
don't.Just don't.

97
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,580
Oh,pardon me.

98
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,430
Jeremy,it's me.

99
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,930
I have auestion, and it's not a
question because you don't have a choice.

100
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,040
So listen up.

101
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,740
Wrenn is not what she appears to be.

102
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,290
I- i c-- i can
feel it in my bones.

103
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,030
- Letia-- - don't
you "letitia" me.

104
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Your father used to
say it just like that.

105
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:27,400
I have a-a gold digger sinking
her claws into my marriage.

106
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,460
I think that you are
being a little dramatic.

107
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,620
Dramatic?

108
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,760
I heard tripp tell you that girl has
him thinking he can do better than me.

109
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,080
I heard it.

110
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:43,220
Three friends of mine have lost their husbands
to women like this in the last six months.

111
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,900
I will not join the
ranks of the deserted.

112
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,700
I will not die alone.

113
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,880
Okay,what do you want me to do?

114
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,380
I want you to,i don't...

115
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,610
Do some checking, see if
she has a criminal record.

116
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,220
- In all seriousness?
- What?

117
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,500
You hit the woman with a car.

118
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:04,490
Initiating a background check on her on the
heels of that could start to look like harassment.

119
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,990
There's nothing to be done.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,620
Oh,well. Merci beaucoup.

121
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,070
Oh,oh,and just,um, so you know,nick,

122
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,670
jeremy apparently has invited
your wife to karen's wedding.

123
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,940
I advised him against it,
of course,for your sake.

124
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,650
But... There was nothing to be done.

125
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,270
What's on your mind,boys?
I can't wait to find out.

126
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,180
It's blank.

127
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,110
Fill it in with whatever
figure you think is appropriate.

128
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,330
And walk away from karen.

129
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,330
Uh,no. I'm not interested.

130
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,610
Get off your high horse, mr. Elder.

131
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,120
A man of your ilk has
a price for everything.

132
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,480
Uh,money... Is not what i want.

133
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,330
We're listening.

134
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,540
I have what is most valuable to you.

135
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,810
And you have what is
most valuable to me.

136
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,300
The company.

137
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,860
Your company for your daughter.

138
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,920
You sell me all of your
shares-- all of 'em--

139
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,340
Voting rights, at a fair market
value, and i'll call off the wedding.

140
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,320
Nick.

141
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:45,210
Okay,then. I'm sorry. I thought you
loved karen. I guess i was mistaken.

142
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,680
You obnoxious,little
piddling son of a bitch.

143
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:57,280
Hey,hey,no one talks to me that
way, not in my house, not anywhere.

144
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,200
Nick.

145
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,390
I know it hurts to lose her,nick.

146
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,900
But i tell you what, i'll make sure she
throws the bouquet in your direction. Okay?

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,200
lisa's just trying to make you jealous.

150
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,630
You should take it as a compliment.

151
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,430
Well,i feel like i'm in
junior high school again.

152
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,910
I remember a time not so long
ago, my problems were more adult.

153
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,750
Well... We're all back in the eighth
grade when we're in love with somebody.

154
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,370
Yeah. That's for sure.

155
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,870
What? What's so funny?

156
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,690
Speaking of the eighth grade... Tripp
wanted me to... Set up a lunch with you.

157
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,910
- Just him and me?
- Privately,yeah.

158
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,020
Why would he want to
have a private lunch?

159
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,570
- Isn't it obvious?
- Oh,my god. That's...

160
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,130
He's sweet, but i just
don't see him like that.

161
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,560
It's a good day all around,huh?

162
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,340
- Okay. How about this?
- Okay,what?

163
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,700
To solve everyone's
problems,why don't you bring me?

164
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,490
To the wedding?

165
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know. What about tripp?

166
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,960
I'll talk to him at the
wedding, make my feelings clear.

167
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,380
Come on. You and me together,
you know we'll have fun.

168
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,630
Even the family lawyer can't deny that.

169
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,270
All right. You got me. Let's do it.

170
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,460
Okay.

171
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,530
I'll be blunt. The news isn't good.

172
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,210
Your body isn't
responding as we'd hoped.

173
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,130
- Why don't you just say what you friggin' mean?
- Brian.

174
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,870
The cancer has spread.
Considerably. I'm sorry.

175
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,470
That can't be right, because she's feeling
better, she has a lot of energy and...

176
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,510
So just run the labs again.

177
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,300
One of the risks of this drug
is that it can mask the symptoms.

178
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,860
Kind of a blessing in a way.

179
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,360
- Then put her on something else.
- No.

180
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,390
What do you mean,no? Just
put her on something else!

181
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,870
No,brian. I'm done.

182
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,770
Why don't you two take
your time and talk it over?

183
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,120
Andrea... You have to.

184
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,570
I don't have to do anything.

185
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,750
All i wanted was to live my life as peacefully
as possible for the rest of my time...

186
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,780
However long i have.

187
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,350
And you talked me into
this. I did it. I'm glad.

188
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,660
And it's over.

189
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,470
What are we gonna tell the shrimp?

190
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,700
I don't know.

191
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,230
I must say, i'm a bit surprised.

192
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,310
- You want a job... In this office?
- Certified.

193
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,370
Whatever happened to you being a valet?

194
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,460
I got the public service bug.

195
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,860
Your campaign was a
watershed moment for me.

196
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,280
You know,it made me realize
that i have one life,

197
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,360
And i gotta find a
better way to spend it.

198
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,990
You don't really want a job here.

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,390
I do. Dude,i crave employment.

200
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,050
No. You just want to be closer to her.

201
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,780
Nola?

202
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,770
Survey says...

203
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,140
She is miles behind me, light-years.

204
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,550
- You're sure about that?
- Look...

205
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,330
I just want to do my part
to make new york and america

206
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,260
a little bit cooler for everyone.

207
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,870
I'd like to think you really mean that.

208
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,330
Dude,i'm your man.

209
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,470
How is our patient, wrenn,feeling?

210
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,740
She's coming along.

211
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,470
Well,that's good. Did you make
the arrangements for our luncheon?

212
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,180
- No,not yet.
- Oh,get it done,will you?

213
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:20,230
I really need that little diversion
to take my mind off this...

214
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,000
Damnable wedding.

215
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,410
Why don't we ask wrenn to come to the
wedding? That-- that would please me.

216
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,400
Well,she's already coming.

217
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,470
Really?

218
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,930
I'm bringing her as my date.

219
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,690
- As your date?
- Yeah.

220
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,180
Oh,i-i didn't realize the two
of you had become fast friends.

221
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,390
Well,it's basically just that
at this point-- friends. I...

222
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,110
Which why i didn't-- i didn't
tell you earlier, because--

223
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,230
Well... I-i made it clear, didn't i?

224
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,880
Oh,yeah... You did. I
- i just...

225
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,040
- You know, i mean,you know...
- Okay. No,fine. Good.

226
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,170
Tripp...

227
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,530
It's all right,nick. Actually,it's
for the best. There's my baby.

228
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,230
Just a silly daydream gone.

229
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,900
- Hi,daddy.
- Hello,sweetheart.

230
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,100
Nick. See you at the wedding?

231
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,170
- Yeah.
- Okay.

232
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,950
Oh,and hey,don't worry. I
didn't put lisa at your table.

233
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,010
I figured sitting next to your wife and
her date could get kind of... Awkward. So...

234
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,090
Well,that's very thoughtful
of you. If you'll excuse me.

235
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,980
- Daddy.
- Sit down,sweetheart.

236
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,410
I just want to say thank you for
letting me have the wedding here.

237
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,300
I mean,i know there's-- there's still
a part of you that doesn't trust simon.

238
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,200
A part of me?

239
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,180
He makes me feel safe, daddy.

240
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,890
Look,i don't expect you to be completely
happy about this right now,okay?

241
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,950
Or,well,okay,ever.

242
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,010
But i love him,daddy.

243
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:04,470
And in the way that you've always
wanted for me, he loves me,too. He does.

244
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,150
- He does?
- He does.

245
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,380
Well...

246
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
I'll do my best,darling.

247
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,430
Thank you,daddy.

248
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,850
Hello.

249
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,310
It's tripp.

250
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,380
I want you to go see simon elder.

251
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,900
And do what?

252
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,800
Tell him he has a deal.

253
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,770
Nick. Come on in.

254
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,140
What do you want?

255
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,400
You've got a deal.

256
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,900
Ah,and what deal do have exactly?

257
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,560
Tripp is prepared to sell you his
controlling stake in darling enterprises

258
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,690
in exchange for calling off the wedding.

259
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,680
The old man saw the wisdom.

260
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,280
I'm almost impressed.

261
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,820
- All right. I'll call it off.
- Good.

262
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,530
As soon as tripp transfers
his shares into my account.

263
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,080
Wait a second.

264
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,940
Clearly,a deal like this will
take days to complete,weeks.

265
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,590
The ceremony's in four hours.

266
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,370
Is it that soon?

267
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,860
I gotta start getting dressed.

268
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,790
Come on,nick. You didn't think i was
gonna leave karen darling at the altar,

269
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,890
Break her little heart in two just because
you walked in here and shook my hand?

270
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,690
Listen,you work fast,

271
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,540
because until this deal is done,Until
darling enterprises is mine,

272
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,470
the wedding's on.

273
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,850
Are you lost?

274
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,630
Baby,i'm working. Like you,i
is now on the federal dime.

275
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,250
Speak english.

276
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,550
I'm the senator's new general-assignment
office assistant, salary grade gs-1.

277
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,200
I took your advice. Found a
better way to spend my life.

278
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,730
I won't do "charlie
rose" again. Oh,no,no,no.

279
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,740
He dazzles you with that carolina charm.

280
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,980
The next thing you know, you're talking about how
you used to walk around in your mommy's high heels.

281
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,560
Um,nola,any suggestions for how
to get o'connell back to the table

282
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,090
Before we lose another
100,000 jobs to california?

283
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,480
Get a new father.

284
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,490
I have-- i
have an idea.

285
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,280
No,you don't. Patrick,a word.

286
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,430
Does the name billy carter
mean anything to you?

287
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,670
Roger clinton?

288
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,110
Your brother is a piece of baggage you
cannot take on this trip to washington.

289
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,140
He just needs some direction in life.

290
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,680
Okay, the only direction
he needs is out the door.

291
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,840
Jeremy shows up drunk and disorderly
in the tabloids every week.

292
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:20,570
His taste in women runs the gamut from
eurotrash b-listers to anorexic pop stars--

293
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,260
To you.

294
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,730
I was the exception
that proves the rule.

295
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,750
Listen,we need you to be taken
seriously, and pork barreling your brother

296
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,630
Before you've even taken
the oath is just silly.

297
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,350
Nola, it's only his first day.

298
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,260
Patrick,i'll make it easy for you.
It's jeremy or me. Your choice.

299
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,490
A
- all right, all right. I'll... I'll fire him.

300
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,410
Great.

301
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,760
Well,that's an interesting
wardrobe choice.

302
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,580
Oh,yeah. I'm changing at the
imperial. Unless you want me like this.

303
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,290
Uh,excuse me. I've gotta
get that. Let me check it.

304
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,760
You're working on our
wedding day? Romantic.

305
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,440
It'll just take a second.

306
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,970
<i>TRANSACTION COMPLETE DARLING
ENTERPRISER Voting Shares Transferred</i>

307
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,180
Is everything okay?

308
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,770
Is the world still
safe for billionaires?

309
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,790
Yeah.

310
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,740
- No complaints.
- Okay.

311
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,050
You... Are beautiful.

312
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,840
And i love you. And i can't...

313
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,310
I can't wait to be your husband.

314
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,750
Well,you don't have to wait much longer.

315
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,390
I gotta head over. I gotta go.

316
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,940
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

317
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,510
You know you will.

318
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,140
The bank called. The deal's done.
It'll hit the wires any minute.

319
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,770
Good. Well,we better start making calls.

320
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,630
- People are waiting to hear from us.
- Right.

321
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,230
If my observation of the man is correct, mr.
Elder will not have the guts to tell karen,

322
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,230
So i guess it'll be down to me.

323
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,470
If it's all right with
you, i'll tell her.

324
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,820
Okay. Thanks,nick.

325
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,400
Oh,hey,nick. It's not a good time.
I'm kinda gettin' married here.

326
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,330
- Karen,can we talk?
- Yeah.

327
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,430
Alone.

328
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,620
Okay,girls.

329
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,490
What's cookin'? Sorry.

330
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,280
I think you might want to sit back down.

331
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,370
Okay,nick,you know, i've-- i've played
this scene in my head a million times,

332
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,220
Of you coming in here and talking to me, and you
telling me that you're gonna whisk me off to some--

333
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,310
- I don't know-- -
this is not that scene.

334
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,370
- I know.
- I wish it were, but it's not.

335
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,310
Okay,so what's the matter?

336
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,640
You're not getting
married to simon today.

337
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,370
That's...

338
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,870
Are... Are you s-sure you're
not whisking me away here?

339
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,920
- I'm not.
- Because that would be...

340
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,170
- Better.
- I'm not.

341
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,000
What happened?

342
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:32,550
Simon offered to call off the wedding in exchange
for majority control of darling enterprises.

343
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,940
And your father took him up on it.

344
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,500
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

345
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,640
What g-- what girl wouldn't be thrilled
to know she's worth 20-- $20 billion?

346
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,100
- That's a
lot-- - more.

347
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,880
- Nick.
- Yeah.

348
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,490
You didn't have anything
to do with this,did you?

349
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,610
- Get out.
- Karen--

350
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,700
get out!

351
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,610
pillowhead! My man.

352
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,180
Jeremy darling in a suit.

353
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,690
- Oh,what's up?
- What's up?

354
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,060
What the hell are you dog here?
It's a little on the early side.

355
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,750
Well,i'm kinda on a sched.

356
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,840
I gotta get to my big
sister's fifth wedding.

357
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,880
What do you need,tunes?

358
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,160
We need to talk,my brother.

359
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,690
Well, all right. What can i do for you?

360
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,870
Well,it's more what can
we do for each other?

361
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,610
You shouldn't play with fire.

362
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,330
Who the hell are you, smokey the bear?

363
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,670
It makes the polish softer.

364
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,700
Hey,i'm just kidding.

365
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,790
You can be smokey the bear if you want.

366
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,650
Hey,what's the matter?

367
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,280
Is mommy going to die?

368
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,990
Why would you say that?

369
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,110
Because she's sick.

370
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,470
Who told you that?

371
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,910
I listened on the phone when
she was talking to the doctor.

372
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,300
Well,that's what you get
for eavesdropping,rumsfeld--

373
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,210
Inaccurate information.

374
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,410
But she is sick.

375
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,640
Yeah. She's sick.

376
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,840
But she's not gonna die.

377
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,830
You're lying.

378
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,630
Hey,have i ever lied to you?

379
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,050
- Yes.
- Listen to me.

380
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,240
Mommy is not gonna die. You understand?

381
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,910
Everything's gonna be just fine.

382
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,870
You look hot.

383
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,790
Jeremy,i am here to make my husband
jealous, not to get you aroused. Got it?

384
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,090
- Got it.
- Good.

385
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,940
And thank you.

386
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,320
Thanks again for coming with me.

387
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:02,530
Happy to, if for no other reason than to witness
the removal of yr brother as hanger-on in chief.

388
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,400
Great shoes,by the way.

389
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,220
Piece of advice,senator.
When we get to d.c...

390
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,620
Don't mention women's shoes.

391
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,860
How could you promise
him i was gonna be okay?

392
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,400
- I just wanted him to feel safe.
- Great.

393
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:23,560
Now when i die, he'll feel even more
unsafe and know that his dad is a liar.

394
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:27,430
- Look,you are not gonna die.
- Yes,i am.

395
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,670
- Grow up and accept it.
- No.

396
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,980
You can't die.

397
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,010
I need you. I love you.

398
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,680
You love me?

399
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,210
You'll do anything...
To win an argument.

400
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,840
Good afternoon.

401
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,650
If you'll all excuse me, i am
sorry to be the bearer of bad news,

402
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:07,560
But the schedule has changed, and
there will no longer be a wedding today.

403
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:13,100
On behalf of the bride
and groom, i apologize.

404
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,800
Uh,wait a second.

405
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,430
Yes,there is.

406
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,050
What are you doing?

407
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,580
- Andrea...
- Get up.

408
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,750
No. Listen...

409
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,530
Ever since i met you...

410
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:40,270
I've felt drawn to you, so much that it
makes me friggin' hate you sometimes...

411
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,480
Because i don't like needing anybody.

412
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,470
But i do need you. I do.

413
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,270
You're the mother of my son...

414
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,910
And i want you to be my wife.

415
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,120
So what do you say?

416
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,280
I do.

417
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:12,610
Then by the power vested in me by the state of
new york, i now pronounce you husband and wife.

418
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:33,920
Tripp darling got emotional,
and emotion is bad for business.

419
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,370
We're in serious trouble, simon,
and getting worse by the minute.

420
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,620
- What are you talking about?
- Here.

421
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,000
See for yourself.

422
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:48,460
It's been a roller-coaster
day for darling enterprises.

423
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,710
The blue chip surged in early
trading on news of a takeover

424
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,380
- by billionaire simon elder...
- Yeah,so?

425
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,850
- Keep watching.
- Then plummeted

426
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,930
when dozens of c.e.o.s announced they were
canceling their contracts with the company.

427
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,530
One star research analyst has
already published a note to investors

428
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,580
That she believes simon
elder's new company may face

429
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,470
- a serious liquidity cris in the coming weeks...
- What the hell happened?

430
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,920
He must have planned
this from the beginning.

431
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,340
You're a losing $100
million an hour,sir.

432
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,990
Suddenly be forced to file
for bankruptcy protection?

433
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,300
Is d.e.stock now worthless?

434
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,090
No word yet from simon elder...

435
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,020
- Shut it off.
- As to how these developments are sitting with the techno magnate.

436
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,260
- We'll be bringing you up-to-the-minute
updates... - Shut it off!

437
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,780
I'm trying,sir.

438
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:40,890
nobody leaves this room until we
put this company back together.

439
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,780
What are you doing here? What,d--
did you-- did you come to gloat?

440
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:50,450
I guess this was all a part of
daddy's plan all along,right?

441
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,000
Well,congratulations.

442
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,150
You can take the girl out of the darlings,
but you can't take the darling out of the girl.

443
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,550
How dare you accuse me of anything.

444
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:06,140
I gave myself to you more fully and more
freely than i've ever given to anyone.

445
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,980
And you traded me away for
what, for shares in a company?

446
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,770
Hey,look on the bright side.

447
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,320
At least now you're free for nick.

448
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,030
Oh,simon.

449
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,510
You don't get it, do you?

450
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,960
All i wanted was you.

451
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,710
You're quiet. Are you okay?

452
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,340
I'm happy. It's unfamiliar.

453
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,370
You're gonna have to
tell brian the truth.

454
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,380
We're only married 18 minutes,
you're already nagging me?

455
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,890
I don't think i can do it.

456
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,050
Which is exactly why you have to.

457
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,230
I'm dying,brian.

458
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,270
You have to learn how
to communicate with him,

459
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:10,360
Even when it's hard,
especially when it's hard.

460
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,240
Let's just let him enjoy today,okay?

461
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,250
Jeremy,how's it going?

462
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,250
Hey,what can i do for you,chief?

463
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,990
I am ready,willing and able.

464
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,410
- About that.
- You okay?

465
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,620
Jeremy,it's like this, and i really
hate to have to do this here,but--

466
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,140
give that fella medal.

467
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,150
Mr. O'connell,what are you doing here?

468
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,860
Well,i said no to you in person.

469
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,290
Figured i oughta come back to say yes.

470
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,360
Yes?

471
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:52,190
Senator,i've decided
to accept your offer,

472
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,960
and it was this young man
that got me to change my mind.

473
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,380
- J- jeremy?
- Yeah.

474
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,180
Really?

475
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,040
This is my son--
d.j.pillowhead.

476
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,350
What's up?

477
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,830
Mr. O'connell. What a surprise.

478
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,740
Ms.lyons.

479
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,150
Things have,uh, been a little
tough for me and my boy ever since,

480
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,950
Uh, my marriage fell
apart with his mother.

481
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,700
Fact of the matter is, we haven't
talked to each other for,uh,over a year.

482
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,040
I advised my buddy d.j.over here
to give his old man a call...

483
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,040
Reconcile.

484
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,920
My son and i still have some work
to do, but we're talking again.

485
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,200
And you've got yourself a deal.

486
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,030
- Well,wonderful.
- Fantastic.

487
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,200
Our staff will work out the details.

488
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,100
And thank you again, young man.

489
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,910
He's a keeper.

490
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,090
A keeper.

491
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,640
You look lovely.

492
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,460
Thank you.

493
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,500
You're here with nick?

494
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,320
I am,yeah.

495
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:14,700
Well,i've... Often said
on many occasions...

496
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,630
Nick... Is a lucky man.

497
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,340
Actually,i think i'm the lucky one.

498
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,650
Well...

499
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:29,940
Whatever comes of it, i couldn't
be more thrilled for the two of you.

500
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,030
Truly.

501
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,290
Well,i have to admit, you
throw a mean hail mary.

502
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,120
I had to.

503
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,050
Youwere trying to get me fired.

504
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,890
Get you fired,jeremy?

505
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,930
You barely even occur to me.

506
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,230
Hello,team.

507
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,520
Mind if i steal away my chief of staff
for a little spin on the dance floor?

508
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,950
She's all yours.

509
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,090
See you in the office,
first thing monday.

510
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,570
- We'll see about tuesday.
- Dig it.

511
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,620
So tell me, what did tripp have to say?

512
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,250
He couldn't have been nicer.

513
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,330
Why?

514
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,380
No reason.

515
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,770
What nick sees in her, i'll never know.

516
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,500
I have something to
confess to you,my dear.

517
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,110
What's that?

518
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,460
Upon first meeting wrenn...

519
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,870
Getting to know her a little,

520
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,820
i allowed myself to reflect,
for the first time,really,

521
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:46,850
In our 40 years, on what my life
might be like with someone else.

522
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,450
E could be your granddaughter.

523
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,490
I know. I know. It's absurd.

524
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,500
I even went so far as to ask nick to
arrange a clandestine rendezvous, a luncheon.

525
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,630
But it-- that
never came to pass.

526
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,400
But seeing her here this evening

527
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:09,160
put my escapade into perspective.

528
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:15,480
And i felt that you should
know that i discovered afresh...

529
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:23,180
That you are the love of my
life, and you always will be.

530
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,840
Thank you. Thank you.

531
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,750
Thank you.

532
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,270
- Mr. Darling.
- Yes,clark.

533
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,790
Simon elder's here. He says it's urgent.

534
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,780
You screwed me,old man.

535
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,630
You sabotaged darling enterprises.

536
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,830
Not at all. Not at all.

537
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,430
My friends,my colleagues, are free to do business
or to not do business with whomever they please.

538
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,720
But it is fascinating, don't you find?

539
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:56,520
To see people operating on the basis of something
other than the pursuit of financial gain.

540
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,170
The company is
ruined-- ruined.

541
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:03,230
Well,if you're no longer inrested
in controlling darling enterprises,

542
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,640
I will buy it back from you
at its current market value.

543
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:12,630
You think i'm gonna let you walk
away with a 1-day, $10-billion profit?

544
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:18,220
Okay,half the company...

545
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,030
At a 20% discount to yesterday's close.

546
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,710
So that that way it would only be...

547
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,780
$4 billion and change.

548
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,150
And what,you and i will...

549
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,320
Will be partners?

550
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,800
Ironic,isn't it?

551
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:44,230
What do you say? Deal?

552
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,670
- Wrenn, you bony little tramp.
- Excuse me?

553
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,500
How dare you show up at my daughter's
wedding and throw yourself at my husband,

554
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,140
- A man old enough to
be-- - i'm here with nick.

555
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,250
- Do you honestly think you're gonna steal my family...
- No.

556
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,790
- My fortune? - No,i
have no intention--

557
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,170
you think i would let that happen?

558
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,970
Okay,i-i didn't mean to hurt anyone.

559
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,720
I know exactly what you meant to do.

560
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:20,650
You planted yourself in front of my car,
you insinuated yourself into my household,

561
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,030
And you had every intention
of stealing my husband from me,

562
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,100
And with him,my future and
the future of my family.

563
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:36,820
Get the hell out of my house. Now!

564
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,610
Lost your date?

565
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,620
Lisa,let's-- let's
not do this here.

566
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,160
I was... Really asking.

567
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,220
Do you rember the summer house?

568
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,200
What,the one that you and your family used
to stay at when you were growing up? Yeah.

569
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,240
I was just thinking of this time in college when
me and my roommate drove all night to go there,

570
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:23,870
And when we finally made it,
it had been sold and torn down.

571
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,370
There was nothing left.

572
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,440
That's how i feel about
us right now. You know...

573
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:36,000
We could drive all night and try and get
back what we had, but it's-- it's gone.

574
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,330
It's just... Gone.

575
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,970
When i saw you and wrenn at the
coffee shop, i was so jealous.

576
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,480
So i brought jeremy
tonight to make you jealous.

577
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,920
But i don't feel jealous
anymore. I just feel...

578
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,350
Sad.

579
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,370
Yeah.

580
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,250
It's fine.

581
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,790
If you'll excuse me.

582
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,950
- Wrenn,wait a minute.
- No. I-i have to go.

583
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,610
- Why,what happened?
- I - i don't know.

584
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:41,100
- I can't be here. I can't be around these people.
- Wait. Just tell me what happened.

585
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,130
I honestly don't know. One
second,i'm talking to tripp about you.

586
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:50,340
Next thing i know, letia is accusing me of
coming to the wedding to steal her husband.

587
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:55,110
You know,i made it very clear to
tripp that it'syou i'm interested in.

588
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,330
I mean,you're asking me what
happened. Why don't you tell me?

589
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,070
You know what? This started
as an accident,and...

590
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,250
Maybe it's best if we
just leave it at that.

591
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:17,220
So... We're just done?

592
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,780
Just like that?

593
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:24,720
Listen,i would love to get
to know you better, really.

594
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,960
But existing around this
family is... Not easy.

595
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,630
Trust me. I-i know.

596
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,720
Go. And... Don't look back.

597
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,460
Tripp. We need to talk,now.

598
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,900
What the hell is going on?

599
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:08,050
Mr. Elder has had a nasty
case of buyer's remorse.

600
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,940
So we're going to bail
him out of his predicament.

601
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,560
Congratulations.

602
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,940
Did you enjoy owning darling
enterprises for five hours?

603
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,030
Oh,no,no. He's still going
to be a major shareholder.

604
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:27,290
I control 50% of the
company, to be exact.

605
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,270
What's going on,tripp?

606
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,950
Well,mr. Elder and i
have become partners.

607
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,150
Which i-i guess also means that
in addition to working for me,

608
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,690
you will also work for him.

609
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,760
Well... Clearly this
is about me and wrenn.

610
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,130
That's utter nonsense.

611
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,880
It wasn't enough for you to blow up my
chance at a relationship with the woman?

612
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,250
You're gonna make me pay r it again?

613
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,300
Nick,your accusation
is incomprehensible.

614
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,130
Fine.

615
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:02,560
I'll see both of you on monday morning.

616
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,920
Karen,i am so sorry.

617
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,000
Go to hell.
