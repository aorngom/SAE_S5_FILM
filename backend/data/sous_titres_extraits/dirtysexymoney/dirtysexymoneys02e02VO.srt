1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,930
Tonight on.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,450
behind the scenes of america's favorite certrov fsialamily-- 

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,660
the darlings.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,810
For decades,we've cheered their victories,

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,340
mourned their losses and relished the lurid scandals

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,180
that seem to follow america's first family everywhere.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,490
We thought the darling dynasty couldn't get dirtier,

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,940
but just last week,tragic lightning struck twice.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,590
First,new york attorney general patrick darling's beloved wife ellen

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,840
perished in a suspicious fire at the family's country estate,

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,870
leading the darlings to retreat en masse to the imperial,

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,030
their palatial manhattan home,where they've remained in seclusion.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,790
margaux,turn that off.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,970
We're still eating.

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,380
We want to see.

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,590
Why would you want to watch that garbage?

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,160
Lindsey dallamuir's mom says you killed mommy.

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,390
Dude.

19
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,120
are you serious?

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,740
Lots of people are saying it.

21
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,310
This is why I'm never having kids.

22
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,450
Whoa,whoa,whoa,listen to me,both of you,

23
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,080
what happened to your mother was an accident.

24
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,010
Even the police said so.

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,170
I-I loved your mommy.

26
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,740
very much.You know that.

27
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,980
While others ask,was this really an accident?

28
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,790
Meanwhile,wall street insiders are saying darling enterprises may be facing troubled times.

29
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,980
Analysts have downgraded inhe wake of what may be the biggest darling bombshell ever.

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,860
mr.Darling.

31
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,560
The board will see you now.

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,950
Letitia darling for the murder of dutch george,the family's lawyer.

33
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,880
Dutch's son,nick george,who now serves the family in a similar capacity,

34
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,080
spoke to reporters.

35
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,520
Who will represent mrs.Darling?

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,560
Terry deramian will serve as defense counsel for mrs.Darling.

37
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,390
Mr.Deramian's stell record as america's premier

38
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,040
defense attorney gives us every confidence mrs.Darling will be found innocent.

39
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,410
And she will be,make no mistake.

40
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,800
Mr.George,mr.George,you've enjoyed a close relationship with the darlings for decades,

41
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,710
but now that your own father is the alleged victim in a darling murder case,

42
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,280
do you believe in the darling curse?

43
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,940
Well,the only curse I know about is being asked questions like that.

44
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,830
thank you all very much.

45
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,170
Someone looks cute on tv.

46
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,470
Yeah,you can see me in highdef.

47
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,270
mayor bloomberg,nick george.

48
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,580
I just wanted to thank you on behalf of the darling family.

49
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,030
For making this tribute possible.

50
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,610
I will pass that on.

51
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,780
Thank you.

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,840
- Bye.
- He's coming to ellen's service?

53
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,580
Oh,I don't know.

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,320
We'll see.

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,110
He'll probably skip it like everybody else and show up at letitia's trial.

56
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,780
It's juicier.

57
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,300
Well,a person can only make it to so many darling debacles.

58
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,510
Are you sure you don't want me to come to the arraignment?

59
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,310
Oh,yeah.It's not gonna be any fun.

60
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,470
The whole family's pretty freaked.

61
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,890
I'm gonna be holding a lot of hands.

62
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,270
Who'll be holding yours?

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,900
I don't know.I hear jeremy's gonna be there.

64
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,280
I know how fond he is of our family.

65
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,910
You said you weren't angry anymore.

66
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,470
I'm not.

67
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,250
It doesn't mean I don't remember that you kissed jeremy.

68
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,880
Forgiveness isn't amnesia.

69
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,800
come here.

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,230
Come here.

71
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,720
Remember that thing we talked about doing?

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,360
You talked about.

73
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,900
You're bringing that up now?

74
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,340
You're the one who said you wanted to have another kid.

75
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,620
Nick,I'm still in this marriage for the long haul.

76
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,860
Come on.

77
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,820
Let's-- let's have a baby.

78
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,300
All right.Let's talk about this later,all right?

79
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,870
I've got a roomful of darlings waiting for me

80
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,470
to help them figure out what the entertainment

81
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,690
is gonna be for ellen's memorial service.

82
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,830
My god.

83
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,760
Is there anything these people won't ask you to do?

84
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,330
I'm amazed they haven't asked you to take letitia's case.

85
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,070
Mm,no,I guess even the darlings have their limits.

86
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,270
I want nick to defend your mother.

87
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,950
What?

88
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,690
What about this million-dollar deramian guy that nick recommended?

89
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,420
No,nick was right to bring him on as a bridge,

90
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,500
but now mr.Deramian should make a graceful exit,

91
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,490
and nick should take over the case.

92
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,450
You really expect him to stand up in court and defend the woman

93
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,740
who's accused of murdering his father,my father?

94
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,780
That woman is your mother.

95
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,550
She did not commit this crime.

96
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,300
She must not go to jail.

97
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:17,740
What jury could possibly convict her if she's being defended by the victim's son?

98
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,020
Something's troubling you.

99
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,690
What did the board have to say?

100
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,860
They're not happy.

101
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,480
No?

102
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,190
They want you to name a successor.

103
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,510
Your mother is the vice chair.

104
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,810
They know,and they all think she's going up the river tout de suite.

105
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,020
they do,do they?

106
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,150
Well,I suppose putting forward a succession plan

107
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,320
might stabilize the stock until your mother's acquittal.

108
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,450
You seem pretty optimistic.

109
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,690
I am.

110
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,130
Your mother will be proven innocent.

111
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,020
just so long as nick takes the case.

112
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,890
Okay,you have to go.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,220
What?

114
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,330
You can't keep me up until 5:15 in the morning,

115
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,200
then throw me out on the street at.8:05.

116
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,660
My day doesn't start till noon.

117
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,120
I have to get to work.

118
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,280
What do you even do?

119
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,820
I've been so busy.

120
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,150
Mapping your bod for the past three days like the sweet moon of venus it is,

121
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,890
I forgot to ask.

122
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,170
I'm a superhero.

123
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,270
Just remember,whatever happens.

124
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,050
every moment we've had has been completely real,and I like you a lot.

125
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,170
I really do.

126
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,370
What does that mean?

127
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,280
It means.

128
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,680
see you later.

129
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,620
Okay,after patrick's eulogy,it was suggested there be a song.

130
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,430
Choir,soloist?

131
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,940
What about elton john?

132
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,810
He'll play "candle in the wind" for anyone.

133
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,830
Genius.

134
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,940
Patrick,was there anyone who's music ellen was particularly fond of?

135
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,860
Kenny g?

136
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,680
th is so ellen.

137
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,160
I'll call kenny G.

138
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,010
oh,great.

139
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,390
You're all here.

140
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,250
,Daddy.

141
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,640
Hello,my darling girl.

142
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,790
Brian has just told me that the board has become fearful for the future of e company,

143
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,130
and they are going to demand that I choose a new vice chair to replace your mother.

144
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,790
A successor.

145
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,540
Exactly,and I'm your father.

146
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,400
I have an equal d imperishable love for each of you.

147
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,050
I--I'm not capable of making that decision.

148
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,350
So I'm going to need someone that I trust to make it for me,

149
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,820
and I can't think of anyone better suited to determine the future of the company

150
00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:01,590
than the fellow to whom I have entrusted the task of steering the family through each and every day.

151
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,290
And that is you,nick.

152
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,650
Good luck.

156
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,560
It should be you.

157
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,990
Oh,I think it kind of is me.

158
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,560
you know what I mean.

159
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,760
You should be next in line to run the company.

160
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,830
Oh,no.

161
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,280
Nick would never recommend to daddy that I should be in charge of anything.

162
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,330
Why?

163
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't know.He doesn't see me that way.

164
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,900
Well,how does nick see you?

165
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:42,340
Um,I'm a silly rich girl who doesn't know what she wants.

166
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,560
And is that what you are?

167
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,310
'Cause that's not what I see.

168
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,170
But you have to wonder,who's he gonna pick?

169
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:56,340
Patrick's running for senate,and,you know,business is hardly his "thing," and jeremy.

170
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,930
jeremy's just a bubble of goo.

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,820
Juliet's off on some island somewhere,and well,brian isn't even daddy's son.

172
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,440
- And you have an M.B.A.From columbia.
- I do.

173
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,800
And look at me-- 

174
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,160
I'm sleeping with you to get secrets for daddy.

175
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,440
I'm very loyal.

176
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,190
Completely.

177
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,190
It ought to be me.

178
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,440
Now--now you sound like someone who knows what they want.

179
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,370
I do.

180
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,850
and right after I get it.

181
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,380
I'm gonna go talk to nick.

182
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,760
Nicky!

183
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,260
We get front-row seats for mom's arraignment,right?

184
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,170
You're not gonna hit me again,are you?

185
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,140
You're not gonna kiss my wife again,are you?

186
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,880
No plans.

187
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,190
We're cool.

188
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,080
So who's this prosecutor they got on mom's case?

189
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,380
Ah,a real pit bull.

190
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,720
It's the kinda lawyer the state uses

191
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,630
when they really want to make an example of someone.

192
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,880
I hate this guy already.

193
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,180
It's not a guy.

194
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,320
Speak of the devil.

195
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,220
Nick george.

196
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,140
Nola lyons.

197
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,470
You're the--the-- uh,th-this is her?

198
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,140
Nola lyons,jeremy darling.

199
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,130
Oh,hi.Nice to meet you.

200
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,920
Nice to meet you,too.

201
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,360
Last time I read about you,nick,you were representing orphans and nuns.

202
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,900
Well,last time I read about you,nola,

203
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,000
you were sleeping with your boss,and now you have his job.

204
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,130
And you have the darlings.

205
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,570
Cream rises.

206
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,450
Nothing personal.

207
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,610
See you in the colosseum.

208
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,460
"People of the state of new york vs.Letitia van kirk darling." 

209
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,100
sweetheart,please.

210
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,030
Darling.

211
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,880
on behalf of my client,your honor,uh,we enter a plea of not guilty.

212
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,320
Objection.

213
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,190
Already?

214
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,430
Your honor,mr.Deramian is an out-of-state lawyer,and as such,

215
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,750
needs the sponsorship of local counsel in order to appear before this court.

216
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,730
I had,uh,that paperwork filed with the clerk yesterday,your honor.

217
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,180
That may be the case,but ms.Lyons seems to be correct.

218
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,010
It didn't make it to the actual file.

219
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,650
This hearing is adjourned.Mrs.Darling will be remanded into custody 

220
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,310
- until
- your honor,

221
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,950
your-- 

222
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,230
- you want me to take care
- no,no,no.

223
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,040
Nick will take care of it.

224
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,870
Nick?

225
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,940
Your honor,nick george,general counsel for the darling family.

226
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,230
Congratulations.Sit down.

227
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,250
I am prepared to act as local counsel until mr.Deramian can file the necessary paperwork.

228
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,410
Fine.

229
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,090
I'll let it go today,but please be sure to file those papers properly,mr.Deramian.

230
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,150
Absolutely,your honor.

231
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,790
You,mr.George,may proceed.

232
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,880
We humbly ask that bail be waived 

233
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,680
and mrs.Darling be allowed to remain free on her own recognizance.

234
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,970
Objection.

235
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,450
Your honor,the defendant is clearly-- 

236
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,050
your honor,mrs.Darling has no previous-- 

237
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,330
your honor,do you really want to send the message that the rich are above the law?

238
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,110
She's got a gulfstream v gassed up and waiting for her at teterboro.

239
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,200
Bail is set in the amount of $20 million.

240
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,010
The defendant will remain in custody until bond is posted.

241
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,110
your honor,I know this is highly irregular,

242
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,960
but we have taken it upon ourselves to contact the darlings' private bank,

243
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,170
and bail will be paid forthwith.

244
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,100
First time I've seen that.

245
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,450
Mrs.Darling,you are free to go,

246
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,140
but you will be under strict house arrest until further notice.

247
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,470
Next.

248
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,630
well,I don't know what the hell went wrong with those papers.

249
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,200
Did you get a proof of service from the clerk?

250
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,950
Yeah,of course I did.

251
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,670
But damned if I know where it got to.

252
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,990
Well,that's all right.

253
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,230
Things happen.

254
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,610
It's a pity that the only thing that went off flawlessly

255
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,310
was the shameless parade of our wealth.

256
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,810
Where are we going?

257
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,990
This is a little back way I daniel booned during the mangold trial.

258
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,660
Should be quiet as a church.

259
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,110
what the hell is that?

260
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,160
Well,this is a little disappointing.

261
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,700
Did you murder dutch george?

262
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,570
Cwhatouan y tell us?

263
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,270
where's the car?

264
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,100
Did yo plan this?

265
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,270
Terry,is this going to be a repeat of the harvey sutton trial?

266
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,280
My client is completely innocent.

267
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,720
Just as harvey sutton was innocent,despite bshis suequent confession.

268
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,040
Hey,clan,cayou get the car back here now,please?

269
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,600
Letitia,yd to live outside of the spotlight for over 30 years--

270
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,170
are you going to take the stand in your own defense?

271
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,050
Has the reality of the situation sunk in yet?

272
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,580
I just want tojust want to go home!

273
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,430
nothing personal?

274
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,630
Don't be a hater.

275
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,370
You hooked up with me and then arrested my mom.

276
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,280
It's called a hit-and-run.

277
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,650
Oh,I thought it was called a setup.

278
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,000
Jeremy.

279
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,930
It's not a setup,then what is it,some sort of evil plan to use me,get secret information?

280
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,590
If it was,I would've asked you a few questions,don't you ink?

281
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,600
Yeah.

282
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:21,570
The only thing I remember asking was for you to do a certain thing a little bit harder.

283
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,600
I told you everything was real.

284
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,650
I like you a lot.

285
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,630
It's just complicated.

286
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,420
I want to see you tonight.

287
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,050
We need to talk about this.

288
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,770
File that under "not gonna happen.

289
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,200
" It was great while it lasted.

290
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,090
That degree of mayhem could never have been predicted,tripp.

291
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,070
And what about those papers that you failed to file?

292
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,420
Or the fact that you were standing there preening in the silvery light of the cameras

293
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,450
while barely a foot away from you,

294
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,780
my beloved wife was unraveling like tape from a cassette?

295
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,610
I don't care how many shoddy heiresses you've returned

296
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:17,180
from the gnawing jaws of justice to the safety of their infinity pools.

297
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,380
You will not be defending my wife.

298
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,280
Fine.

299
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,100
You ready to take this case?

300
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,720
Brian,if you think heading into a court with me-- the victim's son--

301
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,970
- as her lawyer is gonna fly
- it exonerates her by design.

302
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,010
No,it doesn'T.

303
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,940
It makes us look like we're all in bed together.

304
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:46,890
Yeah,that's true.

305
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,490
That's true.

306
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,820
I'll have a new list ofttorneys for you in the morning.

307
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,980
thank you.

308
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,120
Excuse me.

309
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,700
What's going on?

310
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,540
All will be well,my darling.

311
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,660
Just wait.

312
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,240
There's not an argumen you can make that'll change my mind,brian.

313
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,380
I'm not taking the case.

314
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,650
I can't believe you.

315
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
We ask you one friggin' thing.

316
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,620
brian,you ask me to do everything.

317
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,830
Why shouldn't we?

318
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,190
You don't think you owe this family?

319
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,410
Your whole life,we've treated you like a friggin' prince.

320
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,400
A prince?

321
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,230
I'm the cleanup crew,brian.

322
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,050
I'm the guy who clears your tickets,plans your funerals and calls kenny G.

323
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,270
Oh,and in between chores,

324
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,700
I have to decide which one of you spoiled brats gets to inherit the kingdom.

325
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,190
And,oh,yes,on occasion,

326
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,940
I'm invited to sit at the main table,

327
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,890
but that's just until somebody drops their plate and I'm sent to fetch a mop.

328
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,310
Well,that's what family is.

329
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,730
We're all expendable until we're needed.

330
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,120
At least you get paid for it.

331
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:04,930
Brian,get this straight-- I'm not taking this case,now or ever.

332
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,950
**********

333
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,880
yeah,paddy.

334
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,440
Uh,have you given some thought as to what you're going to say?

335
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,220
At ellen's memorial service?

336
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,370
This eulogy could be a real milestone in your political life.

337
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,100
Dad,it's bad enough that we covered up ellen's death.

338
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,410
Do we really have to capitalize on it?

339
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,210
We don't have to,no.

340
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:42,190
One wonders,though,who precisely is best served by missing this opportunity.

341
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,840
Certainly not ellen.

342
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,740
She wanted nothing more than for you to win this election.

343
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,880
You know that.

344
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,870
What am I supposed to get up there and say?

345
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,860
Share the pain of this.

346
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,680
unthinkable loss.

347
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,150
a-and be a human being.

348
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,820
a human being.

349
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,020
I'll try.

350
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,660
Afternoon,counselor.

351
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,680
Oh,what do you want?

352
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,410
You're not letitia's lawyer now,are you?

353
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,720
'Cause that would be gross.

354
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,790
No,I'm not,but I still represent the family,

355
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,850
and the family would like letitia to attend ellen's memorial service tomorrow.

356
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,270
She's under house arrest.

357
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,340
Come on.Give her an exemption.

358
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,930
She should be in jail,and by the way,no need to thank me for finding your father's murderer.

359
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,980
How did you end up on the wrong side of this fight?

360
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,530
What kind of case have you got?

361
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,270
Golden--a 40-year affair gone bad,a plane that's been tampered with,

362
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,600
an eager witness and a juicy chance to arresher again if she shows her face outdoors.

363
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,580
You wouldn't dare.

364
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,810
Try me.

365
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,320
You're kinda late,nick.

366
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:54,680
Well,gee.

367
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,770
I'm really sorry,karen.

368
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,500
I just got all caught up in trying to find someone to defend your mother in a murder trial.

369
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,670
let me guess.You're herbecause you want me to pick you to take over the company.

370
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,390
Oh,let me guess.

371
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,190
You weren't even going to consider me,were you?

372
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,050
Come on,karen.

373
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,710
I am well-aware of all your virtues-- your business experience,

374
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,130
your work with the family foundation.

375
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,310
I promise you I'm gonna take all those things into consideration as I make a decision,okay?

376
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,350
Done.

377
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,970
You're not gonna pick me.

378
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,340
Come on,karen.

379
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,830
You know,I don't want to pick anybody.

380
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,200
- I got handed this live grenade
- you're not gonna pick me.

381
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,050
It's that simple.

382
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,190
If I had known when we were 10 years old that letting you see me

383
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,800
with my shirt off was gonna cost me the company,I never would've done it.

384
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,550
But I guess I didn't know you then.

385
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,680
And I don't know you now,nick.

386
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,620
Karen.

387
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,870
I'm going to kill him.

388
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,770
I'm seriously going to kill him.

389
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,970
Ah,he might still recommend you.

390
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,070
No,he won'T.

391
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,300
Once you see a person a certain way,that's how you see them.

392
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,550
Nick doesn't ke me seriously.

393
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,950
I don't know.How could he not?

394
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,780
Ask him.

395
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,150
you know what?I think I might just do that.

396
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,210
No.See?I was kidding.

397
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,740
No,no,no.No,no,listen to me.Karen,

398
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,480
I got to where I am today by recognizing

399
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,020
and utilizing not only my own talents but the talents of others.

400
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,070
Nick,because he has a history with you,

401
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:30,240
might not be able to see all of your gifts like I do.

402
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,020
Let me talk to him.

403
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,720
Okay.

404
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,380
okay.

405
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,600
patrick,I assure you,I'm taking all your leadership qualities

406
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,080
into consideration as I make a decision,okay?

407
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,990
Nick,don't care about the company.

408
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,280
That's not why I'm here.

409
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,100
Oh,okay.

410
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:52,780
So what's up?

411
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,210
Well,dad wants me to write a heartfelt eulogy for ellen's memorial.

412
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,150
He thinks it'll clinch the election.

413
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,460
He's probably not wrong,regrettably.

414
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,390
Well,I'm--I'm having a real tough time.

415
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,750
With what,finding the words?

416
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,190
The words?

417
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,620
try the feelings.

418
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,550
And this damn thing's tomorrow.

419
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,660
Patrick,you had two children with the woman.

420
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,040
I mean,you must have some feelings for her.

421
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,670
She tried to kill me with a fire poker,nick.

422
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,520
And before that,she shot me in the leg,remember?

423
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,270
- I mean,call me callous here
- I hear you.

424
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,790
I hear you.

425
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,950
What am I supposed to do?

426
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,870
I-I keep trying to come up with things,and all I can think about is.

427
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,950
carmelita.

428
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,470
Wait a minute.Are you two seeing each other again?

429
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,050
No,no.She's still missing,but she's all I.

430
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,600
ever think about.

431
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,510
Well,pat,if--if she's really all that you can think about,

432
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,380
why don't you try writing it about her?

433
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,410
Carmelita?

434
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:45,850
You write it about carmelita,then you can replace her name with ellen's when you're done.

435
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,680
That's a great idea.

436
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,370
All right.

437
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,350
That's a great idea.

438
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,640
Great.

439
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,600
That was easy.

440
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,410
Good to see you.

441
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,860
You,too.

442
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,140
Oh,and by the way,nick,you,uh,you are gonna pick me,right?

443
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,660
Write the speech,pat.

444
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,990
That's fair.

445
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,250
Icy,nK.

446
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,750
glad I caught you.

447
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,160
Hope I can say the same.

448
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,410
Yeah,hey,can I talk to you for a second?

449
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,650
Yeah.

450
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,150
I'll--I'll cut to the chase.

451
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,710
I-I need a favor.

452
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,060
It's about karen.

453
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,760
Come on,simon.

454
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,320
Lobbying on behalf of family members?

455
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,980
Just hear me-- hear me out.Please.

456
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,420
We both know karen.

457
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,570
She's a great girl.

458
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,980
She's got a lot of amazing qualities.

459
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,750
Agreed.

460
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,100
But let's be honest.

461
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,360
Running a billion-dollar,multinational corporation isn't one of 'em.

462
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,810
Now I'm in a tight spot.

463
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,670
Karen asked me to talk to you because.

464
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,170
she doesn't trust you to make a fair decision in this matter.

465
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,750
I-I-I don't think she trusts you on much of anything anymore.

466
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,510
Now li--I--look,I was reluctant to get involved,but we know karen.

467
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,390
She wants what she wants.

468
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,140
I mean,last week she wanted a-a fendi bag.

469
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,510
This week she wants darling enterprises.

470
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,590
Why are you telling me this?

471
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,180
Because I told her I'd talk to you.

472
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,180
But when push comes to shove,I can't,

473
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,120
in good conscience,sell you something you're too smart to buy.

474
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,210
So just do me this favor.

475
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,360
If she ever asks you what I said,

476
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,020
just try not to sell me completely down the river.

477
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,330
okay?

478
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,720
Okay.

479
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,220
Anyway.

480
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,890
I'm glad I caught you.

481
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,100
Yeah,yeah,me,too.

482
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,220
What's this?

483
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,210
My recommendation for the new vice chair of darling enterprises.

484
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,130
Really?

485
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,230
In terms of loyalty and commitment and brains,

486
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,460
that's the person best equipped to guide the company,I feel.

487
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,950
All right,then.

488
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,500
The future of darling enterprises has just been secured.

489
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,590
She was no ordinary woman,my ellen.

490
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,480
No.

491
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,380
Far from it.

492
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:42,160
Ellen's special blend of courage and kindness combined to form a whole that embodied--

493
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,880
what a body it was-- the american spirit,

494
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,210
that uniquely american spirit that celebrated freedom,

495
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,560
creativity and transformation.

496
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,270
Does that sound like ellen to you?

497
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,370
I think he's delirious with grief.

498
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,870
sorry.

499
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,260
Just.

500
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,820
not a moment goes by that I don't miss her.

501
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,030
but I know that even though her corporeal being has left us,her.

502
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,970
spirit lives on in my heart.

503
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,340
You know,I was born with every advantage a person could have.

504
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:32,540
But ellen made me feel like I was worth something.

505
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,560
I just miss her so much.

506
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,580
I love you.

507
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:55,460
and now here with a musical tribute,one of ellen's favorite performers-- mr.Kenny G.

508
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,450
Here we go.

509
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,420
sorry to break up the party.

510
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,820
I've been expecting you.

511
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,780
You really gonna do this?

512
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,980
You put her in a difficult position by letting her attend,nick.

513
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,750
Go get her.

514
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,430
out of the way,please.

515
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:51,780
gentlemen.

516
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,740
Mrs.Darling,we're gonna have to ask you to come with us.

517
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,090
She will do nothing of the kind.

518
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,110
Sir,she's violated house arrest.

519
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,330
Mrs.Darling,please.

520
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,490
Ma'am,please.

521
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,150
Hey,get the hell away from my mother.

522
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,910
Sir,step away or I will have you arrested.

523
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,070
No,you step away,or I'm gonna have you working a crosswalk,chubby.

524
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,430
You're not helping.

525
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,350
that's them.

526
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,330
I see her.

527
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,890
let's go!

528
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,650
well,counselor,there they go.

529
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,390
Six major news outlets recording the brutal arrest of a grief-stricken woman.

530
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,390
If you're looking to taint the jury pool in her favor--

531
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,640
I don't think that's how it plays.

532
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,470
Enlighten me.

533
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,680
I see a cold-blooded murderer oswhe sense of entitlement knows no bounds.

534
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,550
She's a grandmother.

535
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,960
She's a sociopath.

536
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,930
No,no,tish.

537
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,120
Get a doctor.

538
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:35,850
Oh,great.

539
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,860
Way to go,moron!

540
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,120
Sir,I am warning you,step back.

541
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,230
You still sure you want to do this?

542
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,350
somebody get a doctor!

543
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,590
It is getting a little icky.

544
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,460
I'll let her go with a warning.

545
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,200
I'll send you the medical bills.

546
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,900
Right.

547
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,200
what the hell?

548
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,240
What do you think you're doing?

549
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:55,850
My job.

550
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,770
I need to see you tonight.

551
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,670
Not possible.

552
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,960
Oh,how 'bout I go perform a little duet with mister G.

553
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,460
About how you slept with the defendant'son 

554
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,720
hours before you arrested his mother for murder?

555
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,780
You wouldn'T.

556
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,980
We paid for two songs.

557
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,450
10:00,my apartment.

558
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,680
But by 10:05,you're out on your ass.

559
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,060
Okay,let her go.

560
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,000
Take off the cuffs.

561
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,890
and who the hell are you?

562
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,780
I'm the family lawyer.

563
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,620
I just consulted with your boss,and she said there's been a misunderstanding.

564
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,600
Yeah,I guess you guys are gonna have to go get your jollies somewhere else.

565
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,200
Maybe you can go roll a few bums.

566
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,940
That does it.

567
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,430
You are coming down to the station with us.

568
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,300
The hell I am!

569
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,500
Sir,I am serious.

570
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,930
Why don't you bring it,doughnut hole?

571
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,670
Oh,all right.

572
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,640
Okay,brian,just step back.

573
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,590
I will take care of this,okay?

574
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,540
Oh,the hell you will.

575
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,420
you know a good lawyer?

576
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,980
Not in the mood,brian.

577
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,810
Hey,I just got arrested for assaulting a peace officer.

578
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,670
I'm gonna need counsel,

579
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,920
and I know how eager you are to defend a darling in open court.

580
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,800
Anyway,it doesn't matter,'cause I get your whole thing,nick.

581
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,910
What are you talking about?

582
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,530
The company.

583
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,040
What about it?

584
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,960
You want to run the company.

585
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,830
I don't want to run the company.

586
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,710
But you said so yourself.

587
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,940
You grew up slinking around the edge of a rich family 

588
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,260
wondering why you of all people were so unlucky to be put

589
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,930
that close to the prize and denied it every single day.

590
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,880
That's nothat I said.

591
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,670
And now here you are years later.

592
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,520
I mean,far be it from you at this late date to pick a fight with tripp darling,

593
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,610
the one guy who could hand you the whole kitty on a silver monogrammed platter.

594
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,100
- Damn it,brian.
- I picked you!

595
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,840
Bull crap.

596
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,170
Ask tripp.

597
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,850
I handed him a memo yesterday with my recommendation for a successor,and it was you.

598
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:54,810
Why would you do that?

599
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,720
Because,brian,you're the best person for the job.

600
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,690
You've been the black sheep in that family for your whole life,

601
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,560
and you're still willing to do anything for them,

602
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,010
like sabotaging court documents and getting people like terry deramian fired.

603
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,120
You found out about that?

604
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,650
And because you're a real pain in the ass,

605
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,910
and when it's your job to run a $50-billion global enterprise,

606
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,600
that's not such a bad thing to be.

607
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,800
just take the case.

608
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,470
Brian,why are you so intensely committed to getting me to take this case?

609
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,520
Because I know my mom didn't do it.

610
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:33,000
And if the only way to get her off is for the son of the guy

611
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:37,310
she's accused of killing to stand up in court and say she didn't do it?

612
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,650
Then that's what has to happen.

613
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,050
She's innocent.

614
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,970
And you used to be the kind of person who cared about stuff like that.

615
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,600
Oh,brian.

616
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,280
besides,we both know who killed our dad.

617
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,140
- Who?
- Come on.

618
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,530
Who do you think?

619
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,410
The woman he loved.

620
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,800
or the guy he betrayed for the past 40 years?

621
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,830
Tripp?

622
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,890
Tripp.

623
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,400
Not that we'll be able to do anything about it.

624
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,970
We all know how that works.

625
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,640
hello,ladies.

626
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,170
Well.

627
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:23,990
what happened?

628
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,900
The officers involved in your little donnybrook don't want to testify.

629
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,260
Something about saving their pensions from the vengeful arm of the darlings.

630
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,960
sissies.

631
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,600
Oh,god.

632
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,120
Just get 'em out of here.

633
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,690
tough luck,huh,counselor?

634
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,630
I'm fine with it.

635
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,010
You're not the darling I want anyway.

636
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,600
I'm not a darling.

637
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,400
Aren't you?

638
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,910
Come on.

639
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,100
You're the darlingest darling of them all.

640
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,280
mr.Darling.

641
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,400
she's the one who thinks you killed mommy.

642
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,820
Mr.Darling.

643
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,530
What--what can i do for you?

644
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,440
I'm connie dallamuir.

645
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,090
I've heard a lot about you.

646
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,050
I won't keep you.

647
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,720
I just wanted to say that I saw the eulogy you delivered on the news.

648
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,700
Yes?

649
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,540
I just have to say it was lovely.

650
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,560
It felt like you were speaking straight from your heart to mine,

651
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,700
to anyone who's lost a loved one.

652
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,160
You'll make a great senator.

653
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,790
Thank you.

654
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,080
Thank you very much.

655
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,480
Good afternoon.

656
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,520
you're four minutes late.

657
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,380
I stopped to get these.

658
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,880
You've got 60 seconds.

659
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,170
All right,then tell me once and for all.

660
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,550
did you or did you not set me up?

661
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,760
I set myself up.

662
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:05,830
Look.

663
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,190
I've never lost a case,and I rarely face opposing lawyers

664
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,670
who present even the slightest challenge.

665
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,310
So I've developed this bad habit of getting involved with people close to the case,you know,

666
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,210
as a way of keeping it interesting.

667
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,050
That's all thiwas.

668
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,360
Good-bye.

669
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,020
So what,I'm,like,your handicap?

670
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,880
Did you hear the way I screamed when we did it in your limo?

671
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,460
Yeah.

672
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,860
You're not a handicap.

673
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,770
Then let me come inside.

674
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,260
No.I can't risk losing this case.

675
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,750
- So if you don't mind
- nola,will you hold these a sec?

676
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,420
I know you're trying my mom for murder,but.

677
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,750
god,I want you so much.

678
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,160
Jeremy,sex is just sex.

679
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,840
this isn't about sex.

680
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,990
This is about your face.

681
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,230
You have the most beautiful face in the world,nola.

682
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:58,170
your eyes,your lips your little,tiny freckles.

683
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,770
You know what I think about most when I remember that night in the limo?

684
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,310
Don't tell me.

685
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:06,520
The feeling of your ear against my upper lip.

686
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,390
and the way the back of your head felt in my hand as I held it when you.

687
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,530
you know.

688
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,820
We both know this can't happen.

689
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,490
I don'T.

690
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,430
Let me in.

691
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,340
My 60 seconds ran out 60 seconds ago.

692
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,230
No one.

693
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,830
will ever.

694
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,290
find out.

695
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,730
That was pretty much it.

696
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,140
I,um.

697
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,960
I made my case for you as dispassionately as I could.

698
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,750
Nick listened.

699
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,400
You know,but to be honest,

700
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,670
I don't think he was really interested in what I had to say.

701
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:02,580
So after about an hour,I-I wrapped it up and I thked him for his time.

702
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,640
So he's not going to pick me,is he?

703
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,320
Honey,I don't know.

704
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,840
I don't know.I just think at the end of the day,

705
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,690
he doesn't take you as seriously as I do.

706
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:39,360
cnbc's confirmed that the succession announcement--

707
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,550
the press conference will air live.

708
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,290
Good.

709
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,070
That's good.

710
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,540
I'll take the case.

711
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,170
Excuse me?

712
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,530
I'll defend letitia.

713
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:57,780
Well,that--that--that's-- that's wonderful news,nick.

714
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,780
May I ask you what caused you to change your mind?

715
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,330
Ah,we both know she didn't do it.

716
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,690
Okay.

717
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,250
And besides,tripp.

718
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,620
we're family.

719
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,040
Hey,you look good.

720
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,630
I have an interview at the needham gallery.

721
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,770
That's good.

722
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:30,930
Oh,whatever.

723
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:35,170
I'm overqualified and I probably won't get it,but I'm not that psyched for it anyway.

724
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,300
So why go?

725
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,300
Well,I gotta do something with my life.

726
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,500
Kiki is in school all day,and since we're apparently not having another baby.

727
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,970
I took the case.

728
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,790
Letitia's?

729
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,940
Yeah.

730
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,650
Why?

731
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,960
Because she's innocent.

732
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,320
Look,it's complicated.

733
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,650
No,it's not.

734
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,420
It's really simple.

735
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,900
You can't say no to the darlings.

736
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,890
Lisa,would you just listen to me?

737
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,840
I know what I'm doing.

738
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,000
You used to have faith in me.

739
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,550
Have some now.

740
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,400
Please.

741
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,950
Okay.

742
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,260
I'll see you at the press conference.

743
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,210
Congratulations.

744
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:40,370
Nick's decided to take your mother's case,and it's thanks to you.

745
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,780
Well,I made a compelling argument,and nick finally saw the wisdom.

746
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:47,630
It's very impressive,son,very.

747
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,890
There are great things ahead for you.

748
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,050
Don't doubt it.

749
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,270
Come on.

750
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:01,030
They're waiting downstairs.

751
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,740
In light of all e recent challenges that have befallen our family and our company,

752
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,510
it became incumbent upon me to choose a successor

753
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:20,910
who will take over from letitia the position of vice chair of darling enterprises.

754
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:25,750
It has not been an easy task.

755
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,250
All the candidates are extraordinarily talented,

756
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:35,660
and I love each and every one of them with all my heart.

757
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:40,450
But the board demanded a leader,a decision maker

758
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,890
who would usher in a great and prosperous new era for us all.

759
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,270
That was their mandate,and suffice to say,we are,

760
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:53,920
as of this moment,uh,uniformly thrilled with our pick.

761
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,420
So,ladies and gentlemen,it gives me great pleasure

762
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:01,620
to introduce to you the new vice chair of darling enterprises--

763
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,450
nick george.

764
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,270
did you know daddy was gonna pick nick?

765
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,360
No,I thought he was gonna pick me.

766
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,920
That was never gonna happen.

767
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,420
Oh,lisa must be so happy.

768
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:16,800
Yeah,tripp spreads joy wherever he goes.

769
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,640
Well,thank you.

770
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,580
Thank you very much.

771
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,610
Thank you.

772
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,970
Uh,if you'll excuse me.

773
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,450
God,you look beautiful.

774
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
Thank you.

775
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,150
I've been trying to make my way across the room for the last half-hour.

776
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,350
Well,you're very popular tonight.

777
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,330
Yeah.

778
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,050
Lisa,I didn't know.

779
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:45,010
Look,this was as much of a shock to me as it was to you.

780
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,040
Do you think it's because you took the case?

781
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:51,110
You know,I have no idea.

782
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,900
We're supposed to sit down and talk about it,

783
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,420
but we haven't had a chance with all the...

784
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,920
Is.

785
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,290
this what you want?

786
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,640
You know,I can't say I've thought about it until now,but...

787
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,940
it's not so bad,you know?

788
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,970
No,it's not so bad.

789
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,640
What?

790
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,700
Maybe I was wrong.

791
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,210
- About?
- Having a baby.

792
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,350
Look,maybe you were right.

793
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,250
Maybe we should do it.

794
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,310
We are in a really good place right now.

795
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,220
No.

796
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,890
- No?Why not?
- Because.

797
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,030
you said you wanted a baby.

798
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,050
I just don't think it's a good idea anymore.

799
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,110
I'm sorry.

800
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,230
Nick?

801
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,470
Can I steal you away for second?

802
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,480
Somebody I want you to meet.

803
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,620
I-I will be right there.

804
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,470
Go,nick.

805
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,360
Look,I want to continue this conversation.

806
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,760
Go.I'm not going anywhere.Go.

807
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,300
An old friend of mine.

808
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:56,990
I haven't seen him for years.

809
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,020
I've been telling him all about you.

810
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,470
This is nick.

811
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,560
Nick.
