00:00:01,155 --> 00:00:02,772
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:02,892 --> 00:00:05,382
Alex, please tell me that you
don't live with Meredith Grey.

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,127
<i>The more available he gets,</i>

4
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:08,840
the more I pull away.

5
00:00:09,014 --> 00:00:11,584
I'm used to being number one.
I will help you.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,120
We'll be like a team.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,308
Dr. Hahn has agreed to become
our new head of cardiothoracic surgery.

8
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:18,048
Lookin'forward to it, Dr. Yang.

9
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:19,639
Ah, good morning.

10
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:21,089
Trout for breakfast...

11
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:22,230
Again.

12
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:24,915
Tonight we will have hot,

13
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:26,929
perfect sex.

14
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:28,111
I'm exhausted.

15
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:30,649
Maybe tonight's not the perfect night.

16
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:44,581
<i>Before we were doctors,
we were med students.</i>

17
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:47,497
<i>Which meant we spent a lot
of time studying chemistry.</i>

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,760
- That was...
- Aerobic.

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,003
- Aerobic bad?
- No.

20
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:00,388
Why, do you think it was bad?

21
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:01,928
- No.
- Okay.

22
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:04,867
No, I mean, obviously
we both were nervous.

23
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:06,687
Well, yeah, we've been,

24
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:09,449
you know, waiting for so long.
It was like...

25
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,161
- It better be good.
- No, better be worth it.

26
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,617
That's a lot of pressure.

27
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:15,905
Yeah.

28
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:21,032
- Let's just do it again.
- Let's get right back on that horse.

29
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:25,251
<i>Organic chemistry, biochemistry...</i>

30
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:26,961
<i>We learned it all.</i>

31
00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:28,454
<i>What's new with you?</i>

32
00:01:28,846 --> 00:01:31,156
I saw my half sister half naked.

33
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:35,953
- What's new with you?
- I had dinner and a movie...

34
00:01:36,717 --> 00:01:37,807
With the chief.

35
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,056
You could stay.

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,864
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go.

37
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:48,135
Leave you wanting more and all of that.

38
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:51,011
<i>But when you're talking
about human chemistry,</i>

39
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:52,772
<i>only one thing matters...</i>

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,978
<i>Either you've got it...</i>

41
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,113
<i>or you don't.</i>

42
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,699
Dry cleaning.

43
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:08,889
Yeah. You want some coffee?

44
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,820
And tell them
that there is a stain

45
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,001
on the left sleeve
of the blue one.

46
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:16,286
I'm thinking <i>Godfather</i> tonight.

47
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:18,463
Sounds good.

48
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:21,409
"I'm gonna make 'em
an offer they can't refuse."

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,178
- That's Brando.
- Yeah. Got that.

50
00:02:27,258 --> 00:02:28,639
<i>XXX.</i>

51
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:35,669
Hey, I'm taking Meredith Grey
from you this week.

52
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,050
Her mother was a good surgeon,
and I want to see what she's like.

53
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,501
That's not how it works here.

54
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:42,739
You get assigned a resident.
There's a schedule.

55
00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:46,930
Well, the schedule doesn't take
into account certain things.

56
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:50,401
- Like what?
- Like the fact that I don't want Yang.

57
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:51,892
You can have stevens.

58
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:54,326
She's good,
and I'm sure Shepherd won't mind.

59
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,847
Won't mind what?

60
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,077
She's sassy.

61
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:03,188
She's a woman of substance.
You two have nothing in common.

62
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:05,936
Oh, I'm late. I had to drop
off the chief's dry cleaning.

63
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:07,808
You're doing his laundry?

64
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:10,444
- We're helping each other out.
- Yeah? What's he doing?

65
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:12,604
He has an extensive dvd collection.

66
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:16,506
You're dating the chief.

67
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,597
I don't care if you sleep with Lexie.

68
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:25,163
- I just can't do it at my house.
- It's my house.

69
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:26,596
Oh, get over it.

70
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:28,446
- It was a onetime thing anyway.
- Alex.

71
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:30,161
What? Seriously, one time.

72
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,411
What's the problem with you
and your sister anyway?

73
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:33,942
She's not my sister.

74
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:38,952
You look weird.

75
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:40,716
- I don't look weird.
- What's wrong?

76
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:42,743
- I look fine.
- I know you.

77
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,078
It's horrible...

78
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,222
The sex... with Izzie...

79
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:51,310
Horrible.

80
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,469
It's like she's trying too hard.
It's... You ever see a porno?

81
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,490
Not that Izzie's a porno.
She's an angel.

82
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,902
But it's like she's trying
to channel a porn star.

83
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:03,410
And she's trying to act
all dirty and sexy,

84
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,987
which sounds great, right?
But in reality,

85
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:08,477
I just want to say,
"Izzie,

86
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:11,698
"just 'cause you can do that with
your legs doesn't mean you should."

87
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:18,739
- I want to run.
- Run. Run. Run now.

88
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:26,361
- I love George.
- Oh, god.

89
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:28,706
I do. I love him.
And I'm so happy

90
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:32,963
because he's kind and smart
and, um, sweet

91
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,009
and sexy.
He's perfect. Perfect.

92
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,207
Except for the fact that
he kisses like a chicken.

93
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:39,337
You know, a chicken pecking
the ground for food,

94
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:41,179
just pecking
and pecking and pecking?

95
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:43,771
When he's pecking at me like that,
I forget that I love him.

96
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:46,164
I forget that he's kind
and sweet and sexy,

97
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:48,318
and I just want to scream,
"Stop pecking me!"

98
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,209
Did he peck you ke a chicken, Mer?

99
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,996
- Morning.
- Cristina needs me.

100
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:57,574
I'm painting Burke's apartment so I can
stop calling it "Burke's apartment".

101
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:00,783
A happy color... Red, like blood.

102
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:03,699
Plus, I am on cardio this whole week...

103
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:06,884
One of the benefits of living with
the person who makes the schedule.

104
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:09,926
I'm on post-op.

105
00:05:10,113 --> 00:05:12,170
Again.
Second week in a row.

106
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:13,480
Trade with me.

107
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,921
Oh, yeah. No way.

108
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:17,753
- I was talking to Meredith.
- Why? I'm with Hahn.

109
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:20,089
Dude, wake up
and smell the surgical board.

110
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:25,019
3 days ago, there was
a code in room 2037

111
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,548
and no resident to cover it.

112
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:29,223
The schedule is a mess,
your mess.

113
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:30,660
Clean it up.

114
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,775
Chief had on his stern face.

115
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:37,739
Yeah, you know, I was...
I was happy this morning.

116
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:39,129
You know why?

117
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,035
Because I have back-to-back
surgeries today.

118
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:45,334
You have on
your I-want-something face.

119
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:46,763
Will you cover for me,

120
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:49,354
just do the chief resident thing
so I can stay happy?

121
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:50,969
Just today. Please, please.

122
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,819
- So you want me to...
- Be me.

123
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:54,074
But, you know, better.

124
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:55,570
Be you.

125
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:01,224
How's it going, Jerry?

126
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:03,719
If by "how's it going,"
you're asking me

127
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,837
if I've had the pleasure
of taking a crap yet, Dr. Karev,

128
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:09,233
The answer is it's not going.

129
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:10,859
Nothing's going. Nothing's moving.

130
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,915
It's been five days since
your bowel resection.

131
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:15,035
- You should be...
- Crapping by now?

132
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,594
What's the problem?
Did you people botch the surgery?

133
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,082
Is there crap leaking out into my body?

134
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:23,111
- The surgery was a success...
- Listen, Dr. Karev...

135
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:25,261
Oh, Mama!

136
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:29,376
I've been divorced twice.
My children won't talk to me.

137
00:06:29,976 --> 00:06:32,898
I've battled addictions,
filed for bankruptcy.

138
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,609
My life has basically sucked.

139
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:36,489
But through it all,

140
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:40,309
the one thing I had going for me was
I crap like clockwork.

141
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:42,841
It's a simple pleasure.
I want it back.

142
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:45,171
So get your little prescription pad

143
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,134
and write me a prescription

144
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:48,805
to make me crap.

145
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:53,518
Grey and Hahn?

146
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,874
Hey, she can't do this.

147
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:59,332
She can't just not teach me.
It's her job.

148
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,451
- Torres has to make her teach me.
- If the chemistry isn't there...

149
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:04,290
It's not chemistry.
She doesn't like me.

150
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:05,989
She says it's chemistry.

151
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:08,171
No, I'm going to Torres.

152
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:09,701
Uh, Dr. Torres...

153
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,537
wanted me to tell you...

154
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,517
to find another specialty.

155
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:17,566
- Why?
- It's not gonna work with Hahn.

156
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:21,082
So you need to fin a way to make
it work with another specialty.

157
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,363
I suggest you try the ER.

158
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:25,881
- What?
- This isn't a request.

159
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:28,011
This is an order from
your chief resident.

160
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:32,808
The ER can be a candy store.

161
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:35,203
You've got car crashes, impalements.
What do you got?

162
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:37,351
Sprained ankle and an infected bunion.

163
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:40,841
It can also strip you
of your will to live.

164
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,581
Okay, go, troll, find me something good.

165
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:50,203
Meredith said anything to you about me?
'Cause she's been avoiding me for days.

166
00:07:50,323 --> 00:07:52,935
What did I say to you about talking
to me about your personal life?

167
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,056
Help! My baby.

168
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,379
I was carrying her down the stairs
and I fell, and she hit her head.

169
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,910
She was crying in the car,
now she's not crying anymore.

170
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,650
I'm too scared to look.
Someone please tell me my baby's alive.

171
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,416
- Let me...
- She can't be dead, right?

172
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:07,623
You don't die from falling
down the stairs. She's...

173
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:10,610
Let me help. Let me help.
I'll take the baby. That's fine.

174
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:12,004
Oh, my god.

175
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:16,192
Oh, my god.

176
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,433
She's breathing.

177
00:08:20,363 --> 00:08:22,579
Her fontanelle feels tense.
She's lethargic.

178
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,870
Take her to trauma
two and page shepherd.

179
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:27,711
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- You're welcome. OK.

180
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:30,680
Okay, ma'am, you can,
uh, stop hugging me

181
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,162
so I can take care of your baby.
Ma'am.

182
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:36,742
Ma'am? Ma'am?

183
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:41,134
I'm not getting a hetbeat.
No pulse.

184
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:43,963
<i>Get me a crash cart.</i>

185
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:45,447
<i>She's not breathing.</i>

186
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:55,829
- Dr. Yang?
- Teresa Brotherton, lost vitals

187
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:59,087
and coded. I needled a tension pneumo
on the right side. She regained vitals.

188
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:02,179
Got so much air in the soft tissues,
it's obscuring the ultrasound.

189
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:05,232
Probably punctured an airway
as well as her lung. Feel that?

190
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:08,126
Uh, I was talking to Grey.

191
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,211
We've got it from here, Dr. Yang.

192
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,109
Call CT.
Tell them we're on our way.

193
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,129
And you didn't see him swallow it?

194
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:24,024
You were making your collages
while our son quietly choked to death?

195
00:09:24,144 --> 00:09:25,350
It was one marble.

196
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,221
Brian, tell your dad
you're not dead.

197
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:29,236
And ask your mom
what the hell collage art is.

198
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:31,964
If you came to my studio sometime,
you could see for yourself.

199
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:34,472
Look, I'm too busy working
to pay for that studio...

200
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:36,810
Okay, mom, dad, just shut up, okay?

201
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:39,381
Sorry. They're annoying.

202
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:42,167
- Brian, that's rude.
- I wonder where he gets that from.

203
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:45,113
Well, there's not much we can
do except wait for it to pass.

204
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:47,564
- So he's fine?
- It was one marble.

205
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:49,600
He's not choking or drooling.

206
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:51,422
He'll be fine.

207
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:55,541
But I still get something?
You said after we went to the hospital,

208
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,758
- I'd get whatever I wanted.
- Absolutely, sweetie.

209
00:09:57,878 --> 00:10:00,545
- You were really brave.
- Yeah, buddy, anything you want.

210
00:10:01,897 --> 00:10:03,456
I want you guys to get a divorce.

211
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:09,324
- How about a puppy?
- No, don.

212
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:12,735
What? A boy should have a puppy.
I know we talked about it, but look...

213
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,780
We'll infiltrate
with a mixture of bupivacaine

214
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,018
then lido with epi
along these areas here.

215
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:23,412
Is there a surgery that
can make me look like her?

216
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:25,412
You're much prettier than Dr. Stevens.

217
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:28,671
Then how come I can't even remember
the last time I had sex?

218
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,807
I'll bet Dr. Stevens can remember
the last time she had sex.

219
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:34,966
- Harriet, don't harass the residents.
- She's young. She still has her looks.

220
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:37,302
Although, sweetie,
you're already getting worry lines.

221
00:10:37,422 --> 00:10:39,332
What do you possibly
have to be worried about?

222
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,861
Nothing. I don't have worry lines.

223
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,182
Your frown line
is already prominent.

224
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:46,764
Whatever is wrong in your life,
you need to fix it quick.

225
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:49,515
Because once this stuff
starts to turn south,

226
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:51,898
honey, it is a long way back.
Trust me.

227
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:53,813
Know what this is?

228
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,415
Looks like multiple rib fractures
and a massive hemothorax.

229
00:10:57,535 --> 00:11:00,196
Actually, it's you giving up OR two.

230
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:01,819
My patient is emergent.

231
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:03,488
What do I tell my patient?

232
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:07,026
If it were me,
I'd tell her to age gracefully.

233
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:11,922
Your baby has a slight

234
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:13,673
brain contusion.
Her brain's bruised.

235
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:16,232
It's minor. But I'd like
to keep her here for observation.

236
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,544
I gotta tell you, Dr. Shepherd,

237
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:22,694
I'm listening to you, but I'm not
hearing anything you're saying.

238
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:25,238
Dr. Hahn is taking my wife
into surgery right now,

239
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:27,095
and I need to go be with her.

240
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,226
You know what you're doing.
Go ahead and do it.

241
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:32,478
I need to go be with my wife.

242
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:34,315
Wait.

243
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:36,888
Um, what's your daughter's name?

244
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,210
She doesn't have one yet.

245
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,405
We just adopted her a week ago,

246
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:45,574
Just been trying to get to know her.

247
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,597
Clear. Charge.

248
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:55,578
clear.

249
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,038
Push the intracardc epi.

250
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,972
Get ready to cross-clamp the aorta.

251
00:12:03,902 --> 00:12:05,870
The heart's responding.
Sinus rhythm.

252
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,173
All right, that's twice

253
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,931
in two hours
this woman has died.

254
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:10,668
Let's pick up the pace, everyone.

255
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:12,666
The less time
she's on the table, the better.

256
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:14,736
Quite a rush, huh?

257
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:20,645
Hahn took my OR.

258
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,852
She's pushy.

259
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:26,594
Pushy and rude.

260
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:30,162
- Is she doing a stapled tractotomy?
- Yeah.

261
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:33,067
She's trying to save
as much lung tissue as possible.

262
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,028
Doesn't make up for pushy and rude.

263
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:42,042
No, it doesn't.

264
00:12:48,497 --> 00:12:49,662
You paged me?

265
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:52,413
Yeah, um, I was wondering,

266
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,501
do you think I could pick her up?

267
00:12:54,961 --> 00:12:56,097
The baby?

268
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,550
I mean, the father
hasn't really been down here,

269
00:12:58,681 --> 00:13:00,465
and she's been through
so much already.

270
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:02,970
That's not why you paged me.

271
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,393
- It's not?
- No.

272
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:08,501
You paged me because your legs
are still shaking from the other night

273
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,617
you're trying to work up
the nerve to invite me

274
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,740
to a friendly,
neighborhood on call room.

275
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:15,875
Actually,

276
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:18,345
I paged you because I wanted
to know if you could please

277
00:13:18,477 --> 00:13:20,111
tell Meredith that I had no idea

278
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:21,707
that her house was your house.

279
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,150
I mean, she and I w...
We were making progress...

280
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,082
And now she must think
that I'm a stalker.

281
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,959
Sorry.

282
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,383
Uh, your issues can't be my issues.

283
00:13:30,503 --> 00:13:33,179
But I am here for the
sex if you need it.

284
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:35,001
If I need it?

285
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:36,840
You know you need it.

286
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,876
Have you seen Dr. Torres?

287
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:45,632
She promised me a breakdown

288
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:48,475
for next week's E.N.T. conference
by the end of the day.

289
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:50,872
She asked me to pass it along.

290
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:52,952
Must have slipped my mind.
My apologies.

291
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,077
Oh, good. I mean...

292
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:57,034
This is good. This is...

293
00:13:57,865 --> 00:14:00,240
- Nice work.
- Thank you. I mean, yeah.

294
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,905
Sorry. I'm sorry.

295
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:13,410
Oh, no, it's fine.

296
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:18,461
- Sorry.
- You go that way. I go...

297
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,153
You know, we...

298
00:14:20,432 --> 00:14:23,505
we should...
We... Stop for a sec.

299
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,700
We should just...
We're a little nervous and...

300
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:28,949
awkward. We just have to admit that
we're nervous and we're awkward.

301
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,409
Yeah, it's a little awkward.

302
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:32,562
Because why?
Because we're nervous.

303
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,998
So we just need to, you know,
get over ourselves.

304
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:36,496
How?

305
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:44,074
We could pick a fantasy.

306
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:47,388
- What?
- You know, a fantasy.

307
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:50,646
We could pick a fantasy, any...

308
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,972
fantasy. Any...

309
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,268
I will do anything
that you want me to.

310
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,880
Anything?

311
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:07,973
- That's what you wanted?
- No.

312
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,972
I mean...

313
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:12,010
Yes, but...

314
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:14,470
That's not what I meant.

315
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:17,308
What did you mean then?

316
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,805
Okay, let's just not
ever talk about this again.

317
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:21,289
Please?

318
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:24,341
We have chemistry, George.

319
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:27,507
I know we have it because we had
the best sex I have ever had in my life.

320
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:29,720
- Do you remember that sex?
- I do.

321
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:33,028
It's vague and it's in flashes,
but I do.

322
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:34,375
I want that sex back.

323
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,216
- We can do this.
- Well, I want that sex back.

324
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:41,879
I think I chipped my tooth.

325
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,499
Well, I've been trying to do
what you said, but it's not working.

326
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,102
Uh, what... What did I say?

327
00:15:49,222 --> 00:15:50,668
To try another specialty.

328
00:15:50,874 --> 00:15:52,942
Yeah, Cristina,
I have back-to-back surgeries,

329
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:55,353
and I don't know
what you're talking about, so...

330
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,997
Dr. Bailey said it was your idea,

331
00:15:57,117 --> 00:15:59,258
but I thought maybe
I could have some input...

332
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:01,183
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that.

333
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:04,494
The... Yeah, my idea to...
For you to...

334
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,296
try other specialties.

335
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:09,921
So can I...
Can I scrub in with you?

336
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:11,282
You hate ortho.

337
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:12,649
No, I love ortho.

338
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,055
But I can't observe anymore.
I need to scrub in,

339
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,461
even if it's on ortho,

340
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:19,140
Which I love.

341
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:23,872
Okay.

342
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,789
- Morning.
- Morning.

343
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:34,703
I'm a person of substance.

344
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:37,699
Plastics isn't all face-lifts.
I do many...

345
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,509
substantial, life-changing surgeries.

346
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,339
Um, the stain's still there.

347
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:49,592
So next time,
stand there, make sure

348
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:51,794
you watch 'em mark it
with the tape.

349
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:57,178
And everyone thinks
it's so easy being chief's girlfriend.

350
00:16:58,229 --> 00:16:59,731
If you need to talk, I'm here.

351
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:08,914
Oh, hi.

352
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,144
I just came by
to update him on the baby.

353
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:15,522
But I can, uh, come back.

354
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:18,097
Listen, I had, uh...

355
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:20,600
I had no idea it was your house.

356
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:24,231
And, you know...
I'm not the girl who sleeps around.

357
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:27,449
I'm not. It's just, you know...
There's so much going on at home...

358
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,696
How is she doing?

359
00:17:32,123 --> 00:17:34,911
She made it through the night.
That's a very good sign.

360
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,432
Oh, yeah.

361
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:41,096
Yeah, well, she's strong.
She'll make it.

362
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:45,673
She's not gonna let that baby
grow up without a mother. Huh?

363
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:52,595
You're okay.

364
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,346
No, don't...
Don't try to talk, okay?

365
00:18:01,277 --> 00:18:02,554
Your baby's fine.

366
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:05,529
She's feeding well.
She's doing great.

367
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,839
I can get her if you'd like.

368
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:11,979
Dr. Grey, why don't you go get the baby?

369
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:15,674
You're Dr. Grey, too.
Are you two sisters?

370
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:21,580
Uh, just same last name.

371
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,303
I was just thinking about
this crap I took in the army.

372
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:37,931
Still nothing?
I gave you a pretty good laxative.

373
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,769
Not strong enough apparently.

374
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:41,962
Have a seat, Dr. Karev.
If I can't crap,

375
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:44,157
you're going to sit here
while I reminisce.

376
00:18:46,955 --> 00:18:48,076
Morning, Harriet.

377
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:50,422
Let's get you out of bed,
get you mobile.

378
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:52,846
I'm in too much pain.
Leave me alone.

379
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,692
The best thing for pain is to get you
out of bed, get you movin'.

380
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:58,372
- You'll feel much better.
- I will feel better if you leave.

381
00:18:58,492 --> 00:19:00,653
- Harriet...
- Stop scowling.

382
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:04,830
You can scowl later when you actually
have something to scowl about...

383
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,222
When your ass expands
and you get a double chin.

384
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,011
But right now, you are young.
You should be having fun.

385
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:12,339
Go, start enjoying your life.

386
00:19:12,536 --> 00:19:14,649
You're getting uglier by the minute.

387
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:22,021
Her heart stopped again.
They got it started, but...

388
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:25,600
I can't deal with her right now.
Could you just take her back?

389
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:30,445
Now!
Could you take her away now?

390
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:39,586
Dr. Torres,
could I talk to you a minute?

391
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:42,168
Uh, I'm in the middle
of a shattered femur.

392
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:44,928
Thank god for men
who ride motorcycles, right, Yang?

393
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:47,086
Right.

394
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:51,068
There are some scheduling
issues you have to deal with.

395
00:19:51,188 --> 00:19:53,432
Yeah, can you handle it again?
Thanks.

396
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:00,144
I need to talk to Dr. Torres.

397
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:02,895
My patient won't crap and won't
stop talking about it. I'm done.

398
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,934
Is Dr. Torres in there?
My face-lift won't walk,

399
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:06,789
and she is abusive.
I can't work with her.

400
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,331
Dr. Shepherd's ready to discharge
teresa brotherton's baby,

401
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:11,497
but the father's in no
condition take care of her.

402
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,312
Okay, is there a problem?

403
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,772
Uh, just a little administrative

404
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:18,331
traffic jam.
Dr. Torres has it under control.

405
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:24,458
Okay, here's what's gonna happen...

406
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:27,583
Take crap man and put him in the
same room with lazy face-lift.

407
00:20:27,703 --> 00:20:29,048
They can abuse each other.

408
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:31,526
The baby can stay another night.

409
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:33,922
Now get out of here.
And if anyone asks,

410
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,550
none of this was my idea.

411
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:39,045
Excuse us.
Where does it hurt?

412
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:40,985
- Everywhere.
- Didn't the marble come out?

413
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:42,223
Yeah, last night.

414
00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:45,310
Oh, it really hurts.
I ate some more.

415
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:48,024
You what? You said you took
the rest from his room.

416
00:20:48,212 --> 00:20:50,447
- I did.
- Well, obviously you didn't.

417
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:53,111
- Brian, how many did you eat?
- Eight.

418
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,445
Is this what you ate?

419
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,785
Brian, this isn't a marble.
This is a magnet.

420
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:05,745
Page Dr. Bailey.
Tell her it's an emergency.

421
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,810
The magnets take the path of least
ristance to get to each other.

422
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:13,267
If that means going through
the wall of the intestine,

423
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:14,867
then that's what they're gonna do.

424
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:16,937
Yeah. I'm looking
at perfed bowel here.

425
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:18,845
He's gonna need surgery.

426
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:21,070
Dr. Bailey...

427
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:24,044
There's another one, and it's moving.

428
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,479
Like a slow-motion gunshot.

429
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:28,700
All right, we gotta stop it
before it rips

430
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:30,526
through his stomach and kills him.

431
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,695
- Here we go, Jerry.
- What the hell is this?

432
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:42,157
Room shortage.
You're gonna have to double up.

433
00:21:42,277 --> 00:21:44,760
- What?
- Yeah. Harriet, meet Jerry.

434
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:47,223
- This is absurd.
- Not so angry, Jerry.

435
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:49,343
It's not good for the complexion.
Right, Harriet?

436
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,157
Harriet, jerry may be monopolizing
the bathroom for a few hours,

437
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,980
so if you need to go, I'd go now.

438
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,637
- This is unacceptable.
- I n't even think it's legal.

439
00:21:56,757 --> 00:22:00,049
My advice would be to get yourselves
discharged as quickly as possible.

440
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:01,362
See ya.

441
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:09,236
I have seven magnets in my tray.

442
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:10,982
He said he swallowed eight.

443
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:13,862
He has a hole in his diaphragm.

444
00:22:14,398 --> 00:22:16,439
One could have wandered up to his chest.

445
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,673
- Forceps.
- Aren't you gonna repair the diaphragm?

446
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:21,007
First I want to see
if the magnet will find me.

447
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,785
You know he did this so his
parents would get a divorce?

448
00:22:26,991 --> 00:22:28,456
They fight all the time, so...

449
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,971
He made himself sick so they
would take him seriously.

450
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:32,805
I bet they take him seriously now.

451
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:35,247
They said they'd try
not to fight so much.

452
00:22:35,472 --> 00:22:38,120
I am elbow deep
in their 8 year old...

453
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:42,214
Sounds like something
a little extra effort can't fix.

454
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:44,399
You're probably right.

455
00:22:44,536 --> 00:22:48,433
I am so right about so many things,

456
00:22:48,977 --> 00:22:50,686
it'll make your head spin.

457
00:22:53,264 --> 00:22:54,748
Her hands are beautiful.

458
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,493
I mean, surgically,

459
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:00,657
- The finesse.
- I was in ortho all day.

460
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,791
There is no finesse to breaking bones.

461
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:05,119
- Yeah, it's carpentry.
- Carpentry.

462
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:08,716
You want finesse, you should
try plastics. It's all finesse.

463
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,298
No room for error when you're dealing
with someone's face.

464
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:16,549
It's more than just face-lifts.

465
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:18,709
I'm a board certified E.N.T.

466
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:20,344
I take out tumors.

467
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,898
It's also a lot of face-lifts.

468
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:26,881
But even aace-lift...

469
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:28,609
I'm changing a life.

470
00:23:30,128 --> 00:23:32,682
I'm holding someone's future
in my hands.

471
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:40,649
Holding a heart is way better.

472
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:55,815
She's good.

473
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,236
She's sleeping,
but we can go in if you want to...

474
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:08,595
Dr. Hahn said that Teresa's...

475
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:11,489
She's not in good shape.

476
00:24:12,372 --> 00:24:14,071
Her other lung is leaking now.

477
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,612
And they can't operate

478
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:19,664
because her heart is too weak
from all the strain.

479
00:24:21,937 --> 00:24:24,458
So they're gonna see if she's
gonna make it through the night

480
00:24:24,688 --> 00:24:26,078
and reassess in the morning.

481
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:29,242
I am so sorry.

482
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:33,687
I need tknow who to call

483
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,222
just in case my wife doesn't make it.

484
00:24:37,196 --> 00:24:38,699
I can't do this on my own.

485
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,890
I know what I'm capable of,

486
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,472
and I can't raise a kid
without my wife...

487
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:48,223
A kid that's not even my own blood.

488
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:51,689
The kid deserves a family.

489
00:24:52,346 --> 00:24:55,188
And hey, I'm not a bad guy,
and I see her,

490
00:24:55,376 --> 00:24:57,198
and she's...
She's good, you know?

491
00:24:57,318 --> 00:25:00,389
She's...
She's a good baby, but I'm not...

492
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,976
You're her father.

493
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,043
She needs you.

494
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:06,033
She needs you now more...

495
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:10,109
- You're her father.
- I don't feel like her father.

496
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:12,735
I look at her,
and I'd... I just...

497
00:25:16,425 --> 00:25:18,820
I see that she's not mine.
She's just a baby.

498
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:35,742
What did you do tonight?

499
00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:39,102
I stayed late at work
because my house is a brothel.

500
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:41,180
What did you do?

501
00:25:41,729 --> 00:25:42,729
Oh, no.

502
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,016
- What?
- Oh, dinner and a movie.

503
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:46,435
Dinner and a movie?

504
00:25:47,064 --> 00:25:48,177
All right, dinner...

505
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:50,666
Uh, I'm sorry.

506
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,874
I'll just...
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry.

507
00:25:52,994 --> 00:25:54,262
I'm sorry, okay?

508
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:58,046
It's a box of fun. You know?

509
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:00,293
It's just been...

510
00:26:01,252 --> 00:26:03,814
Too much. Too much pressure.

511
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,553
Too much trying.
We just gotta get back to having fun.

512
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,164
- So it's a box of props?
- It's a box of fun.

513
00:26:11,284 --> 00:26:12,363
Okay.

514
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:15,021
Can I...

515
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:21,119
A box of fun and booze,
'cause I figure it can't hurt.

516
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:22,574
Yeah, yeah.

517
00:26:22,968 --> 00:26:24,121
Oh, that...

518
00:26:24,241 --> 00:26:26,613
- That's a...
- You know what? Don't say it.

519
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:27,807
This will work.

520
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:30,289
We will work. We just need
to take the pressure off.

521
00:26:31,374 --> 00:26:33,271
We have the house
to ourselves tonight.

522
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,631
We're gonna have a drink
and we're gonna play.

523
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,591
- We'll play.
- Play...

524
00:26:41,342 --> 00:26:42,703
with our box of fun.

525
00:26:52,352 --> 00:26:54,084
You definitely
don't want to go in there.

526
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,596
- George and Izzie?
- Yeah.

527
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,337
The chief just saw me naked.

528
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:04,745
Nice.

529
00:27:07,568 --> 00:27:09,988
I thought I said no having
sex with her at this house?

530
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:11,376
I didn't invite her over.

531
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,276
Um, Alex, do you want
to get a drink at Joe's?

532
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:22,284
Yeah, sure.

533
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:29,969
There's no rule that says
he can't have a drink with me.

534
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:31,847
Actually, there is. I'm making one.

535
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,673
No drinking with Alex,
no sleeping with Alex.

536
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,567
- What exactly did I ever do to you?
- Get your own friends.

537
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:40,223
Get your own life.
Stop living in mine.

538
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,651
Screw you.

539
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:44,998
I'll wait at the car.

540
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:51,623
I know that was mean,
but she's everywhere.

541
00:27:51,743 --> 00:27:53,121
You say she's not your sister.

542
00:27:53,302 --> 00:27:54,816
You say you don't want to know her.

543
00:27:54,936 --> 00:27:56,992
So why the hell do you care so much?

544
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:02,299
I don't. I don't.

545
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,543
I don't care.

546
00:28:13,773 --> 00:28:15,557
- Morning.
- Hey.

547
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,601
- Gotta get to work.
- Yeah, me too. Gotta go.

548
00:28:25,128 --> 00:28:28,903
All I'm saying is, the next time
you have company, lock the door.

549
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:32,331
All I'm saying is, next time
you come over, you should knock.

550
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:46,595
Where is she?

551
00:28:47,444 --> 00:28:49,491
It looks like
she finally got out of bed.

552
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,352
Oh, my God!

553
00:28:57,084 --> 00:28:59,178
We're adults.
Don't look so shocked.

554
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:00,842
She always looks like that.

555
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:06,059
Well, I guess he finally crapped.

556
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:08,726
What?

557
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:10,536
Even they have chemistry.

558
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:14,205
Dr. O'Malley, he's...

559
00:29:15,282 --> 00:29:17,122
Brian...
He's really gonna be okay, right?

560
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,592
Kids bounce back more
quickly than adults, so...

561
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,430
We used to be really happy.

562
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:25,477
I'm sorry?

563
00:29:25,661 --> 00:29:27,339
My husband and I, we really were...

564
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:28,930
Before.

565
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:33,839
Brian was a colicky baby,
and Don lost his job,

566
00:29:34,027 --> 00:29:36,886
and my mother died,
and all this baggage piled up.

567
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:39,878
I just keep thinking that
we have to get back there.

568
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,295
Maybe Brian's right. Maybe Don and I
do need a break from each other.

569
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,934
We haven't been happy in a long time.

570
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:02,645
She put her on a heart
and lung machine in her room?

571
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:05,424
Yeah. She wasn't gonna survive
another day without the surgery,

572
00:30:05,544 --> 00:30:07,743
and she was too unstable
to transport to the OR.

573
00:30:07,863 --> 00:30:09,853
So Hahn had to bring the OR to her.

574
00:30:10,073 --> 00:30:12,665
- It's pretty genius, right?
- It's genius.

575
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,030
Make sure her lines are clear.

576
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,847
The last thing we need is a kink
to send her into arrest.

577
00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:24,611
Anybody gets so much as a bad feeling,
we stop and we reassess.

578
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,693
She's gonna make it, right?

579
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:29,252
He said he's gonna give her baby up
if she doesn't make it.

580
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:30,445
She has to make it.

581
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:32,609
- Kinda busy right now, Lex.
- Road trip.

582
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,928
Mr. Brotherton, we need to go now.

583
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,402
I will send Dr. Grey out to you
with periodic updates.

584
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:49,467
I promise I'm gonna do everything
in my power to fix your wife.

585
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:15,206
- Got a thing for her.
- You don't have a thing for her.

586
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:17,318
I do. I do. I have a thing for her.

587
00:31:17,438 --> 00:31:18,997
- Gonna end badly.
- You don't know.

588
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:20,653
- Yes, I do.
- What do you know?

589
00:31:20,775 --> 00:31:22,811
- You're dating the Chief.
- It's not funny anymore.

590
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:24,142
It's overused.

591
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,222
- Lover's quarrel?
- Oh, Jeez.

592
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:37,502
We're not quarreling.
It's not a quarrel.

593
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,360
More importantly, we're not...

594
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,749
If I... go through
the trouble to choose a movie,

595
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:45,720
he should have enough
common courtesy to mention it

596
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:47,313
if he makes other plans...

597
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:49,227
A phone call, a note, something.

598
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:51,718
And if he'not gonna pick up my shirts,
just tell me.

599
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:53,024
I'll pick them up.

600
00:31:53,152 --> 00:31:55,788
I'm perfectly capable of
picking up my own shirts.

601
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:56,934
No, you're not.

602
00:31:57,054 --> 00:31:59,197
You're not capable of
picking up your shirts.

603
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,524
You're not capable of doing
anything on your own.

604
00:32:01,777 --> 00:32:05,167
If I wasn't around, you'd starve
in a dirty shirt and die a lonely death.

605
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:06,384
Oh, for God sakes.

606
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:08,582
I offered you
a place to put your trailer,

607
00:32:08,702 --> 00:32:10,542
and you've been taking
advantage ever since.

608
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,886
You can't pick up the dry cleaning
or do the cooking,

609
00:32:13,006 --> 00:32:14,626
so I have to pick up all the slack.

610
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,384
Hold that thought.

611
00:32:20,787 --> 00:32:22,853
You see? He can't handle the truth.

612
00:32:24,177 --> 00:32:26,046
I definitely have a thing for her.

613
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,266
Do you have any idea
why the Brothertons' baby's still here?

614
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:37,276
I believe Dr. Torres decided
to keep the baby here for another day.

615
00:32:37,396 --> 00:32:40,861
Why would she do that if Dr. Shepherd
was ready to discharge her?

616
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,298
I don't know.
You'd have to ask Dr. Torres.

617
00:32:44,584 --> 00:32:46,906
I mean, if it was me
and the mother kept coding,

618
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:48,592
I might keep the baby around

619
00:32:48,712 --> 00:32:50,599
so they could get
a little more time together.

620
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,673
And why did Torres
have Stevens and Karev

621
00:32:56,793 --> 00:32:58,799
put their patients in the same room?

622
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,750
That's a clear violation of protocol.

623
00:33:01,707 --> 00:33:03,088
You'd have to ask her.

624
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,630
But those two patients were impossible,

625
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,848
and neither one was willing
to follow post-op instruction, so...

626
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,670
I mean, if it was me, I would
put them both in the same room

627
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,127
so they could encourage each other
to get out of here.

628
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,449
And she told Dr. Yang
to find a new specialty?

629
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:23,704
That's a pretty odd thing
to say to someone

630
00:33:23,824 --> 00:33:26,275
who has such an affinity for cardio.

631
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:29,036
Again, you'll have to ask Torres.

632
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,619
But maybe it has to do with the fact

633
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:34,271
that Erica Hahn's putting her
through her paces,

634
00:33:34,391 --> 00:33:36,690
so Yang needs to see
what else is out there,

635
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,536
otherwise she won't fight hard
enough to stay with cardio.

636
00:33:39,845 --> 00:33:40,878
I'm just guessing.

637
00:33:41,282 --> 00:33:43,179
You need to ask Torres.

638
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:45,805
That's just what I'm gonna do.

639
00:33:58,574 --> 00:34:01,090
It's been an hour.
We should've heard something.

640
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:04,336
Well, the fact that we haven't
heard anything is good.

641
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:06,700
That means that
they've got her in the O.R.

642
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,623
And they've opened her up.

643
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,270
You know, every step of this
that she survives is good.

644
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:16,576
Oh, God.

645
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,675
So we were able to find one puncture
in her remaining lung.

646
00:34:22,472 --> 00:34:25,627
We're preparing
to place a patch over it.

647
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,345
And hopefully at's the only leak,

648
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:29,354
and hopefully the patch will hold.

649
00:34:34,894 --> 00:34:36,209
I should be getting back.

650
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,609
You know, you said your wife bonded
instantly with the baby.

651
00:34:49,147 --> 00:34:50,668
For some people, it's like that.

652
00:34:51,196 --> 00:34:52,242
For other people,

653
00:34:52,521 --> 00:34:54,219
they need a little more time
with a baby

654
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,920
before they can feel like a family.

655
00:34:56,766 --> 00:34:59,113
I bet you know her better
than you think you do.

656
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:02,378
All I know is that she cries.

657
00:35:03,071 --> 00:35:05,879
Okay? And she eats a lot.

658
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:08,426
We were going
through formula like crazy.

659
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,951
And she sleeps with her hand
up under her chin.

660
00:35:13,687 --> 00:35:16,288
And she likes my wife.

661
00:35:17,023 --> 00:35:18,828
Teresa soothes her, you know?

662
00:35:18,948 --> 00:35:20,742
She puts her hand on her back...

663
00:35:22,951 --> 00:35:24,688
She let's her suck on her finger.

664
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,049
But that's all I know.

665
00:35:27,452 --> 00:35:29,462
That's five things no one else knows.

666
00:35:30,152 --> 00:35:31,495
That's five things.

667
00:35:42,756 --> 00:35:44,127
The patch is secure.

668
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:46,100
Water, please.

669
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:52,934
All right. Let's see
if I earned my paycheck today.

670
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:55,246
Go to manual. Give me a breath.

671
00:36:06,506 --> 00:36:08,612
- No bubbles.
- So far, so good.

672
00:36:08,732 --> 00:36:09,858
Another breath.

673
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:15,007
I see bubbles.

674
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:18,262
Patch is secure. Clamp.

675
00:36:20,697 --> 00:36:21,834
We got another leak.

676
00:36:22,209 --> 00:36:23,768
Grey, hold on to this clamp.

677
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,057
Dr. Torres, you got a moment?

678
00:36:33,177 --> 00:36:35,057
I don't, I have two more surgeries.

679
00:36:35,177 --> 00:36:36,563
The schedule's a little crazy.

680
00:36:36,704 --> 00:36:38,732
- I'll get on it tonight.
- You're not, actually.

681
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:40,878
Okay, you're right.

682
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:44,237
- It may not happen till tomorrow...
- You're not gonna get on it at all.

683
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,944
Mr. Brotherton, we did
everything we could...

684
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,065
Cool lounge.

685
00:37:36,243 --> 00:37:37,746
Yeah, no interns allowed.

686
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:39,217
I know that.

687
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,939
I was looking for you
because I was wondering if...

688
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,033
if you would meet me later...

689
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:48,885
in the on call room.

690
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:51,808
I can't.

691
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:56,503
- I thought you said that...
- I know what I said, but I can't.

692
00:37:58,483 --> 00:37:59,573
Because of Meredith.

693
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:01,808
Look...

694
00:38:01,928 --> 00:38:04,528
I'm not getting involved in
whatever you two got going on.

695
00:38:05,064 --> 00:38:06,426
I'm not choosing sides.

696
00:38:07,963 --> 00:38:10,066
Except... clearly you are.

697
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:25,904
You've been covering for Dr. Torres.

698
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:30,044
I've just been shuffling
a little paperwork for her.

699
00:38:30,164 --> 00:38:33,911
You've been doing the lion's share
of the Chief resident's work...

700
00:38:34,922 --> 00:38:38,011
All the responsibility
and none of the credit.

701
00:38:39,072 --> 00:38:40,387
You deserve the credit.

702
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,453
You deserve the job.

703
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,761
I should've given it to you
in the first place.

704
00:38:46,596 --> 00:38:47,930
I hope you'll take it now.

705
00:38:48,795 --> 00:38:49,829
Because...

706
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:52,260
what you do and how you do it...

707
00:38:53,562 --> 00:38:55,271
makes this hospital work.

708
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:01,097
Well, it's about time you noticed.

709
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:58,034
Can I pick her up?

710
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,431
Yeah, of course.

711
00:40:00,741 --> 00:40:01,793
Nurse.

712
00:40:18,662 --> 00:40:19,789
It's okay.

713
00:40:23,576 --> 00:40:25,555
I remembered a sixth thing.

714
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:29,517
She hates the car seat...

715
00:40:31,808 --> 00:40:33,329
Unless you put this

716
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:35,629
little duck up under her head.
You know?

717
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:41,841
I'm gonna name you Keisha, okay?

718
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,594
'Cause that's what your mommy
wanted to name you.

719
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:06,810
I am not stalking. I just...

720
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,611
I hate apples.

721
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:11,371
Hate them.

722
00:41:12,031 --> 00:41:13,965
Think they shouldn't be allowed
to be a fruit.

723
00:41:14,486 --> 00:41:16,101
That's one.
And...

724
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:17,494
Two,

725
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,377
I can draw really,
really well on an etch a sketch.

726
00:41:20,497 --> 00:41:23,084
Like, really well,
I could be a professional if...

727
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:25,364
you know, that profession existed.

728
00:41:27,323 --> 00:41:29,286
I play the trombone... badly.

729
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,187
I like math.

730
00:41:32,274 --> 00:41:33,891
And I notice that you do this thing

731
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:36,724
with your hands when you're trying
to make a point, like this,

732
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:38,037
with your hands.

733
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:40,267
And I know that that's about you, but...

734
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,028
I do it, too,

735
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,011
so it's also about me.

736
00:41:44,131 --> 00:41:46,441
And so that's five...

737
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:50,620
five things that I'm hoping
will make it

738
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:52,479
a little bit harder for you to hate me.

739
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:13,625
I told her I could draw
with an etch a sketch.

740
00:42:13,913 --> 00:42:16,289
Of all the things I could've chosen,
I...

741
00:42:16,552 --> 00:42:18,392
No wonder she thinks I'm pathetic.

742
00:42:23,998 --> 00:42:25,472
I saw your transplant today.

743
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,965
I know.

744
00:42:27,122 --> 00:42:29,657
- You have extraordinary technique.
- I know.

745
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:31,836
Can I buy you a drink?

746
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:35,663
I have... rather extraordinary
techniques myself.

747
00:42:38,605 --> 00:42:39,903
You're not attracted to me.

748
00:42:40,023 --> 00:42:42,069
You think you are, but you're not.

749
00:42:42,403 --> 00:42:44,159
You're attracted to my skill

750
00:42:44,445 --> 00:42:46,539
and my confidence and maybe how

751
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:48,531
hot I look with my hands on a heart.

752
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:50,360
But mostly, you're attracted to me

753
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:52,435
because I'm not attracted to you.

754
00:42:56,759 --> 00:42:58,609
I told her I couldn't see her anymore.

755
00:43:00,058 --> 00:43:01,195
You did?

756
00:43:01,814 --> 00:43:04,575
Whatever. I don't need
another chick with issues.

757
00:43:05,413 --> 00:43:06,456
Thank you.

758
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:18,908
Will you take my sister home?

759
00:43:19,949 --> 00:43:22,944
Come on, she plays the trombone
and whatever.

760
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,109
Just take her home, please.

761
00:43:44,988 --> 00:43:46,096
I finished painting.

762
00:43:47,246 --> 00:43:48,326
I got fired.

763
00:44:01,952 --> 00:44:04,318
I married Adele two years
out of college.

764
00:44:05,328 --> 00:44:07,807
There's a lot I need to learn
to do for myself.

765
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,830
Just pick up your own shirts
from now on.

766
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:24,756
<i>Taxi Driver<i>?

767
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,141
Meredith is coming over.

768
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,639
Better get back to my trailer.

769
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:38,602
"You talkin' to me"?

770
00:44:39,381 --> 00:44:40,386
De Niro?

771
00:44:50,415 --> 00:44:52,595
Alex, I'm fine. Thank you.

772
00:44:52,715 --> 00:44:54,443
Really, you can go.

773
00:45:04,098 --> 00:45:06,577
What a pleasant surprise.

774
00:45:06,765 --> 00:45:09,986
- It's Dr. Karev, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

775
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,022
All right,
don't want to interrupt you two.

776
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:14,764
Wait, dad!

777
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:17,225
- You're going out?
- Just down to the store.

778
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:21,141
- Dad.
- It's just down to the store.

779
00:45:22,925 --> 00:45:24,854
- Why don't I go?
- My car, it's right here.

780
00:45:24,974 --> 00:45:25,979
I'm fine.

781
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:28,027
What do you need?

782
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,072
Scotch?
Vodka?

783
00:45:30,617 --> 00:45:31,631
Gin?

784
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:36,555
Scotch.

785
00:45:50,692 --> 00:45:51,743
Just...

786
00:45:52,091 --> 00:45:53,687
Don't tell Meredith.

787
00:46:01,377 --> 00:46:02,729
What did you do tonight?

788
00:46:03,255 --> 00:46:04,315
Nothing.

789
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:05,965
You?

790
00:46:06,945 --> 00:46:07,972
Nothing.

791
00:46:09,675 --> 00:46:11,778
It's late.
Shouldn't you be going soon?

792
00:46:13,603 --> 00:46:15,631
I just want to lie here
for a few more minutes.

793
00:46:25,053 --> 00:46:27,297
That... was amazing.

794
00:46:28,246 --> 00:46:30,199
- Finally.
- See?

795
00:46:31,031 --> 00:46:32,402
I knew we had it in us.

796
00:46:33,283 --> 00:46:35,114
That was as good as the first time.

797
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,254
It was better.

798
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,570
- Way better.
- Way, right.

799
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:44,600
Because, we weren't drunk, and well,
I'm not married. And...

800
00:46:44,806 --> 00:46:46,027
That was just...

801
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:47,632
Incredible.

802
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,254
You're lying.

803
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,582
Well, so are you.

804
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:02,604
<i>Chemistry...</i>

805
00:47:03,663 --> 00:47:04,968
