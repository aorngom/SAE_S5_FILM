00:00:00,216 --> 00:00:01,720
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy<i>...</i>

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,788
Can I have the key back? I heard
we broke up. Can I have it, please?

3
00:00:04,967 --> 00:00:08,535
Did you find an apartment yet?
'Cause I was thinking about getting one.

4
00:00:08,723 --> 00:00:10,713
Can you make sure
I stay on Hahn's cardio service?

5
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:13,015
Where you going? You going to Joe's?
I'll meet you.

6
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:14,916
I can't sleep.
What's wrong with me?

7
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:16,923
Severe abandonment issues.

8
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:19,099
Psych is crap.
Derek kissed Rose?

9
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:21,597
- We were dating other people.
- That's not the point.

10
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:23,290
- You weren't ready.
- And Rose is?

11
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,480
You want to go to dinner
with me tonight?

12
00:00:30,452 --> 00:00:33,384
<i>We like to think
that we are rational beings...</i>

13
00:00:35,556 --> 00:00:36,664
<i>Humane...</i>

14
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:39,302
<i>Conscientious...</i>

15
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:44,568
<i>Civilized...</i>

16
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:49,457
<i>Thoughtful.</i>

17
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:53,904
This is your third session,

18
00:00:54,974 --> 00:00:57,078
and you still haven't said anything yet.

19
00:00:57,306 --> 00:00:59,832
Now while I love the quiet time, I'm...

20
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:03,875
I read a study that says

21
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:07,603
that just the act of going
to therapy is beneficial,

22
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:10,437
even if you don't say anything,
even if you just sit.

23
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:14,922
So you thought
you'd come here and just sit?

24
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,510
- That's how you'll solve your problems?
- I don't have problems.

25
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:19,088
What brings you here?

26
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:21,773
<i>But when things fall apart,</i>

27
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,604
<i>even just a little,</i>

28
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,592
<i>it becomes clear...</i>

29
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:27,406
<i>We're no better than animals.</i>

30
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:39,165
it's not that bad.

31
00:01:39,462 --> 00:01:41,753
Once we get rid of the roaches,
the apartment...

32
00:01:42,337 --> 00:01:43,417
The crapartment.

33
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:45,722
George, this is our home.

34
00:01:46,113 --> 00:01:47,947
- We'll fix it up.
- With what money?

35
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,438
We'll figure it out.

36
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:53,398
I like it here, and i'd like it here
so much more if you'd like it here too.

37
00:01:56,207 --> 00:01:57,831
<i>We have opposable thumbs...</i>

38
00:01:58,301 --> 00:01:59,488
Look, I'm fine.

39
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:02,779
It's just...
I just haven't been sleeping.

40
00:02:02,985 --> 00:02:07,069
You know, it's a...
Just been five weeks, and I can't sleep.

41
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:08,937
Five weeks since what?

42
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:17,088
Look... I work in this hospital.

43
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:21,295
I try not to listen to gossip,
but this is a very gossipy place.

44
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:25,178
- There are some things that I've heard.
- Derek's not the reason I'm... here.

45
00:02:25,298 --> 00:02:28,043
- He's not the reason.
- Then what brings you here?

46
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,241
I gotta go.
I'm in this contest.

47
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:37,603
Dr. Grey, if you j...

48
00:02:38,394 --> 00:02:39,436
<i>We think...</i>

49
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:43,924
<i>We walk erect...</i>

50
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:45,621
I'm up!

51
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:46,940
<i>We speak...</i>

52
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,610
<i>We dream...</i>

53
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:57,193
<i>But deep down,
we're all still rooting around</i>

54
00:02:57,313 --> 00:02:59,172
<i>in the primordial ooze,</i>

55
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:02,783
<i>biting, clawing,
scratching out an existence</i>

56
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:05,130
<i>in the cold, dark world
like the rest </i>

57
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:06,996
<i>of the tree toads and sloths.</i>

58
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,012
- There's a contest going on.
- Sir?

59
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,309
Your residents...
They've been living in the hospital

60
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:18,091
around-the-clock
for the last 14 days,

61
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:21,839
engaged in a surgical contest
with a point system.

62
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:24,365
I don't know what you're talking about.

63
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:33,041
- They're committed. It's commitment.
- It's a lion fight.

64
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:35,362
I have one baby to get to day care.

65
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:38,667
I have 50 residents on my watch,
four surgeries on my schedule.

66
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:41,435
The lions can fight all they want.
I'm not zookeeper.

67
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:45,901
Keep your animals under control.

68
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:48,609
Yes, sir.

69
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,271
Move it!

70
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,568
- She's wretched... and mean.
- She's not.

71
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,385
I heard one of the nurses saying
that they've only been on five dates.

72
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:07,660
Yeah, 'cause Derek
knows she's wretched and mean.

73
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,277
What did you do to your hair?

74
00:04:09,397 --> 00:04:10,498
You guys,

75
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:13,376
I know you're trying to make me
feel better, but I have to tell you,

76
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:17,327
this pausing to talk about
Rose and Derek, it just means...

77
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:18,489
Yeah?

78
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,544
- I'm gonna win.
- you bitch!

79
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,754
What? Keeping it clean was getting
in the way of the contest,

80
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:27,040
so I chopped it off last night. It makes
me faster and sleeker, like a cheetah.

81
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,313
You chopped off all your hot hair
for a stupid contest?

82
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:31,254
Not stupid.
Rock star contest.

83
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:33,393
Best contest ever.

84
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,275
You should try living in the hospital
for 2 straight weeks. It's amazing.

85
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:38,634
- This contest is for residents only.
- Yes!I know that.

86
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:41,443
Doesn't mean he can't still live here.
I feel juiced and alive,

87
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:44,519
my brain is clicking and running.
I have never been more on my game.

88
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:46,869
I'm kinda sad the contest ends tonight.

89
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:49,034
- I'm not. I want at prize.
- What prize?

90
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,023
Bailey won't tell us.
But I want it bad.

91
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,114
- Too bad you're never gonna get it.
- So on my game!

92
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:04,079
Good morning.
Thank you.

93
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:05,777
What do you see in her?

94
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:07,543
Is it the hot sex?
Is she an animal?

95
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:09,259
Is she a bobcat?

96
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:10,662
- Mark.
- Come on.

97
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:12,972
Lady on the streets,
tramp in the sheets, am I right?

98
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,234
Oh, yeah. She's amazing.
Hot, sweaty.

99
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:17,403
Very dirty, hot, sweaty sex.

100
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,267
You haven't slept with her yet?

101
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,181
She's waiting until we're serious.

102
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:23,902
She has morals. She's a lady.
Besides you know what's better than sex?

103
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,431
- What?
- Anticipation.

104
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,979
Anticipation, my friend.

105
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:30,993
Why didn't anybody wake me?

106
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:32,579
Why would we help you?

107
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:35,389
- There's such a thing as honor.
- Yeah, it's dog-eat-dog, karev.

108
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:36,786
Suck it up.

109
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:40,080
- You so are gonna do it.
- I'm so not.

110
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,615
You came in with Dr. Hahn?

111
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:45,809
Erica? Yeah.

112
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:49,214
We went out last night, and then it got
kinda late with the dancing and the...

113
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:52,136
Anyway... we never made it home,
so I hitched a ride here.

114
00:05:52,324 --> 00:05:54,435
- You're hanging out with Hahn?
- Erica. Yes.

115
00:05:54,602 --> 00:05:56,186
So you and Hahn are friends?

116
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,314
Erica.

117
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,030
See, this is the downside
of the contest.

118
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,639
I'm stuck here all the time,
Callie's living in my apartment

119
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:09,131
- and hanging out with hahn.
- They're trying to pick up guys.

120
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:11,447
I'm so glad I'm past that.
I don't need guys.

121
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:13,794
I don't need sex 'cause
this competition is my orgasm.

122
00:06:13,914 --> 00:06:15,503
I should be hanging out with Hahn.

123
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:17,046
Cristina, would you focus?

124
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:19,863
It is so much more fun kicking
your ass when you focus.

125
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:23,280
- Who's winning?
- Yang.

126
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,595
- Surprised?
- What?

127
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:25,777
Let me see.

128
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:27,335
I'm 26 points behind?

129
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,335
That's not possible.
Count again.

130
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:31,819
- What about all the surgeries?
- Only 3 points for watching.

131
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,453
- You gotta do.
- I do do.

132
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:35,699
I can't make them let me do procedures.

133
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,657
- You gotta ask.
- You gotta take charge

134
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:40,271
of your own destiny,
make it happen, like this.

135
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,537
- What do you got?
- Otis sharon, 61-year-old male,

136
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:46,908
found unconscious on the street
corner with a swollen ankle.

137
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:48,061
Not it.

138
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,366
- I don't even know what happened.
- Initial B.P. was 90 over palp.

139
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,268
- Vitals stable after a bolus of NS.
- Okay, he's mine.

140
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:55,610
All of you back off.

141
00:06:55,787 --> 00:06:57,786
- It's a swollen ankle.
- He passed out, he's pale,

142
00:06:57,908 --> 00:07:00,554
altered, hypotensive and he has a rash.
You see a sprained ankle.

143
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:02,869
I see a medical mystery.
80 points.

144
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:07,889
- Stevens is the only one working today?
- No. We're all working. We got paged.

145
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:10,284
For the ankle. It's gone.
Now you're trolling for traumas?

146
00:07:10,404 --> 00:07:12,480
Somebody could come any minute
with a critical injury.

147
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:14,337
- We're being proactive.
- Helping people.

148
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:17,426
You're trolling. And I've got
no one on post-op and pre-op.

149
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:18,588
Now move.

150
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,414
Help us!
Please help!

151
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:21,972
Help my brother!

152
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,692
- I'm gonna get a gurney.
- Help my brother.

153
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:30,465
- What happened to your hand?
- A bear.

154
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:31,967
- A what?
- He's really hurt.

155
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:34,540
- We tried to stop the bleeding.
- We were camping in the mountain.

156
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,083
- You drove all the way here?
- We couldn't wait for an ambulance.

157
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:39,536
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not. Let me see your hand.

158
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:42,597
Sir, let's try and get you
on this gurney.

159
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,644
- Careful.
- Step down right here.

160
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:56,200
I... intestines in the hands.
Intestines in the hands.

161
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,893
- Did you just say...
- Intestine in the hands!

162

Sync: ¤AkaZab¤, Benj!

163
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:06,636
He just touched it.
He just... just put his hand out.

164
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:09,732
- He touched a bear?
- A cub, and then the mother came.

165
00:08:09,882 --> 00:08:10,887
I bet she did.

166
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:12,988
Why would he do that?
We go camping all the time.

167
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:15,973
- I don't why...
- Okay, try to relax, Mr. Robinson.

168
00:08:16,172 --> 00:08:18,632
All right, get me
a chest tube tray, please.

169
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:21,670
- Did I hear bear attack?
- Complete evisceration, chief.

170
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:24,499
Give me 100 of sux,
20 of etomidate.

171
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:26,970
Get me an intubation tray
and an OR room ready now.

172
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,463
Are you gonna put me under?

173
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,494
Sir, it'll be the best thing
that's happened to you all day.

174
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:33,432
Is my brother gonna be okay?

175
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:35,464
Please.
This whole thing's my fault.

176
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:37,672
I gotta know if he's okay.

177
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:40,040
They're taking him to surgery.
They don't know much yet.

178
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,596
We'll keep you informed.

179
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:45,347
Impressive hand, Phillip.
I can see right through it.

180
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:48,040
The bear cub, she just latched on
and wouldn't let go.

181
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:50,347
And then when Scott came over
to try to help,

182
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:52,176
the mother, she... Oh, god.

183
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,061
I can't believe
we got out of there alive.

184
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,535
He has to be all right.

185
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:58,392
He's gonna be all right.
He has to be, right?

186
00:08:58,577 --> 00:08:59,491
Right?

187
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:00,961
He has to be all right.

188
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,233
You really don't remember how you fell?

189
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:05,226
One minute
I was walking down the street,

190
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,789
the next minute,
there was paramedics standing over me.

191
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:10,232
Have you been feeling dizzy lately,
like the room is spinning?

192
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:11,666
Maybe a little.

193
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:15,045
Any muscle aches?
Fatigue? Fever? Headaches?

194
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:17,477
Well, now that you mention it, yes.

195
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:18,848
Any recent travels?

196
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:22,669
I go back and forth to the east coast
for my job. Does that count?

197
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:25,062
- Notice any tick or mosquito bites?
- I live near a lake.

198
00:09:25,194 --> 00:09:27,128
I get mosquito bites all the time.

199
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:31,345
Oh, god. Do I have something bad,
like malaria

200
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:33,443
- or west nile virus or something?
- Oh, no.

201
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:36,905
There's no need to panic. We're
gonna take this one step at a time.

202
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,245
Mama bear wasn't messing around.

203
00:09:42,508 --> 00:09:44,151
Mama bears never mess around.

204
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:45,904
I have a ross procedure,

205
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:49,864
but I want to keep a close eye on his
chest tube outputs and blood pressure.

206
00:09:49,984 --> 00:09:52,543
- What's the game plan?
- He's a setup for overwhelming sepsis,

207
00:09:52,663 --> 00:09:55,022
so we're gonna deal
with the life threatening blood loss

208
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:57,770
and get out of there.
You can't touch him until he's stable.

209
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,330
I'm in OR 4. Can you make sure
I'm getting hourly updates?

210
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:02,670
I'd be more than happy
to apprise you of his condition.

211
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,795
Fine.

212
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:08,792
You don't get points for
sucking up to an attending.

213
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:10,143
Oh, shut up.

214
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:15,818
I hate this contest.

215
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:18,200
There's a lot of stuff in here.
A lot of stuff.

216
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,095
Stupid, stupid contest...
stupid, and irresponsible.

217
00:10:22,895 --> 00:10:24,238
I want to play.

218
00:10:24,397 --> 00:10:26,266
There's good stuff, free stuff.

219
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:29,507
I need a butterfly needle, a vacutainer,
and maybe an LP kit.

220
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:32,606
- I'm 26 points behind, I need it fast.
- What do you got? Something good?

221
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:34,059
Uh, sprained ankle.

222
00:10:34,436 --> 00:10:36,471
You get 26 points for a sprained ankle?

223
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:38,959
Last time Callie treated
what we thought was a sprained ankle,

224
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:42,399
turned out the patient was malnourished,
perforated ulcer and died on the table.

225
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:44,512
That's the best case scenario.

226
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:46,236
Well, not the death part, george.

227
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:49,229
The medical mystery part. It's 80 points
for solving a medical mystery.

228
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:51,167
It's the holy grail of the competition.

229
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,012
Oh, yeah. Sometimes
an ankle's just an ankle, though.

230
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:58,736
Syncope, a very strange rash,

231
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,770
pale, insidious onset
in a guy who travels a lot.

232
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,069
This is not just an ankle.

233
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,145
Oh, thanks.

234
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,955
Oh, I could do a lot with these.

235
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:14,589
That's an underpad.

236
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:17,278
Underpads soak up urine.

237
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:20,715
Or... it could be a place mat.

238
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:27,982
Fruit bowl.

239
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,196
There. Done.

240
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,605
Beat you, busted hand and all.

241
00:11:37,788 --> 00:11:39,801
- It's completely illegible.
- He's a slob.

242
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:40,935
Still beat her.

243
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,610
Okay, mr. Robinson, Dr. O'malley
is going to come and take you to x-ray,

244
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:46,374
and I am gonna take your wife

245
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,913
to the waiting room
until you get back.

246
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:51,088
She said wife.
I'm still not used to that.

247
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:53,084
- We're newlyweds.
- Congratulations.

248
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:54,718
She's my rebound girl.

249
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:58,332
He's a little hopped up
on painkillers right now.

250
00:11:58,512 --> 00:12:01,375
- You're oversharing, honey.
- She thought she was my rebound girl,

251
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:04,069
but I rebounded her,
all the way to the church.

252
00:12:04,342 --> 00:12:05,966
Only knew her ten days,

253
00:12:06,154 --> 00:12:08,379
but when you know,
you know. You know?

254
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:11,792
I'm leaving you.

255
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,339
I'll miss you while you're gone.

256
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:23,193
Are you okay?

257
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:27,606
It's just, you know,
you marry a man like that...

258
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:30,584
Or a man like that marries you,

259
00:12:30,747 --> 00:12:33,216
and he's cute and he's rich...

260
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:36,422
He's a catch by anyone's standard.

261
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:41,374
So you sort of sit around waiting
for the other shoe to drop,

262
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:43,888
because there's no way a man
like that marries you.

263
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:45,879
Or me.

264
00:12:46,736 --> 00:12:48,295
I mean, he married me.

265
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,109
I'm sorry.
I must look like a crazy woman.

266
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:02,436
It's OK, but looks like you're bleeding
a little. Do you mind if I take look?

267
00:13:02,624 --> 00:13:04,015
No, no. I'm... I'm fine.

268
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:06,905
I just scratched myself
on a branch when we were running.

269
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:12,188
Why are you looking at me like that?

270
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:14,710
CT is clear.

271
00:13:15,255 --> 00:13:17,405
But it's deep.
That bear clawed you good.

272
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:18,995
God I didn't even feel it.

273
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,201
Adrenaline's a pretty powerful drug.

274
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:24,696
You're gonna have to repair the galea,
but it should reatach without a problem.

275
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:27,079
Squeeze my fingers
as hard as you can, please.

276
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,769
I just got happy.

277
00:13:29,137 --> 00:13:31,960
I just got married,
and I'm really, really happy.

278
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,967
I don't have permanent
brain damage, do I?

279
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,621
It appears that you do not.

280
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:37,067
Okay, good.

281
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:39,121
Page me if any neuro deficits appear.

282
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,624
You got lucky.

283
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:47,755
Your scalp wasn't completely taken off,
so we can just sew it back on.

284
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,448
Your hair should cover the scar.
You won't even need surgery.

285
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:53,638
That's great.
Thank you.

286
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:57,386
Dr. Grey here will take care of you.
You go back to being a happy newlywed.

287
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:01,700
Don't worry.
He and Rose won't last.

288
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:08,342
He's hypothermic,
and his bowels are swollen.

289
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:11,416
We need to stabilize him in the ICU.
And try and get him back to the OR.

290
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:12,854
When he's less acidotic.

291
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:15,954
That'll give us time to deal with the
puncture wounds and the lacerations.

292
00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:19,040
Sorry to say that one of you has
several hundred sutures ahead of you.

293
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,898
I'll do it.
I need the practice.

294
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:22,869
Her stitches are flawless.
I need the work.

295
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:24,673
They're flawless
because I practice.

296
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:26,182
- Karev, it's yours.
- Yes.

297
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:29,291
You need to update Hahn
on the condition of the patient hourly.

298
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,637
- That ought to keep you busy.
- That is a minute an hour.

299
00:14:31,757 --> 00:14:33,340
I can suture for the other 59.

300
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:35,976
- Fine, you both do it.
- That's not fair.

301
00:14:36,096 --> 00:14:39,401
This man was a chew toy for a grizzly
bear. There'll be enough to go around.

302
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:42,291
A lot of enthusiasm
for an afternoon of stitching.

303
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:45,119
Some people find it boring.
I value the fundamentals.

304
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,329
It's a point a suture.

305
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:49,132
Kiss ass.

306
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:06,647
It is a hairline fracture.

307
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,574
His ESR and CRP's were elevated.

308
00:15:08,694 --> 00:15:10,986
I also appreciated
some swelling in the knee.

309
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:12,338
What does that mean?

310
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:15,089
There could be some sort
of inflammatory process going on.

311
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:18,229
- Inflammatory? That sounds bad.
- I don't want you to worry yet.

312
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:20,253
- Yet?
- Is there someone I can call for you?

313
00:15:20,394 --> 00:15:22,431
Maybe you shouldn't be alone here today.

314
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:25,581
- How were his labs?
- WBC's normal, slightly anemic,

315
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:28,783
- potassium's mildly decreased.
- Okay, give him, a k-rider,

316
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:31,920
See if you can tap the fluid in his knee
to check for white cells or crystals.

317
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:34,605
Let me know if the tap's positive.
Good luck, mr. Sharon.

318
00:15:35,132 --> 00:15:36,944
You think I need luck?
Oh, god.

319
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:40,001
I want to go home.
I want to go home.

320
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:44,051
I want... Look, I want to go back.
I want to go back to when I was 30,

321
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,976
I want to stop smoking
when I was 30.

322
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:48,736
Or back to when I was 20 and
not start smoking in the first place.

323
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,104
I want to give up coffee
and junk food and beer,

324
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:54,353
and I want to be healthy
like my ex-wife always nagged me to be.

325
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:56,351
She was a saint.

326
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:58,905
she was a saint,
and I drove her away.

327
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,123
I want to go back
and not drive her away

328
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:05,963
so I don't end up at 60 sick and fat
and alone and scared in some hospital

329
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,063
with some beautiful young doctor
holding my hand.

330
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:12,329
She wouldn't be holding my hand
except she's trying to figure out

331
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,365
what horrible disease I'm gonna die of.

332
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:17,055
I... I want to go home.

333
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:21,227
- Where's the fire?
- Can't talk now.

334
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,915
Gotta kick Karev's ass suturing.

335
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:26,622
Since when are you friends
with my mentor?

336
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,040
A, she's not your mentor
because she treats you like crap,

337
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:31,959
and b, if you weren't living
in the hospital like a mangy dog,

338
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,232
you would've noticed
we've been friends for a while.

339
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:36,596
- You put in a good word for me?
- We don't talk about you.

340
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,899
- I let you live with me.
- He's getting on the elevator.

341
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:40,392
- Who?
- Alex.

342
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:44,026
Hold it! Hold it!

343
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:47,911
It needs surgery, but callie wants
to do 24 hours of antibiotic coverage.

344
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:50,025
I think we should just
irrigate and splint.

345
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:51,582
Okay. I'll take care of it.

346
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:54,799
Or I could take care of it, and you
could take care of the wife's scalp.

347
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,844
She needs lots of complex sutures.

348
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:59,153
You could get lots of complex practice.

349
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:02,849
Isn't that like a point a suture?
You don't want that?

350
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:04,948
I think this is bigger
than a broken hand.

351
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:07,901
He provoked a bear
and then drove himself to the hospital.

352
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:10,594
- Well, he was in shock.
- And he married his rebound girl.

353
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:13,240
- What?
- He married his rebound girl,

354
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:16,448
after knowing her for only ten days.
Nobody does that.

355
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,622
Who does that?

356
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:19,471
I'm thinking brain tumor.

357
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:22,249
I got married on the spur of the moment,
and I don't have a brain tumor.

358
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:23,667
That you know of.

359
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:25,948
I'll do the scalp.

360
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,940
- You will?
- I'm gonna watch you try to turn

361
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:31,158
a broken hand into a neuro problem
just to get some extra points? Nope.

362
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,586
It's not about the points.

363
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,498
I'm gonna watch you try to turn a broken
hand into a neuro problem just so you

364
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:37,712
have a reason to talk to Shepherd?

365
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,272
Nope.

366
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:43,029
I do not need a reason
to talk to Shepherd.

367
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,301
If I want to talk to Shepherd,
I'll talk...

368
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,007
What is this? Is this a hint?
I should be getting you more gifts?

369
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:04,345
A grateful patient gave them to me, but

370
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:07,055
since you're asking,
I do like a nice box of chocolates.

371
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,722
You're gonna die of a diabetic coma,
and I don't want any part of it.

372
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:11,696
- Cheapskate.
- Crackhead.

373
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:21,055
- Have you seen him?
- I have.

374
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:23,112
- Have you seen his eyes?
- I... Yeah.

375
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,729
- I'm trying to play it cool.
- I am playing it so, so cool.

376
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,265
I love him.

377
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:33,317
Oh, my god.
I... don't know you. I...

378
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:34,956
didn't say that.

379
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:45,788
What's with the flowers?

380
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,296
Are you asking as a resident
or a sister?

381
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:50,621
- Sister.
- I'm stealing stuff.

382
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:54,725
Are you okay?

383
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:59,077
Resident again now.
Stop stealing crap from the hospital.

384
00:19:01,492 --> 00:19:02,675
22.

385
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:05,184
- Keep a lid on it.
- I like to know where I am.

386
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:06,949
PH is up to 7.28.

387
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:11,062
Yeah, not great, but it's improving.
Push another amp of bicarb for a boost.

388
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:13,355
- Karev's only at 17.
- You're not helping!

389
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:15,079
Did you just yell at the chief?

390
00:19:15,818 --> 00:19:18,494
- Sorry, sir.
- I should end this competition now.

391
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:23,545
I mean, it's fine. Actually,
they're doing some nice work.

392
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:27,137
23. She's beating
the pants off of you, Karev.

393
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:28,875
Don't you have an update to deliver?

394
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:31,017
I think Hahn can wait
a couple of minutes.

395
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:34,181
Crap.

396
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:38,474
I thought you told me
to keep the animals under control.

397
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,174
From time to time,
I like to go to the zoo.

398
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,223
Dr. Hahn,
mr. Robinson is critical but stable.

399
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:51,527
We had to put him
on low dose levofed for his BP,

400
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:53,772
and he's put out 350 cc's
from his chest tube.

401
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:57,317
All right. I'll look forward to another
scintillating report in an hour.

402
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:58,493
Of course.

403
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:06,111
I'm thinking we ought to have
a little contest of our own.

404
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,095
You want to live in the hospital
like rodents?

405
00:20:08,215 --> 00:20:09,494
Different kind of contest.

406
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:11,368
You and Rose,
you're not exclusive, right?

407
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:13,159
- So I'm thinking.
- You not serious.

408
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,272
One woman, 10 points.
2 women, same time, 20 points.

409
00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:18,665
You get out in the morning
before anybody wakes up, 5 point.

410
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:21,158
- You are serious.
- You need a little spice in your life.

411
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,492
I'm just trying to help.

412
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:25,102
I am truly a worse human being
for knowing you.

413
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:31,633
- It's okay, mr. Sharon.
- It's not okay. It hurts.

414
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:33,327
I'm alone.

415
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:36,679
I'm all alone, and it hurts,
and I'm not okay. I'm dying.

416
00:20:38,998 --> 00:20:40,983
By some lucky stroke of fate,

417
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:44,142
you fractured your ankle and ended up
at Seattle Grey hospital

418
00:20:44,262 --> 00:20:45,620
with me as a doctor.

419
00:20:46,156 --> 00:20:48,297
And I am gonna find
out what's wrong with you,

420
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,900
then I'm gonna do my damnedest
to fix it, and if I can't fix it,

421
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,110
I'm gonna assemble a team
of doctors better than me,

422
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:56,351
they're gonna do their damnedest, too.
Then you know what's gonna happen?

423
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:59,136
- What?
- You're gonna live a healthier life,

424
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:01,702
and maybe even call your ex-wife
because you're being given

425
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:04,009
a second chance at life and this time...

426
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:06,260
This time you can do it right.

427
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,179
You're gonna feel a little pressure.

428
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:19,747
Chief, Mr. Robinson's brother.

429
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,793
- Can I talk to him?
- Just for a minute.

430
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:27,317
Hey, man.

431
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:29,059
Hey, that you, Phil?

432
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:30,529
How you feeling?

433
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:31,895
I feel like a...

434
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,139
Like a bear ate my guts
out or something.

435
00:21:36,535 --> 00:21:38,414
You touched a cub, man.

436
00:21:38,676 --> 00:21:41,220
- What the hell?
- I wasn't thinking.

437
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:43,592
I... I'm so sorry.

438
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:45,844
So touching the cub, you knew better?

439
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:47,294
Of course he knew better.

440
00:21:47,476 --> 00:21:50,365
He's having an early midlife crisis.
He's gonna kill us all.

441
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:51,996
I'm not having a midlife crisis.

442
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,900
Dude, dude,
you married your midlife crisis.

443
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:58,582
Just 'cause you got eaten by a bear, you
don't get to talk smack about my wife.

444
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:01,935
So was this spontaneous
wedding out of character for you?

445
00:22:02,693 --> 00:22:05,977
You know what? He needs a little rest,
so let's have some quiet.

446
00:22:13,117 --> 00:22:14,952
- Where was I?
- 59.

447
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:17,605
You are toast.

448
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:19,856
Tick tock.

449
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,412
Yang, no running in the hospital.

450
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:40,300
Why did we do a spinal tap
on an ankle fracture?

451
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:42,601
- He's getting a full workup.
- How many points?

452
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:43,702
What?

453
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:46,634
Look me in the eyes and tell me you are
not putting this man through painful

454
00:22:46,754 --> 00:22:49,846
and unnecessary procedures
because you're trying to win a contest.

455
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:52,540
I'm doing this because my patient
had dyspnea on exertion,

456
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:54,278
headaches, fever, myalgia,

457
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:56,594
a confluent rash intermittently
over his entire body.

458
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:59,242
I'm working him up for
RMSF and doing lyme titers,

459
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,251
but I'm also worried
about a rare autoimmune

460
00:23:01,411 --> 00:23:04,516
or rheumatoid disease because of his
high CRP and sed rates, or maybe lupus.

461
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:06,630
I'm doing a spinal tap too,
because he was altered

462
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,226
and is amnestic about his fall earlier.
I do want to win this contest,

463
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:13,257
but I also want to make sure
that a man does not leave this hospital

464
00:23:13,404 --> 00:23:16,083
with meningitis or encephalitis
and discover when it's too late

465
00:23:16,203 --> 00:23:18,142
that all we did was treat his ankle.

466
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:23,114
All right, then. Carry on.

467
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,875
When you hear hoofbeats, think
horses not zebras, right, Dr. Bailey?

468
00:23:30,037 --> 00:23:31,645
Exactly, O'Malley.

469
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,211
Exactly.

470
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:37,237
Something tells me you're not just
worried about the damage to my hand.

471
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:40,682
Phillip, earlier today,
you were squinting at your paperwork.

472
00:23:40,814 --> 00:23:42,705
I keep telling him he needs glasses.

473
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:45,760
And your handwriting was very
tiny and wasn't all that legible.

474
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,062
Is that normal for you?

475
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:50,245
Well, never been a straight-a student,
if that's what you mean.

476
00:23:50,376 --> 00:23:53,252
Is he done, or are we done here?

477
00:23:53,826 --> 00:23:56,383
- We could both use some rest.
- Humor me for one more second.

478
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:00,699
Okay, look straight ahead.

479
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,131
Tell me when you see my fingers.

480
00:24:11,428 --> 00:24:13,156
- I see them.
- Tumor!

481
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,062
Sorry.

482
00:24:19,294 --> 00:24:21,351
This is nice of you, really.

483
00:24:21,988 --> 00:24:25,290
Dreaming up some brain tumor to make me
better about me making a bear mad.

484
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:28,088
Ever cross your mind I may be the type
of guy who's enough to pet a bear?

485
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:30,066
Jennifer, is he that type of guy?

486
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:32,534
Well, don't ask me.
I've only known him a few months.

487
00:24:32,663 --> 00:24:34,231
Phillip, you knew better.

488
00:24:34,364 --> 00:24:35,795
You touched the cub anyway.

489
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:38,355
- That, along with your other symptoms.
- What symptoms?

490
00:24:38,484 --> 00:24:40,455
My vision's going bad.
So I get glasses, right?

491
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:41,948
But it's not just your vision.

492
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:44,106
Brain tumors have been known
to impede judgment,

493
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:47,021
prompt spontaneity, impulsivity.

494
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:52,985
He married a trashy waitress, right?

495
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:56,305
I mean, that's what you mean,
that he married a girl like me,

496
00:24:56,892 --> 00:24:58,143
the rebound girl.

497
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:03,673
I'm just saying, I would like
him to have an MRI.

498
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:05,307
Just to be sure.

499
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:10,162
Well, the answer's no.

500
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:13,075
- Do the MRI.
- Honey, I don't need....

501
00:25:13,552 --> 00:25:16,138
Do the damn MRI,
because you're wrong.

502
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:20,309
He loves me.

503
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:24,626
He loves me.

504
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:31,484
Mr. Robinson is doing better.
We were able to DC the levofed,

505
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,304
and he's intermittently awake and lucid.

506
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:35,813
His chest tube has put out
100 cc's since I last saw you,

507
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:38,099
and I'll be back in an hour
with another update.

508
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:40,424
Is somebody chasing you Dr. Yang?

509
00:25:40,553 --> 00:25:42,553
- Excuse me?
- What are you racing around for?

510
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:44,990
- No reason.
- No reason?

511
00:25:45,342 --> 00:25:48,210
Not because you're running towards the
finish line of this surgical contest?

512
00:25:48,823 --> 00:25:49,916
That.

513
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:52,486
- Yes.
- Are you winning?

514
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,234
Yes. Once I finish my sutures
on Mr. Robinson.

515
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:57,566
That's too bad.
I was gonna let you watch me

516
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:59,512
put mrs. Witkowsky's new valve in,

517
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,324
but if a contest is more important
than a cardiac surgery, so be it.

518
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:13,104
I'd be happy to watch, Dr. Hahn.

519
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:18,153
Crap. Crap. Crap!

520
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:21,502
- Ankle guy?
- His CSF is spotless,

521
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:25,497
ABG's normal, the ultrasound is clear...
What am I missing? What am I missing?

522
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:31,078
- What?
- Right there.

523
00:26:31,198 --> 00:26:32,244
- Where.
- See?

524
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:35,989
The fact that you're doing unnecessary
medical procedures to win a contest.

525
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:37,151
No! My god.

526
00:26:37,271 --> 00:26:39,104
The fact that
you and Meredith are both doing

527
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,221
unnecessary medical procedures
to win a contest.

528
00:26:41,341 --> 00:26:43,575
- Meredith has a medical mystery?
- No, she doesn'T.

529
00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:45,895
Something is wrong.
You wanna know how I know that?

530
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:49,224
Great doctors have that extra instinct,
George. They just know.

531
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,778
Great doctors,

532
00:26:51,164 --> 00:26:53,445
- they know when to stop.
- I have to have that instinct.

533
00:26:53,717 --> 00:26:56,084
'Cause my instincts lately?
Very bad.

534
00:26:56,231 --> 00:26:57,410
Really bad.

535
00:26:57,711 --> 00:27:00,995
They told me to go for cardio. They
told me to have sex with a married man.

536
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:03,009
They are not serving me well.

537
00:27:03,216 --> 00:27:05,947
I am in danger of going extinct
here if this keeps up,

538
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:08,912
and I am gonna win this contest if for
no other reason than I have to win it.

539
00:27:12,574 --> 00:27:13,589
You paged me?

540
00:27:13,814 --> 00:27:15,976
I thought you might like to see this.

541
00:27:16,882 --> 00:27:18,103
Is that bear attack guy?

542
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:20,636
That's bear attack guy,
and that's his big old Brain tumor.

543
00:27:20,978 --> 00:27:22,725
And I'm not requiring
an apology, George.

544
00:27:23,002 --> 00:27:24,385
I'm not requiring an apology

545
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:27,136
because the fact that I may
have potentially saved a life today

546
00:27:27,265 --> 00:27:28,456
is reward enough for me.

547
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:30,511
- You're calling me in to gloat.
- No.

548
00:27:32,788 --> 00:27:34,053
I need a favor.

549
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:40,852
- What am I at?
- 87.

550
00:27:42,004 --> 00:27:43,864
You're an underdog, aren't you, Karev?

551
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,483
Sir?

552
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,940
It's not that yodon't have the skills.
You have the skills.

553
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:50,862
But you're scrappy.

554
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,720
You're a fighter.

555
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:54,281
I like that.

556
00:27:54,891 --> 00:27:56,290
I always root for the underdog.

557
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:59,459
I'm a fighter, but,
I'm no underdog.

558
00:28:00,517 --> 00:28:02,573
Like this guy here.
He didn't...

559
00:28:02,757 --> 00:28:05,117
He didn't provoke that bear.
His brother did it.

560
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:09,161
Now he's here, fighting for his life,
paying for someone else's mistakes.

561
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:12,709
It doesn't make him an underdog.

562
00:28:12,956 --> 00:28:13,961
It just...

563
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,219
Well, makes him have to work harder
to overcome the cards he got dealt.

564
00:28:23,022 --> 00:28:24,872
He's crashing. Hit that code button.

565
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,717
We got a code blue!

566
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:28,279
Code blue!

567
00:28:31,857 --> 00:28:33,984
- This is Meredith's patient?
- Yes.

568
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:37,579
She didn't want to come to me herself?

569
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,859
Hey, I'm just... her intern.

570
00:28:49,654 --> 00:28:50,927
Oh, my god.

571
00:28:54,244 --> 00:28:55,442
Oh, my god.

572
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,575
Honey, I'm so sorry.

573
00:28:58,091 --> 00:29:00,266
We did absolutely everything we could.

574
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,347
The stress was just too much
for his body.

575
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,684
There's more.

576
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:17,770
The neurosurgeon is going
to come in and talk to you.

577
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:19,670
No, I need to know.

578
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,334
Please.

579
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,004
I'm sorry.

580
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,953
I was right about the tumor.

581
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:29,749
You have something called
a malignant glioma.

582
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:33,124
This kind of tumor

583
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,775
causes behavioral...

584
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:38,268
It can cause inappropriate affect.

585
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:41,233
- Can you operate?
- No.

586
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:45,255
It's too invasive.
It's been growing a long time.

587
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,581
I'm so sorry.

588
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,324
Good.

589
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:02,434
Good, I deserve that.

590
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:06,548
I killed my brother, so
I don't deserve to survive.

591
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:24,656
Doctor?

592
00:30:27,752 --> 00:30:29,038
I'm a symptom, right?

593
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:30,269
I mean, I'm...

594
00:30:30,502 --> 00:30:33,366
I'm like the bear cub.
I'm just a symptom of this tumor.

595
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:36,043
That's what we're saying here, right?

596
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,611
Just so I'm clear.

597
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:40,955
I don't know.

598
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:43,030
I don't know that.

599
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:46,179
You're the only one who
could know that for sure.

600
00:30:50,788 --> 00:30:52,838
When you say "negative,"
do you mean as

601
00:30:52,997 --> 00:30:54,722
in bad or as in nonexistent?

602
00:30:55,942 --> 00:30:57,122
Nothing bad came up.

603
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:59,858
What about all those alphabet tests
you were railing off?

604
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:02,085
I mean, they were elevated or something.

605
00:31:02,205 --> 00:31:03,249
Yeah...

606
00:31:04,176 --> 00:31:05,687
They were nonspecific.

607
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:09,650
They likely indicated that you
basically have a relatively minor flu.

608
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:11,281
I have the flu?

609
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:13,370
This whole day...

610
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:15,981
Everything you put me through...

611
00:31:16,101 --> 00:31:18,066
You put me through all this for the flu?

612
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:19,564
I'm sorry. I am.

613
00:31:19,756 --> 00:31:21,911
It just it seemed like
there was something more.

614
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:23,481
It really seemed...

615
00:31:24,265 --> 00:31:26,188
I know it's hard to see
the silver lining here,

616
00:31:26,308 --> 00:31:28,074
but think of the discoveries
you made today

617
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,223
about yourself and your life and...
and your ex-wife.

618
00:31:31,343 --> 00:31:33,264
My ex-wife was a castrating bitch!

619
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:37,259
She was a castrating bitch, and I never
missed her for one day since she left!

620
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:38,500
Not until today!

621
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,796
And I missed her today because
if we were still together,

622
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:42,907
she would've shot
me dead a long time ago,

623
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:45,506
and I wouldn't have had to gone
through the hell you put me through!

624
00:31:45,665 --> 00:31:46,717
I'm sorry.

625
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:49,526
- I didn't mean to. I really...
- You treated me like a rat!

626
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:52,117
Like a rat in some perverted lab!

627
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:55,575
Just give my prescription.
I want to get outta here.

628
00:31:56,964 --> 00:31:59,053
The flu is a virus. It...

629
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:03,280
doesn't respond to antibiotics.
I suggest plenty of fluids and rest.

630
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:06,372
Fluids and rest?

631
00:32:06,944 --> 00:32:08,014
Fluid and rest?

632
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,278
- I'm sorry.
- Fluids and freakin' rest!

633
00:32:10,466 --> 00:32:12,935
I'm sorry!
I'm really, really sorry.

634
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,451
What you doing here? You spent the last
3 hrs watching a surgery. It's 3 points.

635
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,793
I'm trusting you screwed up enough
that it won't matter.

636
00:32:27,935 --> 00:32:30,376
I could still win. I could.
I did get a lot of points today.

637
00:32:30,496 --> 00:32:32,988
What's the matter with you?
Where's the trash talk, Charles Barkley?

638
00:32:33,176 --> 00:32:34,490
She knows I'm the best.

639
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:39,981
- Who won?
- Congratulations...

640
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:42,197
- Who won?
- Dr. Grey.

641
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,733
The guy from the bear attack had
a brain tumor, and Grey caught it.

642
00:32:46,873 --> 00:32:49,521
80 points for solving a medical mystery.
That's what put her over the top.

643
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:51,372
- I could've found a tumor.
- You didn't.

644
00:32:51,492 --> 00:32:54,595
You chose to scrub in with Hahn
and watch for 3 little points.

645
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:56,570
Now congratulate Grey.

646
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:58,183
Congratulations.

647
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,190
Hey, don't you want your prize?

648
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:05,690
- A shiny pager.
- A sparkle pager.

649
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:08,760
- What's so great about a glitter pager?
- A sparkle pager.

650
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:11,845
It is special.
It is surgery's holy grail.

651
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:15,241
It's been passed down from resident
to resident, and now it belongs to Grey.

652
00:33:15,362 --> 00:33:17,818
For the next three months,
whenever you all get a surgery,

653
00:33:17,947 --> 00:33:20,437
you have to page this pager, and if...

654
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,199
Grey wants your surgery,
she has the right to take it from you.

655
00:33:23,546 --> 00:33:24,878
Come on. Crap.

656
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,569
Enjoy the power, Grey.

657
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:30,942
Now may I recommend you all go home?

658
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:32,899
You smell, you greasy,

659
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:35,339
you need to bathe,
and I'm sick of looking at you.

660
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:38,201
Even my 1 year old here is sick of
looking at you. Isn't that right, bug?

661
00:33:38,348 --> 00:33:40,567
Sick of looking at your little,
ugly faces.

662
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:44,778
Somehow I thought
I would enjoy this more.

663
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,426
- Well, give it to me. I'll enjoy it.
- Don't give it to her.

664
00:33:47,614 --> 00:33:50,715
- Give it to me.
- Shut up. It's hers. She's the winner.

665
00:33:50,835 --> 00:33:52,787
She's not gonna give it to you.
Give it to me.

666
00:33:58,649 --> 00:33:59,701
Are you kidding me?

667
00:34:03,035 --> 00:34:04,153
I don't like her.

668
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,672
I'm sorry, but as your friend, It's
my job to say it. I don't like Rose.

669
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:08,719
Why?

670
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:11,313
- You're not even sleeping with her.
- You don't like her 'cause

671
00:34:11,444 --> 00:34:13,877
she's not sleeping with me?
That's a little weird.

672
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:15,831
- It's not weird.
- It's a little weird.

673
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:17,968
If you were sleeping with Rose,
I could understand

674
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,841
why you've been spending time with her,
but you're not. And it's just...

675
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:22,447
I thought that,

676
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,151
you know...

677
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:26,674
I thought it was just gonna be
you and me.

678
00:34:27,914 --> 00:34:31,119
- Having sex?
- After. After Addison, after Meredith.

679
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:32,867
I have been patient.

680
00:34:33,014 --> 00:34:36,138
I have waited while you partnered up
with these chicks, but now they're over,

681
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:38,395
and it's supposed to be just us,

682
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:40,843
you and me, two guys on the prowl,
on the hunt.

683
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:43,230
You're having trouble getting laid,
and you need my help.

684
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,711
I can get laid.
I can get laid whenever I want.

685
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:48,904
I do get laid whenever I want.
That's the point.

686
00:34:49,465 --> 00:34:50,785
Women are everywhere.

687
00:34:52,797 --> 00:34:55,046
I only have one person I can talk to.

688
00:34:56,853 --> 00:34:58,147
- That's sweet.
- Shut up.

689
00:34:58,267 --> 00:35:00,388
- It's really warm and fuzzy very sweet.
- Shut up.

690
00:35:00,942 --> 00:35:02,997
Are you serious about this woman?

691
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,186
I don't know.

692
00:35:06,928 --> 00:35:07,980
Could be.

693
00:35:12,218 --> 00:35:14,425
All right.
I'll give her a chance.

694
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:15,604
Good boy.

695
00:35:15,745 --> 00:35:17,970
You're pathetic, and I'm a lesser man
for knowing you.

696
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,912
That's my line.
You can't use my line.

697
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,518
Thought you were off duty an hour ago.

698
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:36,603
I'm just catching up on some paperwork.

699
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:40,296
Piled up on you
during the contest, I guess.

700
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,806
- You know about that?
- I know about Otis Sharon

701
00:35:43,939 --> 00:35:45,948
and the $120,000

702
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:48,347
worth of unnecessary tests you ordered.

703
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:49,482
Yeah.

704
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:50,758
Well...

705
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:53,150
I lost.

706
00:35:53,864 --> 00:35:56,260
And I put a man through
hell for no reason at all.

707
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:00,283
I was a bad doctor today with
bad instincts, and I deserved to lose.

708
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:03,750
I don't know why I even bothered
competing in the stupid contest.

709
00:36:04,103 --> 00:36:06,251
- So I don't need to yell?
- You should.

710
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:07,418
You can.

711
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:09,204
But you don't need to.

712
00:36:09,675 --> 00:36:10,692
Good.

713
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:15,480
- Stevens.
- Yes, sir?

714
00:36:16,535 --> 00:36:17,568
My year...

715
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:19,841
I lost by 2 points.

716
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:22,822
- You...
- You didn't invent the contest.

717
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,878
The contest is a lion fight.

718
00:36:28,747 --> 00:36:29,798
So chin up,

719
00:36:30,111 --> 00:36:32,472
put your shoulders back,
walk proud, strut a little.

720
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:34,250
Don't lick your wounds.

721
00:36:34,379 --> 00:36:35,466
Celebrate them.

722
00:36:35,844 --> 00:36:38,383
The scars you bear
are the sign of a competitor.

723
00:36:40,373 --> 00:36:41,985
You were in a lion fight.

724
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:45,360
Just because you didn't win
doesn't mean you don't know how to roar.

725
00:36:52,355 --> 00:36:53,360
Good night.

726
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:55,006
Good night, sir.

727
00:37:01,314 --> 00:37:03,629
<i>There's a little animal in all of us,</i>

728
00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:05,673
<i>and maybe that's something to celebrate.</i>

729
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,428
<i>Our animal instinct is what
makes us seek comfort,</i>

730
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:12,566
<i>warmth, a pack to run with.</i>

731
00:37:12,874 --> 00:37:14,087
Hi...

732
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,502
Hello, Dr. Hahn.

733
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,679
I hope it's okay
I invited somebody over.

734
00:37:18,857 --> 00:37:20,576
No, it's fine.

735
00:37:21,911 --> 00:37:23,939
It's an honor to have you here,
Dr. Hahn.

736
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:27,261
I have to tell you...

737
00:37:28,108 --> 00:37:29,563
- You won't believe it.
- Yes.

738
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:36,747
I was just going in there.

739
00:37:43,365 --> 00:37:44,900
<i>We may feel caged...</i>

740
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,672
Are you kidding me?

741
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:53,008
<i>We may feel trapped...</i>

742
00:37:58,285 --> 00:38:01,919
<i>but still, as humans,
we can find ways to feel free.</i>

743
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,578
Before you say anything,

744
00:38:03,756 --> 00:38:05,860
before you say a word, just...
just hear me out.

745
00:38:06,259 --> 00:38:10,024
I know it's not much,
and I... I know it's all stolen.

746
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:13,973
It's all stolen and...
and hospitaly and stolen.

747
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,687
You can turn me in if you want to.

748
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:18,286
You can report me for stealing,
cause obviously, now I'm a thief.

749
00:38:18,406 --> 00:38:21,439
I've never even shoplifted a piece
of gum before, and now I'm a thief,

750
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:23,025
except I'm not.

751
00:38:23,543 --> 00:38:26,171
I'm a nester. I'm...
I'm nesting. This is me nesting...

752
00:38:27,026 --> 00:38:28,026
For you.

753
00:38:28,243 --> 00:38:30,108
Because you hate it here.

754
00:38:31,006 --> 00:38:33,630
You want to be at that big house
with Meredith and Izzie

755
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,734
where things are warm and you have your
friends and there aren't any roaches.

756
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:40,521
But this can be warm,
and I put out traps for the roaches.

757
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,446
And I...

758
00:38:43,138 --> 00:38:44,467
I can be your friend.

759
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:47,575
No, I can be your friend.

760
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:51,591
I don't...
I don't have any friends here,

761
00:38:51,711 --> 00:38:54,182
not... not really, except you.

762
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:58,872
And... and I don't have a home
to go to anymore, except here.

763
00:39:00,363 --> 00:39:02,979
I just... I...
I can be your friend.

764
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:09,019
I complain a lot, don't I?

765
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,400
It's... okay.

766
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:13,674
No.

767
00:39:15,377 --> 00:39:16,598
No. You know what?

768
00:39:16,805 --> 00:39:19,359
I'm gonna stop. I'm just...
just gonna stop right now.

769
00:39:20,214 --> 00:39:22,376
I'm gonna focus on what's good,

770
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:26,299
you know, like, like this crapartment,
like this apartment.

771
00:39:33,776 --> 00:39:34,800
<i>We are...</i>

772
00:39:35,317 --> 00:39:36,934
<i>each other's keepers.</i>

773
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:42,257
- Wish you'd have stolen a TV.
- I tried. They're bolted to the walls.

774
00:39:42,398 --> 00:39:43,398
Still.

775
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,662
<i>We are the guardians
of our own humanity.</i>

776
00:40:11,523 --> 00:40:15,114
<i>And even though there's
a beast inside all of us...</i>

777
00:40:23,094 --> 00:40:24,661
I think I found a way to save lives.

778
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,588
I don't know for sure,
but I think we can save people

779
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,672
who have the kind of tumors
that Mr. Robinson has.

780
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:32,713
Mr. Robinson, the man
who was mauled by the bear.

781
00:40:32,957 --> 00:40:35,058
I did all this research,
and I found this.

782
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:37,617
It's rare, and it's still untested
in humans, but...

783
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:40,259
I could find patients
for a clinical trial,

784
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:43,398
and I could do the lab work,
and I could track the results.

785
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:46,799
But I do need a neurosurgeon,
and you're one of the best.

786
00:40:47,665 --> 00:40:50,236
It's not about us.
I would go somewhere else if I could.

787
00:40:52,488 --> 00:40:53,512
But...

788
00:40:54,603 --> 00:40:57,148
I don't know.
I think I found a way to save lives.

789
00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:04,186
<i>What sets us apart from the animals
is that we can think,</i>

790
00:41:04,536 --> 00:41:06,911
<i>feel, dream and love.</i>

791
00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:15,985
<i>And against all odds...</i>

792
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:20,489
<i>Against all instinct...</i>

793
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:31,320
I think I better start talking now.

794
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,257
<i>We evolve.</i>
