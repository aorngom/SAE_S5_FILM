1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,800
We all remember the bedtime
stories of our childhoods--

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,500
the shoe fits cinderella, the
frog turns into a prince,

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,580
sleeping beauty is
awakened with a kiss.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,250
Once upon a time...

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,100
and then they lived
happily ever after...

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,070
fairy tales, the stuff of dreaMs.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,050
The problem is fairy
tales don't come true.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,620
It's the other stories, the ones that begin with
dark and stormy nights and end in the unspeakable...

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,670
it's the nightmares that
always seem to become reality.

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,020
What happened?

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,200
A bus in front of him
hit a telephone pole.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,860
He tried to swerve
to miss it, but--

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,270
how bad is
it? Meredith--

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,400
meredith,
you're gonna have to be strong.

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,660
Derek!

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,240
No.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,010
No!

18
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,640
No!

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,230
No!

20
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,980
Derek!

21
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,120
No!

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,700
No!

23
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,500
Derek!

24
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,090
Derek!

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,020
The person who invented the
phrase "happily ever after"

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,890
should have his ass kicked so hard.

27
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,320
Back up.
You're sucking all my oxygen.

28
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,240
I'm trying to see.

29
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,760
It's not up yet.
There's nothing to see.

30
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,240
- It's supposed to be posted at 4:00.
- It's 4:15.

31
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,510
Hit the refresh button.
Yeah. You have to reload the page.

32
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,730
I'm hitting the refresh button
every ten seconds. Just wait.

33
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,880
- Is it up yet?
- no.

34
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,399
- Hi.
- Hi.

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,770
- is it up yet?
- no! Wait.

36
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,330
I'm thinking we move up a slot. We
pass hopkins, move up to number two.

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,410
We're not passing hopkins.
We're gonna stay number two.

38
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,390
Mayo could surge ahead.
We could be three.

39
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,380
Three?

40
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,749
- Pessimist.
- Realist.

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,430
The rankings of teaching hospitals
change based on any number of things.

42
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,620
Ah, three is top five.
I can live with three.

43
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,320
Just hit the refresh button.

44
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,240
Get--stay back.
I'm doing this.

45
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,720
- Hey, is it up yet?
- No.

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,010
Well, here. Just
hitthe refresh-- ah-ah!

47
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,370
I am hitting the refresh...
okay, all of you, back up.

48
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,950
Stop hovering, stop speculating.

49
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,680
The rankings will
go up when they go up.

50
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,430
We have no control over
when they're posted.

51
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,220
When it is up, I will say,"it is up.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,000
" Until then, back up, shut up and
leave me alone so I can push the--

53
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,150
it's up.

54
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,020
Oh, number one, hopkins.

55
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,140
- Number two, mayo.
- Told ya.

56
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,930
- Three, cleland clinic?
- What?

57
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,770
- Four, mass gen.
- What?

58
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,660
Wait, wait. We moved down to five?

59
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,270
No.

60
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,140
We are not five.

61
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,180
12!

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,880
- 12, o'malley!
- It's so upsetting.

63
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,940
Sir-- this is not a number
12 teaching hospital.

64
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,260
- No, it's a great teaching hospital.
- I do not run the number 12 surgical program in the country.

65
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,430
Sir-- out with
it, o'malley!

66
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,710
We've been downgraded from a level
I trauma center to a level ii?

67
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,900
What does that even mean you

68
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,470
don't need to ex-explain.

69
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,800
It's--it's just
details. I can go.

70
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,710
12.

71
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,500
You know, I couldn't ask him about when
he was gonna schedule my intern test

72
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,760
with all the you know
what hitting the fan.

73
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,330
I mean, for all I know, he's
gonna spring it to me,

74
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,200
what, like, in an hour, two hours?

75
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,810
And you'll be ready.

76
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,320
Causes of hypotension.

77
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,450
Uh,hypovolemia,M.I.,Cardiac
dysrhythmia...

78
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,810
- uh, hypoxia. Yeah, is that good?
- Very good.

79
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,380
Yeah? What?

80
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,050
The snow, it...

81
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,190
it's--it's
so pretty.

82
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,380
It's like a fairy tale.

83
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,650
Lexie...

84
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,570
It's--it's
the fall.

85
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,910
That's not so much a fairy tale as,

86
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,610
uh, it is global warming.
That's the apocalypse.

87
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,830
That's like--well, it's
like dropping to number 12

88
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,880
and me failing my intern
test for the second time.

89
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,720
I adore you, by the way.

90
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,290
Just...

91
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,580
oh, hey, uh, sorry i'm late.

92
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,150
I was just helping-- no
talking unless it's medical.

93
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,890
So I keep having that
dream, the derek-is-dead dream.

94
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,610
You know who does their
residencies at number 12 hospitals?

95
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,840
Losers, and I am not a loser.

96
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,330
Go get the charts.

97
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,820
So, I mean, the dream is about me being
afraid of the house of candles and,

98
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,800
you know, taking the big step and...

99
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,510
I'm afraid of havinga happy ending.

100
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,600
You know, I have a phd in biochem.

101
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,710
I'm a double doctor.

102
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,510
Double doctors should not do their
residencies at second-rate hospitals.

103
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,270
Wyatt says I should just lean
into the wind, into the fear,

104
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,110
so I'm just gonna ask
derek to move in with me.

105
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,550
I could transfer.

106
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,320
Cleveland clinic has
a huge cardio program.

107
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,070
You know, we're still in the
top 20. That's pretty good.

108
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,770
Pretty good is not enough.

109
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,760
I want to be great.
Greatness, meredith.

110
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,710
Greatness, which is why I'm going
to ask derek to move in with me.

111
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,810
It's just that it's, you
know, it's a big step,

112
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
and I don't want
to mess it up again.

113
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,900
I've messed
it up before--

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,040
the breakups and the on and off
again and the sleeping with george.

115
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,880
It's just-- you
slept with george?

116
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,500
No talking unless it's medical.

117
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,900
So I'm just gonna do it. I'm just
gonna ask him to move in with me.

118
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,870
You think it's the
right thing, right?

119
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,520
Uh, oh, bailey's paging.

120
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,870
Um, uh, so medically, um, meredith
and george had sexual intercourse?

121
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,970
Uh, when and
how--how many times?

122
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,220
- it's humiliating.
- yeah.

123
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,530
12?

124
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,660
You're the best
neurosurgeon in the country...

125
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,200
thank you. In the world.

126
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,370
Don'you want to say
anything nice about me?

127
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,290
Uh, you're the best plastics
guy at seattle grace.

128
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,750
Nice, really nice.

129
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,460
Don't force me to praise you.

130
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,460
Hey, rose.

131
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,470
Hello, Dr. Sloan.

132
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,890
She took it so well
at the beginning.

133
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,280
I was hoping we could be civilized.
You know,she's working my O.R.

134
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,230
- Civilized is out.
- Thank you.

135
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,440
It's gone.
It's a trail of fairy dust.

136
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,590
Now she's got delayed rage.

137
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,820
Delayed rage?

138
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,410
Yeah, she was being big
before, putting on a brave face.

139
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,110
Now she's had time to think.
Now she hates your gutS.

140
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,400
You have to break up with R.

141
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,560
Well, that's the point.
I did already.

142
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,900
Well, you did it personally.

143
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,130
Now you have to
do it professionally.

144
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,580
Good luck with that.

145
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,380
Delayed rage...

146
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,320
I'd like a list...

147
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,320
from you of ways that I can improve.

148
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,570
Not right now.

149
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,220
Richard, you told me
that I'm a bad teacher.

150
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,160
Now we're number 12, and i
don't like to be number 12.

151
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,660
So I'd like a
list-- not right now.

152
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,640
But if there are ways
that I can improve,

153
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,240
ways that I can help the
program regain its ranking,

154
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,940
then-- it's
snowing.

155
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,880
You know what happens when
it's nighttime and it's snowing

156
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,340
and the temperature is hovering
right around 32 degrees?

157
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,270
No.

158
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,560
The snow begins to melt, and
then it freezes again,

159
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,280
creating black ice the deadliest kind of
ice because it is invisible to drivers.

160
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,610
That would usually mean
that our E. R. Would fill up

161
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,250
, but mercy west is a number-I
level trauma center and we're not,

162
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,680
which means their E. R. Gets the traumas while
we get their castoffs, which pisses me off.

163
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,510
So when I say "not right now,"
what I mean is not right now.

164
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,120
Stop shivering.
You're embarrassing me.

165
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,440
I didn't realize we
were gonna be outside.

166
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,580
Oh, I'm okay.
You don't have to do that.

167
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,599
Bundle up. You're turning blue.

168
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,660
Dr. Bailey,
it is kind of cold out here.

169
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,860
- Someone will come.
- No one's coming.

170
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,220
Maybe some old people with
broken hips we can fix.

171
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,020
Okay, stop talng.

172
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,270
We are seattle grace hospital, and
rankings or no rankings,

173
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,280
we are going to stand
outside at the ready, on alert,

174
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:18,280
and give the best care available to every
single patient that arrives at our door.

175
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,970
We may no longer be ranked the best,

176
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,400
but I'm the best, and you're my
residents, which means you're the best.

177
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,940
It's a matter of pride, people.

178
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,710
What are we doing?

179
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,210
- We're waiting.
- For?

180
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,660
A miracle.

181
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,320
Someone will come.

182
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,550
Dr. Bailey, you know that mercy
west is getting the traumas first.

183
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,610
Someone will come.

184
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,120
So we're standing out here in the
hopes that someone is severely injured?

185
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,190
Wishing and praying that someone
is so hurt and so near death that

186
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,030
the ambulance has to bring them here
because we're closer than mercy west?

187
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,700
Yep.

188
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,820
You and god are cool with that?

189
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,359
Damn it. I forgot about god.

190
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,020
All right. Let's just go
on back inside and wait-

191
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,630
Hey, watch out!

192
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:11,990
Are you okay?

193
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,050
I drove a limousine on ice...

194
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,640
all by myself, ten blocks.

195
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,050
Are you okay?

196
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,020
My dress--there's blood all
over my dress. What happened?

197
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,240
What happened was I got us
to the hospital in one piece.

198
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,600
Ma'am, pase try not to move, okay?

199
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,550
Just sit right here until
we can get you a wheelchair.

200
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,050
We need a wheelchair over here.

201
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,710
We're not the patient.

202
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,740
What's his name? Benny?Billy?

203
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,590
Billy?

204
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,830
The limo driver.

205
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,660
He flew through the windshield.

206
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,550
Help him, please.

207
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,650
Uh, yang, come around, help mE.

208
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,920
Get a board, uh, bring out
a gurney and a c-collar.

209
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,320
Okay, get--uh--

210
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,030

214
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,410
what do we have?

215
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,580
Billy matthews,45, arterial
bleed, haven't isolated the cause.

216
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,410
I got this. Okay, let's
get him in trauma one.

217
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,380
- Okay, but I'm holding pressure over the bleed.
- I got this.

218
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,530
I just
need--chie--

219
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,330
what's going on?

220
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,570
Vincent will worry if I'm late.

221
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,120
You've been in a car accident.

222
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,610
You're at the hospital, but we're
gonna take really good care of you.

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,400
Is she okay?

224
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,720
Might be a concussion.

225
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,159
I'm gonna go order a C.T. And make
sure it's nothing more than that.

226
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,370
All this blood--we should've
waited for the ambulance.

227
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,670
We did wait.
We waited, they never came.

228
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,290
And billy was just hanging
there through the windshield.

229
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,460
Wait, you guys extracted your limo
driver from the windshield by yourselves?

230
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,980
Wow, that's pretty heroic.

231
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,730
- Isn't michael answering?
- No. Try phil again.

232
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,640
We shouldn't have even been going to
the stupid ball in a storm like that.

233
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,610
What ball?

234
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,330
The fire and ice ball--would
you believe, in an ice storm?

235
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,780
Just goes to voice mail.
Maybe--maybe their phones are off?

236
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,500
You can't reach vincent?

237
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,980
Your husbands were in another car?

238
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,120
We won't ride with them.

239
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,340
We're three of the most happily married women ever
except when our husbands drag out their cigars,

240
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,990
and they drag out their
cigars in the limo.

241
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,930
Well, your arm is not
broken, just bruised.

242
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,310
So o'malley here is gonna suture up
your cuts, and then you're all set.

243
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,780
You ladies are lucky you didn't
sustain more serious injuries.

244
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,770
What kind of doctor
are you? You're young.

245
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,140
Oh, I'm an intern.

246
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,880
Interns don't touch the face.

247
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,420
The plastic surgeon
touches the face.

248
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,450
What's happening?

249
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
Where am I?

250
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,440
We were in an accident.

251
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,120
You're okay.

252
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,640
We're all gonna be fine.

253
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,370
- Hi.
- Hi.

254
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,080
I've been really busy.

255
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,610
- No, no, I know.
- I've been, like, crazy busy.

256
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,560
Researching things, a lot
of research, in the library.

257
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,040
Oh, yeah, me, too. Incredibly busy.

258
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,660
A lot of research, uh, like
you, only I use the internet.

259
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,800
- Well, I gotta check in
with bailey, so-- me, too.

260
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,830
Bailey, anything else?

261
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,850
Nothing. Nothing else.

262
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,890
That's the problem.

263
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,830
I'm charting. The chief
took my one trauma.

264
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,890
I gave up my clinic, and
now I'm charting.

265
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,680
The chief wanted you
to take a look at these.

266
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,220
Billy matthews.
He's the limo driver.

267
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,090
Multiple crush
injuries from an M.V.C.

268
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,020
Hemopericardium.

269
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:37,210
Hemopericardium can lead to cardiac tamponade,
which can be detected by beck's triad--

270
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,540
increased J.V.P.,Hypotension
and muffled heart sounds.

271
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,490
This is a teaching hospital.

272
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,130
I'm trying to improve my teaching.

273
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,070
Well, don't try it on me.

274
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,550
- want to know how I teach?
- No.

275
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,680
I'm like a guru-- they
come to me for help,

276
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,400
and I gently guide them along
the path to truth and wisdom.

277
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,260
- Hey, george.
- Hi.

278
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,020
- I heard a thing.
- Yeah?

279
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,120
- A surprising thing, a very unexpected, nonmedical
thing about you and-- -oh, hold on.

280
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,480
Uh, Dr. Sloan, hi.

281
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,760
Sarabeth briar has got a facial lac,
but she will only let you touch her.

282
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,420
You paged me for a cut?

283
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,020
What kind of moron are you,
o'malley?

284
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,580
Are you a special moron from the
isle of complete and utter morons?

285
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,150
- I don't think so.
- Shut up.

286
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,010
Truth and wisdom.

287
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,270
He's an ass.

288
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,740
You know what? This is what
we get for being number 12--

289
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,670
a bunch of women in ball gowns
and half-dead limo driver.

290
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,030
Those women are amazing.
They tried to save his life.

291
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,990
That's who I want to be, you know?

292
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,130
An aging princess?

293
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,910
They've been with the same men
for years, and they're happy.

294
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,130
They did it. I can do it.

295
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,690
- mer, I--
hey.

296
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,450
Who paged me?

297
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,750
Bailey and izzie paged you, but you should see
bailey first because she's got the limo driver.

298
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,010
Okay.

299
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,960
Do you want to move in with me?

300
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,890
You want to live together?

301
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,540
- Well, I an, I could-- I just, uh. If--if
you don't want to, I-- -yes.

302
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,550
Yes?

303
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,120
Absolutely. You sure you're ready?

304
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,500
I am leaning into the
fear to get a happy ending.

305
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,440
I don't even know what that means.

306
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,140
Damn it!

307
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,090
Time of
death--20:47.

308
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,480
Limo driver, traumatic arrest.

309
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,990
Never regained a pulse.

310
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,380
Tell them not to book the O.R.

311
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,600
I have a dream, yang.

312
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,520
Excuse me?

313
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,130
That one day, a trauma will
come through those doors--

314
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,770
I have a dream.

315
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,160
I share that dream.

316
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,790
Number 12.

317
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,500
Number 12.

318
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,410
Right now dispatch is squawking about
three men-- three serious injuries--

319
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,280
every one, they're
taking 'em to mercy west.

320
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,590
- Three men?
- That's what I said.

321
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,840
You mean like three men who could be
married to those ladies in the ball gowns?

322
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,440
Little stick.

323
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,180
Squeeze my hand. Squeeze my hand.

324
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,220
Just like when you
had pete, you remember?

325
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,820
Pete hurt less.

326
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,250
Yeah, but you're going to love me
later when there's virtually no scar.

327
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,700
Ladies, um, I've been on the
phone with, uh, ambulance dispatch.

328
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,730
Three gentlemen in a limousine collided
with another vehicle on broad street.

329
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,560
It's possible it was your husbands.

330
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,170
Oh, no.

331
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,850
- They're taking them to mercy west...
- which is across town.

332
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,640
Unless, uh, you prefer
that they be brought here.

333
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,260
- We can do that?
- Oh, you can insist.

334
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,690
And, uh...
if I were you, I would insist.

335
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,770
Oh, w-well, then I guess--
I guess we insist.

336
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,780
- Yes, we insist.
- You insist.

337
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,990
Am I to understand that you stole
these traumas from mercy west?

338
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,330
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

339
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,390
Good job,'cause now it's personal.

340
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,130
Yang, come with me.

341
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,680
- We have a situation.
- OK

342
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,480
58-year-old male,M.V.C.,Tachy
and 160,B.P.80 palp,

343
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,740
decreased bilateral
and breath sounds.

344
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,840
What did you do?

345
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,460
I didn't do it. He did.

346
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,980
G.I. Joe trached him at the
field before I got there.

347
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,740
With a pen? You trached
this guy with an ink pen?

348
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,220
So?

349
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,100
Move this guy inside
now. Come on. Let's go.

350
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,640
Move, move, move, move.

351
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,930
Pen... trach...

352
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,920
hot.

353
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,940
Okay, what do we got?

354
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,160
Vincent kenner,58, unrestrained backseat
passenger of a limo that took a nosedive.

355
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,890
Muffled heart sounds
and large scalp lac.

356
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,360
- That's vincent.
- betty.

357
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,850
- I'm sorry, Dr. Hahn, but she wanted to see her husband.
- Vincent. That's my husband.

358
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,220
What happened? Is he all right?

359
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,690
- I promise to give you an update as soon as we know something.
- no.

360
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,559
- But right now,I have to get you to the C.T.
- Oh,god.

361
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,500
Vincent.

362
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,539
I'll bringou back.
I'll bring you back.

363
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,830
Free fluid in the abdomen.

364
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,670
Compressed skullracture.

365
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,230
He's also got decreased
breath sounds bilaterally.

366
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,660
This guy's getting an
express ticket to the O.R.

367
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,690
Let the chief know.

368
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,840
- Can I scrub in?
- Fine.

369
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,640
He has a pen in his throat!

370
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,260
Oh, michael!

371
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,990
Oh, god, michael!
Oh, god, are you--

372
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,850
is that a--is that
a pen in his throat?

373
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,430
Does he have a ballpoint
pen in his throat?

374
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,970
Ma'am, you need to wait
outside. Let the doctors work.

375
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,100
But they have to be
very careful with him.

376
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,240
Michael's been under an incredible
amount of stress lately and--

377
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,260
and the last
thing he needs--

378
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,130
grey, can you handle
this woman, please?

379
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,540
Mrs. Loomis, we're gonna take you to
your husband. He's around the corner.

380
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,170
Sweetheart, I'm here.

381
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,260
Michael, I'm here, sweetheart.

382
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,820
- This is not her husband?
- Nope.

383
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,200
Oh, my god, michael!

384
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,090
It's her husband.

385
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,280
What happened to him?

386
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,050
Please come with
me, ma'am. Please, this way.

387
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,320
What happened to him?

388
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,250
Michael!

389
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,360
You trached a man in the
field using a ballpoint pen?

390
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,110
That's all I had on me.

391
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,730
What? It's not like I didn't
clean it off with fresh snow.

392
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,880
That's awesome.

393
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,790
Really? You're going with a
size 6 shiley tube on this?

394
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,350
Somebody get this guy away from me.

395
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,080
Uh,I'm gonna need a C.T.

396
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,890
Of, uh, this belly, chief.

397
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,900
Karev, get us in line.

398
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,850
Looks like his trachea's crushed.

399
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,730
I'm gonna need an O.R. And an
extra set of hands. Who's available?

400
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,290
- Grey.
- The good grey?

401
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,510
The intern grey.

402
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,390
And I'll throw in o'malley.

403
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,900
Oh, nice. Perfect.

404
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,940
Phil?

405
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,580
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. What happened?

406
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,540
The limo hit a patch of ice.

407
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,830
Next thing I know, we're all upside
down, rolling around, and now...

408
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,330
anna...

409
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,310
I can't feel my legs.

410
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,760
Oh, phil. I'm so sorry.

411
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,780
Okay, get her out of here. I
gotta get a consult from shepherd.

412
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,060
Oh, sir, Dr. Hahn is working
on multiple crash injuries.

413
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,060
She wants you to take a look.

414
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,030
Mm-hmm, I'm on my way.

415
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,420
You're bleeding.

416
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,080
Oh, my car was right behind
theirs at the intersection.

417
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,900
I cut it on impact.

418
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,680
And you triaged these men?

419
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,230
Major owen hunt,U.S.
Army,second forward surgical.

420
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,910
I'm a trauma surgeon.

421
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,500
I just got home on leave.

422
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,040
Dr. Yang,
take care of major hunt's leg.

423
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,650
Uh, sir, I'm-- I'm
scrubbing in with you.

424
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,180
After you take care of major hunt.

425
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,580
Hey, where are you going?

426
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,960
To check on my other patients.

427
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,610
No, no. You are the patient.

428
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,710
Hello?

429
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,160
Vincent?

430
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,040
Are you there?

431
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,870
Where am I?

432
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,359
You've been in a car
accident,betty. You're having a C.T.

433
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,210
It's gonna be okay.
Everything is okay. Don't move.

434
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,510
Some nut job down there trached a
guy with a pen. Pretty freakin' cool.

435
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,640
You want cool? Check this out.

436
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,000
Every 30 seconds.

437
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,600
Is someone there?

438
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,360
Where am I?

439
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,850
You've been in a
car accident, betty.

440
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,940
You're having a C.T. It's okay.

441
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,040
Every 30 seconds, her memory
resets-- every 30 seconds.

442
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,330
Might not be so bad.

443
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,610
Like hitting the refresh
button, everything is new again.

444
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,300
How you doing?

445
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,220
You keep asking me that, and
I keep telling you, I'm fine.

446
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,990
I know, it's just...

447
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,120
sometimes I still think denny's
gonna be right around the corner,

448
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,020
and he's been dead a long time now.

449
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,930
It just takes a
while to get used to.

450
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,350
Rebecca didn't die. It's
not like that for me.

451
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,910
I'm good.

452
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,790
But thank you for asking.

453
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,750
Hello?

454
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,200
Is someone there?

455
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,810
Where am I?

456
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,360
You're in a spaceship.

457
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,290
You're going to the
moon. Enjoy the ride.

458
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,910
Alex.

459
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,210
A space ship?

460
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,650
Excuse me?

461
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,360
You're having a C.T.,Betty.

462
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,320
You're gonna be okay.

463
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,800
You've been in a car
accident. Just don't move.

464
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,690
Thanks a lot.

465
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,990
Bailey paged me.

466
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,680
I'll see you later.

467
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,930
He has a depressed skull fracture.

468
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,170
I could elevate the skull fragments,

469
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,620
but there's just no telling
how much damage has been done.

470
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,950
We're saving this man.

471
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:48,050
All right, I think we're looking at an aortic tear,
not to mention vast amounts of blood in his abdomen.

472
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,030
We are saving this man.

473
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,680
I can handle the abdominal bleeding.

474
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,250
He is circling the drain.

475
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,410
Yeah, I have other
traumas to get to.

476
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,540
We are saving this man!

477
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,470
Now does everyone understand, or
do I have to repeat myself?

478
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,290
- Yes, sir.
- Understood.

479
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,550
Okay,book O.R. Two.

480
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,200
It's
pathetic, isn't it--

481
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,180
a married woman cheats on her
best friend with her husband?

482
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,160
You can't go much lower than that.

483
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,590
These things happen.

484
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,300
I ran into michael in
the mall, and we had lunch.

485
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,030
And a week later, we
had another lunch.

486
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,730
And here we are...

487
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,440
eight months later, and
sarabeth has no idea.

488
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,940
When you s--when you spend
your life with someone and--

489
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,930
and you have kids together,

490
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,390
you think it'll always be this
amazing and this wonderful.

491
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,730
You think--you think that you'll
always feel that kind of love,

492
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,690
and--and--and
I do, I...

493
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,060
I do love phil.

494
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,710
I just...

495
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,840
just what?

496
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:00,430
Well, little pieces of
you get chipped away...

497
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,630
by another person, and...

498
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:09,830
then you shave little pieces of yourself
away so that you'll fit together and...

499
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,580
then one day, you look up...

500
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:16,530
and you don't even know who you are.

501
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,100
I better get back to my husband.

502
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,930
He'll be wondering where I am.

503
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,240
Okay.

504
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,660
That graft is actually holding.

505
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,940
I am impressing even myself.

506
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,030
Shep?

507
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,150
Mm-hmm, almost there.

508
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,530
All right, everybody take a
look at the monitor, please.

509
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,650
Now to elevate the last
of the skull fragments,

510
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,530
I'll need a large, flat
instrument to get under the bone.

511
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,490
A curved number 2 penfield, please.

512
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,800
You know what? Actually, I
want my number 4 penfield.

513
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,750
Oh, that's interesting.

514
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,290
Why did you want to use the
number 4 penfield instead?

515
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,110
I'm sorry.

516
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,780
Oh, well, how would you explain it?

517
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,910
I'm observing your teaching
style. Hope you don't mind.

518
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,760
So the penfield-- you
changed it because?

519
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,710
I changed my mind.

520
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,610
Is that a problem, rose?

521
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,900
Not at all, Dr. Shepherd.

522
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,550
You changed your mind. Got it.

523
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,510
Dr. Shepherd, uh, I've got a guy
with a high level spinal injury.

524
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,820
I've, uh, started him on steroids, but
I believe he needs to be decompressed.

525
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,260
- Are you almost done here?
- Yeah, I'm done right now.

526
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,450
Can you close up for me?

527
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,610
So we consider him
a good teacher, right?

528
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,690
I'm just checking.

529
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,500
The spine's crushed from c6
to t1, impinging on the cord.

530
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,630
Yeah, we need to go in and try and
relieve the pressure on the spinal cord.

531
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,130
- But with this kind of injury--
people don't want again.

532
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,430
Phil, you don't know that.

533
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,010
Anna, sweetheart...

534
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,040
it's okay.

535
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,490
You have to be able to do something.

536
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,710
Phil's very strong, and
he--he has grandkids.

537
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,580
You--you have
to do something.

538
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,150
- You could freeze him... -you
shouldn't be in here. I'm so--

539
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,740
if you want him to have
a shot at walking again.

540
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,090
Who the hell are you?

541
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,960
Army surgeon badass, did something
crazy with a pen on a guy's throat.

542
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,770
Well, I would appreciate it if you didn't
give my patient and his wife false hope.

543
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,880
Until you've exhausted all the
options, it's not false, it's just hope.

544
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,830
Maybe you should keep
current on your research.

545
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:29,880
They did, uh, make a football player walk at
buffalo gen, using therapeutic hypothermia.

546
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,370
Buffalo gen's patient was 20
years old, in prime cardiac fitness.

547
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,230
My patient is in his 60s and
is a very risky candidate.

548
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,390
I would prefer he live
to see his grandchildren.

549
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,470
Dr. Torres,book an O.R.

550
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,110
And please tell this patient that this procedure
is not an option, despite uncle sam's assessment.

551
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,620
We're closing up your leg now.

552
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,170
Michael calive after they
put a pen in his throat?

553
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,320
Oh, yes, ma'am. The emergency
trach helped him breathe.

554
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,040
Dr. Sloan needs to get
him to the O. R. To sta-

555
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,010
- surgery? He needs surgery?

556
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,050
Uh, when your husband was
pinned underneath the car,

557
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:15,660
he suffered a laceration to his windpipe, which
Dr. Sloan needs to fix to stabilize his airway.

558
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:21,560
He also has some bruising around
his kidney and a lac on his liver.

559
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,990
Will he need surgery for th?

560
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,250
There's a chance the abdominal
injuries will heal on their own,

561
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,050
but if it ts
worse, yes, will need surgery.

562
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,700
Two surgeries?

563
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,430
I can't believe this is happening.

564
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,190
- Hold on. This--this is
today? -Tonight, midnight.

565
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,240
Um, ma'am,
there's also one other matter.

566
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,620
More? There's more?

567
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,980
Um, just according to billing, your
insurance expires at midnight.

568
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,610
So we're gonna treat you, of course, but
just to make it easier on you later,

569
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,410
is there another card or
another insurance policy?

570
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,260
My husband, he--he takes
care of these things.

571
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,640
Uh, okay.

572
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,350
Okay.

573
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,840
I'm gonna
numb--wow.

574
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,580
Uh, you're not numbed.

575
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,720
So?

576
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,720
S--ow!

577
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,340
S--uh, ow.

578
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,710
Can't get an angle on these.
Could you?

579
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,350
OkaY.

580
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,090
thank you.

581
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,190
Don't mention it.

582
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,600
Can I ask you something?

583
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,030
Uh, w-what?

584
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,950
Um, him, actually.

585
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,570
Oh, um, yeah, sure. I've got surgery.

586
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,360
And, uh, poke yourself.

587
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,080
Talk to me about the freezing thing.

588
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,220
Betty kenner, closed head
injury from the limo wreck.

589
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,380
Subdural hematoma.

590
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,640
Which is why she has memory loss.

591
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,680
Yeah. Might ease up once
we relieve the pressure.

592
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,520
Book an O.R.

593
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,520
I'll go in on her once i
finish up on anna's husband.

594
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,710
Busy O.R. Today.

595
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,410
But that's kinda your thing, right?

596
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,220
Juggling more than
one person at a time.

597
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,270
How's betty's husband doing?

598
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,680
Oh, I'm scrubbing in on him now.

599
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,200
Shepherd did what he could, but the
chief and hahn are still working on him.

600
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,060
He is an ugly, ugly mess.

601
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,170
Sarabeth's husband may need another
surgery after derek's done with him.

602
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,230
These poor women.

603
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,660
Well, anna-- the
one with the cuts--

604
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,800
is married to the
guy on derek's table

605
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,780
and she is sleeping with sarabeth's
husband, the one sloan's working on.

606
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,740
- You're kidding.
- No. Don't tell betty.

607
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,230
She wouldn't remember even if I did.

608
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,150
You mean, that's what happens?

609
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,540
You're married 40 years and then
you become a big, fat lying cheater?

610
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,010
I mean, if 40 years doesn't
make you committed, what does?

611
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,560
What's the point?

612
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,330
- if I move in with
derek-- okay, you know what?

613
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,550
I'll give you 100 bucks if
you talk about something else.

614
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,470
It's not about the years, it's about
the man, and derek is a good man.

615
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,880
Oh, well, I'm outta here.

616
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,380
There are a lot of
really good men, you know?

617
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,730
George is a really good guy.
I mean, he...

618
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,010
nope. Sloan is not.

619
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,860
Alex. Yeah.

620
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,980
Alex has turned
into a very good man.

621
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,760
- You and alex...
- no.

622
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,200
I'm making a point.

623
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:40,330
But it is nice, you know, that
we're friends, and he's changed.

624
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,980
He's actually opening up to me.

625
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,250
So do you think if you moved
in and got married, in 40 years,

626
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,650
you'd feel dead inside
enough to cheat on him?

627
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,400
Yang, major hunt all taken care of?

628
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,760
Uh, I did my best, sir.

629
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,620
Okay, come put some pressure
on this bleeder for me.

630
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,940
You know what I think?

631
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,140
I think that number 12
ranking was a mistake.

632
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:06,330
I think it was a clerical error, and I'm gonna start
making calls about it as soon as I get out of this surgery.

633
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,520
So I've been observing
teaching styles.

634
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,850
Shepherd likes to teach
by thinking out loud.

635
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,680
Bailey is blunt and direct and
doesn't over teach, and sloan...

636
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,380
well, sloan just likes
to berate and humiliate.

637
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,240
I think if you really want
to learn about teaching,

638
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,300
you should talk to your
students, fi out how they learn best.

639
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,170
Yang?

640
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:34,110
- Oh, that's not necessary, sir.
- Are you serious about this or not, Dr. Hahn?

641
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,530
Fine.

642
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,930
Go.

643
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,520
Uh, for me, personally, I learn
better when I'm asked questions.

644
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,590
The socratic method.

645
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,110
Well, that's the cornerstone of medical
teaching. It's what we do in rounds.

646
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,340
Well, not everyone does it.

647
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,980
Some people...

648
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,220
Simply tell you what to do.

649
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,050
Who? Are you talking about me?

650
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,140
He's crashing.
Get me an aortic clamp.

651
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,080
I can't get a handle on
this bleeding in his liver.

652
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,250
We may just have to start
doing damage control soon.

653
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,620
I see a tear in the renal artery.

654
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,590
Yang, are you familiar, with the
single-layer continuous closure?

655
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,550
Yes, sir. Of course.

656
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,940
All right,B.P.'S still dropping.

657
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,160
Okay, max out on levophed
and keep pushing the blood.

658
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,360
Get in there and stitch, yang.

659
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,970
There's a problem
with the insurance.

660
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,690
As we explained,
he can't talk right now.

661
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:38,230
I know, but, michael, I-I called
them and the credit card company,

662
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,660
and--and they
said that...

663
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,270
the cards have been canceled.

664
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,380
I... I don't understand.

665
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,860
I... I just need to know what to do.

666
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,250
I don't know what to do.

667
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,580
I'm sorry. I'm--I'm really sorry, but
we need to get him to DR. Sloan now.

668
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,210
Is there something I can do?

669
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,220
Someone I can call?

670
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,510
I... I don'T.

671
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,330
I don't handle the money, but I...

672
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,240
if you can just tell me...

673
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,020
who to call...

674
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,500
I'll talk to billing
and see what I can do.

675
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,220
Thank you.

676
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,010
It's stuck.

677
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,070
I can't seem to get
down the left bronchus.

678
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,470
Y-you almost got it, george.

679
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,710
What are you, his little cheerleader?

680
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,920
Step aside, wonder boy, before
you make things worse.

681
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,390
O'malley, go find out
if the O. R. Is ready...

682
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,350
if you can manage that.

683
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:15,040
You're a little mean to
george, un-unnecessarily mean.

684
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,240
And he's studying to retake his intern
test, so he's a little stressed out,

685
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,540
so I was just thinking
maybe you could be nicer.

686
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,860
You're an intern.

687
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,880
Why are you talking to me?

688
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:31,340
Y--well, you're my half sister's
boyfriend's best friend, so I...

689
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,130
you thought that makes us friends?

690
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,830
You thought that you'd defend your
boyfriend to me, and I'd just take it?

691
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,710
He's not my boyfriend.

692
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,380
But you want him to be.

693
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,500
- I do not.
- Do too.

694
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,130
- Do too.
- Do too.

695
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,600
- Does he know?
- Shut up.

696
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,780
I'm your attending. You
can't tell me to shut up.

697
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,660
You want me to be nicer to o'malley?

698
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,640
Please.

699
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,340
Confess your love to
him, and I'll think about it.

700
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,980
Shut up.

701
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,440
You know anything
about health insurance?

702
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,330
No. Why?

703
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,080
Well, I'm trying
to help out a patient.

704
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,170
Oh, the softer side of alex.

705
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,740
Izzie was right.

706
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,030
What's that supposed to mean?

707
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,700
- Nothing.
- What did izzie say to you?

708
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,560
She said you were a good man.

709
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,430
She said you changed.

710
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,860
It was nothing.

711
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,520
Did she say that I cried?

712
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,870
'Cause that is a lie.

713
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,430
- No, she didn't say that.
- She should just keep her mouth shut.

714
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,460
Alex, I made a stupid joke.

715
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,540
She didn't mean anything.

716
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,990
Yang, how you doing?

717
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,950
It's, um... I can't get it.

718
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,390
It's--it's
not holding.

719
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,830
- It's tearing. I--
damn it, yang. Move.

720
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,450
I thought you said
you'd done this stitch.

721
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,650
I have, a hundred times.

722
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,120
- On hearts.
- hearts.

723
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,580
Your forceps were
macerating the tissue.

724
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,070
You were handling the bowel
incorrectly, which you would ow

725
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:53,010
if you weren't allowed to clock
so many hours in cardiothoracics.

726
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,840
At the expense of your
general surgery knowledge

727
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,880
crap. His vocal cords are
damaged beyond repair.

728
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,300
Is there anything we can do?

729
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,319
He probably won't talk again.

730
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,540
I think that question was for me.

731
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,440
Sorry.

732
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,150
You think just 'cause you get to take your intern
test again, that makes you big man on campus?

733
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,350
Doesn't chan the fact you
failed it the first time.

734
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,860
- DR. Sloan.
- I'm sorry, grey.

735
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,390
Was there something you
wanted to say to anyone here?

736
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,770
No, there wasn'T.

737
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,170
- Coward.-
Shut up.- Lexie!

738
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,410
Pressure's dropping.

739
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:31,910
It looks like v-fiB.

740
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,660
20 joules.

741
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,960
Clear.

742
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,470
Give me another unit of packed
cells, as many as it takes.

743
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,120
*****

744
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,960
Somebody get me some F.F.P.

745
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,790
Suction, pleasE. Suction!

746
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,600
Too much blood.

747
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,380
There's too much blood.

748
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,150
We're losing him.

749
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,120
What's going on?

750
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,710
Am I in a hospital?

751
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:05,870
There was an accident, but
you're going to be fine.

752
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,540
We're all going to be fine.

753
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,150
I was able to repair your husband's vertebrae
and relieve the pressure from his spine.

754
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,890
But, uh... it...

755
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,160
he--he's still
paralyzed?

756
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,780
Yes, I'm sorry.

757
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,100
Oh, god.

758
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,930
Oh, phil.

759
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,160
And--and--and
michael.

760
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,840
What--what
about michael?

761
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,650
I repaired his trachea.

762
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,690
But unfortunately, his vocal cords were
completely severed in the accident.

763
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,420
He can't talk?

764
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,430
He'll never be able to talk again?

765
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,150
We have to be strong.

766
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,280
We have to be strong for
phil and--and for michael.

767
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,650
I'll be ready for betty in
O. R. One when you're done here.

768
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,820
Is it vincent?

769
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,270
Tell mewhat's happened, please.

770
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,160
Vincent came through the surgery.

771
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,120
He's stable but still critical.

772
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,340
Oh, my god.

773
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,600
This is DR. Yang.

774
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,990
She is going to be personally responsible for seeing
to it that your husband makes it through the night.

775
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,280
I'M...

776
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,180
I will keep you posted.

777
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,110
Keep me posted... about what?

778
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,570
Where am I?

779
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,960
Where's vincent?

780
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,710
She has a subdural hematoma.

781
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,940
Her memory resets every 30 seconds.

782
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,770
Perfect.

783
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,720
That's for you. Thank you.

784
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,420
Rose.

785
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,110
Please look at me.

786
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:15,240
If you're gonna behave like
this,you can't be in my O.R.

787
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,380
okay, there's no
good way to say this.

788
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,710
I'veeen acting this
way because I'M...

789
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,230
I'm carrying your child, derek.

790
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,910
Gotcha.

791
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,860
This is your idea of a joke?

792
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,010
Oh, please.

793
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,030
You deserve it.

794
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,480
Who do you think you are?

795
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,190
If you're gonna keep behaving
this way,you can't be in my O.R.

796
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,610
you should transfer to
a different specialty.

797
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:54,160
You should transr to
a different specialty.

798
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,980
I'm a neurosurgeon.

799
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,630
You shoulda thought of that while repeatedly
assuring me that you were over your ex.

800
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,240
I'll see you in the O.R.

801
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,670
I'm not going anywhere.

802
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:16,200
Chief, about phillip
loomis, shepherd's spinal patient?

803
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,310
Um, I was thinking...

804
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,280
what about therapeutic hypothermia?

805
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,240
You want to freeze a spinal injury?

806
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:31,370
They did it in buffalo, and mass gen had success
with it, too, and major hunt-- he swears by it.

807
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,190
What does shepherd think?

808
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,110
He thinks it's too risky in mr. Loomis'
case,that he's not as fit,is older.

809
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,400
Loomis isn't much older than me.

810
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,130
I can do the procedure, chief.

811
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,260
I just need your okay.

812
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,180
What were you doing back there?

813
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,800
I was trying to help you.

814
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,690
Telling an attending to shut up
in his O. r-- That's not helping.

815
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,480
What makes you think
you can get away...

816
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,240
you're sleeping with him?

817
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,760
- What?No.
- Yes, you are.

818
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,200
- You-- why would
you even say that?

819
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,540
Wait, are you jealous?

820
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,540
Of the fact that you can
tell sloan to shut up?

821
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,630
Yeah.

822
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,090
But, you know, he's right.

823
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,370
I'm the hospital joke,
and it's my fault.

824
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,670
I'm the one who failed my intern exam and
got married in vegas and cheated on my wife.

825
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,020
No. You don't understand.

826
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,590
- The only reason that he was picking
on you is-- no, it doesn't matter.

827
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,050
I can take care of myself.

828
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,620
So-- and he's got fishing gear
and boots and hair products.

829
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,280
I don't have room
for any of that stuff.

830
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,100
And he talks, and not a little.

831
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,060
I mean, he chats He's
chatty freakin' cathy..

832
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,400
Not right now.

833
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,880
And then you know what's gonna
happen after he moves in, don't you?

834
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,370
We build a house on his land, which will
be our land because we'll be married,

835
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,680
and then I'll be DR. Mrs. Shepherd.

836
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,550
And you know what comes
after that, don't you?

837
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:51,450
Babies, and they'll be hisabies, so they'll
have perfect hair and they'll be chatty.

838
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:56,570
So I'll have five chatty children, a chatty
husband and live in a house in the wilderness.

839
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,780
And then I'll start
sleeping with your husband.

840
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,630
I gotta tell him I changed my mind.

841
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,840
- Don't you think?
- Meredith!

842
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,690
What?

843
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,350
- Why are you making that face?
- Shut up.

844
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,140
You know, just shut up about derek.

845
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,030
Shut up about moving in with derek.

846
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,240
Shut up about your relationship
because you want to know why?

847
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,710
I've heard it all before.

848
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,980
Yeah, you know, you guys get
together, and I have to listen to it,

849
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,300
and then you guys break
up, and I have to listen to it.

850
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,210
I almost killed a
man in surgery today.

851
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,790
I...

852
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,160
okay, you want--you want
to know what I think?

853
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,270
Okay, you--you
really want to know?

854
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,740
You and derek will not work.

855
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,180
Moving in together is a
mistake of massive proportions.

856
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:39,980
You are dreaming of dead derek, which
should tell you it will not work!

857
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,160
- Cristina, I--
no no you know

858
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,720
this whole thing, this happily
ever after does not exist.

859
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:50,290
So please, please, please, as you weigh
your options here, just, you know,

860
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:55,700
consider the possibility of shutting the
hell up, because I can't listen to it anymore.

861
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,130
- I--
no.

862
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,130
- Okay--
no!

863
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,890
- I-- okay, that's
it. I'm done.

864
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,720
I'm not gonna say you deserved
that, but you deserved that.

865
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,620
Oh, thanks.

866
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,030
Oh, help me... help me up.

867
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,320
Don't move.

868
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,480
I'm gonna go get some help.

869
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,520
What are you doing?

870
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,820
Eating cereal.

871
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
I got us a chicken for dinner.

872
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,760
Chicken.

873
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,230
Seriously?

874
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,230
You're not gonna be hungry now.

875
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,480
Oh, you're doing it all
wrong again, as usual.

876
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,030
I'm not. I'm cutting
from the mediastinum out.

877
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,340
You can't even see the
mediastinum without your glasses.

878
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,390
Damn it. Where are my glasses?

879
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,910
Okay.

880
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,390
No, put it down.

881
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,090
Down.

882
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,120
Right here.

883
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,020
Mm. Right here.

884
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,450
Move.

885
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,390
What would I do without you?

886
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,820
Starve.

887
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,920
A damsel in distress.

888
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,180
Put her on a monitor. Order
a portable chest.

889
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,130
I'm gonna cut your top off.

890
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,160
It's between my ninth and
tenth intercostal spaces.

891
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,100
There's no hemo or pneumothorax.

892
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,780
My vitals are stable.
Just pull it out.

893
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,780
- I wouldn'T.
- Mind your own business.

894
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,810
Who is this guy?

895
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,110
Get this thing out of me.

896
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,650
I already screwed up in
front of the chief today once.

897
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,020
I can'T...

898
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,320
I mess up a suture, and now he's
looking at me like I'm number 12.

899
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,380
Mer, please. No one gets
to see me like this, okay?

900
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,690
Yang... what the hell happened?

901
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,920
- Get her on a monitor and order a portable chest.
- I did.

902
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,380
- Did you check her
respiratory function-- I did.

903
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,730
See?

904
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,740
- Breath sounds clear and equal.
- You be quiet.

905
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,810
Grey, what would you advise
as a course of treatment?

906
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:34,410
I think we should leave it in until we
get the chest x-ray and the C. T. Back.

907
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,700
I'm fine.

908
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,940
But what about infection?This thing is
definitely melting dirty roof water into her body.

909
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,240
Which is why we should pull it out.

910
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,330
Leave it right where it is.

911
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,520
You get stabbed in the chest and
you're lucky enough totill be breathing,

912
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:47,070
you leave the knife in, at least until
you figure out what's going on inside.

913
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:47,930
Leave it in.

914
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,140
- Take it out.
- Leave it in.

915
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,550
In the meantime, since you know so much, you
can teach your interns how to treat you.

916
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,450
This is a good opportunityto
get back to the basics.

917
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,340
But I need to check
on vincent kenner.

918
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,340
Grey, vincent kenner is
your responsibility now.

919
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,670
But bear in mind, he is my patient, and I'm
not about to lose another trauma case todaY.

920
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,430
Keep that man alive.

921
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,570
Can I get a word with you, DR. Hunt?

922
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,620
You think you'll be
able to resto her memory?

923
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,490
Well, I was able to suction the
blood and remove the pressure.

924
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,260
I'm hopeful.
Not certain, but hopeful.

925
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:18,320
15-blade, please.

926
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,540
Something wrong, DR. Shepherd?

927
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,890
Oh, my god.

928
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,450
DR. Hahn asked me
about teaching before.

929
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,240
Here's a tip--when you hand a surgeon
a 15-blade, make sure it's handle first.

930
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,750
Suction the bleeders while I
clean this up and get a new glove.

931
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,570
He's really gonna be okay?

932
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,140
Except for his voice.

933
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,040
His abdomen's
definitely more tender.

934
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,870
He needs another c. T

935
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,770
Michael, the insurance, it's--it's
a mistake, right?

936
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,050
It's gotta be a mistake.

937
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:57,640
Look, write down a name and number, and I'll
fix it, and everytng will be fine, right?

938
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,130
Everything's gonna be fine?

939
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,250
Uh, maybe later would be better.

940
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,020
S-sarabeth.

941
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,510
Come on, honey.

942
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,510
What's going on?

943
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,990
We're going ahead with the freezing.

944
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,620
Without my consent?

945
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,490
No, I don't think so.

946
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,940
You really want to be the doctor who
doesn't give his all to keep a man

947
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,660
from being wheelchair-bound
for the rest of his life?

948
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:39,850
Get out of my patient's room!

949
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,430
I don't take orders from civilians.

950
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,400
- Listen, you
arrogant, little-- shepherd.

951
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,380
Okay, right now this
patient is stable.

952
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,390
He may never walk again, but if you try this, he could
throw a clot, go into organ failure, and he could die.

953
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:52,820
We're going ahead with the freezing.

954
00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:00,680
Ever since this morning, you've been pissing on anything
with a pulse trying to prove you're not number 12,

955
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,200
and you're not.

956
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:07,010
But right now, with this
decision, you act like number 12.

957
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:09,910
Good luck with the patient,
DR. Torres.

958
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:22,220
You know, the chief is under the spell
of some insane man in camouflage.

959
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,860
He saved my patient's life.

960
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,910
He'll never talk
again, but still, life saved.

961
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,470
What happened to your hand?

962
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,360
Ah, scalpel.

963
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,760
Rose.

964
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:32,890
Not intentional.

965
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,140
She's a dead mouse
on the kitchen floor.

966
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,100
At some point, you gotta
pick it up and throw it away.

967
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,950
Want me to take a look at that?

968
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:40,930
Mer's gonna take care of it.

969
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,490
I'm a renowned plastic
surgeon. Grey's a resident.

970
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,610
She gives me sex, especially
when I'm wounded.

971
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,450
Is this positioned right?

972
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,490
If I'm getting a mammogram.

973
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,160
Lower, to the right.

974
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,940
Two, what are you doing?

975
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,970
Uh, draping so your parts are safe.

976
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,610
Get away from my parts.

977
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,630
Oh, gentle, gentle, gentle.

978
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,220
How are you doing?

979
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,280
Please take my films,'cause
my interns are idiots.

980
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,060
How's mr. Kenner?

981
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,210
- Well, he's stable, but--
you cannot let him die.

982
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,680
I'm doing my best. Hold still.

983
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,820
I am. Just shoot it.

984
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:20,130
Hold still because I want
to ask you a question.

985
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:22,090
What?

986
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,710
Did you mean what you
said about me and derek?

987
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,090
Oh, well, this is not fair.

988
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,670
- I'm impaled a-- I know
I talk about it too much,

989
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,040
and I know I've gone soft
and gooey and disgusting.

990
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:33,660
And if I had to listen
to it, I'd puke, too.

991
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,900
But you said what you said because you
were mad, right, not because you meant it?

992
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,730
Can you just--
just take my x-ray?

993
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,810
And--and it doesn't
matter what I say.

994
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,750
Of course it matters what you say!

995
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,530
Of course it matters.

996
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,350
You
stop--oh!

997
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,370
Stop taking my picture
and take my picture!

998
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,260
Anna.

999
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,010
Are you feeling okay?

1000
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,630
Her world is about to fall
apart, and she has no idea.

1001
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,530
It's all my fault.

1002
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:38,170
What should I do?

1003
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:42,440
I know I'm a terrible
person, but what should I do?

1004
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,460
She should hear it from you.

1005
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:53,680
You're her best friend, even if it's
the most terrible thing in the world,

1006
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,640
you should tell her.

1007
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:04,120
Callie's gonna freeze her
patient. You want to go check it out?

1008
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,960
Hello?Alex?

1009
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,200
Why are you ignoring me?

1010
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:14,160
I'm hoping if I wait long enough, you'll be as annoyed
by the sound of your voice as I am and just shut up.

1011
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,950
Okay.

1012
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,390
Did I do something?

1013
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,120
- You know what you did.
- No, I don'T.

1014
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,790
Alex, just tell me. What
did I do?I thought that--

1015
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,260
just shut up. I had a bad
night and I cried like a girl.

1016
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,830
I'm over it.
You need to get over it, too.

1017
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:42,610
That chill you'll feel is the cold saline rushing
through your veins to lower your core body temperature.

1018
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,760
And if it works, I walk?

1019
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:49,140
If it works, the
hope is that you walk.

1020
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:52,450
Okay, uh...

1021
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,550
I'm--I'm
getting cold.

1022
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,160
He's temp's still 96.8

1023
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,370
chief. Shall we lay another
cooling blanket on him?

1024
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,530
That's up to you, DR. Torres.

1025
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,750
You're taking point.

1026
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,210
That's what the chief of a
number one teaching hospital does.

1027
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:06,690
He handpicks talented surgeons
and lets them take point.

1028
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,760
Right, DR. Bailey?

1029
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,090
Couldn't agree more, chief.

1030
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,190
Warm and toasty, that's
what I'm feeling.

1031
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:14,570
His pulse is falling.

1032
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,100
- Are you sure--
yeah, down to 52.

1033
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,150
Yeah, it's normal
for his pulse to fall.

1034
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:19,910
Okay, h-how much longer we got?

1035
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,230
Not too much longer, okay?

1036
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,410
You're doing great.

1037
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,060
Keep thinking warm and toasty.

1038
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,700
Okay. I'm trying.

1039
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,150
Good.

1040
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,830
Number 12, my ass.

1041
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:34,170
You want to hear how I cut my hand?

1042
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,900
It's a good story.

1043
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,080
I am not sure moving in
together is a good idea.

1044
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,260
Okay.

1045
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:42,690
Fine.

1046
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:43,910
Fine?

1047
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,660
What does that mean?

1048
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,700
It means that I know you.

1049
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:47,850
So what, you didn't believe that I would
let you move in in the first place?

1050
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,260
I believe that you believe it.

1051
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:53,670
Look, I'm gonna move very slowly--
baby steps, no sudden moves.

1052
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:55,070
You're like a deerin the woods.

1053
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,090
Okay, I built the house of candles.

1054
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,690
That is unprecedented in
the meredith chronicles.

1055
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,040
Fine. Let's move in together.

1056
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:01,890
Fine.

1057
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,570
Unless, of course, you just want
to go ahead and get married.

1058
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,080
You want to know
where I learned that?

1059
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,560
Goes with the story
of how I cut my hand.

1060
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:13,390
What did you say to alex?

1061
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,760
I-I didn't say anything.

1062
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:20,430
I just s-said that I think it's
nice that you two are friendly again.

1063
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,280
Oh, damn it, meredith. Why can't
you just mind your own business?

1064
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,870
You know what?Forget it. I should
never have told you anything.

1065
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,560
You can't keep anything to
yourself unless it's for cristina.

1066
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,290
Izzie!

1067
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:32,400
Marriage?

1068
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,100
Not funny.

1069
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,170
DR. Bailey.

1070
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:41,970
Yeah.

1071
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:43,930
Michael briar's
abdomen is more tender.

1072
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,130
Now I-I know I'm
supposed to get a C.T.

1073
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,870
, But if we start the surgery
after midnight, he's not covered.

1074
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,660
We're basically bankrupting him.

1075
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:52,090
I say we skip the C.T.

1076
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:54,780
Oh, you s--you say?No, you
don't say. You ask.

1077
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,400
And the answer is, we don't
skimp on medicine to save money.

1078
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,980
Gethe C.T.

1079
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,160
phillip, you're doing great. I'm
giving you more sedative

1080
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,500
and a paralytic to stop
your shivering, okay?

1081
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,150
Okay, okay.

1082
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,259
Okay, we'll need to intubate,
bailey.

1083
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,990
All right, coming down.

1084
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,720
One, two and three and down.

1085
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,690
He's down to 90 degrees.

1086
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:21,350
I think that's, um, too low.

1087
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,880
I-is that too low?

1088
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,630
You did all the research.

1089
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,270
I think it's too low.

1090
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:28,910
Oh, my god.

1091
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,880
Okay, so what now?

1092
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,460
Is this gonna resolve?

1093
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,990
Do they recommend
lido or amiodarone?

1094
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,500
DR. Torres?

1095
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,970
Uh, DR. Torres?

1096
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,540
He's barely got a pulse.

1097
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,370
Uh,uh,should we do C.P.R.?

1098
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:50,580
No, he-- let's t-try to avoid jostling
shepherd's spinal decompression

1099
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,830
unless absolutely necessary.

1100
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,300
Oh, crap. Crap.

1101
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:57,690
His heart is likely to stop, soon.

1102
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,560
What are you gonna do, DR. Torres?

1103
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,890
I don't know.

1104
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,560
I-I don't know.

1105
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,360
How is he?

1106
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:13,700
We've given him medication
to keep his blood pressure up,

1107
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:17,010
but betty's husband's not as
stable as we'd like him to be.

1108
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,550
They're freezing phillip...

1109
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,560
freezing him...

1110
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,770
to try to help him walk again.

1111
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:42,380
I don'T... they explained
it to me very well.

1112
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:49,690
And betty's having surgery on her brain, and
poor vincent here is barely hanging on...

1113
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:52,240
- and michael...
- it's all right.

1114
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,140
We'll survive.

1115
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,910
We always do.

1116
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:02,990
I wish he would just look at me.

1117
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:07,310
Sarabeth...

1118
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,550
michael lost his job eight mohs ago.

1119
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,180
What?

1120
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,900
The firm let him go.

1121
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:22,390
He just...

1122
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:24,190
he couldn't bring
himself to tell you.

1123
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,620
He--he just felt
like such a failure.

1124
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:33,600
Why--I don't-- wh-why do
you-- how do you know this?

1125
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,950
He told you.

1126
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,000
He told you.

1127
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,500
Sarabeth...

1128
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:54,440
anna...

1129
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,740
have you been sleeping
with my husband?

1130
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,590
- I'm s-- he's in
v-fib. Code blue!

1131
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,180
Get them out of here, please.

1132
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,900
What-- push one of
epi, one of atropine.

1133
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,360
You started him on ecmo?

1134
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:21,080
You're taking out all his
blood and replacing it?

1135
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,830
It was the only thing to do,
DR. Hahn.

1136
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:25,680
We don't want to jostle his spine, and
this will give his heart some rest.

1137
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,230
Now we need you to monitor
him until we get him back on.

1138
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,130
Now are you in or not?

1139
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,640
I sent michael down for the C.T.

1140
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:53,060
I was hoping we could, uh, start the
surgery, get him in under the wire,

1141
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,470
but it's almost midnight, so...

1142
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:00,020
it doesn't matter.
I don't care. I don'T.

1143
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:05,220
Do you--do you know anything
about betty's husband?he...

1144
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:06,860
I-I think he was dying.

1145
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:09,320
Do you-- have you
heard anything?

1146
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,860
No. I-I can find out.

1147
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,420
Why do men cheat?

1148
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,700
My husband slept with my friend.

1149
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:24,730
He lost his job, and then he slept with my
friend, all the while telling me he loves me.

1150
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:28,220
Why?

1151
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,940
Maybe he was low.

1152
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:39,970
He was down, and he didn't want you
to see him like that, in pain, weak...

1153
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,990
as less than a man.

1154
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,820
He has his pride,
so, uh, he turned away.

1155
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,730
It's not right, but it...

1156
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,910
it doesn't mean he
doesn't care about you.

1157
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,930
I swear it doesn'T.

1158
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:11,430
All right, we all ready to wean?

1159
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:12,960
Let's do it.

1160
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:26,230
It looks like he's tachycardic.

1161
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,750
Should we shock him,
give him adenosine?

1162
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:31,380
Well, normally I'd say yes, but
this man's an ice cube.

1163
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:35,850
DR. Torres, in any of your research, was there anything
to suggest what to do in a situation like this?

1164
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,280
I don't--I don't--
I mean, um...

1165
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,800
I think I messed up here.

1166
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,420
I mean, I don't know. I
mean, maybe--maybe--maybe

1167
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,790
he would've been fine on his own.

1168
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,070
- Maybe--maybe-- all
right, look at me. Look at me.

1169
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,190
Focus.

1170
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,520
You're trying something new.

1171
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,770
There's nothing wrong with new.

1172
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:53,750
Breaking new ground, pushing the
boundaries, it comes with the job.

1173
00:57:53,810 --> 00:58:01,220
So, DR. Torres, take a breath, stop
panicking and just tell us.

1174
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,690
What did your research say?

1175
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,820
My research showed that...

1176
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,380
that, um...

1177
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,310
arrhythmias can occur
at a certain threshold.

1178
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:20,550
His appear to be between...
uh,91.5 and 92 degrees.

1179
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,830
He around 90 right now.

1180
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,530
Okay, so...

1181
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,870
we could use the ecmo to
help bring him back up.

1182
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:28,960
Yes, but not too quickly, because
that can cause problems of its own.

1183
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,900
All right. Looks like we
have some warming to do.

1184
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,530
What do you see?

1185
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:46,640
Um, it kinda looks like
it's hitting nothing?

1186
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:49,130
It looks like it's hitting nothing?

1187
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,040
Because it's hitting nothing!

1188
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:53,260
So, like, what does
that-- at does that mean?

1189
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:54,640
What do you mean,
what does that mean?

1190
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,630
Don't you know how to read an x-ray?

1191
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:59,460
You--you always
read them.

1192
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,320
Well, get out.

1193
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:02,850
All of you just...

1194
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:05,970
get out and find me
someone with a brain.

1195
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:12,810
Those your interns?

1196
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,970
They seem pretty scared of you.

1197
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,610
I am not scary.

1198
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,920
Uh, what are you doing?

1199
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,090
That's my icicle.

1200
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,590
Yeah.

1201
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,490
Uh, you took out my icicle.

1202
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,170
I didn't give you
permission to do that.

1203
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,920
So?

1204
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:47,140
Cristina.

1205
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,340
He died.

1206
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,080
My patient still alive?

1207
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,640
He's stable.

1208
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:02,200
You let some soldier off the street talk you
into something that could have killed a man.

1209
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,340
He deserved the chance.

1210
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,610
- We have no way of knowing if it helped or hurt.
- He deserved the chance, derek.

1211
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:10,640
He deserved the best, the most
that this hospital could give him.

1212
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:15,150
I've let a lot of things
slide over the past few years.

1213
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:18,780
I've been... soft.

1214
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,280
This was not about you being soft.

1215
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:24,740
Yeah, I think it's the fact that meredith's
here, the fact that ellis' daughter is here.

1216
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,080
Chief.

1217
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,820
Vincent kenner-- we gave him 31
units of blood, fresh frozen plasma

1218
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:37,040
,multiple liters of L.R.

1219
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:38,320
We did everything we knew how to do.

1220
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,520
We just couldn't bring him back.

1221
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,430
You don't know how to do anything...

1222
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,150
none of you.

1223
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,920
You're halfway through your second year of residency, and you walk
around this hospital like it's your god-given right to be here.

1224
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:02,120
Well, it is not, DR. Grey.

1225
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,100
I assure you.

1226
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:07,000
You are here because i allow it.

1227
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,700
You are here to do what I say, and
the one thing I ask you to do-

1228
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:13,120
- you can't even
save-- richard.

1229
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,300
We can't save everybody.

1230
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:22,720
We should try harder.

1231
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,750
We should try harder.

1232
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:37,690
Michael, sarabeth is here.

1233
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:39,080
He's a little tired.

1234
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:41,650
Uh,the C.T. Showed that his
hematoma's getting worse.

1235
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,760
So DR. Bailey and I will be
taking him down to the O.R. Soon.

1236
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,600
But he wrote you, um, this letter.

1237
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:52,250
I'm not interested.

1238
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:54,940
"Sarabeth." Sorry.

1239
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,750
Um, that wasn't me,
that was the letter.

1240
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:58,280
It...

1241
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:59,710
"I-I know you hate me.

1242
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,710
"Um, again, it's not me, it's the
letter. I'll--I'm just gonna read.

1243
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:05,430
Um, I know you hate me right now."

1244
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,290
"And you have every right to.

1245
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,700
"I betrayed you.

1246
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,000
I betrayed our marriage.

1247
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:15,130
"But I had lost my job and I couldn't
tell you,"so I told anna instead,"

1248
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:17,820
which was wrong and stupid.

1249
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:22,340
"And I've wanted to tell you a million times
"and let you know how truly sorry I am,"

1250
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,230
but now I have no voice.

1251
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:29,960
"So I am begging you, please, if you
could justisten with your heart.

1252
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,930
"Oh, that is so poetic.

1253
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,070
That--that was
me, so-- not him. Sorry.

1254
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:39,220
Um, if--if you could just listen with
your heart ""when I tell you that"

1255
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:44,170
I know you can't forgive me right now "but I'm
gonna do everything in my power to make it up to you.

1256
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:48,630
"And no matter what happens,"no
matter what you decide to do

1257
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:52,790
i'm gonna love you
until the end of time.

1258
01:02:58,230 --> 01:02:59,990
"That's it.-I'm done
talk-well, he's done.

1259
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,970
It's the end.

1260
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,800
Betty?

1261
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,100
She's not awake yet, but I
can take you to see her if you'd like.

1262
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,100
- and her memory?
- We don't know yet.

1263
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,800
Oh, no.

1264
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,200
Oh, please don't say it.

1265
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,400
I'm sorry. Vincent.

1266
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:46,200
Oh, god. Oh, god, no, no.

1267
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,900
I'm very sorry.

1268
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,100
- sarabeth.
- no, don't, don'T. Just don'T.

1269
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,500
Sarabeth...

1270
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,200
vincent's dead, and betty...

1271
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:05,700
we don't know if she's gonna be okay,
and-and phillip and michael-

1272
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,600
don't you mention his name to me.

1273
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,500
Sarabeth...

1274
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,500
more bad things have happened to
us today than have ever happened before.

1275
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:19,900
We have been blessed until today.
I took it for granted.

1276
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,400
I took you for granted.

1277
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:28,400
We've been friends for 50 years,
ever since we were little girls.

1278
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:33,100
And I made...
one awful, awful mistake...

1279
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,700
but I need my best friend.

1280
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:39,100
You slept with my husband.

1281
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,200
Please.

1282
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,000
I'm going to go see betty.

1283
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,500
I'm gonna see my friend.

1284
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,800
- I'm sorry about teasing alex.
- I forgive you.

1285
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:12,500
- Tell me about trauma surgery.
- Trauma? Quick and dirty.

1286
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,800
There's no time to make things pretty
and no time for mistakes.

1287
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,900
Drop your pants.
You need a shot of cefazolin I.M.

1288
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,300
No time for mistakes, huh?

1289
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,500
So what, you don't make mistakes?

1290
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,900
I make mistakes and people die.

1291
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,800
I'm the best surgical
resident in my program and...

1292
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,700
today I killed a man
because I couldn't do a stitch.

1293
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,800
In the field, you do what you can,
you work with what you have.

1294
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:50,700
It's about something. It's not about
being the best. It's about saving lives.

1295
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,800
I make mistakes.
Guys die by my hand, good guys,

1296
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,100
guys who are fighting for
their country in a desert.

1297
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,700
And I don't know everything.
Nobody does.

1298
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,700
So I make mistakes, and I learn.

1299
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,900
And the next time,
I don't make that mistake again.

1300
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
So theext time,
the next guy, that guy, he lives.

1301
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,200
Mistakes are how you learn.

1302
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,500
Hi, betty. How you feeling?

1303
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:40,900
My head... hurts.

1304
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,200
What's going on?

1305
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:50,000
Betty, you and vincent
were in a car accident.

1306
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:55,400
Vincent... I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.
He-he didn't make it, betty.

1307
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,900
No, no, please.

1308
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,900
No. No. He's in the other car. He's
just gonna be here any minute. He'S...

1309
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,100
oh... my head...

1310
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,900
it hurts. What happened?

1311
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,400
Well, you look pretty stable,
which is good,

1312
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:43,000
because I can't let you go into your next surgery
unless you're feeling strong and stable, okay?

1313
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,700
It happens. People make mistakes.

1314
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,600
You know, they sleep with the
wrong person and they hide it.

1315
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:58,400
But if you ask me, it's the part that comes after
that matters, the part where you make it right.

1316
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,100
And I think you're
off to a good start.

1317
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,900
Karev, is michael briar
ready for his ex lap?

1318
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,200
He was ready an hour ago.

1319
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,000
And I'm ready now. Book the O.R.

1320
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,500
Fine.

1321
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:25,100
- DR. Karev, what time is it?
- It's tomorrow.

1322
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,000
His insurance expired.

1323
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,300
I'm sorry about the hand.

1324
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,900
These things happen.

1325
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:45,500
Not to me they don't, or they
didn't before you existed for me.

1326
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,300
Before you existed... I was good.

1327
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:54,600
Every doctor in this hospital wanted me in their
O.R. I was known as a damn good scrub nurse.

1328
01:08:54,900 --> 01:09:00,600
And now I'm the crazy girl out of fatal attraction
" who goes around stabbing surgeons."

1329
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:05,300
Sorry. I'm so... I'm sorry.

1330
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,600
There's an opening in peds.
I start on their service tomorrow.

1331
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:15,600
Again, very sorry about your hand.

1332
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,100
You're never at a loss for
words with your patients.

1333
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,500
Oh, for god sake.

1334
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:35,000
You don't seem to have any trouble letting me know
how you feel, so why not tell o'malley?

1335
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,300
You really are the last person
who should be giving romantic advice.

1336
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,100
When I like somebody,
I make sure they know it.

1337
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,100
Life's too short
to live any other way.

1338
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,700
What if he doesn't like me back?

1339
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,200
Then he's an idiot.

1340
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,800
What'S... what am I doing here?

1341
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,700
Where's vincent?

1342
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,300
Did something happen?

1343
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,800
I can'T. I-I can't tell her anymore.
I-I won'T.

1344
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,600
I know.

1345
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,300
Why don't you two take a break,
check on things?

1346
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,500
- I don't want her to be alone.
- I'll sit with her. I don't mind.

1347
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,800
Sarabeth, anna...

1348
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,900
am i in a hospital?

1349
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:43,900
Oh, honey...
there's been an accident.

1350
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,500
Where's vincent? Is he okay?

1351
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,500
Your husband is on his way.
He'll be here any minute.

1352
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,600
- He's on his way now?
- Yes.

1353
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,100
He's just around the corner, actually,
if you watch the door, you'll see him any minute.

1354
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,900
- you'll see him.
- Good. He'S...

1355
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,400
- he's on his way?
- He's on his way.

1356
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,600
- Around the corner.
- Yes. He's around the corner.

1357
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,200
It's better for her.

1358
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,300
Thank you.

1359
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,200
Come on.
Let's go check on our husbands.

1360
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,800
Karev, I think that clock is wrong.

1361
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:57,600
I know it says 2:30 A.M. But I'm pretty
sure it's actually only 11:58 P.M.

1362
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,100
Can you fix it, please?

1363
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,400
- Set it back?
- Set it back.

1364
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:06,600
It's important that the official
hospital record shows the right time,

1365
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,500
and the insurance
company needs it, too.

1366
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,100
And I say it's only 11:58 P.M...

1367
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,800
ScalpeL

1368
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,200
You know,
you'd be good in the field.

1369
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,800
Now that you got this battle scar,
you'd fit right in.

1370
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:45,000
- oh, ight.
- I'm serious.

1371
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:49,100
You should ditch this place
and go for the adventure.

1372
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,100
You're telling me this place
gives you a rush, a high?

1373
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,600
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

1374
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,300
Oh, DR. Hunt, there you are.

1375
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,400
How's the gash on that leg?

1376
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,900
Uh, DR. Yang took good care of me,
excellent care.

1377
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,200
I made a few calls

1378
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,100
they speak very highly of you
at maryland shock trauma.

1379
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,815
I also heard a story that
you constructed an O.R. Table

1380
01:13:13,915 --> 01:13:16,801
from an exploded humvee
in the middle of the desert. That true?

1381
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,700
Well, you have to be innovative
in the middle of the desert.

1382
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,800
You have to be
innovative everywhere.

1383
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,100
How would you like a job, DR. Hunt?

1384
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:35,000
I appreciate the offer, but I am due to
go back to the sandpit, finish my tour.

1385
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,500
Well... good luck to you.

1386
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,800
Thanks.

1387
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,400
What?

1388
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,600
I- I... I-I don't even know you.

1389
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,200
So?

1390
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,600
Might have been the
hypothermia treatment.

1391
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:42,200
- or my surgical skills.
- Oh, we'll never know.

1392
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,600
What's going on?

1393
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,500
Phillip can wiggle his toes.

1394
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,500
- oh, say it.
- Don't make me say it.

1395
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:56,100
Please say it. Say it for me. Even
though it's technically not true yet.

1396
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,000
We made a man walk.

1397
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:04,000
- we made a man walk.
- We made a man walk.

1398
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,700
What a nice way to wake up.

1399
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,300
Did you sleep with meredith?

1400
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,200
- Yeah, I did.
- Why?

1401
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:52,200
I- I mean. Sor-I...

1402
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,600
were you in love with her?

1403
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,600
I thought I was.

1404
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:02,400
But I was too scared to admit it,
so I... I did know that she...

1405
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,400
did not,
uh, like me that way, and...

1406
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:10,600
I did it anyway, when I sh-I...

1407
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,700
I shouldn't have, because I'M...

1408
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,500
besides just being...

1409
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,600
so selfish, I...

1410
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,800
you know, to take advantage of
her that way and to want her to want me

1411
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:26,300
like that when clearly she d-

1412
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:33,000
like I said, I made a lot of mistakes last year,
but I'm trying to get back on track and...

1413
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:38,600
- you know, I gotta do that by myself, so-
- the only reason I-I... I wanted to help

1414
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:46,000
is because I-I-I feel like you and I
are more than just... roommates.

1415
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,600
We are more than just roommates.

1416
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,400
We are?

1417
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:55,900
Yeah, we're friends. I mean, right now
you're probably one of my best friends.

1418
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,600
Best friends.

1419
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,100
I'm not an experimenter.

1420
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,500
I don't like to experiment.

1421
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,800
But then you showed up,
and we did it together,

1422
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:12,100
and the experiment
was kind of a success.

1423
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:25,300
Look, I've never done this before.
I- I've never kissed a girl.

1424
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,300
I'm not sure I even
like kissing girls.

1425
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,700
I don't,
actually, like kissing girls.

1426
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:36,000
I just... like kissing one girl.

1427
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,400
You.

1428
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:43,800
I don't have anything
to compare it with. I...

1429
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:47,000
you're the only woman
I've ever kissed.

1430
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,900
So you're freaking out, too?

1431
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,600
- A lot of therapy time.
- Yeah, I don't do therapy.

1432
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,200
I just get all "aah!"
And then I get all clingy and...

1433
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:58,500
okaY. You don't
need to know that yet.

1434
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,500
So... does this...
this kinda makes us virgins, doesn't it?

1435
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:09,000
I... guess in a way it does.

1436
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:10,800
Virgins.

1437
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:13,100
Hey, we can be scared together.

1438
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:18,200
Kind of virgins, and, yeah,
we can be scared together.

1439
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,500
- okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

1440
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,100
You said derek and
i would never make it.

1441
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,100
And then I was karmically
impaled for saying it.

1442
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,000
But you're right. I mean, people
don't really have happily ever afters.

1443
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,600
People barely have ever afters.

1444
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:40,800
So why would derek
and i be any different?

1445
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,300
Mer, why do you care what I think?

1446
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,300
Because you're my person.

1447
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:50,900
And if I'm gonna do this with him-

1448
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,400
be whole and healthy and be a warm,
gooey person who lives with a boy, I need you.

1449
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,900
I need you on board.
I need you to cheer me on.

1450
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:04,000
Because you're the
only one who knows me...

1451
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:08,300
darkly, really knows me.

1452
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:12,100
I need you to pretend that I
can do this, even if you don't believe.

1453
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:16,100
Because if you abandon me now,
I will never make it,

1454
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,200
and I'll never get my happy ending,
and then that's just-

1455
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,400
life.

1456
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,800
I'm saying please here.

1457
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:33,000
I think you and derek will make it.
You'll make it work.

1458
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,700
Are you just telling
me what I want to hear?

1459
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,800
I am your person. I'm on your side.

1460
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,500
Once upon a time...

1461
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,800
happily ever after...

1462
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:54,800
the stories we tell
are the stuff of dreams.

1463
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,900
Fairy tales don't come true.

1464
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:25,200
See? I told you I
would show you my dress.

1465
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,200
You look better than a bride.

1466
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,200
Reality is much stormier...

1467
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,700
much murkier...

1468
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,500
much scarier.

1469
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,700
Listen up, people.

1470
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,400
Listen up.

1471
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,400
We used to be the best
surgical program in the west,

1472
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:13,200
an upstart program that no one ever heard of
that blew everyone out the water.

1473
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:20,900
Then overnight, we got old... entrenched
and sloppy, just like everyone else.

1474
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,400
We've been resting on our laurels.

1475
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,500
You have all been failing-
failing to take initiative,

1476
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,600
failing to ask the tough questions,
failing to practice your skills,

1477
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:37,400
failing to give opportunity
to practice skills.

1478
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:40,600
And I let it happen.

1479
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:44,300
So you have not failed.
We have failed.

1480
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:48,300
Well, it stops, and it stops now.

1481
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,000
People sliding over general surgery
as though they will never see anything

1482
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:56,200
but a heart or a brain through
the course of their career,

1483
01:23:56,300 --> 01:24:00,300
as though blood from the heart doesn't
make its way through the whole body

1484
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:04,000
or the nerves don't
travel past the brain stem.

1485
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:08,900
It's shoddy teaching,
and it makes for shoddy surgeons.

1486
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:12,200
We've failed.

1487
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,800
Get it?

1488
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:18,200
We all have, and it stops now.

1489
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:26,200
The surgical training protocol is
officially changing, people.

1490
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,700
The bar has been raised.

1491
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,500
Consider yourself on notice.

1492
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:39,300
Reality- it's so much more interesting
than living happily ever after.
