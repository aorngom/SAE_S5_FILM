1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,570
Previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,200
she cut his lvad wire.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,000
denny duquette dd at 7:42 this evening.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,410
I had a baby and I went soft.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,300
Your hand is fine,and shepherd will clear youor surgery.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,120
Our marriage is over.

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,310
Yeah,I guess it is.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,660
Who am I to you,george?

9
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,810
Am I your girlfriend?

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,290
Am I somebody you mess around with?

11
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,340
Can I buy you a drink,callie?

12
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,480
Only if you have it delivered to my hotel room,because I'm off to bed.

13
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,430
You are a great guy.

14
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,400
So it's derek.

15
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,610
he's gonna hurt you again.

16
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,750
I'm walkin' away.

17
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,420
It's for you.

18
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,750
It's from denny.

19
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,200
first do no harm--

20
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,550
as doctors,we pledge to live by this oath.

21
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,190
But harm happens...

22
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,980
and then guilt happens.

23
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,750
And there's no oath for how to deal with that.

24
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,750
morning.

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,280
I thought we were done with the whole muffin thing.

26
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,770
This isn't muffins.

27
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,780
This is breakfast.

28
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,230
Hmm.

29
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,610
Mer needs a good,solid breakfast.

30
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,700
First day back after the big surgery.

31
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,560
Are you okay?

32
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,370
Of course I'm okay.

33
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,400
I'm a millionaire.

34
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,310
Fruit?

35
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,390
What do you guys think about b&bs?

36
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,850
I'm thinking about opening a b&b in vermont where the foliage is,you know?

37
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,180
Maybe you should go back to bed.

38
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,230
Can'T.

39
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,260
I'm going to the hospital.

40
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,520
Are you gonna go talk to the chief?

41
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,340
Nope.

42
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,250
Going to clean out my locker.

43
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,480
I could buy a hotel.

44
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,090
How much do you think a hotel costs?

45
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,460
Ooh. izzie!

46
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,620
Is that...

47
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,570
that is $8 million.

48
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,300
$8 million does not like to have juice spilled on it.

49
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,910
You have to take that to the bank today.

50
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,540
It's making me nervous in the house.

51
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,210
I will,as sooas I clean out my locker.

52
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,760
I am fine.

53
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,230
Really,I am fine.

54
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,770
Denny loved me.

55
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,180
He wanted me to have this money.

56
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,860
He wants me to be happy.

57
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,410
So I'm happy.

58
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,200
Juice?

59
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,640
she's losing it.

60
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,830
She almost battered and deep fried an $8 1/2-million check this morning.

61
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,230
That kind of money,I'd buy my own hospital and stock it full of sick people.

62
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,320
Valvuloplasties and ruptured aneurysms...

63
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,490
You're a psycho. You know that,right?

64
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,860
I'm not the one with an $8 1/2-million check I won't cash.

65
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,590
stop talking about me.

66
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,140
I'm fine.

67
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,730
I am cleaning out my locker and I am going home.

68
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,300
Mer is the one with the problems.

69
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,750
What's wrong with me?

70
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,080
Well,now you haven't told mcdreamy that you dumped mcvet.

71
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,290
Oh,you haven't done that yet?

72
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,300
Dude,tell him already.

73
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,320
She's scared.

74
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,870
I am not sred.

75
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,190
Derek walked away.

76
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,190
He walked away.

77
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,540
And maybe that's a good thing.

78
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,950
I mean,maybe he's happier.

79
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,990
Maybe he's moved on.

80
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,820
He's got addison here.

81
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,870
He's got mark here.

82
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,760
He'S... got a lot to deal with.

83
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,560
And I'm not gonna make him feel guilty.

84
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,740
I mean,I am being an adult here.

85
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,980
And I am not going to drag him into our whole...

86
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,910
izzie is the one with the big check.

87
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,420
I'm fine.

88
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,920
Guilt never goes anywhere on its own.

89
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,440
It brings its friends doubt and insecurity.

90
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,860
is that your boyfriend again?

91
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,210
I do not have a boyfriend.

92
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,740
Then why the guilty face?

93
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,560
you were sexier when you weren't talking.

94
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,070
am I keeping you,o'malley?

95
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,500
M&m in 15 minutes,people.

96
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,650
Wait,wait,wait.

97
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,530
We get to go to m&m?

98
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,650
Even if we haven't finished our rounds?

99
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,480
Even if.

100
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,620
I want all of you the m&m today.

101
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,530
Yes!

102
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,310
People die in this hospital on our watch.

103
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,190
Once a month,we meet to discuss how our actions as physicians contributed to the deaths.

104
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,810
This is a serious exercise.

105
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,330
Dr. Bailey.

106
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,420
George,alex,you guys get good seats.

107
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,380
Mer and I will get snacks.

108
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:39,850
Yeah.

109
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,290
Uh,Mr. And mrs. Niles.

110
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,150
We kinda got turned around on our way to admitting.

111
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,260
Oh,oh,not a problem.

112
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,160
Dr. Karev,

113
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,920
uh,mrs Niles is scheduled for a mastectomy tomorrow.

114
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,410
Uh,why don't you show her and her husband up to the fifth floor?

115
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,300
Is this the little man?

116
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,120
he is adorable.

117
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,360
He's not so adorable at 4:00 in the morning when he's screaming and won't take a bottle.

118
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,210
Can we just get to the room?

119
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,850
It's been kind of a rough week.

120
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,830
She had to stop nursing.

121
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,750
Gus here just won't eat.

122
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,170
Here.

123
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,850
Why don't I take you up?

124
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,950
There you go.

125
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,920
Yeah.

126
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:14,210
You know,you can try a little sugar water on the bottle,just until he gets used to it.

127
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,060
Does that woman have breast cancer?

128
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,400
What is she,30 years old?

129
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,700
It's a new baby.

130
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,270
Probably thought the lump was a milk duct.

131
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,550
Hmm?

132
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,140
You learn things on the vagina squad.

133
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,580
Okay,yeah,focus,people.

134
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,530
M&m--

135
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,990
insults flying,residents covering their asses,our bosses getting kicked in the teeth instead of us.

136
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,020
Seats,then snacks.

137
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,680
Hey.

138
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,460
I didn't know you were coming to the m&M.

139
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,920
You brought snacks?

140
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,840
Well... yeah?

141
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,070
You okay?

142
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,290
Fine.

143
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,020
Hey,no surgeries today,right?

144
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,180
I mean,I'm ready if you need me.

145
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,220
No.

146
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,580
No surgeries.

147
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,860
Callie.

148
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,290
Hey.

149
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:04,880
Hi.

150
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,060
Did you get my message--

151
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,090
my messages?

152
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,390
ye.. I gotta get a seat.

153
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,510
Alex is saving us a bunch if you want to sit with us.

154
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,340
No.

155
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,650
She's trying to make me feel guilty about the other night about the izzie thing.

156
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,780
I thought you said you apologized already?

157
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,600
I did.

158
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,170
I have.

159
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,970
I'm done.

160
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,980
I-I am not apologizing anymore.

161
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,130
I'm enjoying life.

162
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,470
I'm loving the m&M.

163
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,090
okay,people,let's begin.

164
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,980
Patient 34986 died last month from complications following a heart transplant.

165
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,960
Dr. Burke will present.

166
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,270
You guys...

167
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,920
isn't patient 34986...

168
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,720
denny.

169
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,560
$8 million...

170
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,770
$8 million could get us on a plane to somewhere far,far away.

171
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,680
Cause of death at autopsy was an embolus that dislodged from the suture line of the transplant

172
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,810
and caused a C.V.A. With brain stem herniation.

173
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,680
So the company line is that he died of a C.V.A.?

174
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,110
There's no company line. That's what he died of.

175
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,510
Uh,yes,let's get back to this,uh,patient's need for an emergent transplant.

176
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,820
You're saying that his left ventricle had been weakened by the lvad malfunction?

177
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,060
his left ventricle was weakened by the fact that he suffered from congestive heart failure.

178
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,510
oh,come on,Dr. Burke.

179
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,990
We all know the lvad was cut by an intern.

180
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,730
Oh,I'm going to my happy place.

181
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,550
The exact chain of events remain unclear.

182
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,550
It remains unclear to you because you're in the E.R.

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,360
With a gunshot wound.

184
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,750
Why aren't we hearing from Dr. Bailey?

185
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,480
She was the senior physician on the case.

186
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,200
I am the attending on record.

187
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,080
Yes...

188
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,450
I was the resident in charge.

189
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,570
Dr. Burke has summarized the medical fas of this case.

190
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,730
Are there any questions for me?

193
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,050
You recently had a baby,Dr. Bailey?

194
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,900
I don't see what that has to do with--

195
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,630
sleep deprivation coupled with wild swings in hormone levels

196
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,670
are factors that could cloud anyone's judgment.

197
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,780
I sleep just fine,Dr. Savoy.

198
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,710
Really?

199
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,740
'Cause if a patient died due to my poor decision making,

200
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,640
I'd probably lose at least a little sleep or it.

201
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,970
Let me remind everyone that our purpose here is not to place blame.

202
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,240
This is a forum to discuss mistakes in patient care and learn from them.

203
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,120
Well,so far,I haven't heard Dr. Bailey admit to a mistake.

204
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,900
Why don't they just put a bullet in the back of her head?

205
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,450
It would be more humane.

206
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,920
so for a period of several hours,your interns were running amok in the hospital,

207
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,190
totally unsupervised.

208
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,530
I'm waiting for a qution.

209
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,050
The question is where re you?

210
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,270
There was the shooting,and the E.R. Was chaotic.

211
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,530
ER Is always chaotic.

212
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,290
Did you page them during this time?

213
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,430
Yes,I paged them multiple times.

214
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,070
Well,apparently,they thought it was okay to ignore your pages.

215
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,220
Doctor,why do you think your interns have such contempt for your authority?

216
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,440
You don't know what the hell you're talking about!

217
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,320
Dr. Karev,sit down.

218
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,780
izzie.

219
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,930
Next question.

220
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,400
Derek says that neither of you brought any assets into the marriage.

221
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,310
Well,I had my trust fund and a sparkling personality...

222
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,190
oh,and the futon couch.

223
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,160
Yes,addison had a very ugly,very heavy futon couch.

224
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,700
What ever happened to that couch?

225
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,130
We gave it to rk.

226
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,000
- She can have him. - I don't want him.

227
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,560
Okay,well,that's settled. What else?

228
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,160
So aside from addison's trust fund,which remains in her name

229
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,660
you'll split everything stocks,bonds,401ks down the middle.

230
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,440
The only that gets a little complicated is the real estate.

231
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,480
Let me make this,uh,simple.

232
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,130
I'd like to keep my trailer and the land in seattle.

233
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,730
Addison can have the rest.

234
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,710
Hold on.

235
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,830
That's the house in the hamptons and the brownstone overlooking central park?

236
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,080
That's very generous,Dr. Shepherd.

237
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:47,250
Thank you.

238
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,360
Hold on.

239
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,790
He's up to something.

240
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,200
No,I'm not.

241
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,720
I came here to fight over cds and books,go to war over a crystal vase.

242
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,680
What are you up to,derek?

243
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,810
The divorce is my fault.

244
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,040
Let me take responsibility.

245
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,170
We both had affairs.

246
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,840
You had a one-night stand with mark.

247
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,250
Derek,actually...

248
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:03,970
well,it was--

249
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,720
oh,okay,it was two nights.

250
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,170
You made a mistake.

251
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,150
Meredith and I,we had a relationship.

252
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,050
Make these changes,and I'll sign it today.

253
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,930
you weren't supposed to be in here,izzie.

254
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,720
You shouldn't have had to see that.

255
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,760
No,it's fine.

256
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm fE.

257
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,990
Clearly the doctor thing was not working for me.

258
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,270
So go about your business.

259
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,500
Run labs,cure cancer.

260
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,340
I'm fine.

261
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,050
You're not going home.

262
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,970
Either you hang out with us or we'll call your mother.

263
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,640
She's just a few hours away,and I'm sure she wouldn't mind coming and staying with you,all day.

264
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:44,970
You wouldn'T.

265
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,320
Dialing.

266
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,490
Whoa. Hey,hey. Okay.

267
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,220
I'll just...

268
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,400
go hang out in the locker room.

269
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,760
what is she doing here?

270
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,370
She has no business in this room.

271
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,390
What are you looking at me for?

272
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,600
I didn have anything to do with this.

273
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,930
I didn't have anything to do with any of this.

274
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,210
I'll stay with her today,if that's okay.

275
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,010
I'll update charts and I'll run labs and just keep an eye on her,if that's okay.

276
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,110
She shouldn't be alone.

277
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,150
fine.

278
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,640
Dr. Bailey...

279
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,420
we just wanna say ,we're really sorry about the m&M.

280
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,540
No,you do not get to apologize to me for this.

281
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,290
You do not get to feel better.

282
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,190
Neither do I.

283
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,270
Get to work.

284
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,000
O'malley,just keep an eye on her.

285
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,970
Yes,Dr. Bailey.

286
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,100
Dr. Bailey,you understand.

287
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,740
It's nothing personal.

288
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,510
People talking about your hormone levels starts feeling pretty personal.

289
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,090
Hey,Dr. Bailey.

290
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,260
Look,you're the baby whisperer.

291
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,700
Gus here drank the whole bottle.

292
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,130
Here,you want to hold him?

293
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,540
Uh,actually now isn't a good time.

294
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,740
I'm about to go and get yourife's labs.

295
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,610
Oh,yeah.

296
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,210
do you,uh,think you could talk to her?

297
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,050
She's kind of freaking out.

298
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,650
She's not too sure about the mastectomy.

299
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,790
She's thinking maybe a lumpectomy.

300
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,580
I know she likes you.

301
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,680
Maybe you could talk her into--

302
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,420
oh,no,no.

303
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,770
It's not my job to talk her into anything.

304
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,360
Maybe if she knew more about her reconstructive options...

305
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,420
um,I'll send our plastic surgeon up.

306
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,230
hey,chief.

307
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,390
You got a minute?

308
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,940
Sure.

309
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,490
That was qui a morning,huh?

310
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,770
It was.

311
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,770
It's always good to be reminded how important it is to be at the top of your game.

312
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,180
That's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.

313
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,620
I am so glad you are back in this building.

314
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,830
I need your help focusing the staff.

315
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,160
They respond to you as an authority figure.

316
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,840
I mean,you're an example of what they should be--

317
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,310
a leader.

318
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,610
I'm glad to have you back,preston.

319
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,360
Thank you,chief.

320
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,300
You're back.

321
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,250
I am.

322
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,320
You look,uh,good without an appendix. It suits you.

323
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,920
How are you?

324
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,030
Fine.

325
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,820
How are you?

326
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,240
I'm great.

327
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:36,740
Feeling well?

328
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,310
No pain?

329
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,780
No pain.

330
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,120
oh.

331
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,790
That's your wife.

332
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,020
I'm on her service.

333
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,230
Oh. Okay,then.

334
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,360
I won't stand in your way.

335
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,120
Okay.

336
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,860
Hi.I was paged by Dr. Montgomery-shepherd.

337
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,480
Dr. Grey.

338
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,320
Welcome back.

339
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,050
Thank you.

340
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,420
And,uh,it's just montgomery now.

341
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,420
What?

342
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,650
My name.

343
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,570
The divorce was finalized this morning.

344
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,630
So...

345
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,170
montgomery.

346
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,780
To add to our fun,we've been asked to consult on a case

347
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,620
where a woman has a foreign object stuck inside of her.

348
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,100
It hurts whenever you move.

349
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,330
Well,then keep your weight off my bad knee.

350
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,340
I'm sorry.

351
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,240
I thought it was on the left side.

352
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,750
19 years of marriage,you'd think you'd have that one down.

353
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,770
It appears that her husband is the foreign object.

354
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,270
Ex-husband.

355
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,630
Ooh!

356
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,520
you had to go and get a piercing.

357
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,480
sonja.

358
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,180
What?

359
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,020
It's not like they're not going to find out.

360
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,010
This is so embarrassing.

361
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,380
No.

362
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:57,880
Embarrassing is meeting your husband for lunch with your ex-husband still attached.

363
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,340
How long is this gonna take?

364
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,630
Because I really don't want my husband finding out.

365
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,580
Please,could you work outsome small miracle?

366
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,670
Well,first of all,we have to figure out what the piercing is caught on.

367
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,540
Okay.

368
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,230
Do you have any piercings?

369
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,560
Me?No!

370
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,790
Ow!

371
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,150
I'm sorry.

372
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,810
I sell real estate.

373
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,330
What is that supposed to mean?

374
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,330
I sell real estate,too.

375
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,540
We've been divorced for five years.

376
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:28,630
But we keep running into each other,you know,work stuff.

377
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,410
We get together sometimes.

378
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,850
it's stupid and weak,and it is never happening again.

379
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,520
Okay,well,Dr. Grey is going to check on the x-rays,and then--

380
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,420
then we'll take it from there,okay?

381
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,640
But,um,you--

382
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,490
you might want to cancel your lunch plans.

383
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,140
hey.

384
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,710
That m&m was--

385
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,360
yeah.

386
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,210
I went to tell the chief...

387
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,490
about my hand.

388
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,360
Burke,how--

389
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,580
but I couldn'T.

390
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,390
I...

391
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,080
I don't know what I'm going to do.

392
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,250
Well,I-I can be there if you need me in surgery.

393
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,840
I'm not going to do any surgeries.

394
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,980
I'm gonna catch up on paperwork.

395
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,030
Wait,so--

396
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,450
so what does that mean?

397
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,820
I don't know.

398
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,960
I don't know what I'm going to do.

399
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,520
I need time to think.

400
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,310
I have...

401
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,590
paperwork.

402
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,440
I need to do paperwork.

403
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,100
I know how the rumor mill works around here,george,okay?

404
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,410
I'm the crazy intern,and now I'm the crazy intern whose friends have to babysit her.

405
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,280
You know what we should talk about is what you're gonna do with all

406
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,410
that money once you deposit the check after we don't let you destroy it.

407
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,090
don't move,adam.

408
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,030
Whoa!

409
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,340
I'm not moving.

410
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,450
Are those people having sex?

411
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,220
just lay still.

412
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,110
They were having sex.

413
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,280
Now they're just fighting.

414
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,180
Good to have you back,stevens.

415
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,790
I'm not back.

416
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,560
I'm fine,just not back.

417
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,710
Hey,you're addison forbes montgomery-shepherd.

418
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,880
That's a lot of names,a lot of rich sounding names.

419
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,050
You're rich,right?

420
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,890
oh,that's rude.

421
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,840
That's a rude question. I'm sorry.

422
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,840
It's just that I'm rich now,too.

423
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,570
You're not rich until you deposit the check.

424
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,900
Do you ever feel guilty?

425
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,830
I'm sorry.

426
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,900
Being rich.

427
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,650
'Cause I have all this money now,

428
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,130
and I don't really feel like I did anything to deserve it,

429
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,190
and I can't really talk to my friends about it...

430
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,520
'cause they're all so poor.

431
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,280
Standing right here,izzie.

432
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,140
Deposit the check,stevens.

433
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,950
Just start there,okay?

434
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,680
And,um,the guilt will work itself out.

435
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,080
Hey.

436
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,410
You're everywhere.

437
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,450
Well,I'm sorry.

438
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,950
For once,it was actually not on purpose.

439
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:56,730
Do these look blurry to you?

440
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,060
What exactly am I looking at?

441
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,440
A divorced couple who got stuck together during--

442
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,410
oh,wow.

443
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,690
That's gotta be pretty awkward.

444
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:02,880
Yeah.

445
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,170
Divorced five years,and still going at it like teens at the prom...

446
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,640
so to speak.

447
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,980
Speaking of divorce...

448
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,710
I heard because I'm working with your wife.

449
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Ex-wife.

450
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,310
It was time.

451
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,820
Good.

452
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,960
How's finn?

453
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,150
Finn is...

454
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,790
fine.

455
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,790
Good.

456
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,300
You're right. They're blurry.

457
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,530
You should get some new ones.

458
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,630
If you go ahead with the mastectomy,there are several reconstructive options.

459
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,780
Saline implants are used most often,but silicone has a more natural look and feel.

460
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,880
I can't deal with this right now.

461
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,210
diana,come on.

462
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,180
It'll take two seconds,huh?

463
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,750
You're the one who has to feel them,so you decide.

464
00:18:59,010 --> 00:18:59,780
I n't care.

465
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,200
Dude,believe me,you care.

466
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,270
Dr. Karev.

467
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,770
Dude,he's right.

468
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,660
You care.

469
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,440
Dr. Bailey?

470
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,480
What's wrong with my wife?

471
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,540
I'M... sorry.

472
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,710
Uh,as you know,she has stage iib breast cancer.

473
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,210
I know that.

474
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,960
Will you please te me what's wrong with her?

475
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,750
Mr. Niles--

476
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,810
'cause she won'T.

477
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,660
She won't talk to me.

478
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,870
I've tried,and I'm trying.

479
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,130
And I know this sucks,and it's scary,but we can do this.

480
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,960
We can fight this.

481
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,620
But she won'T.

482
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,150
She won't even look at gus.

483
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,890
She won't hold him,and all he wants is his mom.

484
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
He's just--

485
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,360
she's such a good mom.

486
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,010
I know it doesn't seem like that,but she is.

487
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,880
Okay,I can schedule a psych consult.

488
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,930
I don't want a psych consult.

489
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,890
I just want my wife back.

490
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,130
please.

491
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,500
Now she's talking crazy,how she might not ve the surgery at all.

492
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,530
Mr. Niles--

493
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,150
can you please tell her that she has to have the surgery?

494
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,470
Please.

495
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,100
Somebody has to tell her.

496
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,460
I did this for you,you know?

497
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,700
You know,you have got to stop doing things for me.

498
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,390
I'm with tom now.

499
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,760
I love tom.

500
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,690
I still can't believe you left me for that guy.

501
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,080
Wh-what does tom have that don't,huh?

502
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,720
Well,he doesn't have a pierced--

503
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,670
you two need to stay completely still

504
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,950
so that we can get a clear picture.

505
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,250
We fought through 19 years of marriage.

506
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,190
The only time we didn't fight was

507
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,780
when we were having sex.

508
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,160
that's not true.

509
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,420
I still love you.

510
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,520
Okay,I-I'm in hell.

511
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,940
Mom.

512
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,920
Dad!

513
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,180
Scratch that.

514
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,420
Now I'm in hell.

515
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,150
Oh,god.

516
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,790
Jennifer,maybe you want to go wait in the--

517
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,160
you guys are so paying for my therapy and my rent...

518
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,270
and a new car.

519
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,230
of course,sweetie.

520
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,220
Oh,go ahead.

521
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
Coddle her.

522
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,190
You are old enough to know that your parents

523
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,630
are sexual beings and that they make mistakes.

524
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,100
Oh,is that what you call this,mom,a mistake?

525
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,960
Because I call this you,once again,being a slut.

526
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,360
Hey!

527
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,820
You don't talk to me like that.

528
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,900
I am your mother!

529
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah,and what a great role model you've turned out to be.

530
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,800
Look at you--

531
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,670
cheating on your husband with your ex-husband.

532
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,470
God!

533
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,830
And,daddy,what are you doing?

534
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,460
I thought--

535
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,810
I thought you had finally moved on.

536
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,910
You said you were gonna start dating.

537
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,780
It's complicated,honey.

538
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,490
Well,it seems that your I.U.D.

539
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,110
Has dislodged from your uterus,hooked on

540
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,210
to your husband's piercing and is embedded

541
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,320
in your vaginal wall.

542
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,720
Did she say "piercing"?

543
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,510
Daughter.

544
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,040
Perfect.

545
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:01,810
Hey.

546
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,910
Hey.

547
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:03,860
So...

548
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,750
who got the brownstone?

549
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,440
You heard?

550
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,350
People talk around here.

551
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,270
I listen.

552
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,600
Who got the brownstone?

553
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,040
It's none of your business.

554
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,640
I left my bike in the basement.

555
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,560
I just want to know who to talk to to get it back.

556
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,050
Buy a new bike.

557
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,340
You know,this angry divorce thing really turns me on.

558
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,780
I got the brownstone.

559
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,010
And you'll get your bike back when you

560
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,380
come to your senses and go back home.

561
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,460
Derek took the hamptons?

562
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,590
Derek hates the hamptons.

563
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,780
Derek gave you the hamptons,too?

564
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,290
He still doesn't know the whole story,does he?

565
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,220
No.

566
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,370
And as long as you don't tell him,

567
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,560
you get to be the good guy,

568
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,470
and I'm just the chump who seduced

569
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,510
his wife for the hell of it.

570
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,830
Real fair.

571
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,490
I think I'm gonna buy something

572
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,910
for bailey and for burke.

573
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,150
What do you think burke would want?

574
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,340
Nothing you can get with money.

575
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,310
He likes jazz.

576
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,710
I'm not buying him a cd,george.

577
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,740
I'm a multimillionaire.

578
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,880
I need to buy him something...

579
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,330
big.

580
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,610
A house...

581
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,710
in the bahamas.

582
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,970
I'd buy the bahamas,or at least a bahama.

583
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,930
An island.

584
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,810
You know,for $8 million,I'd buy an island.

585
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,930
Oh,you're an intern.

586
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,400
When would you have time to go to your bahama?

587
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,210
I'd quit.

588
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,460
Oh,no,you wouldn'T.

589
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,260
You're a surgeon.

590
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:15,820
You operate.

591
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,010
That's what you do.

592
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,520
Sorry.

593
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,470
what?

594
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,040
It's fine.

595
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm fine.

596
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,410
I am not a surgeon.

597
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,130
My patient?

598
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,350
30 year old with advanced breast cancer.

599
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,610
I say live your life while you can in the bahamas.

600
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,730
Have you told derek yet

601
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,890
that you broke up with finn?

602
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,450
I'm giving him time.

603
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,170
That's stupid.

604
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,040
You know what's stupid?

605
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,490
Is carrying around a check for $8 million.

606
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,700
I'm fine.

607
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,900
The check is fine.

608
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,220
We're all fine,okay?

609
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,440
I slept with another guy.

610
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,770
Do I tell george?

611
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,920
I,um...

612
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,510
broke up with finn.

613
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,820
Do I tell derek?

614
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,460
I can't tell derek.

615
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,090
I have to tell george.

616
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,030
Honey,please,at least hold gus.

617
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,440
No,don't--

618
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,010
stop it.

619
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,500
Will you at least talk to me?

620
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,640
I want you to leave me alone.

621
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,690
You took a lot of hits today at that m&M.

622
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,280
Some of 'em justified,some of 'em not.

623
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,960
Compassion and empathy are a big part of the job.

624
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,350
Look,I don't care what savoy said,

625
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,390
and I know I haven't always been supportive,

626
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:02,720
but being a parent makes you a better doctor.

627
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,210
hi.

628
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,750
I just...

629
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,690
wanted to say hi.

630
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,710
Denny left me $8 million--

631
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,840
$8.7 million to be exact.

632
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,160
Did you know that he had money?

633
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,610
'Cause I didn't know.

634
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,590
No,I didn't know.

635
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,380
I'm thinking about using it to travel,

636
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,400
maybe go to italy.

637
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,380
I've never been there before.

638
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,320
I hear venice is amazing.

639
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,200
Izzie--

640
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,570
I'm fine.

641
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,300
Really,I am.

642
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm fine.

643
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,500
Everyone thinks I'm not.

644
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,750
Everyone thinks I'M...

645
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,830
but I'm fine.

646
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,210
You're fine.

647
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,290
I'm fine.

648
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,650
Everything's fine.

649
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,030
So...

650
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,440
I got shot.

651
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,880
I got shot because I was coming back to the

652
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,410
hospital to check on denny because you told me to.

653
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,680
I'm not fine.

654
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:11,390
Denny asked you to marry him,and now he is dead.

655
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,360
You're not fine.

656
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:18,300
Don't come in here and...

657
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,030
just...

658
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,340
we're not fine.

659
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,640
I'm sorry.

660
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,130
We were friends.

661
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:29,960
You were my boss,but...

662
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,820
I think we were friends,too.

663
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,510
And--

664
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,870
and I never meant...

665
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,410
for anyo to get hurt.

666
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,960
And I know there is nothing I can do to take it back.

667
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,920
No.

668
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,400
Preston,please--

669
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,030
you quit.

670
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,280
You quit...

671
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,450
being a surgeon.

672
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,650
You have two good hands...

673
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:58,280
and you aren't using them.

674
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,390
Feel guilty about that.

675
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,250
sonja,quit grabbing my leg.

676
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,430
I am not grabbing you anywhere.

677
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,960
She is.

678
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,200
Mr. Morris,we need to position you

679
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,570
correctly in order to get a clear image.

680
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,720
Dr. Yang,move him a little to the left.

681
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,690
Hey.

682
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,710
What are you doing here?

683
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,890
Oh,I heard about it.

684
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,630
I had to see it.

685
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,730
And I've seen enough.

686
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,760
Dr. Yang,I need you to lift him

687
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,830
a little as you pull him.

688
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,280
Trying.

689
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,630
Ah.

690
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,680
Now lift his right leg 20 degrees.

691
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:46,690
ow!

692
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,380
ow!

693
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:47,890
Pain!

694
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,820
Freeze!

695
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,700
Hold that position.

696
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,170
Okay,now,Dr. Grey,can you kind of slowly

697
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,470
swirl mrs. Kellman in a counterclockwise direction?

698
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,550
Swirl?

699
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,590
Swirl?

700
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,430
Swirl.

701
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,780
Swirl.

702
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Oh,my god,sonja.

703
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,140
Oh,god,adam.

704
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,510
Not now.

705
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:09,870
careful.

706
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,570
Careful.

707
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,280
Oh,my god.

708
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,850
Oh,my god.

709
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,610
okay,now,grey,yang,on the count of three,

710
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,350
I want you to slowly,gently pull them apart.

711
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,480
One,two,three.

712
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,170
oh,okay.

713
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,080
He's having a--

714
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,570
sonja!

715
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,670
Heart attack!

716
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,710
He's having a heart attack!

717
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,460
Oh,thank god.

718
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,910
I mean,code blue.

719
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,470
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

720
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,000

721
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,790

728
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,070
How do we do this?

729
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,260
You stand on my right side.

730
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,200
On your right side...

731
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,900
and if at any time during the procedure--

732
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,760
if you tremor...

733
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,910
I'll look at you.

734
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,230
You'll know to slide in to do

735
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,450
the sutures we've practiced.

736
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,510
What if one of the scrub nurses notices?

737
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,440
What if they say something?

738
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,640
Cristina,I can't walk away from this surgery.

739
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,530
If I do,that man in there will die.

740
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,630
So tremor or no tremor,I have to try.

741
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,400
But you--

742
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,630
I'm your intern.

743
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,330
I will be there on your right side.

744
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,100
10 blade.

745
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,560
as soon as we hear someing about your ex-husband,

746
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,550
we'll let you know.

747
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,530
Since I removed your I.U.D.,

748
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,600
You may want to use a backup method.

749
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,070
Oh,I doubt I'll be having

750
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,970
sex anytime soon once I tell tom.

751
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,150
You're--

752
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,650
you're gonna tell your husband?

753
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,540
You know,the first time it happened,

754
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,050
I felt so guilty,and I wasn't gonna tell tom

755
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,620
because it was never gonna happen again.

756
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,330
And then it happened again and again.

757
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,070
And then somewhere along the way,

758
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:30,020
I just stopped feeling guilty.

759
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,250
Yeah...

760
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,430
I'm gonna tell my husband.

761
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,810
I think the truth just has to come out,you know?

762
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,500
Dr. Burke,I know it's a lot to ask,

763
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,850
but I would really appreciate if you'd let me

764
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,800
try my running whip stitch.

765
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,800
All right,take a good bite.

766
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,570
Yowant to make sure it holds.

767
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,710
Good.

768
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,610
Don't put too much pressure.

769
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,600
There.

770
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,920
Keep going.

771
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,270
Oh,my god.

772
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,710
Cristina's doing a running whip stitch on a heart.

773
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,710
I guess sleeping with your boss has its perks.

774
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,860
This sucks.

775
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,290
Cristina gets sex and perks.

776
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:48,110
Maybe you should just apologize again,george.

777
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,200
Yeah,'cause you're in a great position

778
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,300
to give relationship advice.

779
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,220
Cristina's doing a running whip stitch on a heart.

780
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,240
I don't feel like talking.

781
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:14,110
when I'm driving home at night after a long day at work,

782
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,030
all I can think about is getting to my baby.

783
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,200
if this is where you tell me to fight the cancer

784
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,120
so I don't miss out on the joys of motherhood--

785
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,210
then I get home--

786
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,810
the baby's crying...

787
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,760
the exhaustion hits,and I resent that tiny baby's

788
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:39,860
presence in my house,my previously very quiet house.

789
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,610
Why are you telling me this?

790
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,760
So you know what I do?

791
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,860
first,I pick a fight with my husband,you know,

792
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,110
blame him for not settling the baby down,

793
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,600
then I bitch about the neighbors' loud music.

794
00:32:54,730 --> 00:33:00,460
And if I'm really tired and pissed off...

795
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,740
I blame the baby.

796
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,280
I mean,if you hadn't been breast-feeding,

797
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:13,300
you never would've thought the lump was a clogged milk duct.

798
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,910
You would've gone to the doctor as soon as you felt it,

799
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,150
the cancer wouldn't have gotten this far,

800
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,510
and you wouldn't be here making this decision.

801
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,940
Am I close?

802
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,960
What kind of mother blames her own baby for her cancer?

803
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,450
A mother who's human.

804
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,350
A mother who's overwhelmed.

805
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,170
But if this is gonnakill me eventually,

806
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:49,040
wouldn't it be easier if it happed when gus was little?

807
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,090
Wouldn't it be easier for him if I just never existed?

808
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:52,720
Okay.

809
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,190
Shh.

810
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:58,890
Now this is the part when I tell you to fight the cancer

811
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,230
so that you don't miss out on the joys of motherhood.

812
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,510
derek.

813
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:06,870
Yeah.

814
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:07,940
Hey,you know what I like?

815
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,620
I like that we're civilized.

816
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,130
We're these adult,grown-up people

817
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,950
who can be divorced and friendly.

818
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,550
We deserve a medal.

819
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,030
It wasn't a one-night stand.

820
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,590
What?

821
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,500
Mark and I--

822
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,820
it wasn't a one-night stand.

823
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,530
I was in love with him.

824
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,240
Or...

825
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,510
at least,I thought I was.

826
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,410
After you left,we lived together for two months.

827
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,540
I wanted to believe that we could make it work,

828
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,850
that I hadn't thrown my marriage away,

829
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:34,700
that I hadn't thrown my life away on a fling.

830
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,880
But he's mark,and,well...

831
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,120
I caught him with someone else,and...

832
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,480
and then richard called,...

833
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,310
we both had relationships with other people.

834
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,650
We're both equally liable for everything,

835
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,730
so please take the brownstone.

836
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,510
All I want is seattle.

837
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:01,360
I want seattle,and I want never to see you again.

838
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,790
you're here.

839
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,230
You're everywhere,and I can't not tell you.

840
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,700
You know,I've been...

841
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,090
not telling you all day because I thought it was kind,

842
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,570
and I thought I was giving you space.

843
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,810
But I can't not tell you

844
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,200
because you're here and you're you and...

845
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,990
I broke up with finn.

846
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,350
Okay.

847
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,670
Okay...

848
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,720
then.

849
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,070
Okay.

850
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,310
I told you.

851
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,090
yeah.

852
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,390
The operation was successful.

853
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,080
The next 24 to 48 hours are really critical,but--

854
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,820
we expect your father to make a full recovery.

855
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,710
Thank you so much,Dr. Burke.

856
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,720
First do no harm--

857
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,670
easier said than done.

858
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,630
We can take all the oaths in the world,but the fact is...

859
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,970
most of us do harm all the time.

860
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,270
I have $8 million.

861
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,270
So I've heard.

862
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,990
I can...

863
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,740
do anything I want.

864
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,390
Just about.

865
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:03,120
and all I really want to do is a running whip stitch.

866
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:09,540
My first year as an intern,I had a stable cardiac patient

867
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,960
who blew out his lung while I was transporting him to C.T.

868
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,380
I called in the code.

869
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,320
By the time everyone got there,he was dead.

870
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,000
If I had put a chest tube in right away...

871
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,830
you made a mistake.

872
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,650
But I stayed.

873
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,330
I worked.

874
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,380
I learned.

875
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,160
I never made that mistake again.

876
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:40,710
If I had quit,all I would have had was that life...

877
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,240
that I lost.

878
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,450
Instead,I get to save lives.

879
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,970
Every day,I get to save lives.

880
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,180
Sometimes even when we're trying to help...

881
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,500
we do more harm than good...

882
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,270
she told you.

883
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,490
I've known you my whole life.

884
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,710
I grew up with you,so I know what you're thinking...

885
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,650
that there is a year of your life wasted trying

886
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,350
to make it work with addison,

887
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,510
and you could've been with meredith,

888
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,390
that you could be happy right now,that all this...

889
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,480
everything...

890
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,920
that you and meredith could've had a real chance.

891
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,020
Still...

892
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,460
I thought you should know the truth.

893
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,810
I thought I owed you that...

894
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,330
as a friend.

895
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,590
You're not my friend.

896
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,800
And then guilt rears its ugly head.

897
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,800
What you do with that guilt is up to you.

898
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,060
Babysitting,Dr. Bailey?

899
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,440
That's right.

900
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,170
I'm babysitting.

901
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,680
I'm being all unprofessional and emotionally volved while

902
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,510
my patient and her husband are having a moment together.

903
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,860
Oh,you might want to leave now.

904
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,510
I'm feeling a rush of hormones coming on.

905
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,860
There's no telling what I might do.

906
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,100
How's it going in there?

907
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,580
I think they're leaning towards a mastectomy.

908
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,110
Well,that's good.

909
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,920
Uh,about izzie...

910
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,570
I didn't do anytng.

911
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,760
I know,karev.

912
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,670
You didn't do anything.

913
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,950
You weren't even here.

914
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,050
No,listen...

915
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,010
I knew.

916
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,670
Izzie told me what she was gonna do,

917
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,040
but I didn't want to get involved.

918
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,420
I didn't do anything.

919
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,730
I didn't do anything to stop her.

920
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,520
You weren't the only one.

921
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,090
Alex.

922
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,490
Thank you.

923
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,060
We're left with a choice...

924
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,340
I got fried chicken--

925
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,800
extra crispy--

926
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:29,940
coleslaw,peach cobbler,"beetle jump" and...

927
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,610
"samurai ambush." The her night...

928
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,750
when I told you I was done trying to compete?

929
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,060
That was me breaking up with you.

930
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,640
No.

931
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,860
No,I think I would've noticed that.

932
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,620
Except you didn'T...

933
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,880
which is why I broke up with you.

934
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,620
At least now you don't have to feel guilty anymore.

935
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,530
Shut up.

936
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,680
Either let the guilt throw you back into the behavior

937
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:09,890
that got you into trouble in the first place or...

938
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:16,640
learn from the guilt and do your best to move on.

939
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,500
Are you seriously not going to deposit that check?

940
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,280
Some good needs to come from this money.

941
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:32,280
And until I know what that good is,no,I'm not depositing the check.
