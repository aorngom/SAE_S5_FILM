1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,460
previously on  "grey's anatomy"

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,830
when I told you I was done trying to compete?
That was me breaking up with you

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,630
I broke up with finn

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,350
Yeah

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,600
The patient died last month from complications
following a heart transplant

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,400
Denny

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,740
Are there any questions for me?

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,310
I got shot
I'm not fine  You're not fine

9
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,730
You quit being a surgeon

10
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,810
You'll stand on my right side,
I'll look at you,

11
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,630
and you'll know to slide in
to do the sutures we've practiced

12
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,720
Nobody has to know

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,810
to make it

14
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,470
really make it

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,260
as a surgeon

16
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,270
it takes major commitment

17
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,110
We have to be willing
to pick up that scalpel

18
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,030
and make a cut  that may or may not
do more damage than good

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,720
It's all about  being committed

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,400
because if we're not

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,300
we have no business
picking up that scalpel  in the first place

22
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,670
Put burke in O R 2 tomorrow at 10:00 A M
The usual scrub team

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,550
And get rid of his valve replacement at 20
That's no--
that's no good

24
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,410
Yang,brought you a latte

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,610
You're not scrubbing in

26
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,550
But burke always let's me scrub in

27
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,160
Hey,yang,
can i get in on burke's--

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,190
no,no,okay?
No residents

29
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,430
Burke says you crowd him,
so just go away

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,560
Make sure you put the instrument t
ray on his left-hand side

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,900
He needs the extra elbow room
And remember,O R Two No gallery

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,600
Burke was specific

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,830
Dr Burke's become very specific
since coming back to work,hasn't he?

34
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,440
Do you want me to tell him you said that?

35
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,560
Burke's back,
and suddenly cristina's running his board?

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,430
Who does she think she is--
bailey?

37
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,830
She's helping him

38
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,230
Bull
She's taking advantage

39
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,980
She gets out of rounds,
she scrubs in on every surgery burke does,

40
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,560
she's ordering around third-year residents

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,150
You guys are overreacting

42
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,910
I'm so sorry
It's completely illegible

43
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,660
She is writing on the O R Board

44
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,750
Maybe I should sleep with burke

45
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,680
you've been busy

46
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,750
Yeah

47
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,070
Derek hasn't called yet
I told him I broke up with finn a week ago

48
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,820
He still hasn't called

49
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,810
Hey,do you want to go grab a drink,
catch up?

50
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,520
no,I can'T I have to study up
for burke's surgeries tomorrow

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,890
She's busy

52
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,870
Callie

53
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,880
Hey,

54
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,100
talk to me

55
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,430
Hey,how about talking
to me instead of ignoring me?

56
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,240
- Callie
- George!

57
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,050
Well,that's talking
That's a good start

58
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,300
Oh! Oh,god

59
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,530
Hey,
stranger

60
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,740
Oh,

61
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,590
You don't call first?

62
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,930

Oh,
meredith

65
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,780
wait
Let me explain Meredith

66
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,480
I take it that was the slutty
intern you cheated on addison with?

67
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
She's not slutty
What are you doing here?

68
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,450
You bailed on thanksgiving and christmas,
and you live in a trailer,

69
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,080
and you're getting a divorce
And then there's the slutty intern

70
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,310
I really don't like you

71
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,500
You love me

She was ugly,very ugly

00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,880
Except she was tall and beautiful
And he was naked

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,330
Which is,I don't care about,
you know,at all

99
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,400
Good,

what the hell has happened to us?

104
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,500
We are now the people that the people
we want to be with avoid

105
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,470
We have careers to think about

106
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,460
We don't need attention from men with perfect hair

107
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,800
You know,
we should make a pact

108
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,030
There's no more dating

109
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,370
No more derek
No more callie

110
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,000
Just 100% focus on our work

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,720
- They're dead to us
- They are freakin' corpses to us

112
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,910
Preston burke What a pleasure
I have read so much about you

113
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,950
Well,
thank you

114
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,380
Pruitt byrd
Medivac brought him inhis morning

115
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,490
He presents with a primary cardiac tumor

116
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,720
We've been told pruitt needs
a "cardiac autotransplantation

117
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,660
" A cardiac autotransplantation?

118
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,590
A humpty dumpty surgery

119
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes,
I know what it is

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,610
Mrs Byrd,
this is a very complicated surgery

121
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,900
You'll need thorough testing

122
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,050
already done

123
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,610
Mr Byrd is a perfect candidate

124
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,920
You understand what this surgery entails?
We have to--

125
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,890
we have to remove his heart,
cut it open,

126
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,920
scrape out all the tumor
and then put his heart back together again

127
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,750
Which is risky

128
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,070
But possible

129
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,570
which is why we're here
I want the very best for my pruitt

130
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,740
The best

131
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,270
- She means you
- I know that,

132
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,360
however-- I've scheduled
mr Byrd for surgery this afternoon

133
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,420
Just trying to be as efficient as possible

134
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,170
Legal cleared stevens

135
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,120
Explain her parameters
and make sure she understands

136
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,720
What,
stevens is being assigned to me again?

137
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,450
- She's your intern
- But I-I didn't think that--

138
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,790
wouldn'tt be better for her
to start fresh with another resident?

139
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,590
U don't want her,

140
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,950
I
want her to succeed

141
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,780
There's still a good deal
of fallout after the duquette m&M

142
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,850
There's been talk

143
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,560
Look,I don't need to tell you
that there are doctors  That there are doctors
who have concerns about your judgment

144
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,530
Concerns about my judgment?

145
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,300
Stevens was your mistake

146
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,860
Do you,
sir?

147
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,070
Do you have concerns about my judgment?

148
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,770
do you?

149
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,870
You're not gonna put those concerns
to rest by avoiding
taking responsibility for dr Stevens

150
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,210
She's your intern
again

151
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,470
Transfer from mercy west

152
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,540
Noelle labatt,
32 weeks along,

153
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,660
pregnant with twins

154
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,970
One appears to be developing
more slowly than the other

155
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,900
Hello Hi,there

156
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,810
Greg stanton
This is my fiancée,

157
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,660
the future mrs Stanton-- noelle

158
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,590
Greg,I promise you,you're the only person
who cares if we're married or not

159
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,080
They said at mercy that we had  to come
here because her condition could be serious

160
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,970
I-is it serious?

161
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,120
I've got to say,
at first glance,

162
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,380
you don't seem emergent enough
for mercy to send you over here in an ambulance

163
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,310
You're not in labor,you're not bleeding,
your vitals are fine

164
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,540
They said I need a specialist because of my thing

165
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,500
- Your thing?
- Two uteruses?

166
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,590
Ms  Labatt,
noelle was born with two uteruses

167
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,170
- uteri?
- Uteruses

168
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,190
Uteruses

169
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,300
That's very rare

170
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,710
I'm here
Hi Hello

171
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,220
That paperwork took--
well,forever

172
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,280
But I'm all do with it now,
and can I just say how

173
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,550
really grateful I am to be back?

174
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,990
You understand there are rules to your probation,
a protocol to follow?

175
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,230
yeah,
I know

176
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,750
Legal already took me through lots of that stuff--

177
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,720
the mandatory counseling,
the extra lab hours,

178
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,770
the volunteer work with transplant patients

179
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,430
That's the stuff you're doing for the chief

180
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,640
I'm talking about what you're doing for me

181
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,730
Okay,
what am I doing for you?

182
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,960
Okay,
let's start with what you don't get to do

183
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,240
You will not interact with any patients

184
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,230
You will not be alone with any patients

185
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,640
You will be seen and not heard
You will perform no procedures

186
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,570
The O R
Is off limits

187
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,600
No pre-op,no post-op,
no anything have to do with an "op

188
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,880
" You have no authority,
you have no opinions

189
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,070
and you have no choice in this matter
Am I understood?

190
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,650
Is there anything I can do?
I want to be useful

191
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,160
Well
I can't use you

192
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,280
You've got to earn back the right
for any of us to trust you again

193
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,090
Until then,
you will be shadowing a different doctor each day

194
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,300
Okay,well,who am I with today,
dr Montgomery,you?

195
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,850
Dr Bailey,
you paged

196
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,460
Dr Grey

197
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,680
Meredith?

198
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,490
You're to make sure that stevens observes only

199
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,300
You want me to

200
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,800
wait,
meredith

201
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,300
meredith is the boss of me?

202
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,210
Y about this

203
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,210
It's not your fault

204
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,680
Hey,you want me to fetch you some coffee,
rub your feet maybe?

205
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,680
I did not ask for this assignment

206
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,180
I'm fine with it
Really,it's fine

207
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,920
- I'm so sorry
- Dr Stevens--

208
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,530
- hey,dr Shepherd
-  Welcome back

209
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,790
Okay
Uh,

210
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,990
meredith,
meredith--

211
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,710
sorry,it's not like I can leave
I gotta stay by my boss' side

212
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,180
Okay,the trailer sucks,

213
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,080
but in the light of day,
the land's nice

214
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,030
Seattle's pretty in the daylight,
plus you have your thing for ferries,

215
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,760
- so
- ferry boats

216
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,880
Right
Whatever

217
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,580
Dr Stevens,
meredith,this is my sister nancy

218
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,540
hi
Sister?

219
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,970
Yeah

220
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,550
you're one of derek's sisters

221
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,450
Yeah,I knew you didn't think I was
the wife seeing as you already ran her F

222
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,640
Nancy is visiting from connecticut
She's on her way home now,

223
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,960
straight back home

224
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,730
Well,
it was nice to meet you

225
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,540
Okay

226
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,340
Mcdreamy's sister's mcbitchy

227
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,930
you put me in charge of your schedule

228
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,400
To make sure that i didn't
get a surgery like this one

229
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,690
Only a handful of people do humpties,
burke,
and you're the best one on the west coast

230
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,750
Well,
he can go to houston

231
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,640
You want to tell that to the chief?

232
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,500
Pruitt needs this surgery
He'll die without it

233
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,660
You didn't tell me

234
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,550
You told the patient we were doing the surgery,

235
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,820
but you didn't tell me

236
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,390
I have been doing that all week

237
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,940
Are you up on the humpty?
Do you realize what this entails?

238
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,000
I have done my research
Stop worrying

239
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,530
We are a well-oiled machine

240
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,170
- dr Burke
- Yeah

241
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,580
I understand there are some doctors
in this hospital

242
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,090
who have concerns about my judgment since denny

243
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,330
Well,
everybody loves a scandal

244
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:06,120
So you think it's just gossip,
not actual concern about me as a doctor?

245
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,610
Sure
Sure

246
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,840
Iz,
set me up for debridement and dressing

247
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,530
It was stupid
I know better

248
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,420
When I'm studying for the bar,
I'm a mess

249
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,170
I can't focus on anything for weeks

250
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,860
but torts and real property and constitutional law

251
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,090
- the biosynthetic ones
- We never use those

252
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,610
We do now
Sloan changed the burn protocol last week

253
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,960
I was about to start a practice test,
and I wanted some tea,

254
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,180
so I put on a pot of water
and hit the timer and just forgot

255
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,250
Half an hour into my section on contracts,

256
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,360
the smoke alarm was blaring,
and well,you know the rest

257
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,500
So you're gonna be a lawyer?

258
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,150
All I have to do is pass the bar exam

259
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,900
I failed before,
but this time I'm ready

260
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,960
- I'm gonna pass
- Good for you

261
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,890
That was just mean

262
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,300
Kathleen called and told me to find out
why the slutty intern's panties were hanging
on the hospital bulletin board

263
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,410
Four sisters--
four sisters and not one brother,

264
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,830
and you wonder why I don't call more

265
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,850
Feel free to explain about the panties at any time

266
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,420
Nance,you know what?
It's great to see you

267
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,230
Really great to have you here
But I have a job,
you know?

268
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,490
I have patients

269
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,170
I have a mother at 35 weeks with twins
Where is her O B ?

270
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,970
Well,her O B Should be on a plane back
to connecticut where she belongs

271
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,620
Okay,so we've covered the trailer
We still need to cover the slutty intern

272
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,230
and the divorce

273
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,780
You know what?
You sound more and more like mom every day

274
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,180
Take it back

275
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,990
So two uteruses
that's pretty cool

276
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,590
And you're engaged
That's also cool

277
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,980
Well,
greg talked me into it

278
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,740
Oh,man,from the first moment I saw noelle,
I was ham

279
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,670
Did you just say "ham"?

280
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,170
- You're either ham or eggs
- Here we go

281
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,130
You gotta ask yourself in every situation,

282
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,800
are you the chicken or are you the pig?

283
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,440
Sorry,
pig or chicken?

284
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,380
Look,you got a plate of ham and eggs,
all right?

285
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,600
Now--
now the chicken is involved in the meal,

286
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,390
but the pig--
now the pig is committed

287
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:55,180
So the question is--
are you involved or are you committed?

288
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,040
Ham or eggs

289
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,760
Ham or eggs

290
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,720
karev,
you free?

291
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,500
Absolutely,
sir

292
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,640
Great,take this
I'm on hold with the D M V

293
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,390
Some mix-up about switching my license
and registration to seattle

294
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,370
Take care of that for me?

295
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,180
Thanks for thinking of me,
sir

296
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,870
O'malley,
how's it feel to be the new gynie grunt?

297
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,080
I got a patient who was born with
and is pregnant in two uteruses

298
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,830
Two uteruses

299
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,880
- Jealous?
- No

300
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,880
No,I'm-- I'm--
I'm busy I'm on hold

301
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,380
- important business
- Right

302
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,690
For sloan

303
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,950
Right,it's super important,
I'm sure

304
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,160
Noelle labatt,
room 2314

305
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,830
Two,two,two,two,
two,two

306
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,810
hang on
Can I see that for a sec?

307
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,600
Did I just hear him say "two uteruses"?

308
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,030
I'm sorry
You-- you must be

309
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,150
nancy-pants?

310
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,510
Hey,
loser

311
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,980
I wish derek had told me you were coming to visit

312
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,990
like he tells you anything these days?

313
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,700
Yeah,well,
I'm working on that

314
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,010
What are you doing here,mark?
Are you trying to torture him?

315
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,170
He's my family,nancy
Plus,I needed a change of pace

316
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,960
Plus,
I slept with my tennis partner's wife,

317
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,200
and he went out and bought a gun

318
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,340
There it is

319
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,240
my god

320
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,310
Nancy!

321
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,250
let me guess
Did mom send you out?

322
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,690
I hear derek's trying to ban you from seattle

323
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,120
Did he also tell you
that he's living in a trailer?

324
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,580
yeah

325
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,570
Derek

326
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,490
derek

327
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,990
I want to see the two uteruses

328
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,220
Yeah,
find me later

329
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,630
- I miss her
- Yeah

330
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,780
me,too

331
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,170
The diesel pushes past cornerback don mcneal

332
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,180
He's at the 30 He's at the 20
He's at the 10

333
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,110
Touchdown,
washingtoredskins

334
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,020
I'm sorry

335
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,640
One of the twins gets rowdy,and greg gets
carried  away when talking to the baby

336
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,640
He's decided that the baby is into sports,
of all things

337
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,280
Well,
she's daddy's little girl

338
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,390
I can tell,see,
because when I talk to her--

339
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,080
yeah,the rhythm in your voice,
it helps calm her

340
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,230
Sure I read a couple of articles
on that recently,actually

341
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,240
Dr Karev,
I knew you secretly missed my service

342
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,060
Right

343
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,530
Greg,noelle,
I have very good news for you

344
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,940
According to our tests,
the babies are both perfectly healthy

345
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,480
But they are substantially different sizes
for a very unique reason

346
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,510
The test indicate that the babies
have two different due dates

347
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,410
according to our calculations,
the larger baby,

348
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:22,420
your son,was conceived a full
six weeks before your daughter

349
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,050
- I
- oh,god

350
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,110
I-I don't--
I-I don't understand

351
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,800
That-- that can't be right
That's impossible

352
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,420
No,actually,
it's quite possible

353
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,920
Our tests are extremely accurate
in predicting due dates

354
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,050
But we broke up

355
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,120
Yeah,see,she,
she got pregnant

356
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,240
I wanted to get married She didn'T
I gave her an ultimatum,and she left me

357
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,270
Greg,I am so sorry
I am so,so sorry

358
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,930
I mean,we were barely speaking six weeks
after the conception,

359
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,060
let alone having sex

360
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,840
Or at least I wasn't having sex

361
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,630
It was one night,greg
It was one night

362
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,660
I-I didn't think that this could happen
It was nothing

363
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,960
I can't believe you did this
I can't believe you didn't tell me

364
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,340
god,
I can't believe this

365
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,520
He's not the father of both babies

366
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,880

380
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,890
I hear you burned your hand
because you were studying?
I can't even be allowed to warm soup

381
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,870
within five days of taking the bar

382
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,190
So you burned your hand while you were--

383
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,080
- burning my soup
- And when you grabbed the pot--

384
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,520
dropped it,obviously
I mean,it was literally red hot

385
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,830
You must have held on to it for a little while,
though

386
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,530
This burn's extremely deep

387
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh,yeah No,that's right
I held on,and then I dropped it

388
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,080
There are some deep partial thickness burns here

389
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,070
Give her a gram of cefazolin and a tetanus

390
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,200
It's too bad,really,
that I did this to my hand

391
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,950
I'm supposed to be taking the bar again friday

392
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,550
This burn is bad,
but we'll get you fixed up

393
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,070
You'll be fine to take the test on friday

394
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,660
I will?

395
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,590
she's lying

396
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,040
Something's off about gretchen's story

397
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,250
Izzie,
you're only supposed to be observing

398
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,070
I am observing
I'm observing closely

399
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,690
And I'm telling you something is off

400
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,430
Did you see her reaction when sloan
told her she'd be okay to take the test again?

401
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,610
That was not relief
That was panic

402
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,780
It's okay to be nervous
about being back here at work,

403
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,720
bout failing,
but you haven't even been back a full day yet,

404
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,580
and already you're pushing to bend the rules

405
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,860
Meredith,
this is so not about me

406
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,810
This is about our patient

407
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,530
I am worried about our patient,
and get off your high freakin' horse

408
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,660
This is my patient
Try to remember that

409
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,850
Fine
Whatever

410
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,150
Iz

411
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,990
A humpty dumpty surgery?

412
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,150
B-burke's doing a humpty dumpty today?

413
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,520
yes

414
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,860
Well,
I've never seen a humpty firsthand before

415
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,820
Yeah,
me neither

416
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,120
what are you doing?

417
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,300
Scrubbing in
You'll let burke know?

418
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,830
Sure

419
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,710
I know you're not talking to me anymore,
and that's okay,

420
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,950
but there's something I'd like to explain
All you have to do is listen

421
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,010
You and me,
we're like ham and eggs

422
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,760
I was the chicken
I just want you to know

423
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,210
that I know that I was the chicken
You put yourself out there

424
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,360
and you were committed,
and I was just putting the eggs on the plate

425
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,980
Not the ham,
because you were the p

426
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,500
I was involved,
but now I'm committed

427
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,240
- Did you just call me a pig?
- No,it's a metaphor

428
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,270
Calling me a pig?

429
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,730
The point is,
you're not the pig anymore

430
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,200
What I'm trying to say is I'm the pig

431
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,960
Now I am the pig

432
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,130
I am the pig

433
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,290
I've been waiting for you guys
for a half an hour in the cafeteria

434
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,080
Since when do we eat in a patient room?

435
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,190
Izzie,
meet really old guy

436
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,050
We found him a couple of days ago

437
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,920
he sleeps all the time

438
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,480
It's quiet in here
Nobody bothers us

439
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,670
No,what are you doing?

440
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,530
It turns out I'm not doing anything

441
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,870
I'm literally not allowed to do anything

442
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,660
I knew coming back was gonna be an adjustment,
but this is just--

443
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,550
no
What are you doing right now?

444
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,390
Eating my lunch

445
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,950
Okay,if you want to socialize or talk
about your day or get in a quick therapy session,

446
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,180
you know,
go do it over there

447
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,870
- Seriously?
- Good-bye,izzie

448
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,280
Okay,
fine

449
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,090
So,o'malley,
your chick with the two uteruses?

450
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,630
You're on scut--
glorified plastics scut

451
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,750
You are in no position to mock me or my uteruses

452
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,610
Any cervical changes on the ultrasound?

453
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,990
- Why do you care?
- I don'T

454
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,380
I'm so glad to be back
Yay!

455
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,180
I'm not complaining about you
You and I are fine,boss

456
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,660
this is weird

457
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,250
- I called callie a pig
- to her face?

458
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,540
what happened to the whole she's a corpse thing?

459
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,270
I just can't get over how much
everything around here has changed

460
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,630
- How many times?
- Just one time

461
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,970
- I get one,too,then
- Deal

462
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,560
Gin

463
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,800
what was,
with that,with meredith?

464
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,540
We have a thing

465
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,880
Wait,you have a thing with meredith
and I don't know about it?

466
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,480
I live with you
I see you every day

467
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,540
It's a work thing
Okay,

468
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,610
you know,
the whole point of hanging out
with really old guy is that he doesn't talk

469
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,690
The man is sedated
This is supposed to be a quiet place

470
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,660
See?
Changed

471
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,660
She's changed
Everything's changed

472
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,360
I gave the other nurse a list
of his medications this morning

473
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,780
My husband needs his pills
He needed them hours ago!

474
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,460
okay
Why don't you check on the meds again?

475
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,580
- I have checked on them
- No,meds,pharmacy,now

476
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,180
I'm sorry
I am sorry

477
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,310
It's fine
It's fine

478
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,430
I was never a yeller before

479
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,620
I'm becoming this horrible person

480
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,060
who yells at people who are just trying
to do their job

481
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,350
You are just looking out for your husband

482
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,130
You do exactly what it takes to protect him,
and that does not make you horrible

483
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,300
It makes you smart

484
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,640
He said he was leaving
He said he wasn't coming back

485
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,010
She's hyperventilating,
and the baby's had some bradycardia

486
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,780
noelle,
I ed you to get back into bed now

487
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,630
Is greg out there?
Did he leave? Like really leave?

488
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,750
Just take deep breaths

489
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,070
I always give him such a hard time,
you know,about everything

490
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:33,020
Like he likes weddings I hate them
He loves kids,and me,they scare me to death

491
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,040
Noelle,
have you had any cramping,

492
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,310
any contractions,
any pressure at all?

493
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,780
But I can't do this without him
We'll get past this,right?

494
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,190
We have to get past this

495
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,560
Damn it

496
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,310
All right,noelle,
I need you to get into bed,okay?

497
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,950
Why,
what's happening?

498
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,640
Stay on your left side,
and whatever you do,do not push,okay?

499
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,820
okay,I need slow,
deep breaths

500
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,010
So tell me about the slutty girl

501
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,250
Fine,
the slutty intern

502
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,840
It was the slutty part I had a problem with

503
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,190
Kathleen says she's not even single

504
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,260
She is single She's wonderful
She's smart

505
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,410
She's a lot of things
And she's none of your business,nancy

506
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,280
I've never seen you  like this over a girl,
even addison

507
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,260
I've never been like this over a girl,
especially addison

508
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,900
don't be bitter I mean,
shame on addison and all that,

509
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,260
but he's mark,derek
What did you expect?

510
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,580
He's just
mark

511
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,430
And who hasn't gone there once or twice,
right?

512
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,910
- What'd you say?
- Oh,come on

513
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,330
Everybody sleeps with mark
It's practically a rite of passage

514
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,540
Derek,
I get it,okay?

515
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,320
I get that they made a terrible mistake

516
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,170
It wasn't a mistake
Nancy,it wasn't a mistake

517
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,030
It wasn't just one night
It was months

518
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,100
They were together for months
Didn't you know that?

519
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,620
No,I had no idea

520
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,330
Then shut up about it and eat your lunch

521
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,970
STAFF:BURKE   LES :

522
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,850
Derek's sister is in town

523
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,380
Cristina,
are you mad at me or something?

524
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,600
Because I have been trying to talk to you all week

525
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,170
Everything is not about you,
meredith

526
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,580
Okay,what is going on?
Because george and alex are saying--

527
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,590
- I-I don't care
- What is your problem?

528
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,030
I just

529
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,270
I have bigger things in my life right now

530
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,230
What?

531
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,440
Nothing

532
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,260
10 blade

533
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,930
Hey Hey,dr O'malley Can you,
can you tell me what's happening in there?

534
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,470
I thought you left
She thinks you left her

535
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,590
Look,man,
this is all a lot to digest

536
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,000
I mean,
our daughter,

537
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,610
my--
my little girl isn't even my little girl anymore

538
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,450
Noelle is in there freaking out because you left

539
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,370
Just tell me if she is okay,
please

540
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,460
She's gone into premature labor
Dr Montgomery-shepherd--

541
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,860
dr
Montgomery is about to do an emergency c-section

542
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,290
on one of the babies to try
to stop the labor on the other

543
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,230
Wait,
so you're delivering one of the babies right now,
today?

544
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,600
In just a few minutes
The boy or the girl?

545
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,540
Greg

546
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,210
ham or eggs?

547
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,210
You say you want a career in plastics,

548
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:00,240
anyet you can't tear yourself away
from the baby catchers long
enough to actually show me you want it

549
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,210
Being on hold with the D M V Has nothing to do
with a career in plastics,dr Sloan

550
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,860
Only it does,because being on hold
with the D M V Has to do with me,

551
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,650
and I have everything to do
with your career in plastics

552
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,270
Tyler

553
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,360
addison montgomery needs two units
of b-positive blood in l&dstat

554
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,200
I'm on it

555
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,540
So the biosynthetic dressing should ensure
that you won't need skin grafts,

556
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,800
and that's good news

557
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,340
If I did need grafts,
would that take long?

558
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,170
I mean,
I mean,
like how long would something like that take if--

559
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,440
if I had needed them?

560
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,860
that would just depend
on the severity of the burn,really

561
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,430
so more severe than this one?

562
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,720
It would have to be more severe?

563
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,950
just to make sure I have everything accurate,

564
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,910
you burned your hand

565
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,260
we've been over this,
haven't we?

566
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,690
I'm sorry
I--

567
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,320
look,I have a test on friday,
and I have work to do

568
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,540
So I have to--
I-I want to go home

569
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,450
I'm really ready to get out of here now,
okay?

570
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,700
I'm sorry
I didn't mean to--

571
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,400
gretchen,
did you burn your hand on purpose?

572
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,310
Izzie,
you heard what dr Bailey said

573
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,150
It's okay if you did

574
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,730
It's just,did you burn your hand
to get out of taking your test?

575
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:30,320
I can't fail that damn test one more time

576
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,070
I just
can'T

577
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,040
It's all anyone in my family,
in my life--

578
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,650
it's all they talk about
It's all I'm known for

579
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,670
"Oh,gretchen,the failure

580
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,840
" Can you imagine failing the bar exam five times?

581
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,670
Five times

582
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,320
I mean,
that's absurd

583
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,340
I mean
that's just,

584
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,760
that's pathetic

585
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:58,550
I cannot sit for two
and a half solid days of testing again

586
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,880
just to prove to everyone

587
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,810
again

588
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,620
how pathetic I am

589
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,430
Not
when

590
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,850
you feel that pathetic all by yourself

591
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,640
okay,
I've completed the incision

592
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,930
I'm going to ask you to move the top uterus

593
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:32,670
to the side so I can reach the one underneath

594
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,860
got it

595
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,970
Now I don't want to alarm you
or make you nervous in any way,
o'malley,

596
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,730
because you seem like a decent person,

597
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,480
but I've got about 120 seconds to get baby one out

598
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,880
of uterus one while you're holding uterus two,

599
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,690
and if you so much as hiccup,

600
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,260
you could tear the uterine wall
and kill this woman's child

601
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,650
So do what you can to be careful,
okay?

602
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,660
Okay

603
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,580
Look at that
Amazing,

604
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,390
applying the final hemostasis suture

605
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,130
Great
Don't be afraid to--

606
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,630
grab a bigger piece?
Got it

607
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,280
Good Very nice,
dr Yang

608
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,810
Applying pressure

609
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,990
Gently

610
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,140
It was attached to the interventricular septum

611
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,770
Are you gonna use a graft to repair?

612
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,630
Somebody's been doing their homework

613
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,160
4-0 prolene,please
Thank you very much,

614
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,450
Ready to perforate uterus two
Scalpel

615
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,440
Wait Wait,
dr Montgomery

616
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,220
My baby's moving It's really moving
I can't hold it

617
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,970
George,I need you to hold her
still if I'm gonna do this c-section

618
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,330
I'm trying

619
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,830
I mean it,
o'malley

620
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,820
What should I do?
It's really moving I can't hold it

621
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,900
I need you to keep her still,george
You're sending her into distress

622
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,640
You have to get that baby to stop moving

623
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,440
- How do I do that?
- Talk,o'malley

624
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,760
Alex

625
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,240
Karev,
back away from the table

626
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,000
Talk to it,to the baby,
to calm it down

627
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,840
- Karev
- Talk about what?

628
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,920
October 30,
1974--

629
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,700
it's the fight known as "rumble in the ngle

630
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,640
" World heavyweight champ george foreman

631
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,920
is pitted against muhammad ali
in his first major fight

632
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,370
after three and a half years out of the ring

633
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,370
- It's working
- Foreman is favored to win

634
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,010
He's younger,
he's stronger

635
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,940
scalpel
But he's not prepared for what
ali would later call the rope-a-dope

636
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,700
It all started in the second round
Foreman comes out swinging

637
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,330
Ali's backed up against the ropes

638
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,240
that's not gonna stay on
You're giving it too much slack

639
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,450
You're blocking my light

640
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,960
Think of it as a basic corner stitch

641
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,930
I can figure out how to sew on my own buttons,
thank you I am surgeon Right

642
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,410
for god's sakes

643
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,990
You sew this on for me,
and I'll get rid of addison and sloan

644
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,580
- Really?
- No

645
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,390
fine
I'll do it anyway

646
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,070
So I heard you've got a sister wandering the halls

647
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,690
She planning on moving here,
too?

648
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,330
God,
I hope not

649
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:15,080
Derek,
I know it's been hard on you

650
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,440
He was like my brother

651
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,120
I have four sisters

652
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,020
four very annoying sisters

653
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,890
Mark was my brother

654
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,740
It's--
it's hard

655
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,100
Divorce isn't all it's cracked up to be,
huh?

656
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,750
I just want it to be easy

657
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,840
I want it to be over and move on

658
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,910
But

659
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:39,390
but you're in a surprising amount of pain

660
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,720
You and adele?

661
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,650
I'm sewing on a button
for the first time in my life

662
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,880
What does that tell you?

663
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,650
technically,

664
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,010
I'm sewing

665
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,280
I'm just saying

666
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,250
Dr Sloan

667
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,290
So we're clear,

668
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:05,950
you knew when you stepped into that surgery,
you were forfeiting your future in plastics,
right?

669
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,480
- But,dr Sloan--
- I need my phone back

670
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,050
Well done
You really prepared

671
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,720
Yes,
I'm always prepared

672
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,800
Couldn't do it without you

673
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,860
- Thank you
- Dr Burke,

674
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,290
could we have a moment alone?

675
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,710
I just--
I didn't realize that you were one of them,

676
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,640
one of the doctors around here
with doubts about me or my abilities

677
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,170
Miranda,
I'm not

678
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,510
My name was erased from the board
I have to assume that was you

679
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,560
- Dr Bailey--
- I just-- I just--

680
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,750
I just need to know why

681
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,600
I need you to tell me why you didn't w
ant me in on your surgery

682
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,120
I'm afraid I just couldn't use you

683
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,090
I understand

684
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:28,540
you should've seen that
Two uteruses So unbelievably cool

685
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,870
And a cute baby to boot

686
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,000
Well,
I'm glad you're enjoying your trip

687
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,910
Relax,derek
I'm going

688
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,810
I'm on a plane in two hours

689
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,630
So
you're gonna report back to mom that?

690
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,060
That you're you

691
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,770
Still running in circles
around all the women in your life,

692
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,790
but that's to be expected
with four sisters and a dead dad

693
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,380
I'm not running around in circles

694
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,290
Derek,
can y even remember the last time you were alone?

695
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,100
You've never been single,
ever

696
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,120
I mean,you're fine,
but you're not happy

697
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,540
And you're not gonna get happy
until you get some space

698
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,410
Just get away from addie,

699
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,550
away from the intern,
just away

700
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,880
Figure out what you want

701
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,340
Kathleen's the shrink,
nancy,not you

702
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,180
I gotta go

703
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,860
Nancy

704
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,940
Thanks for flying out here

705
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,410
It was,

706
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,430
thanks

707
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,740
- where are we going again?
- We need to go upstairs

708
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,570
Okay

709
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,790
wait Wait
Where are we?

710
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,900
We're on the psychiatric floor,
gretchen

711
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,940
We need to place you on a 72-hour hold

712
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,060
No,I'm not crazy You can't--
no I'm going home

713
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,130
- Gretchen
- No,you have to let me go home

714
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,920
Please I'll just--
I need to go back home Please

715
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,820
If you go home,
you're just gonna hurt yourself again Right?

716
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,700
Isn't that your plan,
so that you won't have to take the bar exam?

717
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,680
You need some help,
gretchen

718
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,460
If the idea of taking an exam makes you
hold your palm to a burner,

719
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,860
you need some help

720
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,150
Everyone needs help from time to time,

721
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,140
someone to look out for them,

722
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,560
make sure they're okay,

723
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,960
make sure they're ready
I have that

724
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,650
And you need that right now

725
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,200
- I'm not crazy
- I know

726
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,920
I st
didn't want to fail

727
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,130
I know

728
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,470
What happened?

729
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,100
Are my babies okay?

730
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,020
The surgery went very well
You have a healthy baby boy

731
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,890
And the labor stopped on your little girl
She's gonna be just fine

732
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,400
And greg?
Has greg come back yet?

733
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,510
No,noelle,
I'm sorry

734
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,580
Greg isn't here

735
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,000
I want an update every half-hour,
and--

736
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,280
what happened?

737
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,740
- My babies?
- They're just fine

738
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,840
You're just coming out of anesthesia,
noelle

739
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,900
Everything went very well

740
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,030
Is greg back yet?

741
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,640
I'm so sorry,
noelle He's not here

742
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,300
And be sure to alert me to any fetal distress

743
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,430
What happened?

744
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,330
Your babies are healthy,noelle
Everything's okay

745
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,780
Is greg back yet?

746
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,930
I'm right here

747
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,630
Hi

748
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,070
Hi

749
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,790
I,
I saw our son

750
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,820
He's amazing

751
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:37,320
But how's our little girl?

752
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:55,140
You look like you could use a little cheering up

753
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,030
Not from you

754
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,190
if I recall,
I was pretty good at cheering you up

755
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,360
one,t wo yep,

756
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,720
three very cheerful times

757
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,100
Dirty It was not "cheerful
" It was dirty

758
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,140
And like I said,
no

759
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,570
So your sister really doesn't like me,
huh?

760
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,670
Sorry
It's just,she'S

761
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,550
from the east coast

762
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,970
Well,

763
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,540
I-- I-- you know what?
I shoulda called

764
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,300
But you didn'T

765
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,230
I want us to work,
it's just--

766
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,610
it's complicated

767
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,140
I think I need a little time to

768
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,280
take some space

769
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,150
Yeah

770
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,480
To clear my head

771
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah

772
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,570
I okay

773
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,480
Okay

774
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,340
Okay

775
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,090
There are times  when even the best of us

776
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,700
have trouble with commitment

777
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,340
Dr Stevens

778
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,950
I was just looking at dr
Grey's evaluation on your first day back to work

779
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,390
I get daily report cards now?

780
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,630
She had a lot to say

781
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,890
Yes,
sir

782
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,970
It was a difficult catch
Nicely handled

783
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,380
Good work

784
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,850
Welcome back,
dr Stevens

785
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,610
I was rude to you before
I'm sorry

786
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,670
I understand what you're trying to say
You're the

787
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,460
pig

788
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,740
You are committed

789
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,850
Only we broke up

790
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,600
And I've been wanting to hear
this from you for how long?

791
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,540
And-- and you wait until now to say it
to me after we've broken up?

792
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,980
I'm out of my element here
I break bones for a living

793
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,900
I-I used to live in the basement

794
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,830
Most days I wear last night's eyeliner to work

795
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,830
I don't give a crap
what other people think about me

796
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,960
because I am a happily independent,
successful woman,

797
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,560
and I like it that way

798
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,910
Only when you say stuff like this,

799
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,820
it just
it makes things too hard So please

800
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,540
don't chase me anymore

801
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,330
unless you're ready to catch me

802
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,740
And we may be surprised  by the commitments

803
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,860
we're willing  to let slip out of our grasp

804
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,670
Commitments are complicated

805
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,870
I'm here for you,
whatever it is

806
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,040
Whenever you're ready,
I'm here

807
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,520
Thank you

808
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,450
We may surprise ourselves

809
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:26,510
by the commitmen  we're willing to make

813
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,470
True commitment takes effort

814
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,110
and sacrifice

815
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,310
Which is why sometimes

816
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,480
we have to learn the hard way

817
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,600
to choose our commitments
very carefully
