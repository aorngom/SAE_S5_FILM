1
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:02,582
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:04,779
- I slept with Izzie.
- George told me.

3
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:05,953
Everything.

4
00:00:06,085 --> 00:00:07,995
You named me Ava,
and I was more me

5
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:10,412
as Ava, than I'll ever be as Rebecca.

6
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:14,280
Dr. Hahn, I was pleasantly surprised
to hear you were joining us today.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,875
You remind me of myself
when I was an intern.

8
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:18,744
Focused, intense...

9
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:21,594
- Cold.
- My mother is dead isn't she?

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,547
- Yes.
- Let's do this once.

11
00:00:23,736 --> 00:00:26,439
I'm fine, she's cremated,
I picked out a beautiful urn,

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,572
she's hanging out
in the back of my closet.

13
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:32,110
Any more questions about my dead mother,
or can we get back to work?

14
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:39,063
Pick me. Choose me.

15
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:40,283
Love me.

16
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:44,660
You're the love of my life.
I can't leave you.

17
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:46,867
But you're constantly
leaving me.

18
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:50,374
<i>Imagine my disappointment
when I wake up</i>

19
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:53,534
after five years and discover
that you're no more than ordinary.

20
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:01,013
<i>There's a reason surgeons
learn to wield scalpels.</i>

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,191
<i>We like to pretend
we're hard, cold scientists.</i>

22
00:01:06,654 --> 00:01:08,884
<i>We like to pretend
we're fearless.</i>

23
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:12,382
Pick me. Choose me.

24
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,335
Love me.

25
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:18,018
<i>But the truth is, we become</i>

26
00:01:18,197 --> 00:01:20,633
<i>surgeons because
somewhere, deep down,</i>

27
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,741
<i>we think we can cut away
that which haunts us...</i>

28
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:28,992
What are you guys doing up?

29
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:30,309
Couldn't sleep.

30
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:31,715
<i>Weakness,</i>

31
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:33,283
<i>frailty...</i>

32
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:35,139
<i>Death.</i>

33
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:47,328
What is that?

34
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:50,934
My mother.

35
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,241
Happy freakin' Halloween.

36
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:07,431
You're moving out
of Burke's place?

37
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:08,792
Yes, sir.

38
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:12,407
My wife has filed for divorce.

39
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:14,970
I'm very sorry, sir.

40
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,108
At any rate,
I need a place to live.

41
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:20,264
And Burke's place...
I was there once.

42
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:22,274
I suppose actually
it's your place now?

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,506
No, It's still Burke's place.

44
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,434
Now it's yours.

45
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:40,367
What are we looking at?

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,851
Meredith put her mom in a baggie
and brought her to work.

47
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:46,555
I had to get her out of my closet.
She was haunting me.

48
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:48,788
And now she's haunting us all.

49
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:51,744
- I'm putting her to rest.
- She is cleansing.

50
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:54,843
In tribal culture, when one
wants to cleanse the past,

51
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:56,665
One cuts off all of one's hair

52
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:59,251
and buries it in the earth.
You might try that, too.

53
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:02,658
Okay, listen up.

54
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,700
Today is a holiday, which means
the pit will be overrun.

55
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:07,773
You've got the usual
drunken stupidity...

56
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:10,787
And then you've got
Seattle's annual chain saw

57
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:12,456
pumpkin carving contest.

58
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:14,596
- I love this city.
- Stay on your toes,

59
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,105
- stay on top of your interns.
- So we should round bedore

60
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:20,772
- heading to the pit or...
- Direct your questions to Dr. Bailey.

61
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:23,181
Oh, we're directing
our questions to Dr. Bailey?

62
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:25,314
Oh, not you. Just Stevens.

63
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:28,300
Why is Stevens directing
her questions to Dr. Bailey?

64
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,713
Because she's been sleeping
with my husband.

65
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:39,257
All righty, then.
Have a good day.

66
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:52,501
This is even more disturbing
than your bagful of mommy.

67
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:55,307
His medication was due
half an hour ago.

68
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:58,403
The man is living in the hospital
while he waits on a heart.

69
00:03:58,562 --> 00:03:59,659
Erin, honey.

70
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:03,223
I'm thinking it's kinda hard
for anyone to take you seriously

71
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,977
in your mouse costume.

72
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:07,103
See, I work with 5 year olds, dad.

73
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:10,042
My costume is appropriate.
Hers is not.

74
00:04:10,892 --> 00:04:12,947
Look, I'm... I'm just saying,

75
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,882
if you have time for Halloween costumes,

76
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,877
you probably have time to provide
my father with basic care.

77
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:20,222
Hi, I'm Dr. O'Malley.

78
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:22,236
We'll take care of your father
right away.

79
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:23,360
Thank you.

80
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:28,330
You should always make sure they have
their meds before you do anything else.

81
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:29,719
Thanks.

82
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:32,132
I like your costume.

83
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:34,408
Oh, well, Dr. Yang said that we c...

84
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:36,453
Dr. Yang is screwing with you.

85
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:40,773
Oh, I knew it.

86
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:44,496
Are you the doctor?

87
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:46,153
- Oh, I am.
- Good.

88
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:49,134
That's... That's good.

89
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:51,456
Is your leg hurting you?

90
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,015
It's not the leg.

91
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:54,331
It's the foot.

92
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:57,724
And it's not hurting so much
as it's not mine.

93
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:01,267
Something happened.
I can't explain it.

94
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:04,335
But this foot does
not belong to me.

95
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:11,005
It... It feels like
it's a corpse foot.

96
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:13,434
Did you lose feeling in the foot?
Is it numb?

97
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,119
No, it's... It's not numb.

98
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,441
It's just...

99
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:17,840
It's not mine.

100
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,305
Please, I'm...

101
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:22,818
I'm not crazy. I work at a bank.
I'm not crazy.

102
00:05:22,996 --> 00:05:24,433
Please. I need a surgeon.

103
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,536
I need you to get me a surgeon
who will remove it.

104
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,753
A surgeon who will
remove your foot?

105
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:33,468
A surgeon who will amputate

106
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:36,521
your seemingly healthy foot?

107
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,328
- What is that?
- It's charts.

108
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,703
- It's my mom.
- What?

109
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:53,956
I had her in the cubby,
she was freaking people out.

110
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:55,734
I was just gonna go put her in the car.

111
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:58,157
You think that's disrespectful,
to leave her in the car?

112
00:05:58,288 --> 00:05:59,492
It's a little...

113
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:00,849
It's not that strange.

114
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,931
I'm trying to figure out
how to put her to rest.

115
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:06,304
I can't shove her in the back
of my closet anymore.

116
00:06:06,424 --> 00:06:08,069
I have to deal with her. And...

117
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:09,522
This is me...

118
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:11,578
trying to evolve.

119
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,353
I'm trying here.
So...

120
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:15,109
Cubby or car?

121
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:18,327
You're asking me if I think
you should put your mom's ashes

122
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:19,959
in your cubby or your car?

123
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,672
And you don't think that's very strange?

124
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:24,916
Are those really
your mom's ashes?

125
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:26,889
It's strange, right?
It's strange.

126
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:28,933
Are you lost?

127
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:31,119
No, my mom works
in the cafeteria.

128
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:33,878
She said I could come up here
and look for Dr. Sloan.

129
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:35,127
Do you know him?

130
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,972
Um, can you take care of him?

131
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:39,931
Yeah.
Can you take care of her?

132
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,469
Good morning.

133
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,872
Don't do that.
Don't smile at me.

134
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:52,891
Don't smile at her.
Don't smile at me, either.

135
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:54,880
We're on to you.
We've compared notes.

136
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:57,222
Compared notes? Really?

137
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,166
Compared notes,
compared pickup lines,

138
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,480
- compared techniques.
- Techniques?

139
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,330
Identical.

140
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:05,546
- Identical?
- We formed a club.

141
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,951
Nurses unite against Mark Sloan.

142
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,145
Are there any club activities?

143
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:20,742
Man. You would not believe
what just happened to me.

144
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:23,144
- There's a kid looking for you.
- What?

145
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:26,273
Daddy?

146
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,095
What?

147
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,616
- Nicely done.
- Thanks.

148
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:36,466
- I'll be getting you back for that.
- Looking forward to it.

149
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:38,992
You're not my father.

150
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:41,699
But I am hoping
you'll build me some ears.

151
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:46,590
Dr. Karev, request for you.
Curtain three.

152
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:50,074
Dr. Karev, I'm feeling
a little under the weather.

153
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:52,770
And rather than risk
spreading germs to the patients,

154
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:54,460
I thought I'd head home for the day.

155
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,985
Do you want to be a surgeon

156
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:58,215
or do you want to go to bed?
It's one or the other.

157
00:07:58,335 --> 00:08:00,538
Surgeons stand up through
10-, 12-, 15-hour surgeries

158
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:03,476
without food, without bathroom breaks,
without complaints.

159
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:06,900
Surgeons do not go home because
we have a tickle in our throat.

160
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:10,689
It's not a tickle
in my throat as much...

161
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,048
- Make yourself busy, Norman.
- Right.

162
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:21,645
All the moms in my town,

163
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:23,652
they all dress up for Halloween.

164
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:25,664
So I was thinking what would I...

165
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:29,119
want to be if I had to dress up
or what I...

166
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,037
And the only thing

167
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:34,952
I could come up with,
the only thing that I wanted to be...

168
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:36,774
...was Ava.

169
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:03,198
You found him.

170
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:05,193
You two know each other?

171
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:06,977
You know his parents?

172
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,135
His mom works in the cafeteria.

173
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:12,206
- What's all this?
- Letters from the kids in my class.

174
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:13,587
Letters to me.

175
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:15,623
He has the internal structure
to hear,

176
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:18,681
he just doesn't have a canal
or external structure.

177
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:21,196
So I thought if I came in
with my letters,

178
00:09:21,534 --> 00:09:24,801
Dr. Sloan might feel sorry for me
and do the surgery for free.

179
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:27,059
Uh, look, I'd like to help,

180
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:29,352
I would if I could,
but pro bono surgery...

181
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:31,700
You should probably know,
on my way here this morning,

182
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,866
three different people
thought I was in a costume.

183
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:36,974
My head looks like
a permanent Halloween costume.

184
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:40,566
Just thought
you should know that.

185
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:42,209
You're good.

186
00:09:42,894 --> 00:09:46,196
Pro bono surgery is not just
about me giving you my time.

187
00:09:46,316 --> 00:09:48,590
A surgery like this
requires O.R. time,

188
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,862
an anesthesiologist,
a general surgeon

189
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,695
to remove the cartilage from your ribs,

190
00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:55,019
at least two surgical nurses.

191
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:56,906
Couldn't you ask them for help?

192
00:09:58,024 --> 00:10:00,765
I could, but I don't have
any social capital.

193
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:02,835
The nurses hate me.
They've formed a club

194
00:10:02,955 --> 00:10:04,504
that's all about hating me.

195
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,979
And the other doctors
don't owe me any favors 'cause

196
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,604
I've never done any for them.

197
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:11,627
I'm sorry.
I wish I could help.

198
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:14,766
I would if I could.

199
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:19,981
I have social capital.

200
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,404
Or I don't. Nobody knows me,
but they knew my mother.

201
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:26,197
So maybe I can make this happen.

202
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:28,618
Fine, make it happen.
You manage that,

203
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:30,111
I'm all yours.

204
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:34,073
These people
who knew your mother,

205
00:10:34,796 --> 00:10:37,275
do they know you brought her
to work in a baggie?

206
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,014
Oh, you...

207
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,057
You didn't come for me. You...

208
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,335
You chickened out.

209
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:59,424
When I... When I was leaving,
when I was...

210
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:03,108
When I asked you to give me
a reason to stay,

211
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:04,942
you chickened out, which I get.

212
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,430
I get that. It was a lot.

213
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:10,255
It was scary, and I know
I can be kinda intense,

214
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,344
but I thought... I thought...

215
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,928
I thought
after the chickening out part,

216
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:17,259
I thought...

217
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:19,352
You would come for me.

218
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:24,882
I came back for you,
which basically...

219
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:27,267
makes me a beggar.

220
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,800
I'm a beggar for Halloween.

221
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:31,687
Now you're mocking me.

222
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,105
I'm not mocking you.

223
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,388
We need...

224
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,806
to talk.

225
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:46,027
We will.

226
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:50,316
Body dysmorphic disorder?

227
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:52,316
You can prescribe him
some antianxiety meds

228
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:54,887
to try to lessen
the urgency he's feeling.

229
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:58,035
The man is requesting
an amputation,

230
00:11:58,222 --> 00:12:01,218
and the best you can come up with
is antianxiety meds?

231
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,020
Dr. Bailey.

232
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:06,290
Chain saw contest time?

233
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:07,492
Yep.

234
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,426
Mr. Miller.

235
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:11,937
I have to get to the E.R.

236
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:14,810
But I'm gonna write you
a prescription

237
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,968
for some medication
I think may help you.

238
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:19,428
Medication? I need...
I need a surgeon.

239
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:21,304
A surgeon can take off the foot.

240
00:12:21,661 --> 00:12:22,769
Get me a surgeon!

241
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:25,528
I am a surgeon,
and I can tell you right now

242
00:12:25,648 --> 00:12:27,774
that you won't persuade me
or any other surgeon

243
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,906
to do what you're asking.
Please try this medication.

244
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,637
I have an earless boy.

245
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,987
- I'm sorry?
- Sloan has agreed

246
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:41,126
to build him ears pro bono

247
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,831
if you will donate the O.R.
And all the equipment...

248
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:47,801
I'm sorry, Grey.
My pro bono slate is full.

249
00:12:47,978 --> 00:12:49,640
There are protocols
to be followed,

250
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:51,922
- all sorts of red tape...
- Trick or treat.

251
00:12:52,797 --> 00:12:54,555
Get it?
He's trick-or-treating...

252
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:55,698
For ears.

253
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:59,065
- Grey...
- You know, my mother,

254
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:01,476
she was big
on pro bono surgeries.

255
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:08,462
O.R. 2 is free at 6:00 p.m.

256
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:10,425
Thank you.

257
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:17,804
If you two need to talk,
I could wait over there.

258
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:20,442
Why? It's not like we have
any secrets anymore.

259
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:22,804
Callie told everyone.
Everyone.

260
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:24,688
Yeah, it's gonna be a long day.

261
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:26,264
Erin Shanley, 34,

262
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:28,750
massive head trauma when a brick
came through her windshield.

263
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:31,420
- G.C.S. of 3 in the field.
- A brick came through her windshield?

264
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,652
Kids were screwing around
on a bridge, halloween crap.

265
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:36,515
- I'm looking at brain matter here.
- I checked. She's a donor.

266
00:13:38,393 --> 00:13:39,942
- Oh, my god.
- What?

267
00:13:40,374 --> 00:13:43,062
Her father's on three.
He's waiting for a new heart.

268
00:13:45,255 --> 00:13:46,851
It was awesome.

269
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:49,949
It was the sickest pumpkin head
you ever saw.

270
00:13:50,773 --> 00:13:53,601
And then the next thing you know,
it's like, blood gushing,

271
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:55,439
and it totally stained
my pumpkin head.

272
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:58,236
- You don't say?
- Made it even sicker, though.

273
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:01,848
- I brought it in... The digit.
- Oh, you have the finger?

274
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:04,834
Yeah, but it's, like,
lodged in the chain saw.

275
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:06,711
Wait.

276
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,092
It was right here.

277
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,387
- Who took my saw?
- What? Sir, the cut isn't clean enough

278
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:13,950
- to consider re...
- Yo, who took my saw?

279
00:14:20,247 --> 00:14:21,355
Oh, no.

280
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,962
- What is that noise?
- I have no idea.

281
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,230
Dude! Sick!

282
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,969
Interior nerve is shot.
There's nothing salvageable here.

283
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:40,531
Completely mangled.

284
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:42,904
I can't believe he held that saw
to his leg long enough...

285
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:44,630
- Was he high?
- No, I just gave him

286
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,092
some morphine for the pain, but
the tox screen was clean before that.

287
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:49,688
Unbelievable.

288
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:52,056
All right, I'll finish the job.

289
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:54,517
Yang, go ahead and prep him
for complete amputation.

290
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:56,160
Thank you.

291
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:58,170
Thank you so much.

292
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,312
Hey, you okay?

293
00:15:00,782 --> 00:15:03,507
Severed limbs don't sit well with me.
Just a little queasy is all.

294
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:05,580
But I'm fine.
I'll help Dr. Yang.

295
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:11,642
Gotta love Halloween...

296
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:14,412
When all the crazies
come out to play.

297
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:18,493
I kind of get it. I mean, I get
that you can wake up one day,

298
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,739
and your life doesn't
feel le your own.

299
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:22,317
I heard...

300
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:24,082
About your marriage.

301
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,236
And if there's anything you need
me to do to cheer you up,

302
00:15:28,865 --> 00:15:29,916
I'm around,

303
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:31,836
day or night...

304
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,135
Night in particular.

305
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:35,844
I was married.

306
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:38,976
I said "Till death do us part," okay?
In a church.

307
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:41,988
I mean, it was the church of Elvis,
but still it was a church.

308
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:43,607
I just...

309
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:45,936
I can't believe this is my life.

310
00:15:49,553 --> 00:15:50,620
I don't understand.

311
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,215
How did this happen?
How could this happen?

312
00:15:56,316 --> 00:15:58,579
Injuries like these
happen very quickly.

313
00:15:58,954 --> 00:16:00,954
She probably
didn't feel any pain at all.

314
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:03,580
Mr. Shanley.

315
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:07,842
According to Erin's driver's license...

316
00:16:08,707 --> 00:16:10,123
She was an organ donor.

317
00:16:12,276 --> 00:16:13,881
And as next of kin,

318
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:17,919
if you agree to take her off
of life support,

319
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,623
you could direct the heart
to yourself.

320
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:27,721
She is young, she was healthy.

321
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:29,843
She would be a perfect match
for you, sir.

322
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,795
Could you just please go away?

323
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:34,575
- Mr. Shanley, if you would just...
- Please, go away.

324
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:35,899
Please.

325
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:40,595
Dr. O'Malley will bring you
to see your daughter

326
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:42,511
if you like.

327
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:53,991
Oh, so sorry.
Excuse me. You okay?

328
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:55,745
No apology necessary.

329
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:58,801
I'm Sydney, by the way.
Dr. Sydney Heron. General surgery.

330
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:00,491
Big fan of your work. Yeah.

331
00:17:00,611 --> 00:17:02,583
We were seated together
once at an M&M.

332
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:05,241
Anyway, now seems
as good a time as any

333
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:07,215
to make it official...
Our introduction.

334
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:08,773
Ah, Derek Shepherd.

335
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:11,207
- Pleasure.
- It's very, very nice to meet you.

336
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:12,879
Nice meeting you, too.

337
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:18,979
You think she's pretty?

338
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,772
Yeah. I like cheerful people.

339
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:22,992
I can be cheerful.

340
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:25,779
I think the ashes thing
makes that kinda unlikely.

341
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:28,593
Dr. Bailey,

342
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:32,818
we're gonna help rebuild
a little boy's ears today, pro bono.

343
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:35,406
And I thought maybe
you could donate some time.

344
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:37,806
Thanks to the fine,
upstanding citizen

345
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:41,043
who cut off his foot on my watch,
I've got a mountain of paperwork.

346
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:43,255
On top of that, I promised

347
00:17:43,443 --> 00:17:44,865
to try and get out here in time

348
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:47,050
to see my son
in his Halloween costume.

349
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:49,638
Is Tuck even old enough
to know what Halloween is?

350
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:53,168
He's not, but his father is,
and that's who I promised.

351
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,977
Trick or treat.

352
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,198
For ears?
He's trick-or-treating for ears?

353
00:18:04,644 --> 00:18:08,150
Could you also persuade some of
the surgical nurses to help out?

354
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:10,216
They seem to really like you.

355
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:13,382
- Trick or treat.
- Stop that.

356
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,147
All right, I'm in.

357
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,863
She's warm.
It doesn't make sense.

358
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:31,901
I'm sorry.

359
00:18:33,193 --> 00:18:35,344
She's breathing
with the help of machines.

360
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:38,410
Erin, the persn that you knew,

361
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:41,526
isn't there anymore.

362
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:53,214
Would you bring the paperwork?

363
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:58,033
You can have her...
Have her...

364
00:18:58,315 --> 00:19:00,165
Her organs.
That's what she wanted.

365
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:02,719
And her heart?

366
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:07,940
Give it to someone else.

367
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:14,467
We could scatter her off the roof.

368
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,927
She was afraid of heights.

369
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,180
They're ashes, Meredith.
The ashes aren't acrophobic.

370
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:24,521
I need to put my mother to rest.
I need to not become her.

371
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:27,359
I need to not die emotionally
crippled and alone.

372
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,286
And I need to not...

373
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:32,063
attend the wedding
of Derek Shepherd and Sydney Heron.

374
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,067
I need to put my mother to rest.

375
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:35,710
Sydney Heron?

376
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,187
Just ask.

377
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,897
So you two are together?

378
00:19:57,887 --> 00:19:59,964
Like "together" together,
in love together?

379
00:20:00,084 --> 00:20:01,653
Sexy love, not sibling love?

380
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:05,109
Yes. Yeah.
We're together.

381
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:07,231
And...

382
00:20:07,422 --> 00:20:08,699
you two have been...

383
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:11,047
I mean, without any of us knowing...

384
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,444
Doing this the whole time?

385
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,981
Just once.

386
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,094
I said she could ask questions.

387
00:20:18,804 --> 00:20:19,933
Just once.

388
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,180
And now we're waiting to...

389
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:23,722
Be together...

390
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:26,793
- Out of respect.
- For Callie's feelings.

391
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,104
She's not judging.

392
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:36,278
Right.

393
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,662
I have an earless boy
waiting for me.

394
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:45,530
But...

395
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:48,501
I'm happy for you guys.

396
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:01,550
- Do you have to go?
- No.

397
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:04,752
Norman can get by for
a few more minutes without me.

398
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,125
How are you?
I mean...

399
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:10,750
How have you been?

400
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,111
I'm in love with my daughter.

401
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:14,763
She's perfect. She's...

402
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:18,043
She sucks on her fingers.
It's her new thing.

403
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:19,721
And she makes, like this...

404
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,269
perfect little cartoon suckling sound.

405
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:26,037
And your husband?

406
00:21:28,824 --> 00:21:31,190
My husband's in love
with my daughter, too.

407
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:36,207
You look tired.

408
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:38,244
I haven't been sleeping much.

409
00:21:39,361 --> 00:21:41,098
I haven't been sleeping much either.

410
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,853
The baby wakes up all the time.

411
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:46,447
Not as much now
that I figured out that...

412
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,258
if wrap her in whatever shirt
I'm wearing...

413
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:51,423
She smells you.

414
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:54,418
And she sleeps.

415
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,566
What are we doing?

416
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,388
What are we gonna do?

417
00:22:15,181 --> 00:22:16,237
Dr. Hahn.

418
00:22:16,357 --> 00:22:18,112
Thank you for coming
at such short notice.

419
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,780
Not a problem.
Are we harvesting the heart for UNOS,

420
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,126
or is the recipient here?

421
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:25,173
I'm hoping the recipient is here,
but he hasn't agreed yet.

422
00:22:25,884 --> 00:22:28,004
I've never had much trouble
talking a heart patient

423
00:22:28,124 --> 00:22:29,551
into taking a heart.

424
00:22:30,605 --> 00:22:32,041
It's his daughter's heart.

425
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:33,932
Okay.

426
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:37,178
Get him to OR 2 and page torres.

427
00:22:37,362 --> 00:22:39,261
- OK. Where are you going?
- <i>His daughter...</i>

428
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:42,356
- What's Hahn doing here?
- <i>She's been declared brain dead...</i>

429
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:43,634
Heart transplant.

430
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:45,466
Don't think about it.
It's my patient.

431
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:48,094
Dr. Hahn, I understand
you're doing a heart transplant today,

432
00:22:48,214 --> 00:22:49,866
and I thought I'd volunteer to scrub in.

433
00:22:49,986 --> 00:22:52,080
Isobel Stevens.
She's my patient, the donor.

434
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,371
So if you need any information,
I have it, all of it.

435
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:56,186
She's... She's my patient.

436
00:22:56,827 --> 00:22:59,355
You've got some eager
junior residents around here.

437
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:00,620
Lucky me.

438
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:02,458
Take your pick.

439
00:23:03,442 --> 00:23:05,423
Well, Yang, I appreciate the offer,

440
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,310
but I date men.

441
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,296
So I don't think
you'll be able to impress me

442
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,861
the way you've impressed
your mentors in the past.

443
00:23:13,381 --> 00:23:15,540
- What?
- You sleep with them, right?

444
00:23:15,731 --> 00:23:18,304
Preston Burke, Colin Marlowe...
That's your thing.

445
00:23:18,853 --> 00:23:20,018
It's my...

446
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:24,270
It's... I'm sorry. What does
that have to do with anything?

447
00:23:24,552 --> 00:23:27,451
My theory is if you had
the chops in the OR,

448
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:30,348
you wouldn't need to try
to impress in the bedroom.

449
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:32,583
- Stevens, is it?
- It is.

450
00:23:32,768 --> 00:23:34,073
Let's go, Stevens.

451
00:23:39,823 --> 00:23:41,485
I bust my ass here,

452
00:23:41,675 --> 00:23:43,902
and Burke skips town
with my cardio reputation.

453
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,789
So now instead of
a heart transplant,

454
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:48,709
I get to participate in the amputation
of a crazy man's foot.

455
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,177
- I'm not...
- Crazy.

456
00:23:50,515 --> 00:23:52,327
Cutting off your foot is crazy.

457
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:54,885
Walking through your life
like you have no power,

458
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:57,991
like you have no say...
No say in your own destiny...

459
00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:01,108
Like you have no control
over your own body,

460
00:24:01,464 --> 00:24:04,628
walking through life
likethatis what's crazy.

461
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:09,805
I still think it's cutting off your foot
with a chain saw that's crazy.

462
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:15,554
Mr. Shanley, I'm Dr. Hahn.

463
00:24:16,044 --> 00:24:20,325
The transplant team is in place
if you're ready to say good-bye.

464
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,782
You must not have children.

465
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,462
- I'm sorry?
- If you had children

466
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:30,923
you'd never say it. You'd never say
"If you're ready to say good-bye."

467
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,369
Mr. Shanley, I'm very sorry,

468
00:24:36,545 --> 00:24:39,382
but I want to suggest
one last time...

469
00:24:39,502 --> 00:24:41,277
No, I am not taking her heart.

470
00:24:41,407 --> 00:24:43,728
I can't have my daughter's heart
beating in my chest.

471
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:46,026
It would haunt me
every day of my life. No!

472
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:47,838
All right.

473
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:51,180
I'm very sorry for your loss.

474
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:55,272
Page me when he's ready.

475
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:02,874
Mr. Shanley...

476
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,580
I don't have kids,

477
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,730
so I don't know
what it's like to lose a child,

478
00:25:07,862 --> 00:25:09,875
but I do know what it's like
to lose a parent.

479
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,173
Your daughter loved you.
I saw her this morning.

480
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:14,947
She was fighting for you.

481
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:17,660
She was fighting for your life.

482
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:19,751
You're her dad.

483
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:23,606
You're her dad.
She didn't want to leave you.

484
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:25,157
I know that.

485
00:25:26,362 --> 00:25:29,280
I also know that she would
want you to have her heart.

486
00:25:35,774 --> 00:25:38,281
I would've given my dad
my heart if I could.

487
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,934
If I could've saved him...

488
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:47,039
I would've given him my heart.

489
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:04,272
All right.

490
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,418
- It's not my fault Hahn chose me.
- Whatever.

491
00:26:14,538 --> 00:26:16,348
I can't believe that you are judging me.

492
00:26:16,526 --> 00:26:19,399
That after what Hahn said to you,
that you are judging me.

493
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:21,785
- It's not the same thing.
- It is the same thing.

494
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:23,503
It's exactly the same thing.

495
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:28,582
I'm sorry that I hurt Callie.
I didn't mean to hurt her.

496
00:26:28,876 --> 00:26:31,849
You slept with her husband.
I slept with my boyfriend.

497
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:33,361
It's not the same thing.

498
00:26:33,674 --> 00:26:35,965
Meredith slept
with another woman's husband.

499
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:39,655
Meredith slept
with another woman's husband.

500
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:41,724
The two of you are like
this closed circle.

501
00:26:41,844 --> 00:26:45,433
You can commit whatever crime you want,
in your little circle, it's all fine.

502
00:26:47,346 --> 00:26:50,106
I know that you didn't
sleep with Burke to get ahead.

503
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:52,345
And if Hahn had asked me,

504
00:26:52,682 --> 00:26:54,136
I would've defended you.

505
00:26:54,737 --> 00:26:57,404
I'm not even asking you to defend me.
I'm asking you to just...

506
00:26:57,712 --> 00:26:59,370
cut me an inch of slack.

507
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:03,501
And believe me when I say
that I am sorry I hurt Callie.

508
00:27:05,903 --> 00:27:07,565
We are not a closed circle.

509
00:27:09,941 --> 00:27:11,039
You are.

510
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,287
Dr. Shepherd.
Here's a question...

511
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:21,694
Were there actual shepherds
in your lineage?

512
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:23,523
- Sorry. What?
- You know, shepherds.

513
00:27:23,682 --> 00:27:26,076
The ones who watch over sheep.
I mean the geneology.

514
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:28,299
My name for example,
not actually after the bird...

515
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:30,254
You know, I'm sorry.
Would you excuse me?

516
00:27:30,374 --> 00:27:31,820
- Of course.
- Okay, thank you.

517
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:34,062
Yeah, you did this.

518
00:27:34,241 --> 00:27:36,451
- Payback's a bitch.
- What the hell did you tell her?

519
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,402
I put the word out that you
were lookin'.

520
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:40,256
- That I'm looking?
- Lookin'.

521
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:42,394
It sounds way dirtier without the "g."

522
00:27:42,516 --> 00:27:43,990
You wonder why they formed a club?

523
00:27:44,136 --> 00:27:45,803
- You heard about that?
- Yeah.

524
00:27:47,297 --> 00:27:49,778
Okay, so we have
one plastic surgeon,

525
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:52,596
a general surgeon,
an anesthesiologist,

526
00:27:52,716 --> 00:27:56,302
one, two, three scrub nurses
and an OR.

527
00:27:57,215 --> 00:27:59,832
Let's call your mom, kid.
You're gonna get some ears.

528
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:08,012
He cut off his foot.

529
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,639
Yeah.

530
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:11,570
He cut off his perfectly good foot.

531
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,849
Well, people do
some very strange things.

532
00:28:16,474 --> 00:28:18,174
I had the world' shortest marriage.

533
00:28:21,024 --> 00:28:22,545
I was left in a church

534
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:25,205
while I was literally wearing
a wedding dress.

535
00:28:31,152 --> 00:28:33,054
George cheated on me
right in front of me,

536
00:28:33,174 --> 00:28:34,282
and I missed it.

537
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:38,858
Burke sent his mother to say
good-bye to me.

538
00:28:40,736 --> 00:28:42,305
I'm gonna be a divorcée.

539
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,713
Now Erica Hahn thinks I'm a fraud.

540
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:45,988
I'm...

541
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:47,612
I'm not feeling very...

542
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,766
- Crap.
- What?

543
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,127
My intern, something happened.

544
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:11,586
I don't know what.

545
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:12,971
We need to talk.

546
00:29:13,342 --> 00:29:15,495
Well, we will.
I'll come back. Okay?

547
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,100
Okay.

548
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:21,187
Don't chicken out.

549
00:29:24,928 --> 00:29:26,213
You know, I'm impressed.

550
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:28,255
I didn't think you'd pull this off.

551
00:29:28,438 --> 00:29:30,139
I'm actually
pretty surprised myself,

552
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:32,823
considering it was
my first time trick-or-treating.

553
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,039
Your first time?

554
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,565
Yeah. My mom never made it
home in time to take me,

555
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:39,093
never got it together
to make me a costume.

556
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:42,357
Plus she said it was rude
to knock on people's doors

557
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:43,603
and beg for food.

558
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:50,715
What?

559
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,258
Just...

560
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:56,241
The apple fell pretty far
from the tree, huh?

561
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,307
- Dr. Karev, you want to slow down?
- I just heard.

562
00:30:16,822 --> 00:30:18,314
- Did he have a stroke?
- He did.

563
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:21,176
3 inches to the left,
he'd never talk again.

564
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:23,217
- It's gonna be okay, right?
- No way to know

565
00:30:23,337 --> 00:30:25,123
till we get the clot out
and he wakes up.

566
00:30:25,377 --> 00:30:27,880
- But he's gonna be okay...
- Karev, stop talking.

567
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,196
Is your marriage really over?

568
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:45,807
Yeah.

569
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,018
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

570
00:30:50,546 --> 00:30:53,203
Did Meredith really bring
her mom's ashes to work?

571
00:31:16,035 --> 00:31:17,415
Look at that.

572
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:19,758
Not a bad day's work.

573
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:25,623
Paddles.

574
00:31:30,437 --> 00:31:31,921
Let's see what we've got.

575
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,102
There it is.

576
00:31:47,377 --> 00:31:48,447
There it is.

577
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:50,612
Come on. Norman...

578
00:31:50,732 --> 00:31:51,767
Come on, man...

579
00:31:52,392 --> 00:31:53,700
come on, come on.

580
00:31:58,913 --> 00:31:59,946
What happened?

581
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:09,361
I just saw a heart transplant.

582
00:32:09,754 --> 00:32:12,167
I just helped build
a little boy some ears.

583
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,729
That's cool.

584
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:15,034
Yeah.

585
00:32:16,012 --> 00:32:17,486
I dug up my mom's cat.

586
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:20,737
What?

587
00:32:21,537 --> 00:32:23,623
My mom didn't leave
any instructions

588
00:32:23,743 --> 00:32:25,245
'cause it was so...

589
00:32:26,002 --> 00:32:27,039
Unexpected.

590
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:28,908
So...

591
00:32:29,105 --> 00:32:31,531
We had to figure out on our own
what she would have wanted.

592
00:32:31,651 --> 00:32:34,307
And... my mom loved that cat.

593
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,576
So... I dug her up...

594
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:38,071
The cat...

595
00:32:38,473 --> 00:32:40,656
From her little grave
in our backyard.

596
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:44,084
And I snuck into the cemetery
in the middle of the night

597
00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:47,133
and reburied her
right beside my mom.

598
00:32:47,851 --> 00:32:49,203
And it was...

599
00:32:49,522 --> 00:32:51,457
creepy and morbid,

600
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:53,335
carrying around a dead,

601
00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:55,577
decaying cat in the cemetery

602
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,652
in the middle of the night, but...

603
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:01,722
It made my mom really happy.

604
00:33:03,229 --> 00:33:04,301
At least...

605
00:33:04,968 --> 00:33:06,311
I like to think it did.

606
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:10,852
Thanks.

607
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,183
You're welcome.

608
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:16,428
Look, Tucker, I said I'm sorry.

609
00:33:16,957 --> 00:33:17,980
No.

610
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:19,377
I didn't...

611
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:21,978
No, I...

612
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:24,901
Tucker...

613
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:30,386
Perfect.

614
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:37,942
Hi.

615
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,456
We just put a man's daughter's heart
in his chest.

616
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,955
His daughter's heart?

617
00:33:52,311 --> 00:33:54,865
Well, that just makes you
want to throw up, now doesn't it?

618
00:33:58,026 --> 00:33:59,218
You all right?

619
00:34:05,742 --> 00:34:07,594
You're Dr. Bailey.
You hear everything.

620
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,489
And if you haven't heard everything,
I'm sure you've heard.

621
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:13,492
About your marriage?
Yeah, I probably would've.

622
00:34:16,906 --> 00:34:17,986
I'm sorry...

623
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,755
If I...

624
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,641
disappointed you.

625
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:24,875
I'm not your mother, O'Malley.

626
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,696
I have to apologize
to her now, too.

627
00:34:38,387 --> 00:34:40,105
Look, you're not a bad guy.

628
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:43,535
I don't mean to let you off the hook
entirely, because what you did

629
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:45,216
was unkind,

630
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:48,044
and hurtful and wrong.

631
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:50,523
But you're not a bad guy.

632
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,537
I'm just saying, it...

633
00:34:53,043 --> 00:34:54,170
It takes two.

634
00:34:55,063 --> 00:34:58,002
To reach the point
you reached in your marriage,

635
00:34:58,576 --> 00:34:59,670
it takes two.

636
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,605
I mean... I mean, I'm here
late at night, Halloween,

637
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,833
helping an earless boy get ears,

638
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:11,078
and my husband wants to act
like that ain't an important thing.

639
00:35:11,505 --> 00:35:12,820
He wants to act like...

640
00:35:13,948 --> 00:35:15,300
It isn't a good thing

641
00:35:15,517 --> 00:35:16,637
that I did today.

642
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,514
Now that isn't just on me.

643
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:21,441
That's him wanting things
to be the way he wants.

644
00:35:21,647 --> 00:35:24,295
That's him wanting things
to be purely black-and-white.

645
00:35:27,046 --> 00:35:29,104
I mean, I missed my son's...

646
00:35:29,524 --> 00:35:30,845
first Halloween,

647
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:34,643
and my heart is aching
inside of my chest,

648
00:35:34,763 --> 00:35:36,773
but, you know,
that doesn't mean anything.

649
00:35:37,672 --> 00:35:40,585
It doesn't count because
in a black-and-white world,

650
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:42,888
I simply didn't make it home,

651
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:45,031
and that makes me the bad guy.

652
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:47,574
Always.
I'm always the bad guy.

653
00:35:48,473 --> 00:35:49,746
You hear what I'm saying?

654
00:35:57,732 --> 00:36:00,276
Sorry you missed
your son's first Halloween.

655
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:05,389
Look, what I'm saying to you is...

656
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:08,369
Okay, I was there.

657
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:09,741
All right? I was there...

658
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:12,003
the day your father died.

659
00:36:12,123 --> 00:36:13,173
I was there

660
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,120
when you came back from Vegas,

661
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,066
married after a week and...

662
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:21,931
All I'm saying is...

663
00:36:22,978 --> 00:36:24,818
It's not black-and-white...

664
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:28,448
And you're not a bad guy.

665
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:45,273
I did not sleep my way to the top.

666
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,612
I'm attracted to a talent
that resembles my own,

667
00:36:47,732 --> 00:36:49,572
not that it's any of your business.

668
00:36:49,715 --> 00:36:52,213
Your comments were
unprofessional and inappropriate.

669
00:36:52,456 --> 00:36:53,689
You know what? You're...

670
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,415
inappropriate
and unprofessional.

671
00:36:56,946 --> 00:36:59,602
This is gonna be so much fun.

672
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:01,117
Dr. Yang,

673
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,295
did you hear?
Dr. Hahn has agreed

674
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:05,715
to become our new head
of cardiothoracic surgery.

675
00:37:08,858 --> 00:37:10,755
Lookin' forward to it, Dr. Yang.

676
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,014
You can't have my apartment.

677
00:37:20,937 --> 00:37:21,963
I'm...

678
00:37:22,402 --> 00:37:24,920
sorry I didn't listen when you said
you weren't feeling well.

679
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,683
Sorry, I didn't answer your page.

680
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:29,489
Do you know why I chose surgery?

681
00:37:30,745 --> 00:37:32,210
I'm a little south of 60

682
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:33,947
and blood makes me squeamish.

683
00:37:34,278 --> 00:37:36,372
I wanted to go into psych
because I like to talk.

684
00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:37,887
I've noticed that.

685
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:42,160
But I had this voice in my head
telling me to choose surgery.

686
00:37:43,322 --> 00:37:44,395
It was as if...

687
00:37:45,713 --> 00:37:47,995
my Mary Beth
was whispering in my ear.

688
00:37:49,626 --> 00:37:50,819
And so I listened.

689
00:37:51,176 --> 00:37:53,007
And do you know
what I think now?

690
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:58,529
I think I was about to have
a massive stroke...

691
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,429
and my Mary Beth wanted me
to be surrounded by...

692
00:38:04,123 --> 00:38:06,424
world-class surgeons
when it happened.

693
00:38:11,226 --> 00:38:12,766
So what are you gonna do now?

694
00:38:13,388 --> 00:38:14,833
Well, I'm gonna go into psych.

695
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:17,227
Because you people, you surgeons,

696
00:38:18,103 --> 00:38:19,747
You're just
a bunch of little children

697
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:23,062
running around with your scalpels
and your severed feet and your...

698
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,031
inappropriate sex
in inappropriate places.

699
00:38:26,715 --> 00:38:28,161
You all need a good shrink.

700
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:37,813
Dr. Grey?

701
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:44,161
I had a goldfish,

702
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,629
and when he died,
we flushed him down the toilet,

703
00:38:47,414 --> 00:38:48,541
back to the sea.

704
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,260
Okay.

705
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,408
Back to the sea
is better than your cubby.

706
00:39:10,685 --> 00:39:11,758
You okay?

707
00:39:12,443 --> 00:39:15,270
I don't know if I can handle
one more night in that hotel.

708
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,480
What's the matter with you?

709
00:39:25,985 --> 00:39:27,469
I have to start dating.

710
00:39:31,594 --> 00:39:33,191
<i>It isn't just surgeons.</i>

711
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:40,072
<i>The truth is, I don't know anyone
who isn't haunted by something...</i>

712
00:39:42,877 --> 00:39:44,576
<i>Or someone.</i>

713
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:55,441
<i>And whether we try to slice
the pain away with a scalpel</i>

714
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,758
<i>or shove it in the back of a closet,</i>

715
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,758
<i>our efforts usually fail.</i>

716
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:08,176
We made it through this day.

717
00:40:09,428 --> 00:40:10,658
Yeah, we did.

718
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:14,761
We made it through this day.

719
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:29,615
<i>So the only way
we can clear out the cobwebs</i>

720
00:40:29,798 --> 00:40:31,350
<i>is to turn a new page...</i>

721
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:35,085
So it's the kitchen,
bedroom, bathroom.

722
00:40:35,564 --> 00:40:37,930
There's the sofa.
You can sleep here.

723
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,328
Great. So...

724
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:44,736
- Do you mind if I clean up a little?
- Yes.

725
00:40:45,653 --> 00:40:46,836
I mind a lot.

726
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:55,240
<i>Or put an old story to rest...</i>

727
00:41:09,915 --> 00:41:10,950
Grey.

728
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:13,820
Chief.

729
00:41:15,243 --> 00:41:17,835
What are you doing, Grey?
This is a sterile environment.

730
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:20,056
It's my mother.

731
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,647
And I think this is
where she'd want to be.

732
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:49,445
Should we say a prayer?

733
00:41:50,784 --> 00:41:52,352
She didn't believe in anything.

734
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,456
<i>Finally,</i>

735
00:41:54,676 --> 00:41:56,982
<i>finally to rest.</i>

736
00:41:57,292 --> 00:41:58,776
Ashes to ashes.

737
00:42:01,648 --> 00:42:02,906
Dust to dust.
