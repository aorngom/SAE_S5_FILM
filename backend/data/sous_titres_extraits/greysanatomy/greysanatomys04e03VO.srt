1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:01,842
<i>Previously</i> on Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:01,972 --> 00:00:04,366
- So, hey, you're an intern... again.
- Yeah.

3
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:07,616
- I won't tell anybody.
- Izzie, meet Really Old Guy.

4
00:00:08,494 --> 00:00:09,950
This is the best breakup ever.

5
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:11,992
Why we didn't break up
a long time ago?

6
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:14,877
- He's gone.
- <i>You're my sister, you're my family.</i>

7
00:00:15,022 --> 00:00:16,920
- You're all I've got.
- We have the same dad.

8
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:19,292
We don't have the same dad, Lexie.

9
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,161
- I think my husband's having an affair.
- I'm going to tell her.

10
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:28,498
<i>Doctors give patients
a number of things.</i>

11
00:00:28,877 --> 00:00:30,125
<i>We give them medicine,</i>

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,684
<i>we give them advice.</i>

13
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:34,800
<i>And most of the time,</i>

14
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:37,985
<i>we give them
our undivided attention.</i>

15
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:41,449
I heard he saved a guy who
coded yesterday, by himself.

16
00:00:41,914 --> 00:00:43,248
He just knows things...

17
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:45,779
Never messes up in rounds,
always has the answer.

18
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:47,142
And he's so calm.

19
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:49,756
I'm always terrified,
but he's, like, steady.

20
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:51,408
Best intern ever.

21
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,957
- Who are they talking about?
- George O'Malley.

22
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,469
Seriously?

23
00:00:56,638 --> 00:00:58,140
Don't they know that he...

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,011
<i>But by far the hardest thing
you can give a patient is the truth.</i>

25
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:06,867
You know O'Malley's got
these morons snowed?

26
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:09,852
- They don't even know he's a repeater.
- Yeah, whatever.

27
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,715
How are you today?

28
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,588
- Good.
- Great.

29
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:26,778
<i>The truth is hard.</i>

30
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:29,686
<i>The truth... is awkward.</i>

31
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:31,684
<i>And very often...</i>

32
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:34,954
<i>The truth hurts.</i>

33
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,918
- Damn it.
- Bye.

34
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:38,081
Bye.

35
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:41,051
She's doing McDreamy.

36
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:43,023
She's doing McDreamy
and lying about it.

37
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:44,806
- That's great.
- She thinks I'm weak,

38
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:47,512
that I'm fragile. Like I can't
handle it 'cause of Burke.

39
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:50,865
- Poor Cristina. All alone.
- Damn right. Poor Cristina.

40
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,019
George, what happened?

41
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:58,887
<i>I mean, people say
they want the truth.</i>

42
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:03,022
<i>But do they really?</i>

43
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:07,698
Do I have sex hair?

44
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,802
- If I did my job right.
- You go ahead.

45
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:11,744
- What?
- You go ahead. I'll wait a minute.

46
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:15,548
So this isn't just breakup sex.

47
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:18,861
This is secret breakup sex. It's about
Cristina, this morning in the elevator?

48
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:20,480
I don't know what to do, you know?

49
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,823
We don't talk about it,
the whole Burke thing.

50
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,808
I want to be a good friend.
I want to take care of her.

51
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,637
But you don't take care
of Cristina.

52
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:30,390
So by being with me,
you're cheating on Cristina?

53
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:33,716
- If she knew about you and me...
- You'd have to talk about it.

54
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:36,587
You'd have to talk about you and me,
it'd be a long conversation,

55
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:38,686
there'd be no time left
over to talk about her.

56
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:40,785
I told you, we don't talk about it.

57
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,637
Pierce, you're in the pit.
James, need you in peds.

58
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:47,238
- Laura, you're on scut.
- I was on scut yesterday.

59
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:50,190
And just for that,
you're on scut tomorrow.

60
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:51,683
Get lost.

61
00:02:52,387 --> 00:02:54,622
Dr. Karev, this is Dr. Norman Shales.

62
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:57,621
A strong handshake.
That's a good sign.

63
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,592
Norman is transferring in from UCLA.
I want him to work with you.

64
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,917
Are you the new O.b.-G.Y.N. guy?

65
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:05,839
- I don't have a specialty yet.
- Norman is an intern.

66
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:08,873
You'll be his resident.

67
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,545
He's my intern?

68
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:13,850
Don't worry, son. This tugboat's
ready to pull his own weight.

69
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:17,013
- Age is just a number, right, Norman?
- Absolutely.

70
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:18,984
Pretty important number.

71
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,530
You okay?

72
00:03:25,112 --> 00:03:26,158
I don't know.

73
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:28,143
I think it's all just hitting me...

74
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,909
Stupid Burke dumping me

75
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:32,240
and then stupid Mama

76
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:35,696
coming to reclaim her...
magic necklace.

77
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:40,144
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No, not really,

78
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:41,861
not... Yet.

79
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,728
- If there's anything I can do...
- I just wish I had a...

80
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:47,129
good, bloody surgery.

81
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:49,851
You know, bloody surgeries
make me feel better.

82
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:55,832
One, two, three, four...
Follow me.

83
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:03,450
Joanne, this is why you and
I need to get sick, these doctors.

84
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,321
One's more handsome than the next.

85
00:04:05,597 --> 00:04:08,320
And here comes the handsomest
one of them all.

86
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:10,116
- Hi, Dr. Webber.
- Connie.

87
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:12,147
He took my appendix out
3 years ago.

88
00:04:12,277 --> 00:04:13,564
Barely left a scar.

89
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:15,197
How's Adele?

90
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:17,244
She's good, good.

91
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,288
Marriage is hard.

92
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:21,838
But we're dating again.

93
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,763
And she agreed
to date me tonight.

94
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:28,764
But... More importantly,
How are you doing?

95
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,543
Oh, I just had a little bump
on my tongue removed is all.

96
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:34,459
Couple of taste buds. Turns out
it was a little touch of cancer.

97
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:36,242
So I'm here to have
the rest out.

98
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:38,607
You know, the cancer,
not the taste buds.

99
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:41,378
I don't know exactly
how bad it is

100
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:43,885
because Dr. Sloan over there
has been awfully quiet.

101
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:46,301
'Cause you don't let him
get a word in edgewise is why.

102
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:48,556
How is she, Dr. Sloan?

103
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:51,267
We just got back
The pathology report. Connie...

104
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,741
unfortunately, the cancer is a bit
more widespread than we'd hoped.

105
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:57,896
It's over 60% of your tongue.

106
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:01,000
Well, what...
What does she do, chemo?

107
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:04,820
I think the best bet
is a microvascular free flap.

108
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,039
Dr. Grey?

109
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:08,912
He'll remove the cancerous
part of the tongue,

110
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,140
and then reconstruct it with
a strip of flesh from your legs.

111
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,302
George?

112
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:16,088
The extra flesh
will provide the bulk

113
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:18,717
your tongue needs to breathe
properly, chew, swallow.

114
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:20,962
And talk?

115
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:28,151
Dr. Sloan...

116
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:31,597
- I'll be able to talk, won't I?
- You will be able to talk, connie.

117
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:35,861
I just don't know how well
you'll be understood.

118
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,789
It'll be okay.

119
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:45,885
What are you doing
in my clinic, Karev?

120
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:48,011
I thought you didn't work
in the clinic anymore.

121
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:49,705
I don't,
but I thought I could get

122
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:52,037
my new intern Norman here
settled in with you.

123
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:54,198
Bailey's the best.
You'll really learn from her.

124
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:57,086
- Pleased to meet you.
- You wanna leave Norman with me.

125
00:05:57,216 --> 00:05:59,037
while you troll for surgeries.

126
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:06,140
The dude's got a bum hip,
and he smells like arthritis cream.

127
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:08,290
He can't keep up.
Come on.

128
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:10,330
Do me a favor,
and I'll do you a favor.

129
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:13,175
I'm calling in my favor now.
Curtain five.

130
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,351
You can take your intern
and show him how we do an H&P.

131
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,902
- Nice to meet you, Norman.
- Thank you.

132
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:22,811
Hunter, uh, I'm Dr. Karev.

133
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:25,331
This is Dr. Shales.
What's going on?

134
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:28,664
- My son is on drugs.
- I'm not on drugs, mom.

135
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:31,276
I wasn't born yesterday.
I know the signs.

136
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:33,539
He's lethargic, irritable,
and the last two months,

137
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:36,848
- his schoolwork's gone down the drain.
- I'm not on drugs.

138
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:38,926
Okay, there are a host of reasons
why your son

139
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:40,726
could be exhibiting those symptoms.

140
00:06:40,924 --> 00:06:42,672
We should run some tests,
see if there...

141
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:45,003
But first a drug test, Dr. Shales.

142
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:47,392
I'm right to want a drug test.

143
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:49,927
- I just said...
- Mrs. Chapman, you are not wrong.

144
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:53,259
My mary Beth, god rest her soul,
was just like you.

145
00:06:53,532 --> 00:06:56,314
When one of our kids started
heading down that slippery slope,

146
00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:58,323
she just knew it.

147
00:06:58,805 --> 00:07:00,645
You have a mother's instinct.

148
00:07:01,612 --> 00:07:02,870
Right, Dr. Karev?

149
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:05,255
Yeah, right.

150
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:10,739
What happened?

151
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:14,120
George, it's Really Old Guy.
We could bring a marching band here,

152
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,175
he wouldn't know the difference.
What happened?

153
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:17,441
What happened?

154
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,007
- I thought you were gonna tell her.
- I tried, but she would not let me.

155
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:24,848
She... She wouldn't let me.

156
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:27,839
I wanted to kill her,
but then I couldn't kill her

157
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,040
because she did help me
through a lot of stuff.

158
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,314
And it was a lot of stuff and, you know,
she did help me through it.

159
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:35,766
But I wanted to kill her again,
'cause who marries someone

160
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,328
who just buried their father.
And then I went to bed.

161
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,145
So what does this mean?

162
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:44,324
What do you want? I told you
I needed a minute before rounds.

163
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:46,660
- We heard you saved a guy yesterday.
- What?

164
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:48,534
- Rounds.
- Excuse me.

165
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:50,592
We'll start in here.

166
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:54,435
Graciella, what can you tell us
about Really Old Guy?

167
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:56,548
- He has a name.
- I know he has a name.

168
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:58,379
We call him Really Old Guy. Catch up.

169
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,810
82-year-old, semicomatose male,

170
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:03,279
came in a year ago,
status post fall

171
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:06,321
- and is post-op day 352 from...
- Which basically means that

172
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:09,140
he hasn't woken up for a year.
So what's the treatment plan?

173
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,896
It's really very simple. Daily labs
and dialysis three times a week.

174
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:20,926
Don't bother
with any more dialysis.

175
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:23,276
I plan to die today,

176
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:25,454
So it won't be necessary.

177
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,081
Nice to meet you.

178
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,836
And while I think
Really Old Guy is charming,

179
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:37,425
in a "neglected patient"
kind of way,

180
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:40,318
my name is Charlie.

181
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,534
Charlie Yost.

182
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,632
Hey, I just heard.

183
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:58,135
- Welcome back.
- Is it true? Really Old Guy woke up?

184
00:08:58,334 --> 00:08:59,357
He has a name.

185
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:02,767
This time tomorrow,
you can call me really dead guy.

186
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,667
I don't think Mr. Yost
knows who you are.

187
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,820
Sure I do.

188
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:07,096
That's Meredith.

189
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:10,766
She and the brain doctor
are always running hot and cold.

190
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:12,518
And you're, uh, Alex.

191
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:15,372
You still got a thing for
that old patient of yours?

192
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:18,540
I was semicomatose, blondie.

193
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,381
I could still hear you guys.

194
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:23,593
Get a C.T., a C.B.C.
and chemistries.

195
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:26,466
Your kidneys may be working again,
which may be why you woke up.

196
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:28,196
- That's good news.
- It just means

197
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:30,354
now I got two things
to do today,

198
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:31,952
take a pee and die.

199
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:34,048
Nobody's dying. Ahh.

200
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:37,156
Functional muscle transfer.

201
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:38,764
- What?
- For Connie Willis.

202
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:41,554
I was reading up on glossectomies
and saw the procedure.

203
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:45,183
We could microsurgically reinnervate
her hypoglossal nerve.

204
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:46,844
A nerve graft?

205
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:48,805
It's too risky.

206
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:50,662
A free flap's
still your best bet.

207
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:54,276
Even if that goes well, you and I both
know she'll never speak the same.

208
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:56,183
She loves to talk
more than anyone I know.

209
00:09:56,313 --> 00:09:57,887
What's a functional muscle transfer?

210
00:09:58,017 --> 00:10:00,525
You won't find it in the books,
O'Malley. It's cutting-edge.

211
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:03,979
You connect the nerves from the leg
with the nerves from the tongue.

212
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:07,128
- Gives her a shot at really speaking.
- If it works.

213
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:10,252
- They've only done half a dozen of 'em.
- Better than none.

214
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:12,240
Sometimes you gotta
push the envelope.

215
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,291
Why? Why is it better to do a surgery
that neither of you have done

216
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:17,614
than to do a surgery
that you know at least gives her

217
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,717
a chance to he a normal life?

218
00:10:20,146 --> 00:10:21,742
You know how to do this procedure?

219
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,955
Are you saying that we're too
old to learn new ways, O'Malley?

220
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:33,114
Are you saying we're old
dogs who can't learn new tricks?

221
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:34,700
No, I just...

222
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,035
- We're not old dogs.
- We still got it.

223
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:43,667
I did do a functional muscle transfer
to restore elbow function once.

224
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:45,498
Elbow, tongue...
That's pretty close.

225
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:48,137
Come on. What do you say?
Let's light this candle.

226
00:10:48,306 --> 00:10:49,517
Yes, sir.

227
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:54,052
- Age is just a number, O'Malley.
- Yes, sir.

228
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,178
I got Karev down
in the clinic all day.

229
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:04,975
- Hope that's not a problem.
- Nope.

230
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:07,132
I know how you like
to be told these things,

231
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:08,887
- so I'm telling you.
- Thank you.

232
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:11,975
Oh, he tried to dump
a new intern on me... Karev.

233
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:13,993
Clearly he's not interested
in teaching.

234
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:16,032
Thank you for letting me know.

235
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,336
Do you ever feel old?

236
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:32,150
I'm young. I'm a fetus.

237
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,510
Nah, I mean you ever feel
like there's gonna be a time

238
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,512
when new techniques pass you by?

239
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:38,315
I'm a genius and a scholar.

240
00:11:38,502 --> 00:11:39,676
Shut up.

241
00:11:41,746 --> 00:11:43,642
Meredith isn't telling
Cristina about us.

242
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,525
And, well,

243
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:47,514
she tells Cristina everything.

244
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:50,284
- I thought you broke that off.
- I meant to.

245
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:54,565
You think she's gonna want
to get back together.

246
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:57,476
You think she's gonna
grow up and get all whole

247
00:11:57,606 --> 00:11:59,860
and... want a relationship.

248
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:01,437
I do not.

249
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:03,284
You're a bad liar.

250
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:06,233
- You're old.
- I'm just gettin' started, my friend.

251
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,554
- You feeling any better?
- I heard you're on that

252
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:19,153
- hemiglossectomy.
- The tongue surgery? Yeah.

253
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:22,897
Here I am stuck in the pit
with those know-nothing interns.

254
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,691
You'd think eventually
I'd catch a break.

255
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,683
Are we ever gonna talk about this,
the Burke thing?

256
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,234
I'm not Izzie. I'm not gonna lie
on the bathroom floor all day.

257
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:37,244
I'm gonna lie here
on the counter.

258
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:43,080
I'll trade you the hemiglossectomy.

259
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:46,875
- What?
- You take the hemiglossectomy,

260
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:49,809
and I will take the ER
And your interns.

261
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:50,992
Are you sure?

262
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:53,386
Take the surgery
if it makes you feel better.

263
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:55,264
You're starting to freak me out.

264
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:01,956
I saw the whole thing, Yang.
You can stop pretending.

265
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,139
I'm not pretending.
I'm sad. I'm very sad.

266
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:06,978
Me so sad.

267
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:10,233
Maybe I should try it, see if I can
get Grey to take my new intern.

268
00:13:10,363 --> 00:13:13,565
No. Forget it. Sad is mine.
Go find your own pretend emotion.

269
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:18,016
Blondie!

270
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:21,317
Hey, blondie.

271
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:24,913
Charlie...

272
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:27,587
I have a million charts to update.
I'm busy.

273
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,417
- I want lobster.
- What?

274
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,837
For my last meal.

275
00:13:31,222 --> 00:13:32,518
It's traditional.

276
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:36,439
The dying man gets to choose
what he wants to eat. I want lobster.

277
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:39,368
I'm not getting you lobster 'cause
you're not dying. I won't allow it.

278
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,934
A man can only hang on
for so long, blondie.

279
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,929
After a while,
it's just not worth it.

280
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:53,737
Don't you have any friends,
family, anyone?

281
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,392
They're all dead
or on their way to dead.

282
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:58,439
You'll understand someday

283
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:01,163
when you're older, less naive.

284
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:02,656
I'm not naive.

285
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:05,426
You and what's his face,
that's not naive?

286
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:10,354
I don't know what you're... We're not...
You know about what's his face?

287
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:13,380
I know you're crazy if you
think he's leaving his wife.

288
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,685
- Guys always say that.
- Not that it's any of your business,

289
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,942
- but this is completely different.
- I'm sure it's true love.

290
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,849
I'm sure he's told his wife.

291
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:23,540
I'm sure he's moved out.

292
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,384
And I'm sure
all your friends know, right?

293
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:31,890
By the way, I want real lobster,

294
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,973
not that fake whitefish crap.

295
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:40,488
I'm filling in for Cristina.
So how's it going?

296
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:43,090
I pulled a splinter
out of a guy's toe,

297
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,142
and now I'm writing about it.

298
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:47,689
Okay. Well, if you have
any questions...

299
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:50,408
I have a lot of questions,
just not about a splinter.

300
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,403
40-year-old unrestrained driver
in a rollover M.V.C.

301
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:59,704
Lost vitals on the scene,
we were unable to intubate.

302
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:00,935
Lexie, let's go.

303
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,838
Open the intubation tray.

304
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,177
- How long he been down?
- Took 10 minutes to load him,

305
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:07,691
- 14 to get here, so 24.
- Push another epi.

306
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:09,943
- You know how to intubate?
- I've never done it.

307
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:11,840
- You've seen it done?
- A couple of times.

308
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,745
- Come do one now.
- Are you sure?

309
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,418
Visualize the cords,
pull straight up,

310
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:19,228
watch the tube
go through the cords.

311
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,708
I can't see the cords.
You should do this.

312
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,515
You can do it. Just don't
rock up against the teeth.

313
00:15:24,645 --> 00:15:27,403
- Just pull straight up.
- Pulse ox is down to 86.

314
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:39,437
It wasn't bad.

315
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:41,956
- What?
- That wasn't bad

316
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:43,379
for your first intubation.

317
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,580
Is that some kind of joke?

318
00:15:46,287 --> 00:15:49,123
- The guy is dead. He died.
- He was dead when he came in here.

319
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:50,777
He was dead on the scene.

320
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:53,208
He was dead for 15 minutes
in the ambulance.

321
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:55,602
He was dead before
I asked you to intubate.

322
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,846
You're pretty cavalier,
don't you think?

323
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:02,047
I mean, they brought him
here for help.

324
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:05,755
They brought him here because
they're legally required to.

325
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:08,720
And I had you intubate because
I'm required to teach you,

326
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,223
and that is how you learn.

327
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:14,209
No. No, you should have done
everything that you could.

328
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:16,135
That was everything I could.

329
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:18,920
- What kind of doctor are you?
- What is this about?

330
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,444
If you don't want to learn
from me, that's fine.

331
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:28,098
But I have to
cover the pit today.

332
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:31,237
So why don't you do both of us a favor
and go help Bailey in the clinic?

333
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:32,437
- Fine.
- Fine.

334
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:39,299
Pretend I'm not here.

335
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,848
Pretend I'm not busting in
on you and pictures of...

336
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:43,291
really disturbing tongues.

337
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:45,302
But Really Old Guy
is giving me a hard time.

338
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:47,673
I liked him better when he was sleeping,
which he's not.

339
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:49,666
He's awake.
You've probably already heard.

340
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:51,665
But my point is,
is that he's stubborn.

341
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,409
He's stubborn and really old,

342
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:56,861
and he's telling me I'm an idiot
for thinking you're gonna leave Callie.

343
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,602
Seriously?
We're in this together.

344
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:02,255
You're gonna tell her tonight, right?

345
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,793
I have to get this research done.

346
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:09,317
You're not gonna tell her.

347
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:12,290
Wasn't it just yesterday when you said
you didn't want me to tell her?

348
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,596
Fine! Forget it.

349
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:15,925
Just play with your
stupid pictures of tongues.

350
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:20,126
We got the tox screen back,
Mrs. Chapman.

351
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,820
- Your son's not on drugs.
- You're sure?

352
00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:24,943
There's no drugs in his system?

353
00:17:25,073 --> 00:17:26,309
No, came back clean.

354
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,075
- Your son is fine.
- This is not my son, Dr. Shales.

355
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:30,651
It's... not.

356
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:32,457
Maybe we should order
some more tests.

357
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:35,394
You know, he's a teenager.
I've raised four of 'em myself.

358
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:38,243
Teenagers don't like
to do their homework,

359
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:41,298
they talk back to their parents,
and they never come out of their rooms.

360
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,781
You have apple hair.

361
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:45,842
I threw a pancake in the river,
a pancake!

362
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:49,985
Do you know what you just said?

363
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,347
- I'm... I'm not sure.
- Did you mean to say it?

364
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:57,743
No, I was trying to say
that I wanted to go home.

365
00:17:58,289 --> 00:17:59,961
We need to do a full neuro exam.

366
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:02,110
Order a head C.T. and labs, now.

367
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:07,247
It's gonna be okay, you know?

368
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,862
It is. It's gonna be okay.

369
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:10,698
Do you think so?

370
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,371
Dr. Sloan's gonna do
this fancy new surgery.

371
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:15,489
Maybe you'll make it
into the medical journals.

372
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,349
Maybe be famous.

373
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:19,492
What if the surgery
doesn't work?

374
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,405
What if this is
my last chance to talk?

375
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,039
I still...

376
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:26,541
have so much to say.

377
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:28,804
Say it now, Connie.

378
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:30,292
Don't be so morbid.

379
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:32,398
The surgery will work.
You'll be fine.

380
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,914
She should say it all now,
Jo, just in case.

381
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,970
She shouldn't have any more regrets.

382
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:39,592
You can tell us anything, Connie.

383
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,225
We're your best friends.

384
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:51,125
You should tell them.

385
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:54,324
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to pry. But...

386
00:18:55,253 --> 00:18:57,235
if you want to say something,
you should say it.

387
00:18:57,357 --> 00:18:59,400
I've been here a while.
I've been here long enough

388
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,201
to know that things don't always go
the way that you want them to,

389
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:04,827
and if there's something you
want to say, you should say it.

390
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:07,178
Joanne, you've gotta stop
wearing those pants.

391
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:09,598
Those pants make your ass
look like two puppies

392
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:11,700
are struggling to get out.
As a matter of fact,

393
00:19:11,824 --> 00:19:13,589
all of your pants are too tight.

394
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:16,359
You have to buy some new pants.

395
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:20,027
- And Elaine, your breath is god-awful.
- My breath?

396
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:21,773
You need to see
a doctor or something

397
00:19:21,903 --> 00:19:23,913
because I know you have
good hygiene,

398
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:26,437
but sweet god,
your breath is bad.

399
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,544
And you've got to get
a new hairdo.

400
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:31,629
The '80s are over, honey.

401
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:36,820
What now?

402
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,998
He keeps pulling off his monitor lead.
Told him he can pull 'em off all day,

403
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:42,552
- he's still not gonna die.
- I'm sick and tired of waiting.

404
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:45,026
I'm sick and tired of coming
to your room very 5 minutes.

405
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:49,312
Sorry, blondie. It's time I took
things into my own hands.

406
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:51,381
You know what?
You want to die? Fine.

407
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:53,921
Here. Let me help you.
You missed this one.

408
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:55,762
Damn. You're still with us.

409
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:57,231
Wait. This looks promising.

410
00:19:57,361 --> 00:20:00,281
A nice, thick wire.
How's that? Any luck? No?

411
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:03,310
No wonder. That's why.
It's attached to this lamp.

412
00:20:03,592 --> 00:20:05,573
Okay. Well,
let's see what else we got.

413
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:07,333
- Dr. Stevens.
- What?

414
00:20:07,488 --> 00:20:09,228
- Dr. Stevens, he's not breathing.
- What?

415
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,454
He doesn't have a pulse.
He's in cardiac arrest.

416
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,543
I swear to god,
I didn't do anything.

417
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:17,379
<i>Code blue, fourth floor.
Code blue, fourth floor.</i>

418
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:21,429
Are the epi and atropine in?

419
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,354
Epi's in.
I'm pushing atropine now.

420
00:20:23,484 --> 00:20:26,442
- Hold C.P.R. Let's see what happens.
- Looks like V-fib.

421
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:28,583
Charge the paddles, 300.

422
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:31,226
Clear.

423
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,291
- No change.
- Charge again.

424
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:35,784
Clear.

425
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:38,626
I've got a pulse.

426
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,326
Stop saving my life.

427
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:55,654
I can't believe I said all that.

428
00:20:55,898 --> 00:20:57,532
Do you believe I said all that?

429
00:20:57,712 --> 00:20:59,806
- Not really, no.
- You think I hurt their feelings?

430
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:02,483
I mean, real bad
hurt their feelings?

431
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,485
You think they'll forgive me?

432
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,470
You told me.
You told me to tell them.

433
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:11,419
You told me to say everything.
You said it would be okay.

434
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,360
I'm really sorry.

435
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:22,600
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Grey sent me
down here to work with you.

436
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:24,989
Oh, she did, did she?
And why is that?

437
00:21:25,397 --> 00:21:28,449
Truthfully? She didn't want
to work with me anymore.

438
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:29,792
She kicked me out.

439
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,403
You can go and tell Dr. Grey

440
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:35,101
that the clinic is not
a dumping ground for strays.

441
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:37,017
We are not the island
of broken interns.

442
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:38,584
Please go tell her that.

443
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:47,134
Please don't make me do that.

444
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,142
I-I can't work with her,
with Meredith Grey.

445
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:51,756
I can't work with her
because I can't look at her.

446
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,444
'Cause she hates me,
hates my dad,

447
00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:56,011
she obviously hated my mother,
and I am...

448
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:59,308
Please just let me
work down here today.

449
00:21:59,438 --> 00:22:00,931
Please, Dr. Bailey.

450
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,894
Kid in curtain three
needs stitches. Go.

451
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:10,843
- What do you got?
- A teenager came in the clinic

452
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:12,762
this morning,
he was lethargic, irritable,

453
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:14,202
- dysphasic.
- Right.

454
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:17,490
- I'm sorry. I don't know you.
- Norman Shales, up from UCLA.

455
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:20,342
Are you neuro? I thought I knew
all the neuro guys down there.

456
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,398
Norman's an intern, Dr. Shepherd.

457
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:24,659
- My intern.
- Welcome to the program.

458
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:26,903
- Thank you.
- Good. What do we got?

459
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:29,290
Look at this.

460
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:31,234
Kid's got hydrocephalus.

461
00:22:31,754 --> 00:22:33,461
It's pushing up against
his broca's area.

462
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:35,367
Which explains the screwed up speech.

463
00:22:35,763 --> 00:22:37,192
I was sure it was drugs.

464
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:40,574
Well, that's what happens when
you're a pharmacist for 30 years.

465
00:22:40,704 --> 00:22:42,873
You're sure everybody's
hooked on pills or reefer.

466
00:22:43,183 --> 00:22:45,417
I won't make that mistake again.
No, sirree.

467
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:47,157
Right. Okay.

468
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:50,333
- And we need to put in a shunt.
- Yeah, schedule an O.R.,

469
00:22:50,463 --> 00:22:52,988
- we'll go talk to Hunter and his mom.
- Will do, Captain.

470
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,020
Guy doesn't know when to shut up.

471
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,702
- He does it with the patients, too.
- You're his resident.

472
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,341
I know, I know, but it'd be like
yelling at my grandfather.

473
00:23:05,815 --> 00:23:07,420
I heard about Really Old Guy.

474
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:08,791
What's the matter?

475
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:10,685
Couldn't find his Lvad wire?

476
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:14,047
It was a coincidence,
and he's still alive.

477
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:16,423
Have fun with Really Old Guy.

478
00:23:16,747 --> 00:23:19,635
I'm off to do
Meredith's hemiglossectomy.

479
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,069
- Has George said anything to you...
- She's faking.

480
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:31,012
She's faking sadness, pretending
to be sad to steal my surgeries.

481
00:23:32,824 --> 00:23:36,685
I have a Really Old Guy trying
to kill himself and problems of my own.

482
00:23:37,411 --> 00:23:39,909
So I don't have time for the two of you
and your fake drama.

483
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,662
A person wants to die,

484
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:50,995
you let them.

485
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:52,539
It's polite.

486
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:55,255
Not in a hospital, it's not.
In a hospital, it's a lawsuit.

487
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:56,808
I don't like you.

488
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:58,526
Really? 'Cause I thought we were BFS.

489
00:23:59,195 --> 00:24:00,241
You know what?

490
00:24:00,468 --> 00:24:01,522
Just for that,

491
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,097
I'm dying right now.

492
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,425
That might make you poop your pants,
but it's not gonna make you die.

493
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,804
Damn it.

494
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,317
You really think
he's not gonna leave his wife?

495
00:24:19,962 --> 00:24:23,255
I think if a person wants
to do something,

496
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:26,014
like die, they do it.

497
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:35,373
Maybe I'm wrong.

498
00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:36,837
Maybe there's hope.

499
00:24:37,335 --> 00:24:38,866
Maybe he'll tell her,

500
00:24:39,307 --> 00:24:41,326
and you two will get together

501
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:43,094
and end up happy.

502
00:24:43,972 --> 00:24:47,071
- You think?
- Not that I'll be alive to see it.

503
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:49,280
You're not dying, Charlie.
Not on my watch.

504
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,726
Dead man walking.

505
00:24:52,856 --> 00:24:54,424
I don't see much walking, Charlie.

506
00:24:58,962 --> 00:25:02,502
You know Yang and Grey are playing
musical chairs with their interns?

507
00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:07,448
I mean, I just thought that might
interest you, seeing as how

508
00:25:07,578 --> 00:25:10,683
one of Yang's interns
is actually one of Grey's relatives...

509
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:15,016
And the two Greys are having
some kind of family feud.

510
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,636
I'm just saying,
it would probably be best

511
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:22,585
if the residents stuck
with their own interns

512
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:24,453
- in the future.
- I got it. Thanks.

513
00:25:28,184 --> 00:25:29,941
You plan to hide out in here
all day long,

514
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:33,063
or you plan to emerge at some point
and do your job?

515
00:25:33,336 --> 00:25:36,748
Why would I come out there to do my job
when you clearly do it so much better?

516
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:40,656
I'm doing paperwork, because
I don't have any more fight in me.

517
00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:43,107
I don't want to fight you.
I don't fight my...

518
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:46,519
I don't want to fight today.

519
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:48,279
So...

520
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:50,403
I'm doing paperwork. Okay?

521
00:26:05,628 --> 00:26:07,102
The graft's a perfect fit.

522
00:26:08,156 --> 00:26:10,016
It's got good vascularization.

523
00:26:10,185 --> 00:26:12,861
At this rate, you may actually
get to go on that date with Adele.

524
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:16,986
I better. Can't very well have her
take me back if I cancel our first date.

525
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,430
Where you taking her chief?

526
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,294
There's a nice little chinese restaurant
we like to go to.

527
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:28,336
What happens next?

528
00:26:32,455 --> 00:26:34,060
- Dr. Sloan, I don't...
- I know.

529
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:35,610
Is everything okay?

530
00:26:39,435 --> 00:26:40,854
We're not sure.

531
00:26:41,664 --> 00:26:42,866
What does that mean?

532
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:45,437
It means we've never done this before.

533
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:56,921
What about if we coapt
the lingual nerve underneath here?

534
00:26:57,203 --> 00:26:59,682
No, we'd end up
losing the vascular supply.

535
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:01,438
The graft might not work at all.

536
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,528
She likes to talk, Sloan.

537
00:27:04,426 --> 00:27:05,800
She likes to talk a lot.

538
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,906
We need an extra set of hands.

539
00:27:09,441 --> 00:27:10,742
Someone who knows nerves.

540
00:27:11,683 --> 00:27:13,730
- O'Malley, get Dr. Shepherd.
- Yes, sir.

541
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:20,222
A functional muscle transfer
of the tongue?

542
00:27:20,352 --> 00:27:22,006
It was looking good
for a while, but...

543
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:24,680
I'll be right there.

544
00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:30,081
- Izzie
- What?

545
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:35,545
What is there to say, George?
I'm a blondie. I'm...

546
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:38,130
the other woman.
I'm a bad '50s cliché.

547
00:27:38,264 --> 00:27:39,463
No, no, no.

548
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:43,786
We're not in this together.

549
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:48,777
Great. Well, thank you
for letting me know.

550
00:27:48,984 --> 00:27:51,594
- No. You don't get to be mad here.
- Seriously?

551
00:27:51,915 --> 00:27:53,835
- We said...
- No, no. There is no "We."

552
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:56,123
It's just me.
I'm the one who has to tell Callie.

553
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,779
I'm the one who has to destroy her.

554
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,315
This is not about you and me.
This is about her and me.

555
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:03,675
I'm ending a marriage
to a wonderful woman.

556
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,720
Me. I'm the one.

557
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:07,119
It's not you.

558
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,657
It's not something you just blurt out.
It's not.

559
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:19,681
I'll do it.

560
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:22,183
I will do it.

561
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:26,098
You have to back off and let me do it.

562
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:30,525
I'm sorry.

563
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,343
You traded...

564
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:35,750
a hemiglossectomy for the pit?

565
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,158
It's a long story.

566
00:28:37,288 --> 00:28:40,071
A long story that ends with you
pawning off Lexie Grey on me?

567
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,223
I had her do an intubation
on a dead guy.

568
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,579
It's something you used
to have us do all the time.

569
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:46,064
I was trying to teach her.

570
00:28:46,194 --> 00:28:48,860
- Whatever she told you...
- She told me you hate her.

571
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,331
- I don't...
- And that you hated her mother...

572
00:28:51,461 --> 00:28:53,566
- I didn't say that.
- Her mother, who came to you

573
00:28:53,696 --> 00:28:56,233
with a case of hiccups
and died in our hospital.

574
00:28:56,363 --> 00:28:57,874
You see where I'm going with this?

575
00:28:58,685 --> 00:29:01,284
- She's not my intern.
- No, she's your sister,

576
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:04,536
and you haven't had a kind word
to say to her since she got here.

577
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:07,849
And you were her mother's doctor.
Now what is she supposed to think?

578
00:29:08,773 --> 00:29:10,517
Look, whether you like it or not,

579
00:29:10,647 --> 00:29:13,159
your job is to help that girl
be a better doctor.

580
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:14,390
So help her.

581
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:18,007
- You paged me?
- Really Old Guy...

582
00:29:18,393 --> 00:29:20,485
He's checked out AMA.
He's leaving the hospital.

583
00:29:20,631 --> 00:29:22,605
What? He can't leave.
He's sick.

584
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:25,177
He can barely walk,
and I got him lobster.

585
00:29:27,411 --> 00:29:29,255
- I got a 911. What happened?
- He collapsed.

586
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,138
He started talking that nonsense...

587
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:33,522
His pupil's blown.
His brain's starting to herniate.

588
00:29:33,642 --> 00:29:36,239
Page Shepherd. Take over the bag.
We gotta get him up on the bed.

589
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:39,286
- What's happening?
- On 3. One, two, three.

590
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:41,288
What's happening to my son?

591
00:29:41,438 --> 00:29:43,786
Spinal fluid's backing up.
Putting pressure on his brain.

592
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:46,124
- Shepherd's not answering his page.
- Try it again.

593
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:48,343
What do I do?

594
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,362
Hyperventilation...

595
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,648
Mannitol...

596
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:53,835
I don't know everything.

597
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,864
Go. Get Shepherd. Go.

598
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:04,403
I'm a little busy now
making medical history.

599
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:07,190
Hunter Chapman's brain is herniating.
His right pupil just blew.

600
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:09,057
You need to do exactly what I say,

601
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:11,277
or that kid's dead in 10 minutes.
Can you do that?

602
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:13,479
- Yes, sir.
- Get the biggest needle you can find.

603
00:30:16,286 --> 00:30:18,342
- Dr. Karev, what's going on?
- Where's Shepherd?

604
00:30:19,564 --> 00:30:22,707
- I think it might help Mrs. Chapman...
- What are you doing?

605
00:30:22,848 --> 00:30:24,742
- Get her out of here.
- She is the boy's mom.

606
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,382
Get her out of here.
Get her out!

607
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,795
What are you doing?

608
00:30:27,934 --> 00:30:30,264
- He's trying to help.
- What are you doing?

609
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:32,043
- What are you doing?
- Hold his head.

610
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:33,497
Shepherd told me what to do.

611
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:56,813
Charlie...

612
00:30:57,345 --> 00:30:58,513
You can't go.

613
00:30:59,515 --> 00:31:01,025
I know you think your life is over.

614
00:31:01,155 --> 00:31:03,239
I know you feel
like you don't have anybody. But...

615
00:31:03,977 --> 00:31:05,818
your life's not over and...

616
00:31:07,562 --> 00:31:08,665
And you have me.

617
00:31:09,876 --> 00:31:11,489
You have me. I need you.

618
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:13,614
I need somebody to talk to.

619
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:15,885
I think you may have been right before.

620
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:18,119
I don't think George
is gonna leave his wife.

621
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:20,485
I need you to tell me what to do.

622
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:22,193
I need some...

623
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,286
You can't go, Charlie.

624
00:31:50,782 --> 00:31:51,862
Crap.

625
00:32:03,217 --> 00:32:05,344
All this time, he was telling me
the truth.

626
00:32:05,474 --> 00:32:09,155
Once we get the shunt in, any excess
spinal fluid will drain to his abdomen.

627
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,434
He's gonna be okay.

628
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:12,368
Excuse me.

629
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:21,632
I'm sorry I unloaded on you, Norman.

630
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:23,602
You know how it is?
Heat of the moment.

631
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:25,840
- Don't apologize to him.
- What?

632
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:28,986
- Dr. Bailey's right. It...
- Shut up. I'm not talking to you.

633
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:30,474
He got in your way.

634
00:32:30,672 --> 00:32:32,796
He's been doing it all day,
and when that happens

635
00:32:32,926 --> 00:32:35,123
when an intern gets
in the way of a resident

636
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:37,293
you're not doing
what's best for your patient.

637
00:32:37,494 --> 00:32:40,053
Now you almost missed
diagnosing that kid today

638
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:41,912
because Norman here
thought it was drugs.

639
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:44,240
So don't apologize.
He should be yelled at.

640
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:49,030
- He's as old as the hills.
- I don't care how old he is, Dr. Karev.

641
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:52,492
He's still an intern,
and interns are basically teenagers.

642
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:54,887
We are not hard on them
because it's fun.

643
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,377
We're hard on them because
this is a life-and-death job.

644
00:32:58,565 --> 00:32:59,861
They need to learn that.

645
00:33:00,068 --> 00:33:02,941
There is a reason why we have
a pecking order in a hospital.

646
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:04,246
It saves lives.

647
00:33:10,662 --> 00:33:13,425
I think that woman's gonna be able
to talk for the rest of her life

648
00:33:13,545 --> 00:33:14,700
thanks to us.

649
00:33:14,963 --> 00:33:17,306
- I think I still got it.
- I think you do, too.

650
00:33:17,605 --> 00:33:19,973
We just gotta figure out
what you're gonna tell Adele.

651
00:33:20,677 --> 00:33:22,187
- I forgot about that.
- Yeah.

652
00:33:22,758 --> 00:33:24,818
First off, don't tell her
you wanna move back in.

653
00:33:24,955 --> 00:33:26,795
- No?
- Reeks of desperation.

654
00:33:27,082 --> 00:33:29,627
- It's a deal breaker. Trust me.
- I can't take this anymore.

655
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:32,096
You guys are kidding yourselves.

656
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,041
You know how close you idiots came
to that woman losing her tongue,

657
00:33:35,178 --> 00:33:36,597
to her never speaking again?

658
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:39,154
Oh, yeah, you were
a couple of cowboys in there,

659
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:41,003
telling yourselves you can do this,

660
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:42,547
acting like the big boys.

661
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:45,672
You had no business doing that surgery.

662
00:33:46,864 --> 00:33:47,944
No business.

663
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:50,461
Lucky I came in when I did.
Shame on you.

664
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:51,718
And shame on you.

665
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:53,473
As for Adele,

666
00:33:54,161 --> 00:33:56,736
you can't imagine your life without her.
Tell her for the last

667
00:33:56,856 --> 00:33:59,512
months you been walking in
this hospital just thinking about her.

668
00:33:59,932 --> 00:34:01,193
Tell her the truth.

669
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:04,247
Sorry I called you an idiot.

670
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,714
So I've been thinking
about how you're sad,

671
00:34:12,118 --> 00:34:15,057
- and what I can do to help.
- You have another surgery?

672
00:34:15,348 --> 00:34:16,820
No, that's not what you need.

673
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:19,675
- Well, it kind of is.
- No, what you need is me

674
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:21,389
and my time.

675
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:25,550
So I thought we could go back
to my house and get into our pajamas,

676
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,937
just sit and talk
about this whole Burke thing,

677
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:29,838
really get to the root of your feelings.

678
00:34:30,223 --> 00:34:32,430
Just talk all night long if we have to.

679
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:34,371
- Talk.
- Talk...

680
00:34:35,328 --> 00:34:36,360
and cry.

681
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:39,165
Cry.

682
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:41,972
You know.

683
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,740
You're damn right I know,
surgery stealer.

684
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,972
So, person-who-is-sleeping-with-Derek?

685
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:48,652
How'd you know that?

686
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:51,142
You think I'm too fragile
to handle your sex life?

687
00:34:52,537 --> 00:34:54,492
Well, he did leave you at the altar.

688
00:34:54,622 --> 00:34:56,399
- And I'm your person.
- How?

689
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:57,776
By "protecting me"?

690
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,170
That's now how to be my person.
That's not what we do.

691
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:01,388
You know that.

692
00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:04,783
I'm dealing. Okay?

693
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:08,061
The best I can. So if you need
to take care of someone,

694
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:10,631
you're gonna need to take care
of someone else. okay?

695
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,448
Fine.

696
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:14,396
But you owe me a surgery.

697
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:16,971
Yeah, well, you owe me sex details.

698
00:35:17,303 --> 00:35:18,984
Are we doing this or not?

699
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,051
What are we supposed to say?

700
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,572
We didn't even know the guy.

701
00:35:39,702 --> 00:35:41,142
We ate lunch in here for a year.

702
00:35:41,377 --> 00:35:44,213
The least we can do is say
a few kind words about him.

703
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:53,557
He...

704
00:35:57,252 --> 00:35:58,857
didn't snore too loud...

705
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:01,056
ly.

706
00:36:05,055 --> 00:36:06,269
He...

707
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,693
never complained.

708
00:36:08,872 --> 00:36:10,552
And he always took his meds.

709
00:36:11,342 --> 00:36:13,576
- Hardly ever farted.
- Alex.

710
00:36:14,136 --> 00:36:18,190
Fine. He had 12 surgeries this year,
and he....

711
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,483
He lived through them.

712
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:21,932
- That's impressive.
- Thank you, Alex.

713
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:33,460
I got to practice stuff on him...
central lines and IV's...

714
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,829
It was good practice.

715
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:41,085
Charlie, the truth is...

716
00:36:41,705 --> 00:36:42,892
You were a bastard.

717
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:45,681
You were. You were mean
and stubborn and just...

718
00:36:46,547 --> 00:36:47,698
a bastard.

719
00:36:49,856 --> 00:36:51,982
But you were a bastard
who knew what you wanted.

720
00:36:53,304 --> 00:36:55,133
And you stuck to your guns
and proved that

721
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:57,382
if you want something badly enough,
if you're...

722
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,166
determined enough and patient enough,

723
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:02,428
eventually it will happen.

724
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:04,560
It will.

725
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,739
And that gives me hope, so...

726
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:10,274
Thanks for that.

727
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:14,601
Bye-bye, Charlie.

728
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:19,405
<i>The truth is painful...</i>

729
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:23,697
It went really well.

730
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:30,903
Your friends...

731
00:37:32,087 --> 00:37:33,949
I am so sorry.
I haven't seen them.

732
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:38,813
How'd she do?

733
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,320
Great. She did great.

734
00:37:42,547 --> 00:37:45,107
- She's gonna talk again?
- Yeah, the chances are very good.

735
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:48,518
In that case, we have a few things
we'd like to say.

736
00:37:51,328 --> 00:37:52,483
Your first husband,

737
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:54,959
he put his hand on my ass
every chance he got.

738
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:56,282
And your second husband,

739
00:37:56,412 --> 00:37:58,916
he spat when he talked, and...
plus, he was ugly.

740
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:02,301
We know you thought he was handsome,
but the man was a troll.

741
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:04,158
And that guy you dated last year,

742
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:05,904
Comb-over guy.

743
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,247
<i>Deep down,
nobody wants to hear it,</i>

744
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:10,895
<i>especially
when it hits close to home.</i>

745
00:38:12,646 --> 00:38:13,679
What?

746
00:38:14,406 --> 00:38:16,471
I have your mother's death note here.

747
00:38:17,857 --> 00:38:20,439
Everything that happened
on the day she died is in here.

748
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:22,180
And I know because I wrote it.

749
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,925
So I'd like to go over it
with you if that's okay.

750
00:38:30,051 --> 00:38:32,232
First of all, let me just say that

751
00:38:32,362 --> 00:38:34,054
everything that happened that day

752
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:38,282
every setback...
There was a 1% chance

753
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:39,935
of each of those things happening.

754
00:38:40,124 --> 00:38:41,166
1%.

755
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:44,548
And your mother was the 1%.

756
00:38:48,735 --> 00:38:51,242
She came in complaining
of persistent hiccups.

757
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,374
We did an endoscopic fundoplication.

758
00:38:55,087 --> 00:38:58,313
- You did it endoscopically?
- So it'd be an outpatient procedure.

759
00:38:59,264 --> 00:39:01,230
We wanted to avoid major surgery.

760
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:06,829
For what it's worth,
I was very fond of your mother.

761
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,269
She was...

762
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:11,582
I was very fond of her.

763
00:39:16,591 --> 00:39:20,178
She got bacterial endocarditis...

764
00:39:21,377 --> 00:39:23,321
<i>Sometimes we tell the truth...</i>

765
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:26,918
<i>because the truth is
all we have to give.</i>

766
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,610
I've been having trouble

767
00:39:33,803 --> 00:39:36,252
with this whole pecking order of things.

768
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,655
It's... I've been having trouble.

769
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,096
'Cause I'm used to being number one.

770
00:39:41,277 --> 00:39:42,996
but I'm not number one,

771
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:44,754
not anymore. So...

772
00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:49,272
The best that I can come up with
is to be number two...

773
00:39:50,594 --> 00:39:53,842
the best damn number two
this hospital has ever seen, but...

774
00:39:54,535 --> 00:39:56,380
your number two.

775
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,903
I will...

776
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,452
I will help you.

777
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:03,553
We'll be like a team.

778
00:40:04,649 --> 00:40:05,748
Because...

779
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:08,898
Girl, you just seem
to be having a hard time.

780
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,923
I know I'm having a hard time, but...

781
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,814
together, we could...

782
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:18,093
do this.

783
00:40:20,576 --> 00:40:22,394
I just think we can do this together.

784
00:40:25,192 --> 00:40:27,684
<i>Sometimes,
we tell the truth because...</i>

785
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:31,207
<i>we need to say it out loud
to really hear it for ourselves.</i>

786
00:40:32,456 --> 00:40:34,982
You got to reattach a woman's tongue.

787
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,440
I was there,
I didn't actually do the reattaching.

788
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,348
Yeah, still... You are the intern
they wanted on that case.

789
00:40:41,684 --> 00:40:42,898
He's a repeater.

790
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,242
- What?
- Your big hero, here...

791
00:40:45,996 --> 00:40:47,424
He was a intern last year.

792
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:50,399
That's why he got to know
some of the stuff.

793
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:52,237
He's already been through it.

794
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,689
But if you wanna learn
from someone...

795
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:56,371
really, really learn...

796
00:40:57,072 --> 00:40:58,311
Go to a resident.

797
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,834
Not this dude.

798
00:41:07,144 --> 00:41:10,139
Yeah, he's right, if you want to
emulate someone, it's definitely

799
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:11,529
not me..

800
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:12,846
I'm not that guy.

801
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:16,800
<i>And sometimes,
we tell the truth...</i>

802
00:41:17,571 --> 00:41:20,455
<i>because we just can't help ourselves.</i>

803
00:41:20,585 --> 00:41:22,055
What the hell are you looking at?

804
00:41:27,623 --> 00:41:28,740
Interns...

805
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:33,021
<i>And sometimes...</i>

806
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,296
<i>we tell them...</i>

807
00:41:43,825 --> 00:41:45,947
<i>because we owe them.</i>

808
00:41:47,198 --> 00:41:48,569
<i>At least, that much.</i>

809
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,753
Just say it.

810
00:41:57,896 --> 00:41:59,037
I slept with Izzie.
