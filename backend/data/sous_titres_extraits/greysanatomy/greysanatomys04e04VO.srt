1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,440
Previously  on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,840
this is the best breakup ever.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,190
She's doing mcdreamy.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,430
Norman is an intern.

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,330
I'm your sister.

6
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,400
You're not a girl I ever
wanted to have to know

7
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,790
because our dad chose you.

8
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,530
My niece's cancer's come back.

9
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,550
She's 17 years old and she's gonna die.

10
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,600
Alex,I'm sorry. I can't.

11
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,070
I slept with izzie.

12
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,890
in life,only one thing is certain...

13
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,400
apart from death and taxes...

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,500
no matter how hard you try,

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,770
no matter how good  your intentions,

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,910
you are going to make mistakes.

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,870
callie.

18
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,420
You're going to hurt people.

19
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,070
You're going to get hurt.

20
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,170
And if you ever want  to recover...

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,090
you haven't said anything in...

22
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,830
in...

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,460
just say something.

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,060
Please.

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,130
Anything.

26
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,240
There's really only
one thing  you can say.

27
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,650
I forgive you.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,330
What?

29
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,720
You made a mistake.

30
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,150
But we took vows... till
death do us part... so...

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,050
I forgive you.

32
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,130
Izzie,why aren't you
picking up your phone?

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,360
You need to pick up your phone.

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,960
I just talked to callie and...

35
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,110
george.

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,100
I gotta find izzie.

37
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,820
- We have rounds in five minutes.
- Right after I find izzie.

38
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,090
You wanna go away with me this weekend?

39
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,550
Why would I want to go away with you?

40
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,960
Because of this.

41
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,900
We didn't go away when we were a couple.

42
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,810
Now we're not a couple,and not couples
have no reason to go away together.

43
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,920
Meredith,you're not paying attention.

44
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,660
I'm talking about 48
uninterrupted hours of this.

45
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,580
Where would we go?

46
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,720
Wine country.

47
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,480
Wine country sounds
like a couples' place.

48
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,380
Well,there's wine,there's country,and
you wouldn't see any of it.

49
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,590
We'd be in bed all weekend.

50
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,700
Oh,a weekend of sex.

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,080
Now you're paying attention.

52
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,120
well,I would have to get
someone to cover for me.

53
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,340
Okay,so you're in?

54
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,450
48 uninterrupted hours of this.

55
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,750
I'm in.

56
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,720
Oh,great.

57
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,580
I'm stuck in the pit protecting smackheads
and gangbangers with my idiot interns,

58
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,390
and you're getting
mcdreamied in the elevator?

59
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,310
Really,smackheads and
gangbangers at seattle grace,huh?

60
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,960
My point is,I hate interns.

61
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,640
Well,lexie's not that bad,is she?

62
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,380
Oh,are we not hating her anymore?

63
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,430
Oh,no. We still hate the idea of her.

64
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,480
We just realized we don't have a
reason to hate the actual person.

65
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,650
She's an intern.

66
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,190
That's reason enough.

67
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,560
I think you may be the new nazi.

68
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,640
Damn right.

69
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,640
I don't see any charts.

70
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,180
Will you work for me on saturday?

71
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,310
What's in it for me?

72
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,030
What do you want?

73
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,940
- Take norman off my hands today.
- Who?

74
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,650
The world's oldest intern.

75
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,850
I've got mynterns in the pit,and
he's only gonna slow me down.

76
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,600
Ageist.

77
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,590
Deal?

78
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,290
Fine.

79
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,830
Rounds.

80
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,680
Still can't find izzie.

81
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm gonna have to put you in
the clinic if you miss rounds.

82
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,840
Oh,the clinic!

83
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,390
Uh,ms.Sayles,hi.I'm dr.Bailey.

84
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,420
Oh,you are?

85
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,600
Uh,the boyfriend who warned her
not to read on the stairmaster.

86
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,580
That's how I did this.

87
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,520
I fell off last night.

88
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,920
I took a ton of ibuprofen,but when I woke
up this morning,it was huge and hideous.

89
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,640
How much ibuprofen did you take?

90
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,600
I usually take some every
day anyway,because of the gym,

91
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,080
so I doubled the dose,but
it did nothing for me.

92
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,790
Okay,let's get some x-rays and then...

93
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,480
actually,can I justst get
ahot of cortisone or something?

94
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,240
I'm supposed to meet my trainer anoon.

95
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,480
Uh,ms.Sayles,I can't treat you until
I find out what's wrong with you.

96
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,450
Have you seen dr.Stevens?

97
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,850
Check the pit.

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,370
Right.

99
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,540
What time do you think we'll be done?

100
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,620
Just so I can tell my trainer.

101
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,000
lexie! Sorry.

102
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,840
- Uh,have you seen dr.Stevens?
- No.

103
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,220
- Have you seen dr.Yang?
- No.

104
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,120
She told me to meet her here
in the pit,and she's not here.

105
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,900
I don't want to give that woman
any more reasons to hate me.

106
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,190
- Good for you.
- I'm prepared.

107
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,380
I'm gonna answer every
question correctly.

108
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,960
And I'm not gonna take
any more of her crap.

109
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,620
Three!

110
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,260
Incoming,let's move.

111
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,300
He got hit during a scrimmage.

112
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,060
Are you the coach?

113
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,010
He's my dad.

114
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,110
And his coach.

115
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,860
He was charging the
receiver after the kickoff.

116
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,680
He got blocked,had his head
down,couldn't see the other guy coming.

117
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,780
I had my head down because the
guy blocking me was hoing it down.

118
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,040
You could've gotten past that guy.

119
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,310
I need you to leave the room.

120
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,090
Okay,let's cut him out of
his equipment. I need the saw.

121
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,270
Dr.GreyI need you to help me
stabilize his neck and his head,please.

122
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,610
It's very important,adam,that
you not move your head.

123
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,010
I need you to keep perfectly still.

124
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,910
Don't move.

125
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,510
Relax.

126
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,230
- O'malley,what's the hur?
- Sorry,I can't talk,chief.

127
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,550
O'malley?

128
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,150
I...

129
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,370
sorry,I...

130
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,290
I just gotta find izzie.

131
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,490
She's at the third
floor nurses' station.

132
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,440
Oh. Thanks.

133
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,850
Oh,and...and when you find her,

134
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,210
tell her dr.Torres is looking or her.

135
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,400
now I know charting doesn't
seem as exciting as surgery,

136
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,060
but it is every bit as important.

137
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,620
Believe me when I tell
you,people,penmanship saves lives.

138
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,870
Pick up your phone.

139
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,710
What kind of doctor
doesn't pick up their phone?

140
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,230
Is that a 7 or is that a 9?

141
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,920
If I have to ask myself that question in the
middle of an emergency,your patient is dead.

142
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,020
You killed him with your handwriting.

143
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,240
Think about that.

144
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Callie.

145
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,860
Hey.

146
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,030
Hi.

147
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,460
We have to talk.

148
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,700
Okay. Um,about?

149
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,490
George told me.

150
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,170
- He told you?
- Everything.

151
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,720
Cafeteria,noon,you and me.

152
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,230
Be there.

153
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,230
Dude,is she gonna kick her ass?

157
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,730
She forgave you?

158
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,940
She said I had a rough year,

159
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,010
that people make mistakes,and that...

160
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,160
- that I made a mistake.
- Oh,so now I'm a mistake?

161
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,330
back off!

162
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,580
No,she said that. I didn't say that.

163
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,490
What did you say?

164
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,340
Um,I didn't expect her to forgive me.

165
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,640
I expected...

166
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,610
rage,uh,bloodshed.

167
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,890
No,she's saving all her
rage and bloodshed for me.

168
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,930
- She's gonna kill me in the cafeteria at lunch.
- No,she wouldn'T.

169
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,660
She breaks bones for a living,george.

170
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,330
She's crazy.

171
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,220
No,she's not crazy.

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,810
Well,she is if she thinks
I'm not gonna put up a fight.

173
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,930
I can't believe that kid's dad.

174
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,630
I mean,his son is paralyzed,and
the guy's still riding him.

175
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,280
Focus more on the medicine,three,and
less on the tragedy.

176
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,200
Three?

177
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,340
Is that a nickname?

178
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,990
You could say that.

179
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,590
So how would you proceed,dr.Grey?

180
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,570
Oh,um...you won't be able to operate
unless you realign his spine,would you?

181
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,160
And how would you do that?

182
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,270
Traction halo?

183
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,810
Very impressive,dr.Grey.

184
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,070
Your intern year's off to a good start.

185
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,250
How's it going?

186
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,510
How are you and meredith?

187
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,020
It's weird,the whole family thing.

188
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,080
And plus,I think she
might still hate me.

189
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,380
She doesn't hate you.

190
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,780
Really? Did she say that?

191
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,140
You know,why don't you go see if
mrs.Cooley's dressings need changing?

192
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,610
Yang,why don't you go see if
mrs.Cooley's dressing needs changing?

193
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,730
Certainly.

194
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,020
Dr.Sloan,dr.Norman shales.

195
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,130
Oh,dr.Shales,call me mark.

196
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:43,990
Thank you.

197
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,580
I thought you were on my service.

198
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,160
I am.

199
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,530
He's my intern.

200
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,320
I know,right?

201
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,540
It's like,"seriously,you're an intern?"

202
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,250
But it's seriously true.

203
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,510
Seriously.

204
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,130
glad to have you aboar norman.

205
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,750
So is he the one you call,uh...

206
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,130
mcdreamy or,mc,uh,sleazy,or
mc,uh,wait a minute,what is it?

207
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,360
- Norman,we have labs to deliver.
- Yeah.

208
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,240
Labs and discharges.

209
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,560
Uh,this one's being
discharged to hospice?

210
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,240
When there's nothi else we can do.

211
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,750
So we have to tell
someone they're dying?

212
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,120
Don't worry. I'll
teach you the protocol.

213
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,320
Mcsteamy!

214
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,130
He's the one you girls call mcsteamy.

215
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,560
you paged me,dr.Bailey?

216
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,370
Oh,I didn't know you were...

217
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,980
I'm in the clinic. Or I was...

218
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,160
what have you got?

219
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,280
ruthie sayles.

220
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,310
Says she twisted her ankle
falling off the stairmaster.

221
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,550
She didn't twist it. She crushed it.

222
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,460
We should book an O.R.Right away.

223
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,680
Dr.Torres,you don't think we
should run a few tests first?

224
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,820
Find out why ruthie's bones are
so fragile in the first place?

225
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,100
She's osteoporotic.

226
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,510
I see it in older women all the time.

227
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,290
Now you're seeing it in a 28 year old.

228
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,950
Oh,right.

229
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,920
Call me when you get the test results.

230
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,850
I can't talk about it with you.

231
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,550
- Well,is she all right?
- Yeah.

232
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,800
So when giving a patient the bad news,

233
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,690
you want to be polite
and detached,but not cold.

234
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,320
How can you be detached but not cold?

235
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,390
You show that you care without
actually allowing yourself to care,

236
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,320
because if you get too
emotional,then they get scared,

237
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,480
and then they get
emotional,and that's bad.

238
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,120
Seriously?

239
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,870
Stop with the seriously.

240
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,870
Uh,I'm sorry.

241
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,360
I know it must be hard
being older than most of us,

242
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,430
but I think you're
gonna go a lot further

243
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,400
if you just let everything else
go and focus on the medicine.

244
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,030
- Hey,are you aware that mcdreamy and the other grey are bonding?
- Bonding?

245
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,460
Over their mutual meredith greyness.

246
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,630
What do you mean?
They're talking about me?

247
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,860
- What are they saying?
- Oh,I don't know.

248
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,680
He's making me deal with his patients while
they focus on what's really important...you.

249
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,910
Cristina!

250
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,220
What was I saying?

251
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,100
You were saying how important
it was to focus on the medicine.

252
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,650
Just give me the chart.

253
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,690
First we're going to apply halo,which uses weights
and traction to pull your spine back into place.

254
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,830
Traction?

255
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,890
Like at the gym.

256
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,530
We stretch your upper body using weights
until the tension pops the spine into position.

257
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,210
Except unlike at the gym,

258
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,990
dr.Shepherd needs to attach the
traction device directly to your head

259
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,340
by screwing two bolts into your skull.

260
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,720
That sounds painful.

261
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,560
Painful is if he doesn't fix your spine.

262
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,750
Painful is you never walk again.

263
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,440
okay.

264
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,230
We gonna do this thing or what?

265
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,700
I told you not to get too emotional.

266
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,390
I couldn't help it.

267
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,140
What now?

268
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,960
go apologize one last time.

269
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,820
once again,ma'am,we
are very,very sorry...

270
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,800
very sorry.

271
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,340
and now?

272
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,460
Now we slowly and respectfully
back out of the room.

273
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,880
alex,I need a favor.

274
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,360
I don't have time for favors.

275
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,240
I'm working here.

276
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,010
Well,what are you doing at lunch?

277
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,490
According to my interns,I'm watching torres
kick your ass all up and down the cafeteria.

278
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,430
How do they know?

279
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,380
So it's true.

280
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,670
What'd you do to her?

281
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,520
Nothing.

282
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,420
Dude.

283
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,460
we need a little help here!

284
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,180
Oh,thank god. Somebody I know.

285
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,700
Will somebody please make
sure they page my husband?

286
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,240
Who is she?

287
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,830
It's the chief's niece.

288
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,120
camille travis,18,I
tried intubating 3 times.

289
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,970
There's some kind of obstruction.

290
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,160
My baby can't breathe.

291
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,540
Sats staying down. They're at 82%.

292
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,550
She needs a surgical airway.

293
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,650
Somebody get me a crike tray.

294
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,860
How many emergency crikes have you done?

295
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,420
Including this one? One.

296
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,780
Dude,it's the chief's niece.

297
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,880
pulse is getting weaker.

298
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,160
So we better not screw this up.

299
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,110
what are you doing?

300
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,750
trying to help her breathe.

301
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,820
she just slit her throat!

302
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,370
Suction. I need suction.

303
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,680
- Get the retractors in.
- There's so much blood.

304
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,800
You didn hit an artery,did you?

305
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,930
No,not on purpose.

306
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,090
- Oh,god.
- Oh,god.

307
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,340
Get the tube.

308
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,870
oh,god.

309
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,980
sats are going up.

310
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,300
Oh,we did it.

311
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,830
Oh,richard!

312
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,540
What the hell are you doing to my niece?

313
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,710
one thing this childdid not
need was another surgery.

314
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,950
She wasn't breathing,chief.

315
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,630
we didn't know what else to do.

316
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,520
You did the right thing.

317
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,210
But camille was diagnosed with
ovarian cancer when she was 14.

318
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,140
She's had both ovaries removed,a
hysterectomy and now this...

319
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,470
there it is,the mass.

320
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,150
no wonder she couldn't breathe.

321
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,570
I can take it out.

322
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,580
But we won't know how many more
there are until we do further studies.

323
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,870
I'm so sorry,chief.

324
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,360
She beat it twice before.

325
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,010
She'll beat it again.

326
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,320
I just had to tell a 48-year-old
woman that she's gonna die.

327
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,990
Yeah? I wish I could tell a
24-year-old woman she's gonna die.

328
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,920
I have gone out of my
way to be nice to her,

329
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,110
and this is what she does,talks
about me behind my back?

330
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,000
When were you nice to her?

331
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,220
I was nice...

332
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,350
once.

333
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,610
My point is...

334
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,440
hey,meredith.

335
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:06,990
Hey,norman.

336
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,690
'Sup,lexie?

337
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,450
come on,norman.

338
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,960
Um...dr.Shepherd asked that we
meet in adam's room in ten minutes.

339
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,210
You could at least
acknowledge that you heard me.

340
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,850
You're using the grey sister angle
to get in good with the attendings.

341
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,890
I get that.

342
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,340
But you're here on my license.

343
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,290
So if you do anything,like
kill someone,it's on me.

344
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,530
So for the rest of the
day,you're gonna hug the wall.

345
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,790
You're not gonna say anything,you're
not gonna do anything.

346
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,040
You're an intern.

347
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,280
Are welear...

348
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,800
three?

349
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,710
Lexie.

350
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,970
What?

351
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,230
It's lexie,or grey.

352
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,620
It's not three.

353
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,620
I have a name.

354
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,570
your blood tests show
low electrolyte levels,

355
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,370
low calcium and low vitamin D.

356
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,040
Have you been dieting?

357
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,950
She just lost 40 pounds.

358
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,030
Will told me if I ever got back down
to a size 4,we'd move in together.

359
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,040
How romantic.

360
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,960
We both just needed motivation.

361
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,200
I told him I wouldn't live with
a smoker,so he quit smoking.

362
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,970
The problem is,even if dr.Torres
is able to repair your fracture,

363
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,590
it won't do any good unless you're
eating more and working out less.

364
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,490
Am I right,dr.Torres?

365
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,220
Dr.Tor...

366
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
hey,are you all right?

367
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,460
Uh,uh,.Bailey's right.

368
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,620
So what,you're saying that you won't
operate unless she puts on a bunch of weight?

369
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,210
No,but,um...

370
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,340
then why are we still
talking about this?

371
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,040
We came here to get her leg fixed.

372
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,920
So fix her leg.

373
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,580
Okay.

374
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,900
How'd that discharge-
to-hospice patient go?

375
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,630
Not great.

376
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,550
There was crying and tears and...

377
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,560
more tears.

378
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,700
Tears?

379
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,980
Really?

380
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,260
Such a tough old birD.

381
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,330
I thought he'd take it like a man.

382
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,730
"He'd take it like a man"?

383
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,860
What,I'm sexist now?

384
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,800
No,"he" as in "him"?

385
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,540
Joel hanson in 2212.

386
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,800
Not gretchen bitzer in 2213?

387
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,840
Oh,dear.

388
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,500
I thought that "2" was a "3."

389
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,950
Dr.Grey,did you and
your intern tell a woman

390
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,030
who came in to have her moles
removed that she was dying?

391
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,190
Oh,dear.

392
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,320
I mean,crap.

393
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,760
Oh,crap.

394
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,430
You hear that?

395
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,910
Like a weight room.

396
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,430
There's nothing to be scared of.

397
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,650
He's been weight training
since he was 8 years old.

398
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,940
what did I say about you and the wall?

399
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,420
Dr.Yang,this is still a
teaching hospital,isn't it?

400
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,170
yes,sir.

401
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,510
You need to get a little closer if you
want to learn something today,dr.Grey.

402
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,540
Okay,adam,I'm going to
attach the tongs now.

403
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,390
I need you to stay perfectly
still during this procedure.

404
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,070
Let the weights do all the work.

405
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,080
Okay,you're gonna
feel a little pressure,

406
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,560
but with the meds we've given
you,you shouldn't feel any pain.

407
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,710
All right.

408
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,290
Here we go.

409
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,780
Can you imagine being 14 years old and
having some doctor tell you you've got cancer?

410
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,510
What do you do with that?

411
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,530
Well,you fighT. Camille's a fighter.

412
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,130
You two have that in common.

413
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,990
So what's it gonna be,

414
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,240
stevens gets her bones broken or
torres gets taken to the trailer park?

415
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,980
Neither. It's not happening.

416
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,840
But if it does,will you pull her off me?

417
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,340
You gonna tell me what you did to her?

418
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,070
You have to promise not
to say anything to anybody.

419
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,820
Swear.

420
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,140
I swear.

421
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,420
Jeez.

422
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,530
I slept with georgE.

423
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,350
I know.

424
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,270
I'm a terrible person.

425
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,890
Which is why I'm gonna let
herget one good punch in.

426
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,030
Maybe two.

427
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,590
I deserve it.

428
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,340
No,one. Then you pull her off me.

429
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,630
You slept with o'malley?

430
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,710
Alex,you just said you
wouldn't say anything.

431
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,650
I won't,believe me.

432
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,790
This...

433
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,570
I'm embarrassed for you.

434
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,340
you had one job... one
job... read the charts.

435
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,890
You want to yell at me some more?

436
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,560
You can,because I am an intern and according
to dr.Bailey,yelling is how we learn.

437
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,650
Well,I'm not a very good yeller.

438
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,320
Oh,I'm sure it just takes practice.

439
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,610
Perhaps ms.Bitzer will
show us how it's done.

440
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,380
Just let me do all the talking.

441
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,410
Ms.Bitzer...

442
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,720
gretchen.

443
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,960
She left about an hour ago.

444
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,780
She's gone?

445
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,300
Left the hospital?

446
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,200
Feel like yelling now?

447
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,500
Yo C.T.Results showed that
not only is the cancer back,

448
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,380
it's spread to your
chest,lungs and throat.

449
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,730
We have options,though.

450
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,100
We can operate.

451
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,450
We can be even more aggressive with the
chemo and radiation than the last time.

452
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,520
I just want to go home.

453
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,450
We could try to treat you
at home,but,camille,you...

454
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,250
no,you don't understand.

455
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,850
I don't want any treatment.

456
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,540
what?

457
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,950
camille,don't say that.

458
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,990
I've tried,mama.

459
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,970
It not working.

460
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,450
I can't do it anymore.

461
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,650
You can d you will.

462
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,190
You have no choice.

463
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,830
I'm 18 now,aunt adele.

464
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,140
I do have a choice.

465
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,170
You may be 18,baby girl,

466
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,870
but you are clearly not capable of making
life-and-death decisions for yourself right now.

467
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,240
Tell her,richard.

468
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,790
- Camille...
- no,you tell her.

469
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,680
Tell her how the radiation
almost killed me last time,

470
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:08,260
how I got hepatitis and my kidneys shut down
and my skin was so raw I couldn'te touched.

471
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,270
- Camille...
- I'm dying.

472
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,050
We all know that.

473
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,140
I don't want to spend what little
time I have left in this hospital.

474
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,230
I want to spend time with my friends.

475
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,170
I want to sleep in my own
bed,and I want to be home.

476
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,670
So please don't be my doctor right now.

477
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,290
Be my uncle who loves me.

478
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,430
Let me go home.

479
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,360
try not to move your head,adam.

480
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,720
I'm...I'm trying,but...

481
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,010
I don't know how much
longer I can take this.

482
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,500
You'll take as much
as they give you,son.

483
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,000
Okay,now come on! You can do this.

484
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,570
It's just another few pounds.

485
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,950
- Dr.Yang,maybe we should...
- no one asked you.

486
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,340
I-I can'T.

487
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,180
Please take it off.

488
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,120
No,no. Can't quit.

489
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,210
Push through it.

490
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,450
Okay,just one more plate.

491
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,620
Adam,you're strong. You can handle this.

492
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,280
Want to be a quitter,do you? Huh,do you?

493
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,620
Okay,you know what?
That's it. That's it.

494
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,180
That's 20 pounds.

495
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,210
There,you did it. Right?

496
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,070
Told you you could do it.

497
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,610
Somebody get him out.
Please. Somebody get him out.

498
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,730
Adam,I'm just trying to help out.

499
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,010
Please get out! Get out!

500
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,870
- Get out! Get out!
- Adam,adam,calm down.

501
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,870
Try not to upset him.

502
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,520
- Adam. adam,calm down.
- Get...get...

503
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,440
Adam,it's o... it's okay.

504
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,150
What are you doing? Don't touch him.

505
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,430
The slightest movement could...

506
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,720
put his hand down,gently.

507
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:29,890
I'm so sorry. I forgot.

508
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,670
Now step away from the
patient and leave the room.

509
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,650
Get out right now or
I will throw you out.

510
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,350
Dr.Grey,take over for dr.Yang.

511
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,880
Dr.Yang,a word.

512
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,630
You are a resident now.

513
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,530
Your job is to teach
interns,not abuse them.

514
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,800
I wasn'T. She grabbed his...

515
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,580
until you learn to be less
competitive and less selfish,

516
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,180
you will not assist on my surgeries.

517
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,300
You will observe them.

518
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,570
- But she...
- you can go.

519
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,900
Arlene,she's just tired.

520
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,950
She doesn't know what she's saying.

521
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,470
But she's right.

522
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,680
She's not gonna get any better.

523
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,260
We don't know that,arlene.

524
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,210
There's always a chance.

525
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,910
Not if she doesn't get treatment.

526
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,250
You've got to talk to her,richard.

527
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,080
You've... you have to convince her.

528
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,890
She loves yoU.

529
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,200
She trusts you.

530
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,360
And she's the closest thing
we have to a child of our own.

531
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,210
Richard,I'm begging you.

532
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,540
Please.

533
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,890
Save our baby girl.

534
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,560
Again,ms.Bitzer,it's very
important that you call us back.

535
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,250
You idiots still can't find her?

536
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,290
I called her home,her
cell,her next of kin.

537
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,420
I don't care if you have to
call every bitzer on the planet.

538
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,790
Find her!

539
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,190
I am really so very sorry about this.

540
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,770
It's not entirely your fault,norman.

541
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,670
You're just an intern.

542
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,380
I should've double-checked the charts.

543
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,720
I was distracted by things
I shouldn't be distracted by.

544
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,870
For what it's worth,lexie
grey is a good girl.

545
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,220
She's very sweet.

546
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,940
I don't think she would
say anything untoward...

547
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,710
or uncool.

548
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,810
I have bitzers to call.

549
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,160
But,you know,you could take the...

550
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,850
norman?

551
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,180
Norman?

552
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,990
I'm not a bad resident,am I?

553
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,950
Don't ask me. I lost a patient today.

554
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,280
Oh,you killed someone?

555
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,430
Lost. Literally can't find.

556
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,980
Shepherd says I'm
selfish and competitive.

557
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,300
What the hell is wrong with that?

558
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,970
I kick ass. I'm an excellent resident.

559
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,700
I'm not.

560
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,700
In addition to losing my
patient,I also lost my intern.

561
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,300
Turned around,he was gone. Awol.

562
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,640
See,what...what is
wrong with these interns?

563
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,430
We weren't like this.

564
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,740
We were great interns.

565
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,270
I was great.

566
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,000
You were...you were good.

567
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,630
- You guys seen callie?
- No.

568
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,090
Is it time for herto
grind your bones into dust?

569
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,570
You don't think I can take her?

570
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,630
- Are you guys really doing this?
- You heard?

571
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,700
The whole hospital heard.

572
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,470
Yeah,well,that explainsthe
line at the salad bar.

573
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,670
Well,what are you fighting about?

574
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,050
Believe me,you don't want to know.

575
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,660
Alex.

576
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,800
I'm just saying,whatever
it is,it's not worth it.

577
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,730
Actually,it is.

578
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,040
Some things are worth fighting for.

579
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,860
O'malley.

580
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,600
Picking up repeat
labs for ruthie sayles.

581
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,150
So who's your money on,o'malley?Guess
you gotta back the wife,huh?

582
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,840
What?What are you talking about?

583
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,110
The fight downstairs.Torres vs.Stevens.

584
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,290
What are they fighting about anyway?

585
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,250
Oh,maile,that's just a rumor.

586
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,540
It's not happening.

587
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,100
Callie is way too mature for that.

588
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,410
That's not what my buddy
in the cafeteria just said.

589
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,100
- o'malley,your labs!
- Gotta go!I'll be right back!

590
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,320
I'm just saying,I learned how
to fight in a trailer park.Okay?

591
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,250
Where'd she learn to fight,boarding
school?Not quite the same thing.

592
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,600
I'm a street fighter.

593
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,930
I've got some badass in me.

594
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,410
I could take a girl down.

595
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,150
izzie.

596
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,340
punch with your left.Protect
your face with your right.

597
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,820
No,your hands... protect
your surgeon hands.

598
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,390
Your face can heal.

599
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,000
Here we go.

600
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,090
stevens.

601
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,460
Let's do this.

602
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,820
Let's go.

603
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,300
Let's go.

604
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,210
- Go where?
- You know,go.

605
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,220
I wanted to talk.

606
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,750
you want to talk.You
don't want to kick my ass?

607
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,260
You thought I was gonna fight you?You...

608
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,810
that's cr...

609
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,370
excuse me.

610
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,010
that's a forfeit.Torres forfeits.

611
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,020
Oh,my god.

612
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,850
You were very ghetto fabulous.

613
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,950
Oh,my god.

614
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,930
What happened?Was there a fight?

615
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,770
no.

616
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,320
Guess they realized they
were fighting over nothing.

617
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,180
Hey,what do you think's a better
weekend getaway,napa or sonoma?

618
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,780
I hope you don't mind if
I kill your girlfriend.

619
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,690
Well,first of all,she's
not my girlfriend.

620
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,480
Second of all,I do mind.

621
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,090
Interns should be seen and not heard.

622
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,340
They shouldn't talk to patients.

623
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,620
That's how they learn.

624
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,600
Which means I have to teach,

625
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,900
and then I have to deal with
their problems when they screw up.

626
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,140
Meredith rarely screws
up,and she's not an intern.

627
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,930
So napa or sonoma,what do you think?

628
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,780
- Sonoma.
- Mm.

629
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,000
Smaller hotels,fewer tourists.

630
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,730
And meredith...

631
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,250
she's still an
intern.Don't kid yourself.

632
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,730
She's green,she's a baby,and
the only difference between her

633
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,790
and that old guy she's
got trailing her is

634
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,490
that you're not sleeping
with the old guy.

635
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Sorry I'm late.

636
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,250
Well,I was just explaining the surgery.

637
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,300
Since your bones have splintered,

638
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,880
dr.Torres will place metal plates
and screws to hold the ankle together.

639
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,280
How long will the recovery time be?

640
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,430
It's hard to say.

641
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,870
You'll be in a cast 8 to 12 weeks.

642
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,240
Three months?

643
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,530
Right,dr.Torres?

644
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,060
Longer if she doesn't eat.

645
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,980
She eats.

646
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,700
Not enough to keep her
bones from snapping,

647
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,940
but you don't seem too
concerned about that.

648
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,020
- What is your problem,lady?
- I don't have paroblem.

649
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,860
- I'm not the one who has to live with you.
- You know what?

650
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,110
- Thiis... you have a problem...
- ruthie!

651
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,650
in her go ahead.

652
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,350
In here.

653
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,920
I thought ruthie wasn't going
into surgery till tomorrow.

654
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,210
That's before she
started vomiting blood.

655
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,910
She's got a bleeding duodenal ulcer.

656
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,150
How did we not see this?

657
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,700
She came in with a broken ankle.

658
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,910
Her malnutrition and the amount
of ibuprofen she's been taking,

659
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,520
she's lucky to be alive.

660
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,030
why did she do this to herself?

661
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,580
'Cause people are stupid
and just want to be loved.

662
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,010
That's the only reason
anybody does anything.

663
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,950
asystole.

664
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,670
OK,Start C.P.R.

665
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,460
you think he'll walk again?

666
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,340
It's not impossible.

667
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,440
Mm.We have a bleeder.

668
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,680
I need you to cauterize
the vein,dr.Grey.

669
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,870
Oh,okay.

670
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,500
I...

671
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,720
I,um...

672
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:44,840
I-I can't find it.

673
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,590
I-I-I can't see
where it starts.Um...

674
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,810
it's coming too quickly.

675
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,810
Stop.Suction around it.

676
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,600
You have to see where the
bleed is coming from first.

677
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,860
Follow the flow to the source.Good.

678
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,380
Okay,now bovie it.

679
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,880
Got it.

680
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,520
Good job.

681
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,630
Dr.Yang,if you don't mind stepping in?

682
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,670
Dr.Grey.

683
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,420
Norman,where haveou been?

684
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,230
- I was...
- norman,do you think you can just cut out on me

685
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,500
in the middle of a crisis?

686
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,740
- I-I went...
- where,norman?

687
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,400
Where did you go that was important enough
to just disappear in the middle of a shift?

688
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,400
- Ms.Bitzer's apartment.
- You went to ms.Bitzer's apartment.

689
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,090
I told her she had a bill outstanding.

690
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,820
- She's right behind me.
- Oh.

691
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,450
Oh,but if I may say so,your
yelling has improved remarkably.

692
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,060
Thank you.

693
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,860
I-I'm sorry I missed your calls.

694
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,330
I didn't mean to cut out on my bill.

695
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,750
It's just,I got a lot of living to
do and not a lot of time to do it in.

696
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,130
- Actually...
- I quit my job,dumped my loser boyfriend,

697
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,920
told my boss where he could shove it,

698
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,000
and bought a one-way ticket to iceland,

699
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,300
where the sun never
sets,which is fine by me.

700
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,210
I'll sleep when I'm dead,right?

701
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,880
You're,uh,not going to die,ms. Bitzer.

702
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:58,190
- I'm not? - There was
a mix-up with your labs.

703
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,650
You're going to live,hopefully
a very long,healthy life.

704
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,200
I quit my job.

705
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,920
I broke up with my boyfriend.

706
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,240
I gave up my apartment.

707
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,750
you know how hard it is
to find an apartment...

708
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,560
with parking?

709
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,150
I thought you quit smoking.

710
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,400
Wasn't that the deal?

711
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,490
Ruthie loses 40 pounds,you quit smoking?

712
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,200
My girlfriend's in emergency surgery.

713
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,070
I think she'll forgive me for smoking.

714
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,440
No,no,she won't,because she's dead.

715
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,420
Ruthie's dead.

716
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,280
Dr.Bailey tried to stop the bleeding,

717
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,040
but because she was starving
herself and over training,

718
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,530
her heart couldn't take the strain.

719
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,250
You think this is my fault?

720
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,950
She wanted to lose the weight.

721
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,430
I just wanted herto be healthy.

722
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,970
She was healthy 20 pounds ago.

723
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,410
You just wanted her to be hot,

724
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,460
- especially if you we gonna move in with her,right?
- No,that...

725
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,350
- I loved her.
- You didn't love her.

726
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,770
You just didn't want
to be alone or maybe

727
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,630
maybe she was good for your ego or...

728
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,850
or maybe she made you feel
better about your miserable life,

729
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,190
but you didn't love her because you
don't destroy the person that you love!

730
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,120
- Callie!
- Get her away from me,man.

731
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,730
- Get her away from me.
- You gonna hit me?You gonna hit me?

732
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,790
Give me any excuse to
kick somebody's ass today

733
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:30,590
- because I am dying to!
- Don't touch me!

734
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,380
dr.Torres!

735
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,450
Uh,sir,we are so sorry for your loss.

736
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,770
- O'malley,please take...
- sir,why don't you come with me?

737
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,870
Come on.

738
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:52,330
Okay,I'm gonna ask you one
last time,are you all right?

739
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,130
I'm fine.It's nothing.

740
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,500
Really?

741
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,030
'Cause nothing almost cost
you your career just now.

742
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:23,310
The mass we removed from your throat
was so big you couldn't breathe.

743
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,940
Camille...

744
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,380
what took you so long to come in?

745
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,090
I knew the cancer wasn't gone.

746
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,060
It's never been gone.

747
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,780
It's never gonna be gone.

748
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,370
And...

749
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,160
don't tell my mom,but the truth is...

750
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,980
I was hoping it would kill me
before I had to come back here.

751
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,400
I'm just so tired,uncle richard.

752
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:03,000
I am so,so tired.

753
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,250
Camille...

754
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,450
what I have here is a
plan to keep you alive.

755
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:25,340
It involves 12 oncologists,8 new drugs,

756
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,330
six experimental treatments
from three different continents.

757
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,910
I have no idea if it'll work.

758
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,990
But as your uncle...

759
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,240
I'm begging you to take it.

760
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,010
Because I know for a fact the world...

761
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,930
my world...

762
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,980
is a better place with you in it.

763
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,220
However...as your doctor,

764
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,330
I promise to do whatever you want.

765
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,050
I just want to go home.

766
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,710
Then let's get you home.

767
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,600
Callie.

768
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,020
Callie,wait.Please,wait.

769
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,660
Please.

770
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,530
I'm sorry...

771
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,630
about the cafeteria.

772
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,830
I didn't know that you
wanted to talk to me.

773
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,650
I thought you wanted to kill me.

774
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,210
I'm sorry about everything.

775
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,830
With george,I...

776
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,280
I'm really sorry.

777
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,720
I feel terrible.

778
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,210
You feel terrible?

779
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,060
You took advantage.He was your
best friend.I tried to trust you...

780
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,550
so much,I had convinced myself that
it was all in my head,that I was crazy.

781
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,790
But I wasn't,was I?

782
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,570
And then you pull that
thing in the cafeteria today?

783
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,370
It's not bad enough that you humiliate
me by getting in bed with my husband.

784
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,610
You have to humiliate me at work,too.

785
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,940
George might be the one that
broke his vows,but you...

786
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,250
we're women,izzie.You
did this to another woman.

787
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,300
You...

788
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,790
took something from me.

789
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,470
You stole something from me
like a petty little thief.

790
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,150
You are the one who
should be humiliated.

791
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,090
You are the one who should be ashamed.

792
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,660
You are the one who should...

793
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,000
don't you dare come to me for
forgiveness,you traitorous bitch.

794
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,400
What,I'm invisible now?

795
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,490
What do you want?

796
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,060
So you hate me now,too.

797
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,450
Well,join the club.

798
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,120
You and o'malley?

799
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,300
- O'malley!
- What?

800
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,960
What is it that I did
that is so horrifying?

801
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,840
I fell in love,alex.

802
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,350
- He's married.
- Yeah,so?

803
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,640
You're carrying a big ol' torch for ava

804
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,730
or jane doe or whatever it is that
you call her,and she's married.

805
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,150
So what gives you the
right to judge what I do?

806
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,450
Why do you even care?

807
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,930
you told me you weren't ready yet...

808
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,310
after denny...to be with anyone.

809
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,040
And then o'malley?O'malley.

810
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:44,430
And then you tell me like
I'm one of your chick friends.

811
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,820
Come on.

812
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,940
Ms.Bitzer,I just wanted
to apologize one more time.

813
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,920
Oh,and I just wanted to
say thank you,dr.Grey.

814
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,770
And,you,too,dr.Shales.Bless you.

815
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,270
Bye-bye.

816
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,520
- She's not going to sue?
- Nope.

817
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,030
Our lawyer talked her into settling.

818
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,140
Seattle grace just bought
that woman four bedrooms

819
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,310
and three and a half baths in reykjavíK.

820
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,840
- I'm so sorry.
- Well,don't tell me.

821
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,500
Tell the chief.I'm writing you both up.

822
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,140
It wasn't norman's
fault.He's my responsibility.

823
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,490
I'm the resident.I'm the
only one you should write up.

824
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,790
That's very noble of you,dr.Grey.

825
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,920
Stupid...

826
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,330
but noble.

827
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,310
Oh.

828
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,000
For the record,dr.Grey,I don't
think you're stupid at all.

829
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,000
I find you...

830
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,810
quite smart.

831
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,670
What did you say to camille?

832
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,180
Adele... I've already lost one baby.

833
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,630
And now I have to lose camille?

834
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,530
I am not going to use camille to try and make
up for the fact that I never gave you children.

835
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,270
I never asked you to.

836
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:07,600
I asked you to talk to
her,to convince her to...

837
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,850
I can't do that...

838
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,730
I can't do that,adele.

839
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,600
I can give her all the
options in the world,

840
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:20,130
but I cannot make her
do what I want her to do.

841
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,640
I'm her doctor.

842
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,750
I thought being a doctor
was about saving lives.

843
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,170
After all these years of choosing
your job over your family,

844
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,380
the one time I ask you to do
your job to save this family...

845
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,910
adele,I'm sorry.

846
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,910
I'm truly,truly sorry,but...

847
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:50,250
so am I,richard.

848
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,240
callie...

849
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,840
you can'T...

850
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,400
just forgive me.

851
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,770
What I did to you...

852
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,230
I-is unforgivable.

853
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,700
That's how it works.That's
what "I forgive you" means.

854
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,670
No,see,I...

855
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,900
I think it means you
don't forgive me.I...

856
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,990
you don't know how to
talk to me right noW.

857
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,710
I mean,look,you don't...you
can't even look at me.

858
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,550
You're so angry that...

859
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,570
I think the only way you can deal
with me is to say you forgive me and...

860
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,330
what,we pretend it didn't happen?

861
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,770
I...

862
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,730
it happened.

863
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,080
And you don't forgive me.

864
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,650
You're right.

865
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,850
I don'T.

866
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,180
- So I got alex to cover for me.
- Oh.

867
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,800
- So I can leave right after 
I round on my patients.
- Yeah.

868
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,070
- 48 uninterrupted hours...
- yeah,yeah.Um...

869
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,740
you know what?Maybe this
is not a good weekend.

870
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,330
What did lexie say about me?

871
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,720
She didn't say anything.I
did all the talking.

872
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,510
Look,don't blame her.

873
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,590
So what,you're friends
with my sister now?

874
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,610
I mean,you talk to the
other grey about me?

875
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,000
Mm-hmm.

876
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,250
You know what I talked
about with the other grey?

877
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,460
All the things this
grey won't let me say.

878
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,500
You can say anything to me.

879
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,190
I want to marry you.

880
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,970
I want to have kids with you.

881
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,240
I want to build us a house.

882
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,440
I want to settle down
and grow old with you.

883
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,280
I want to die when I'm
110 years old in your arms.

884
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,230
I don't want 48 uninterrupted hours.

885
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,010
I want a lifetime.

886
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,670
Mm-hmm.

887
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,560
Do you see what happens?

888
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,330
I say things like that,

889
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,470
and you fight the urge to
run in the opposite direction.

890
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,220
It's okay.

891
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,430
I understand.

892
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,550
I didn't,but now I do.I do..

893
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,040
You're just getting started

894
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,790
And I've been doing
this for a long time.

895
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,210
Deep down...

896
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,020
you're still an intern.

897
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,300
And you're not ready.

898
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,390
I'm not ready right now.

899
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,340
But things could stay
the way they are...

900
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,260
And I can get ready.I'll get ready.

901
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,440
Things can stay the way they are.

902
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,520
We can still meet in the
elevator or the on call room.

903
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,870
And maybe you'll be ready.

904
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,200
And I'll wait.

905
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,450
I'll wait until you're ready.

906
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,320
Okay,then.

907
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,010
Yeah,but what if...

908
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,510
what if while I'm waiting I meet someone

909
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,160
who is ready to give
me what I want from you?

910
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,990
What if you do?

911
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,520
I don't know.

912
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,800
Forgive and forget.

913
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,040
That's what they say.

914
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,470
I just wanted to say,um,thank you for...

915
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,780
saving my ass today in surgery.

916
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,310
Well,that's my job,three.

917
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,470
Now where are adam's post-op labs?

918
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:15,010
It's good advice,but
it's not very practical.

919
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,670
I'll get them,dr.Yang.

920
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,620
when someone hurts us...

921
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,330
we want to hurt them back.

922
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,440
Come in.

923
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,570
Keep it down,will you?

924
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,250
When someone wrongs
us,we want to be right.

925
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,150
Without forgiveness,old
scores are never settled...

926
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,540
old wounds never heal.

927
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,850
And the most we can hope for

928
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,400
is that one day

929
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,860
we'll be lucky enough  to forget.
