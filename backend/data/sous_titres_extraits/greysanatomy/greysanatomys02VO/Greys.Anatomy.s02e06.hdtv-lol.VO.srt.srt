1
00:00:01,222 --> 00:00:03,070
Previously on
"Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:04,915
What is going on with you?

3
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:08,525
The hospital grants you four months
to retake the medical board exam.

4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,742
Karev, take the scalpel.

5
00:00:09,812 --> 00:00:11,764
Alex! Come on!

6
00:00:11,872 --> 00:00:12,780
Your choice?

7
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:15,470
It's simple. Her or me.

8
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:16,653
Addison is my family.

9
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,310
Then one day, I'm supposed to sign
a piece of paper and end my family?

10
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,876
- Is that your date?
- That's my husband.

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,962
- You're married?
- Ten years today.

12
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,703
Burke wants to have
a relationship.

13
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,497
Okay, we're a couple.

14
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:30,794
So pick me. Choose me. Love me.

15
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:32,298
I'll be at Joe's tonight.

16
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:36,396
So if you do decide to sign the papers,
meet me there.

17
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:37,694
Tell me what to do.

18
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,951
I actually said "pick me."

19
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:50,279
Right? I did?

20
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:51,452
"Pick me"?

21
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:52,686
I think it's romantic.

22
00:00:52,847 --> 00:00:54,180
It's not romantic, Joe.

23
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:55,405
It's horrifying.

24
00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:57,045
Horror movie horrifying.

25
00:00:57,162 --> 00:00:59,712
Carrie at the prom with
the pig's blood horrifying.

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,641
Okay, fine, it's horrifying.

27
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:05,407
But Carrie took out an entire
senior class as revenge.

28
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:07,367
I gotta say,
I like that in a girl.

29
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:09,527
I said "pick me."

30
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,995
When you tell someone I'll meet
you later at a bar tonight,

31
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:14,825
how long exactly does that
mean you're supposed to wait?

32
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,042
Do you think he's
really not coming?

33
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:18,880
It is getting a
little hard to watch.

34
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,760
It was hard to watch an hour ago.
Now it's just pathetic.

35
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:23,784
Who's pathetic?

36
00:01:25,822 --> 00:01:26,326
What?

37
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:33,630
You who pretend to be my friends are calling
me pathetic behind my back in front of my face.

38
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:37,478
Why don't you just dump the pig's
blood on me now and get it over with?

39
00:01:44,406 --> 00:01:46,134
He's really not coming.

40
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:51,499
Joe, turn up the TV.

41
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:53,353
<i>A massive train wreck occurred</i>

42
00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:55,931
- <i>just outside of Seattle moments ago.</i>
- 911?

43
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,673
We just worked a 30-hour shift.

44
00:01:57,906 --> 00:01:59,556
I don't have any
clean underwear.

45
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:03,847
<i>The Vancouver-bound train was
carrying over 300 passengers.</i>

46
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:04,792
Looks ugly.

47
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:06,730
<i>Paramedics are on the
scene helping victims.</i>

48
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,696
You're leaving?

49
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:09,301
No, no, no, you can't leave.

50
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:12,055
Sorry, gotta go tend to
someone else's train wreck.

51
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,359
You gotta at least stay
for a cup of coffee.

52
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,128
You're in no shape
to cut people open.

53
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:18,058
Plus, I don't want
to miss the ending.

54
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:19,349
Meredith?

55
00:02:19,882 --> 00:02:21,382
Maybe it's for the best.

56
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,810
Maybe I don't want to know.

57
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:25,001
That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

58
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:26,066
In general,

59
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:30,477
people can be categorized
in one of two ways--

60
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:34,256
those who love surprises

61
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,359
and those who don't.

62
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:40,596
I... don't.

63
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:52,884
Dude, you're late.

64
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:01,024
I've never met a surgeon
who enjoys a surprise.

65
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:04,522
Because, as surgeons,
we like to be in the know.

66
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,285
We have to be in the know.

67
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:09,537
Because often, when we aren't,
people die and lawsuits happen.

68
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:11,670
Am I rambling?

69
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:13,134
I think I'm rambling.

70
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:17,236
I think I saw a pneumothorax.

71
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,778
I hope I get a pneumothorax.

72
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,663
I thought you weren't
talking to me.

73
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:23,633
I thought you could use a friend,
so I'm rising above.

74
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:24,877
And why would you think that?

75
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:26,810
- Because you freaked out in the elevator?
- I didn't freak out.

76
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,644
- And missed your chance to perform an open heart surgery?
- O'Malley plugged a hole with his finger.

77
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:31,998
- I thought you could use someone to talk to.
- Well, I don't.

78
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:35,678
- Someone who actually cares about you.
- Thanks for asking, but I don't.

79
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:40,867
What are you looking at?

80
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:42,353
Nothing.

81
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:44,918
Hey, you,
go get me my damn shoes.

82
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:47,792
Let's move, people.

83
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:50,894
Hello.

84
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:53,270
I seem to be a
little bit drunk.

85
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:54,890
I was off duty.

86
00:03:54,975 --> 00:03:56,042
So was I.

87
00:03:56,175 --> 00:03:57,313
Anybody else half
in the bottle?

88
00:03:57,343 --> 00:03:58,356
- Uh, no.
- No.

89
00:03:58,501 --> 00:03:59,418
All right, then.

90
00:03:59,418 --> 00:04:01,734
Grey, just stay out of the way.
I'll deal with you later.

91
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:04,379
The rest of you stick with me
and wait for your assignments.

92
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,914
I know you get all a-quiver at
the sight of blood and organs,

93
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:08,792
but it's gonna be a long night
and you're already tired.

94
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:10,131
I don't want any mistakes.

95
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:11,054
Come on now!

96
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:20,993
- I'm so not tired anymore.
- Me neither. I'm not tired either.

97
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:25,307
We've got a third-trimester
burn victim here.

98
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:27,290
Dr. Bailey,
I'm going to need some help.

99
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,711
- Uh, Izzie, go.
- Yes!

100
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:30,925
Have a nice nap!

101
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,273
- Have you had any contractions?
- No.

102
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:40,241
Oh, hey, Joe told me to tell you
that McSteamy came looking for you.

103
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:41,171
You mean McDreamy.

104
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:43,684
Joe said McDreamy
came looking for me?

105
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:46,070
No, I'm pretty sure
it was McSteamy.

106
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:48,718
Yeah.

107
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,800
Dr. Shepherd,
could you take a look at this?

108
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:01,519
Does that mean he picked her?

109
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:04,398
If it does,
I just lost 50 bucks.

110
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:06,337
Got the leg!

111
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:09,689
I want that leg!

112
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:11,922
He lost a lot of
blood at the scene.

113
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:14,702
Pressure dressings applied,
two large bore ivs started.

114
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:15,728
Anything for pain?

115
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,730
Base ordered morphine.

116
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,010
5 migs given so far.

117
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,658
Dr. Bailey, who you got?

118
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,645
Cristina, go.

119
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:26,497
- Rule out other injuries and book an O.R.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,471
Dr. Webber.

121
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:29,003
We have a train wreck, Derek.

122
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,320
We need all hands on deck.

123
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:31,756
Now clear me for
surgery or you're fired.

124
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:33,051
- Any headaches today?
- No.

125
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:36,134
- Dizziness? Nausea? Blurred vision?
- No, no and no.

126
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:39,094
- Now get out of my way.
- Fine, but I'm coming with you.

127
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:40,563
- Or I'm fired.
- Up to you.

128
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:50,775
- Was that a nod?
- Yes.

129
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:52,526
- Do we know what it meant?
- No.

130
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:56,087
Am I invisible?

131
00:05:56,194 --> 00:06:00,569
Okay, so my point actually,
and I do have one,

132
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:06,068
has nothing to do with surprises or
death or lawsuits or even surgeons.

133
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:08,009
My point is this--

134
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:13,517
whoever said "what you don't know can't
hurt you," was a complete and total moron.

135
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:18,831
Because for most people I know, not
knowing is the worst feeling in the world.

136
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:28,424
Okay, fine.

137
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:30,496
Maybe it's the second worst.

138
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,199
His B.P.'s holding
steady at 90 over palp.

139
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:45,837
She's had two hypotensive
episodes to the low 70s.

140
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,109
You couldn't get
a saw in there?

141
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,289
Not without moving 'em.

142
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:50,695
Which would've been
a very bad idea.

143
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:52,564
Did you bolus her with fluids?

144
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,772
Is this the craziest
thing you've ever seen?

145
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,673
Um, yeah.

146
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:04,257
Yeah.

147
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,896
Me too.

148
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,110
Okay, then,
you guys got it from here.

149
00:07:13,943 --> 00:07:17,211
Hey, uh, you were at the scene?

150
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:19,385
Won't be too bad for you.

151
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:20,313
Lot of carnage.

152
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:21,535
Not a lot of survivors.

153
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,251
They're never
gonna fit into C.T.

154
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:25,696
We're gonna be flying blind.

155
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:28,439
Get x-rays and labs and page
me the minute you're done.

156
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:29,470
Excuse me.

157
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,875
Hi, I'm Dr. Burke.

158
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:34,104
You shouldn't turn your head.

159
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:36,482
You want to try to move
as little as possible.

160
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:38,173
Oh, okay.

161
00:07:38,935 --> 00:07:42,699
So are you gonna pull this
pole out of us anytime soon?

162
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:44,238
It's a touch uncomfortable.

163
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:48,486
I'm sorry. We can't do that until we get
a better look at what's going on internally.

164
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:51,216
But I assure you,
we will work as quickly as possible.

165
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:55,481
Well, in that case,
does anybody have a breath mint?

166
00:07:58,055 --> 00:07:59,049
For me.

167
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:00,429
Not for you.

168
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:03,760
Get them going.

169
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:06,126
Uh, O'Malley,
get them to x-ray.

170
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:08,357
Thanks.

171
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:11,169
Move them extremely carefully.

172
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,991
This never would've happened
before the elevator.

173
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,886
You go, George.

174
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:21,058
Alex, cover the E.R.

175
00:08:21,262 --> 00:08:24,938
You can do sutures while you get
over your newfound fear of scalpels.

176
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:29,565
That was mean, even for you.

177
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:32,314
You are drunk.

178
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:36,041
Go get yourself a banana bag I.V.,
put it in your arm and then find me.

179
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:37,825
Do not speak to
any more patients.

180
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,641
Do not practice any medicine.

181
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:41,415
Well, should I just go home?

182
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,529
Well, unless you drank the whole liquor
bottle, you'll be sober in a few hours.

183
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,959
And the I.V.
fluids will head off your hangover.

184
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:51,874
Then you can assist with the many mangled
victims you see spread out before you.

185
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:54,504
Besides, if I'm not going home,
nobody's going home.

186
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,190
Ten years of marriage.

187
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:58,608
I didn't even get to
finish my damn lobster.

188
00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:02,472
Well, um,
is there anyone you'd like me to call?

189
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:04,310
No, they called my wife
from the ambulance.

190
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,458
And my fiancé. They're flying
down from Vancouver together.

191
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:11,825
Normally Amanda would be a tad upset to
find me pressed up against another woman.

192
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:14,245
But in this case,
I think I'll get a pass.

193
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:15,975
You two weren't
traveling together?

194
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:17,855
No, we just met.

195
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,578
Bit of an awkward introduction.

196
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,299
You have very nice pores.

197
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:24,194
Oh, it hurts to laugh.

198
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:27,233
- Hey.
- Hey.

199
00:09:28,203 --> 00:09:30,290
- You can go ahead.
- Oh thanks!

200
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:36,579
- Do you like, uh, I could--
- Yeah, go ahead.

201
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,304
Dr. Stevens,
did you need something?

202
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:51,537
No.

203
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:56,253
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I doing this too--

204
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:00,139
Was that a...

205
00:10:00,186 --> 00:10:01,550
- did I have...
- A contraction.

206
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,180
It was definitely
a contraction.

207
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,407
We need to book an O.R.

208
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:07,763
Look, you are in no shape to push,
and the baby is still in some distress.

209
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:10,193
We're going to have to
proceed with a c-section.

210
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:13,179
Okay.

211
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:17,351
Okay, but can we
call a lawyer first?

212
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:19,561
I don't have a will.

213
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:22,196
And there's no father.

214
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,298
And in case something
happens to me...

215
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:29,007
There's no cause for panic,
Brooke, we have some time, okay?

216
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:30,958
Okay.

217
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,553
Hello.

218
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:36,239
Oh, no, no, we're fine, honey.

219
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,569
Yeah, some redneck tried
to outrun the train.

220
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:40,419
Honey, the train
slammed into his ass

221
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,380
- and then it rolled.
- Does that hurt?

222
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:45,307
Oh, no, no, no, no,
that dude is toast.

223
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:47,240
Honey, him and about
200 other people.

224
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,182
And Mary got her
face all cut up.

225
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:50,501
Does it hurt anywhere else?

226
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:51,537
Here.

227
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:55,652
A whole bunch of luggage, when they hit
the brakes, it just came flying at us.

228
00:10:55,682 --> 00:11:00,503
All right, we'll take you for an x-ray, see if
anything's broken, if there's any internal injuries.

229
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:01,508
Okay.

230
00:11:02,257 --> 00:11:03,720
Yeah, wait, wait,
you know, hold on.

231
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,663
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

232
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:06,264
Hey, hey, hey,
excuse me, excuse me.

233
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:08,014
Um, where you going?

234
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:09,979
I'm taking your
friend for an x-ray.

235
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:13,706
No offense, little boy,
but you look like my oldest son.

236
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,017
And he's nothing but trouble.

237
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:16,236
Yvonne, shut up.

238
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,701
I said "no offense."

239
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:18,603
I'm just saying.

240
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:20,146
Are you sure you're a doctor?

241
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:25,596
Yeah? Oh, yeah, yeah, we fine.

242
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:28,732
Yeah, some redneck tried to
outrun the train, right?

243
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:36,482
What are you doing?

244
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:41,006
Trying to insert my banana bag, which
sounds vaguely dirty, but it isn't.

245
00:11:42,813 --> 00:11:43,624
I can do it.

246
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:46,094
So how's it going with Addison?

247
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:48,003
Bad mood?

248
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:49,206
Good mood?

249
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:51,540
Yay, my husband picked me mood?

250
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:56,884
Uh, I think it's more of a I hate
the smell of charred flesh mood.

251
00:11:58,756 --> 00:12:01,917
Before you judge me,
I know there was a train accident.

252
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,805
People are very badly hurt.

253
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,426
And that I'm a vapid narcissist
when you mix me with alcohol.

254
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:10,197
In case you were wondering,
I know that.

255
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:15,500
Well, for what it's worth, I take
issue with her salmon-colored scrubs.

256
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:19,381
I mean, what self-respecting
surgeon wears salmon-colored scrubs?

257
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:20,728
This is what I'm saying.

258
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:26,687
Thank you.

259
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:30,246
Yang, how's that wound looking?

260
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,107
Pretty clean.

261
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:32,787
Some dirt and gravel mostly.

262
00:12:32,964 --> 00:12:34,075
This guy was lucky.

263
00:12:34,156 --> 00:12:35,174
It's a guillotine injury.

264
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:37,754
If we do this right he'll
have full use of his leg.

265
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:41,311
Dr. Shepherd?

266
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:44,734
It'll wait.

267
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:47,959
I'm fine, Derek.

268
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,450
Just adjusting to the light.

269
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,010
All I'm saying is there's no shame
in taking a little more time off.

270
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,140
It doesn't make you
old or tired or rusty.

271
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:57,655
Yeah, okay,
that came out wrong.

272
00:12:57,793 --> 00:12:59,743
You're the only
attending neurosurgeon.

273
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:02,810
You're obviously needed elsewhere,
and I'm fine here.

274
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,199
Page me if you need me.

275
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:12,174
When you're finished cleaning that
wound, you can help me here, Dr. Yang.

276
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:18,328
Is the wound clean, Yang?

277
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,603
Yes, sir.

278
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:22,086
- I-- but...
- But what?

279
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,594
If your plan is to be a
watchdog for Dr. Shepherd,

280
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:29,465
or if you think your job here is to
babysit me, then you can think again.

281
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:31,919
I've been a surgeon longer
than you've been breathing.

282
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:35,046
And if I were not ready to be
in this O.R., I would say so.

283
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,048
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

284
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:39,146
Now do we have a problem, Yang?

285
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:40,328
Uh, yes.

286
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:43,940
No, sir,
I-I'm thrilled to learn.

287
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,073
And I'm grateful to be here.
It's just...

288
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:47,994
that...

289
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,886
Sorry.

290
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,428
- His legs--
- What about them?

291
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:57,359
They're both left.

292
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,886
Find the man's leg, Yang.

293
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:05,315
- Find it now.
- Yes, sir.

294
00:14:06,702 --> 00:14:09,899
- Is it going straight through her spine?
- It is.

295
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:11,589
T8's completely crushed.

296
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:16,453
What happened?

297
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:18,811
Uh, tequila.

298
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:22,518
I'm keeping an eye on her.

299
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:25,774
Look at this.

300
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:27,870
These people are still alive?

301
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,500
They're still
making small talk.

302
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:32,882
The pole's tamponading the
wound as far as we can see.

303
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:34,407
It's hitting the aorta.

304
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,976
Look at him. It's right in line
with his inferior vena cava.

305
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:41,143
Is there any way to operate
without separating them?

306
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:42,320
No.

307
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,170
- If we remove the pole then...
- They'll both bleed out.

308
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:49,854
What if we don't move the pole?

309
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:54,577
What if we move one of the patients
off the pole to get the saw in there?

310
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:57,952
Then we can hold the pole
steady in the other one.

311
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:01,403
Move it very slowly and
repair the damage as we go.

312
00:15:01,524 --> 00:15:02,431
Who?

313
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:04,714
Which would you move?

314
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:11,044
With her aortic injuries, her chances of
survival are extremely slim no matter what we do.

315
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:15,857
But if we move her,
we have a real shot at saving him.

316
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:20,096
Well, I could argue since her injuries
are more extensive, we should move him.

317
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:21,670
Give her the best shot we can.

318
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:27,338
So basically,
whoever you move doesn't stand a chance?

319
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:33,199
So how do you choose?

320
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,084
How do you decide
who gets to live?

321
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:45,437
We have to make this call soon if we
want a shot at saving either one of them.

322
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:47,320
I'd like to examine
them before I weigh in.

323
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,550
I'll wait for your page.

324
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:49,727
Dr. Grey--

325
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:54,510
Dr. Grey needs to get herself a blood
alcohol test before practicing any medicine tonight.

326
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:56,202
What? No, I'm totally fine.

327
00:15:56,294 --> 00:15:56,970
Look.

328
00:15:58,331 --> 00:15:59,293
Totally fine.

329
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:03,289
Right, okay.

330
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:05,967
I'm fine.

331
00:16:06,046 --> 00:16:08,596
Regretting that last shooter about now,
aren't you?

332
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:14,128
What are you doing in here?

333
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:16,330
Uh, the leg you brought
in with the amputee--

334
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,656
I didn't bring in an amputee.

335
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,021
Okay, well, um,
one of you did, and it's, um--

336
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:23,291
Because all paramedics look
alike to you, right, doctor?

337
00:16:23,422 --> 00:16:27,565
Okay, really, I cannot straddle
another giant ego right now.

338
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:30,030
I'm already doing the splits,
so I need the right leg,

339
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,960
right now or the chief of surgery is
going to take away my pretty blue scrubs.

340
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:36,231
When the train derailed,
it hit an overpass.

341
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,438
The roof of the dining car was sheered
off and it sliced through a passenger car.

342
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:41,563
There were
multiple decapitations.

343
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:44,032
Your guy can live
without his leg.

344
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,793
This is so not about
the leg or the guy.

345
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:50,187
But thank you.

346
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,593
For all that you do, really.

347
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:54,055
Thanks.

348
00:16:57,421 --> 00:16:58,911
Mm-hmm, yeah.

349
00:16:59,032 --> 00:17:00,602
Oh, yeah, honey, we fine.

350
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:02,646
Yeah, but some redneck
tried to outrun the train.

351
00:17:02,676 --> 00:17:04,802
Then they go and give us
this little boy doctor--

352
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:07,328
All right,
the scar shouldn't be too bad.

353
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,609
Can you tell me, my friend,
she's pregnant, too.

354
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:15,005
She was put in a
different ambulance.

355
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:16,925
She was burned.

356
00:17:17,882 --> 00:17:19,132
Do you know where she is?

357
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,037
If she's not down here,
she should be up in maternity.

358
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:23,648
Okay, I need to see her.

359
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,921
We're not finished yet.

360
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:26,451
- We still have to do a full exam.
- My baby's fine.

361
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:28,463
I can feel her kicking.
I've gotta see Brooke.

362
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:31,045
Uh, wait, you can't just
leave like that. Just wait.

363
00:17:31,075 --> 00:17:32,125
Come here, come here.

364
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:36,714
Sorry.

365
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,653
You operated on a
heart earlier, George.

366
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,783
You'd think you could
draw a little blood.

367
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,285
I rocked that heart.

368
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:43,572
Yeah, you did.

369
00:17:44,662 --> 00:17:48,002
I think I'm strung
out on the scalpel.

370
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,202
Nothing wrong with that.

371
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:57,621
- So any news about...
- No.

372
00:17:58,197 --> 00:17:59,561
I can't read him.

373
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,260
You know, I think it's pretty
amazing you even gave him the choice.

374
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:09,054
And I think, for what it's worth, I
think he's crazy if he doesn't pick you.

375
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,153
Please tell me you've
seen a right leg.

376
00:18:13,274 --> 00:18:14,674
A cleanly severed right leg?

377
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:16,258
No.

378
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:19,742
How weird is this job?

379
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,125
Weird.

380
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:25,170
Brooke?

381
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:26,424
Jana?

382
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:30,819
Thank god.

383
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:31,693
Dr. Karev?

384
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,150
- I couldn't stop her. She wanted to see her.
- She was on the train?

385
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,130
- Yes.
- Have you done an ultrasound?

386
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,948
Cleared her c-spine?

387
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:42,741
Is there any reason you can think of that this patient
should be wandering around the hospital unattended?

388
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:44,183
She's not unattended.

389
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:45,325
I came up with her.

390
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,519
You can leave now, Dr. Karev.

391
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,488
Irresponsible, even
for an intern.

392
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:57,941
What, you disagree?

393
00:18:58,391 --> 00:18:59,560
She wanted to see her friend.

394
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,940
I mean, what was he supposed to do?
Tackle her?

395
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,640
Dr. Stevens, why don't you get
our new patient into a bed?

396
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,354
Shall we?

397
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,630
Can you feel that,
Miss Krasnoff?

398
00:19:13,346 --> 00:19:14,989
You're a cute doctor.

399
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:17,677
Cute doctors get to call
me by my first name.

400
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:20,449
Bonnie.

401
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:23,689
Okay, Bonnie.

402
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:25,371
Can you feel that, Bonnie?

403
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:27,000
Can I feel what?

404
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:29,791
Oh. Oh, well,
I guess that's a no.

405
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:32,633
- Excuse me, Dr. Shepherd?
- Yes?

406
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:35,520
- I got the labs.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

407
00:19:36,428 --> 00:19:37,680
Hold that, please.

408
00:19:38,195 --> 00:19:41,074
Could you try to wiggle your toes,
Mr. Maynard?

409
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:43,855
Are they moving?

410
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:45,027
Yes, they are.

411
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:46,520
Good.

412
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,983
- That's good, right?
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

413
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:49,908
What about me?

414
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:51,193
Are mine moving?

415
00:19:54,606 --> 00:19:55,810
Yes, they are.

416
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:58,298
Yay me!

417
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:01,932
Dr. Shepherd, is it?

418
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:03,240
Yes, it is.

419
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:06,530
Dr. Shepherd, Bonnie and I...

420
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,970
are we gonna live through this?

421
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:12,080
Now that's just morose, Tom.

422
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,638
I'm sorry, dear.

423
00:20:15,243 --> 00:20:16,471
Doctor?

424
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:20,938
We're going to do everything we can,
Mr. Maynard.

425
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:29,305
About time, Yang.

426
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:31,373
I was starting to think my
work here would be wasted.

427
00:20:31,403 --> 00:20:32,440
I'm so sorry.

428
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:34,495
It wasn't easy to find.

429
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:38,097
I took the liberty of checking the
wound, and it's a very clean-cut, well-preserved.

430
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:39,549
Uh, Dr. Webber?

431
00:20:48,356 --> 00:20:49,030
Sir?

432
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,239
Notice anything else
about that leg?

433
00:20:51,354 --> 00:20:53,574
Anything other than
that very clean cut?

434
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:58,068
Did you happen to notice, for example,
that it was shaved recently?

435
00:20:58,245 --> 00:20:59,758
And manicured?

436
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,860
Take a look at my patient,
Dr. Yang.

437
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:06,992
Does he look like a man who woke up and
shaved one of his legs this morning?

438
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:09,253
No.

439
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:12,116
I'll go find the, um, right--

440
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:13,591
the right right--

441
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:15,119
- the right right--
- Thank you.

442
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:22,371
- Where are we?
- You were right.

443
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:23,539
Her vitals are erratic.

444
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:24,465
Pulse is weak.

445
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:25,680
Spine's severed.

446
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:27,714
I was hoping it
didn't hit the--

447
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,760
but from that angle,
it can't have missed the aorta.

448
00:21:30,886 --> 00:21:31,735
What about him?

449
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:32,866
Think he can live?

450
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:35,544
He's got better odds.

451
00:21:35,931 --> 00:21:38,031
All right, let O.R.
one know we're coming.

452
00:21:40,371 --> 00:21:41,406
And, O'Malley?

453
00:21:41,772 --> 00:21:42,942
Close off the gallery.

454
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:44,798
We don't need an
audience for this.

455
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:48,461
She's cracking jokes.

456
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:54,295
How do you tell someone she's gonna be dead in a
few minutes when she's sitting up cracking jokes?

457
00:22:00,376 --> 00:22:01,338
Excuse me.

458
00:22:01,457 --> 00:22:04,557
Is there any chance we can get
out of here sometime this year?

459
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,100
Well, the lab's backed up,
and so is radiology.

460
00:22:07,112 --> 00:22:11,462
I can't discharge your friend until I'm
certain she doesn't have any internal injuries.

461
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,223
Hello?

462
00:22:14,344 --> 00:22:15,624
Yeah, we're still here.

463
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,876
'Cause our doctor's
friggin' useless.

464
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:23,292
I realize you're dealing
with a lot of carnage.

465
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:28,810
I'm asking if you could maybe sift
through some of that carnage and find--

466
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:30,620
Hello?

467
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:32,051
Damn it.

468
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:33,847
Cristina, you paged me?

469
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:37,524
If I don't find this leg, the chief
is going to cut me from this program.

470
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:39,303
And I cannot go
back home, Burke.

471
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,859
It is too sunny in Los Angeles.

472
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:42,116
It's sunny every day.

473
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:45,093
And you paged me because?

474
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:47,516
I need you to help
me find the leg!

475
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:51,209
I checked the board.
You're not in a surgery, right?

476
00:22:53,844 --> 00:22:55,406
You're my boyfriend! I mean...

477
00:22:56,729 --> 00:23:00,029
I know I don't have much experience
with this kind of thing but...

478
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:03,183
Aren't boyfriends supposed to
help in situations like this?

479
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:06,247
Cristina, when we're on duty,
I can't be your boyfriend.

480
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:12,652
Okay, so, uh, when we're on duty,
I can have sex with someone else?

481
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:17,394
Dr. Yang, I'm walking away now.

482
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,292
Fine. Fine.

483
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:22,333
But when the chief cuts me,
you might rethink this.

484
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:26,313
Addison yelled at you
in front of a patient?

485
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,624
She didn't exactly yell.

486
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:33,059
- Fine, she's Satan's whore.
- Thank you.

487
00:23:33,173 --> 00:23:35,518
- So did you yell back?
- No.

488
00:23:36,003 --> 00:23:38,720
- Dude, you lost your mojo.
- Excuse you?

489
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:40,557
I was trying to talk boy.

490
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:44,139
O'Malley plugs a hole with his finger and
everyone walks around like he's some kind of hero.

491
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:46,552
- I have one off day--
- You chickened out.

492
00:23:46,656 --> 00:23:48,793
I hesitated briefly.

493
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:50,223
Why didn't you kiss Izzie?

494
00:23:50,978 --> 00:23:52,091
And now I'm leaving.

495
00:23:52,216 --> 00:23:53,137
It's not in the morgue.

496
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:55,267
I've looked in the ambulances,
in the E.R.

497
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:58,211
How is one bloody,
hairy leg going to destroy my career?

498
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:00,953
Dr. Karev?

499
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,598
I hope you find
your mojo, Alex.

500
00:24:06,598 --> 00:24:09,486
- I find you disturbing without it.
- Me too.

501
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:19,416
This is hard because your body
is in a certain amount of shock.

502
00:24:20,337 --> 00:24:24,914
It's preventing you from feeling pain,
from feeling the extent of your injuries.

503
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:27,685
Dr. Shepherd?

504
00:24:28,182 --> 00:24:31,930
We have a metal pole cutting
a path through our insides.

505
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:35,257
I don't know about
Tom here but,

506
00:24:35,677 --> 00:24:38,806
I didn't expect to walk out
of here anytime soon so...

507
00:24:40,232 --> 00:24:44,019
whatever it is you have to say,
just please say it.

508
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:45,948
Okay, Bonnie.

509
00:24:49,274 --> 00:24:52,796
In order to operate on Mr.
Maynard, we have to separate you two.

510
00:24:54,121 --> 00:24:58,450
In order to do that, we have to
move you backwards off the pole.

511
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:03,221
Can't you just pull the
pole out of both of us?

512
00:25:03,224 --> 00:25:06,845
Well, if we did that, you would
both start bleeding very quickly.

513
00:25:06,957 --> 00:25:07,767
Too quickly.

514
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:10,715
Right now the pole is
plugging the wounds.

515
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:13,786
Once removed,
the organs will shift.

516
00:25:15,258 --> 00:25:17,058
And there is a great
deal of damage.

517
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:22,211
So if you move me...

518
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:23,851
I'll die?

519
00:25:28,556 --> 00:25:33,012
- We're gonna do everything we can to...
- No. No.

520
00:25:33,677 --> 00:25:35,597
If anybody has to go,
it should be me.

521
00:25:35,698 --> 00:25:36,498
You just move--

522
00:25:36,711 --> 00:25:39,562
Mr. Maynard, Mr. Maynard,

523
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:43,454
your injuries are
less extensive.

524
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:50,883
If we pull the pole from you as we operate around it,
we have a better chance at repairing the damage.

525
00:25:56,118 --> 00:25:57,338
It's not right.

526
00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:00,678
It's not fair.

527
00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:02,329
Tom...

528
00:26:03,316 --> 00:26:05,274
it's not fair either way.

529
00:26:10,588 --> 00:26:11,935
Is, um...

530
00:26:12,924 --> 00:26:13,980
is my Danny--

531
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,245
is he here yet?

532
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,907
There are delays
at the airport.

533
00:26:16,937 --> 00:26:18,258
Um, the storm...

534
00:26:18,258 --> 00:26:22,244
We could wait,
but the longer we do,

535
00:26:22,355 --> 00:26:26,084
- the higher the risk of infection for--
- No. No.

536
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:28,191
This is better.

537
00:26:30,161 --> 00:26:31,862
Danny wouldn't understand.

538
00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:38,978
I've had a couple of hours to,
you know, process all of this.

539
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:43,483
But if he had to see me,
talk to me like this, I...

540
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:49,574
well, I just think it
would be too hard.

541
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,022
Right there--in between
the vertebral spaces.

542
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,900
Don't be shy about pressure.

543
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,707
That's good.

544
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,127
You are doing so good.

545
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:17,808
Somebody called for a notary?

546
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,729
I asked for a lawyer.

547
00:27:19,825 --> 00:27:23,927
I couldn't get one at this time of night,
but the hospital has pretty standard forms.

548
00:27:23,957 --> 00:27:26,943
It just says that in the case of
death or permanent vegetative state,

549
00:27:26,973 --> 00:27:30,316
that your child will remain in the
custody of, and then we'll put her name in.

550
00:27:30,346 --> 00:27:31,204
Wait, what?

551
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:33,435
What are we? Who's dying here?

552
00:27:33,544 --> 00:27:34,981
There's some danger.

553
00:27:35,212 --> 00:27:36,974
With any surgery
there's danger.

554
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:40,886
But with the trauma of Brooke's Burns,
there's an additional risk of shock.

555
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:42,466
She just wants to be certain.

556
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:43,426
That's ridiculous.

557
00:27:43,524 --> 00:27:44,613
You're being ridiculous.

558
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:46,662
- You're gonna be fine, do you hear me?
- I hear you.

559
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:48,492
But we still have
to sign the forms.

560
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:51,121
Unless you want our son
to end up with my mom.

561
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:58,316
How long have you
two been together?

562
00:27:58,728 --> 00:28:00,048
Since third grade.

563
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:02,943
We're not lovers.

564
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:04,001
We're best friends.

565
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,584
We just wanted our kids
to have two parents.

566
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:08,318
So we got a sperm donor.

567
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:12,364
The same donor?
So your babies are brother and sister?

568
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,921
Oh, how cool is that?

569
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:15,214
That's--

570
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,491
- wow.
- Wet.

571
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,656
What?

572
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:19,867
- I'm wet.
- Oh, god.

573
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:21,367
I think my water just broke.

574
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:24,768
Good news.

575
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:25,822
You've got a broken rib.

576
00:28:25,852 --> 00:28:28,252
We're gonna give you some
painkillers and, uh...

577
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:29,882
after that,
you should be good to go.

578
00:28:29,912 --> 00:28:30,892
Thank you.

579
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,114
Yvonne, answer your phone.

580
00:28:36,494 --> 00:28:38,560
Yvonne? Yvonne?

581
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,319
Yvonne?!

582
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:43,914
Code blue,
I need some help over here!

583
00:28:43,944 --> 00:28:44,868
Yvonne?!

584
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:47,356
Push one of epi. Hold C.P.R.

585
00:28:47,356 --> 00:28:49,407
Her abdomen's distended.
It's rock solid.

586
00:28:49,484 --> 00:28:51,691
She's lost too much blood.
She's been bleeding for hours.

587
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:53,502
But there's no blood.
She's not bleeding.

588
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:54,695
She was bleeding internally.

589
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:55,988
She didn't say anything.

590
00:28:56,188 --> 00:28:57,357
She wasn't...

591
00:28:57,555 --> 00:28:58,995
she wasn't even a patient.

592
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:01,149
I didn't know.

593
00:29:02,411 --> 00:29:04,374
Dr. Karev, she's gone.

594
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:06,296
No! No! No!

595
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,034
No! No! No!

596
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:12,043
- Yvonne!
- I'm sorry.

597
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:15,968
Time of death--2:51.

598
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:17,089
No! No! No!

599
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,688
No! No! No!

600
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:22,070
Try again.

601
00:29:22,746 --> 00:29:23,906
Try again.

602
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:31,761
Jana, this is our O.B.
resident Dr. Hoffman.

603
00:29:31,851 --> 00:29:34,051
She's gonna be taking
care of you from here.

604
00:29:34,993 --> 00:29:36,031
You're doing great, Jana.

605
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:37,221
Just keep breathing.

606
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,040
I'm gonna check
your cervix now.

607
00:29:39,452 --> 00:29:42,971
Brooke, we've booked an O.R., but they're not
gonna hold it for long so we need to go now.

608
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:43,965
Right now?

609
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:47,121
But we're supposed to be together.
We took classes.

610
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:48,790
I'm sorry, but we can't wait.

611
00:29:48,906 --> 00:29:50,036
That's okay, Brookie.

612
00:29:50,718 --> 00:29:53,979
You go have your c-section
and enjoy those drugs.

613
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:56,033
This is already not
fun for my vagina.

614
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,278
Dr. Stevens.

615
00:29:57,864 --> 00:29:58,753
No.

616
00:29:58,872 --> 00:30:00,951
If I have to go,
she has to stay.

617
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:03,244
Someone has to stay
with Jana, please?

618
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:05,572
Brooke, Dr.
Stevens is a surgeon,

619
00:30:05,572 --> 00:30:07,772
- but I'm gonna find you some--
- It's okay.

620
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:08,710
I'll stay.

621
00:30:11,168 --> 00:30:12,118
Okay.

622
00:30:16,723 --> 00:30:19,419
Brookie, you stay alive, okay?

623
00:30:20,473 --> 00:30:21,723
You too.

624
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:30,803
Damn it!

625
00:30:32,076 --> 00:30:33,494
- Hey, doc?
- What?!

626
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:34,605
Easy, killer.

627
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:37,619
Jill said you guys were freaking
out looking for this leg.

628
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:41,219
- Thank you.
- No problem.

629
00:30:42,185 --> 00:30:43,065
Right on.

630
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:49,763
Chief Webber,
I'm extremely sorry. I...

631
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:52,032
Pull that tendon down
with those pick-ups.

632
00:30:53,113 --> 00:30:54,672
Oh, you found the leg?

633
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:55,877
I found the leg.

634
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,658
You missed out on
this one, Yang.

635
00:30:57,688 --> 00:31:00,238
But I'm sure they could
use a hand down in the E.R.

636
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:02,077
Karev and I can
handle it from here.

637
00:31:15,336 --> 00:31:17,210
Can I ask you a question?

638
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:22,884
Do you believe in heaven?

639
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,027
I do.

640
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:30,439
Don't you?

641
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:37,765
I want to.

642
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:42,859
Bonnie...

643
00:31:45,414 --> 00:31:46,854
I just want to say...

644
00:31:50,554 --> 00:31:51,933
I know.

645
00:31:53,323 --> 00:31:54,723
I know.

646
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:05,556
This is Dr. Adams--

647
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:07,580
our anesthesiologist.

648
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:11,297
When you're ready,
he's gonna put you to sleep.

649
00:32:12,607 --> 00:32:14,263
So it's not gonna hurt?

650
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:15,622
It won't hurt a bit.

651
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,603
Good.

652
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:20,001
That's good.

653
00:32:22,422 --> 00:32:24,746
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Yes.

654
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:28,981
You're gonna be the one to
talk to my Danny, right?

655
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,843
Yes.

656
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:35,631
- Okay.
- Okay.

657
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:41,368
What do you want
me to tell him?

658
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,306
Why do I feel like we're
about to kill this girl?

659
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,910
Dr. Bailey?

660
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,675
- My labs are in.
- Sober?

661
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:56,750
- Can I scrub in?
- Do it fast.

662
00:33:13,884 --> 00:33:14,847
George.

663
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:24,902
- Hey.
- Hi.

664
00:33:34,207 --> 00:33:37,000
- You know, I, uh, I went to the bar.
- I heard.

665
00:33:50,952 --> 00:33:52,622
Did you take some aspirin
with the banana bag?

666
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:53,852
Helps with the hangover.

667
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:08,501
You're staying with her.

668
00:34:18,428 --> 00:34:19,787
Yeah, she's my wife.

669
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,984
Dr. Shepherd, she's crashing.

670
00:34:30,614 --> 00:34:31,672
What happened?

671
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,468
I just put them under.

672
00:34:33,565 --> 00:34:34,560
The pole must've shifted.

673
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,646
I barely touched her.

674
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:36,727
This isn't my fault.

675
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:37,785
It's nobody's fault.

676
00:34:37,884 --> 00:34:39,727
We need to remove her now if
we're gonna have any chance.

677
00:34:39,757 --> 00:34:40,657
How do we do this?

678
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:42,605
Team one,
continue to stabilize his body.

679
00:34:42,635 --> 00:34:43,937
Team two, move her back.

680
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:45,292
Let's get the saw in there.

681
00:34:45,322 --> 00:34:47,518
This has to be fast
and smooth, people.

682
00:34:47,615 --> 00:34:49,602
O'Malley, you hold
the pole in place.

683
00:34:49,694 --> 00:34:50,718
Whatever you do,
don't pull on it.

684
00:34:50,748 --> 00:34:52,644
- Don't let it move.
- Okay.

685
00:34:52,784 --> 00:34:53,884
On the count of three.

686
00:34:53,902 --> 00:34:56,929
- One... two...
- Three!

687
00:34:57,836 --> 00:34:59,461
That's great! That's great.

688
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:00,643
Take another breath.

689
00:35:00,985 --> 00:35:04,305
- One... two...
- He's wedged up under her ribs.

690
00:35:04,362 --> 00:35:06,600
We're gonna have to pull him out.
On three.

691
00:35:06,696 --> 00:35:08,281
One... two...

692
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:31,471
He's stable for now. Let's start
with her and see what we can do.

693
00:35:34,164 --> 00:35:35,175
Scalpel.

694
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,898
Uh, Grey?

695
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:41,149
Uh, get in here
and help retract.

696
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:52,823
Retractor.

697
00:35:57,897 --> 00:35:58,559
I'm in.

698
00:36:02,505 --> 00:36:03,875
Her aorta's shredded.

699
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,250
- She's got a bleed out.
- We have no rhythm.

700
00:36:06,926 --> 00:36:09,291
Doctors, he's losing pressure.

701
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:11,158
He's bleeding.

702
00:36:17,406 --> 00:36:18,268
What about her?

703
00:36:18,357 --> 00:36:19,836
We can't just abandon her!

704
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,350
Come on, come on.

705
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,940
We can't just abandon her!

706
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,742
I'm going in stem
to stern. Scalpel.

707
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:29,997
Sternal saw.

708
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:32,141
Give me the sternal saw.

709
00:36:34,454 --> 00:36:36,562
- Let's go Dr. Grey.
- Meredith.

710
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:38,178
Dr. Grey?

711
00:36:38,765 --> 00:36:40,497
- Meredith?
- What about her?

712
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:42,260
We cannot just abandon her.

713
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,609
We have an obligation!

714
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,839
Meredith, come on, come on. There was too much damage.
There was never anything we could do.

715
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:52,256
We have to let her go.

716
00:36:56,773 --> 00:36:58,440
Time of death-- 3:49.

717
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:23,937
How's Brooke?

718
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,265
She's good.

719
00:37:25,812 --> 00:37:26,717
And the baby?

720
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:27,932
He came through, too.

721
00:37:29,303 --> 00:37:31,553
So have you made a decision yet,
Dr. Stevens?

722
00:37:31,558 --> 00:37:32,579
I'm sorry?

723
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:36,098
Whether or not you're
going to hate me.

724
00:37:37,578 --> 00:37:38,709
You're Meredith's friend.

725
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:42,589
I'm the wicked witch who came in and
ruined her life and cheated on doctor...

726
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:44,647
Wait, what is it that
you guys call him?

727
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:46,534
McDreamy.

728
00:37:46,696 --> 00:37:47,771
Right.

729
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:49,979
God, doesn't that
embarrass him?

730
00:37:51,432 --> 00:37:52,906
Yeah, I think it does.

731
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:55,509
Yeah, well, by all rights,
you should hate me.

732
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:56,881
I guess.

733
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:59,558
Except that I'm gonna be
staying in town for awhile.

734
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:01,240
- You are?
- Yes.

735
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:04,779
And you show a real
gift with my specialty.

736
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:07,476
I've got a lot to teach,
if you want to learn.

737
00:38:09,351 --> 00:38:10,247
So?

738
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:11,980
So?

739
00:38:12,783 --> 00:38:18,869
So when you decide how important it
is for you to hate me, let me know.

740
00:38:30,772 --> 00:38:32,006
Did she, uh...

741
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,387
Did she suffer?

742
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:40,108
No. Her injuries
prevented her from...

743
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:44,187
No, she wasn't in any pain.

744
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:46,572
Good.

745
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:48,875
That's...

746
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,330
She asked me to--

747
00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:57,602
to tell you that...

748
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:05,583
She wanted you to know,
that if love were enough...

749
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:11,597
that if love were enough,
that she'd still be here with you.

750
00:39:32,185 --> 00:39:33,592
As surgeons...

751
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,156
there are so many
things we have to know.

752
00:39:39,729 --> 00:39:41,106
Fine work, Dr. Karev.

753
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:42,455
Thank you, sir.

754
00:39:43,335 --> 00:39:45,485
We have to know that
we have what it takes.

755
00:40:00,593 --> 00:40:03,043
We have to know how to
take care of our patients.

756
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:05,165
Tom is doing just fine.

757
00:40:19,936 --> 00:40:22,261
And how to take
care of each other.

758
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:43,786
- Okay?
- Yeah.

759
00:41:01,572 --> 00:41:03,005
Eventually...

760
00:41:03,414 --> 00:41:05,272
we even have to figure out

761
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,676
how to take care of ourselves.

762
00:41:15,121 --> 00:41:18,539
As surgeons,
we have to be in the know.

763
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,669
But as human beings,

764
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:28,801
sometimes it's better
to stay in the dark.

765
00:41:32,642 --> 00:41:33,745
Because...

766
00:41:35,649 --> 00:41:38,112
in the dark there
may be fear...

767
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:46,475
but there's also hope.

768
00:41:55,528 --> 00:41:56,982
You better get cleaned up.

769
00:41:57,418 --> 00:41:59,938
Rounds in five minutes.
