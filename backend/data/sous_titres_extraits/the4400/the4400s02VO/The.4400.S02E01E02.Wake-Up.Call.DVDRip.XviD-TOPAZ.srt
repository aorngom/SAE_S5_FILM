1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:03,566
Previously on the 4400...

2
00:00:03,621 --> 00:00:05,123
A comet cannot change course.

3
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:07,032
- This one has.
- Then it's not a comet.

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,336
We're not sure what's just happened.

5
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:12,252
There appears to be something out there.

6
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:15,764
The light is gone, and thousands
of people have just suddenly appeared.

7
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:18,031
Diana Skouris. Tom Baldwin.

8
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:22,703
You two will be one of the teams that's responsible
for investigating what happened to the returnees.

9
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,011
We're letting them go.

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,162
We're letting them go?

11
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,678
We don't have a legal right to hold them.

12
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:30,365
Why disappear a little girl from the 1940s,
hold her for 60 years,

13
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:32,572
and then send her back with the ability
to predict the future?

14
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:34,072
- Can I go home?
- Home?

15
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:36,361
With you. I don't like
being here alone.

16
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:37,633
Shawn Farrell...

17
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:39,449
Uncle Tommy. Hi.

18
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:40,377
He's all yours.

19
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:41,657
Hey, what about Kyle?

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,122
Kyle's in a coma, Shawn.

21
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:47,288
What the hell did you do to Kyle?

22
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:50,396
I don't know what happened.
I put my hands on him. That's it.

23
00:00:50,443 --> 00:00:51,371
He woke up.

24
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:53,825
You're talking about some kind of ripple effect.

25
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:55,715
Diana Skouris to the head of the class.

26
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:59,144
The incidents themselves
are just catalysts for change.

27
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,537
I swear to god.
I'll ask you one more time...

28
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:02,746
Where's my son?

29
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:04,108
- Kyle! Kyle!
- No!

30
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,282
Tom, don't!

31
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:10,131
You're not my son.
Who are you? What are you?

32
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:12,666
I'm human. I come from a different time.
Your future.

33
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:14,592
In my time, humanity is dying out.

34
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:17,386
Only those we took can prevent
the catastrophe from happening.

35
00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:20,216
That's why they've been altered
and seeded back into the timeline.

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,752
You mean it's all going to end?

37
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:23,831
- You have to help them.
- Help them? How?

38
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:26,883
Dad?

39
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:27,729
Kyle...

40
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:31,707
I intend to provide a safe haven
for any 4400 in this country who needs one.

41
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:33,632
You goddamn freak!

42
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:34,665
Danny, stop it!

43
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,898
Stop blaming me for nikki!

44
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:38,857
I guess what I'm asking is
if I could stay here for awhile.

45
00:01:38,878 --> 00:01:41,191
Tell me a little more about this...
ability of yours.

46
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:45,043
I wasn't pregnant when I was abducted,
but I was when I got back.

47
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:48,839
That baby could be the key to the future,
and it has to be protected, and I can do that.

48
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:53,513
Go ahead! Run!

49
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:56,259
I will find you.
That baby belongs with me.

50
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,506
Isabelle...

51
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:14,016
Isabelle...

52
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,071
What is it, baby?

53
00:02:31,572 --> 00:02:32,852
Bad dream?

54
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:36,222
Same one.

55
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,611
She's fine, Richard.

56
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:44,812
We're all fine.

57
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:49,591
Come back to bed.

58
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:57,183
It's probably just a raccoon...

59
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:20,277
Who was it?

60
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:24,152
They took off before I could ask.

61
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,349
They left something behind.

62
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:34,028
Someone tracked us down.

63
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,974
Who?

64
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:37,909
NTAC?
Collier?

65
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,835
This look like their calling card to you?

66
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:42,911
I don't know who it is,
but someone knows we're 4400s.

67
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:47,645
Start packing.

68
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:51,226
I'll drive into town tomorrow morning to pick up
my last paycheck, and then we're out of here.

69
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:52,444
Can't we just go now?

70
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,334
We're gonna need that money, Lily.

71
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:09,979
Mr. and Mrs. Sumlin.

72
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:12,644
Peter.
If you'll follow me.

73
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:16,345
Forgive our appearance.

74
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:19,233
As you know,
the Center doesn't officially open until tomorrow.

75
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:20,877
Peter doesn't have time to wait.

76
00:04:20,924 --> 00:04:23,014
That's where you're wrong, Mrs. Sumlin.

77
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,280
Peter has all the time in the world.

78
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:31,756
Hi, Peter.

79
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,787
My name is Jordan Collier.

80
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:37,767
Just this way.

81
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:41,290
Our medical lab isn't quite ready,

82
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:43,990
so we thought Peter would be
more comfortable up here.

83
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:48,392
Hello, Peter.

84
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:49,989
I'm Shawn.

85
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,506
What do you say we get started?

86
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:56,633
Yeah?

87
00:04:57,373 --> 00:04:58,359
Okay, buddy.

88
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:00,637
I want you to take my hands.

89
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:05,795
Try to relax.

90
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:06,946
Okay?

91
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,727
You're okay.

92
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:23,604
You're doing good. You're doing so good.
It's okay.

93
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:26,521
Oh, my god. Is he okay?

94
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:27,590
He's fine.

95
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:29,433
Just watch.

96
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:31,453
It's okay.

97
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:35,339
You're okay. You're okay.

98
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,330
Peter?

99
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,490
How do you feel, honey?

100
00:06:02,513 --> 00:06:03,394
Son?

101
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,144
Thank you

102
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:24,140
for  your generous donation.

103
00:06:24,246 --> 00:06:27,310
We tried everything.
Radiation, bone marrow transplants...

104
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,069
Is he really cured?

105
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:31,934
Take him back to his doctor.
Run some tests.

106
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:33,941
Peter's leukemia is gone.

107
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,468
This is a miracle.

108
00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:37,556
For  now, it has to remain a private miracle.

109
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:40,078
May I remind you
that the confidentiality agreement

110
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,798
you've signed is strictly binding.

111
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:43,824
But people should know about that young man.

112
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,103
And they will.

113
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:46,595
In time,

114
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:48,696
they'll know everything.

115
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,162
Very nice.

116
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:53,508
Floating the five. Floating the five.

117
00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:57,882
- You nervous?
- Aren't you?

118
00:06:58,269 --> 00:06:59,714
No, not at all.

119
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,050
Well, maybe a little bit.

120
00:07:03,697 --> 00:07:04,977
Okay. A lot.

121
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:07,384
Now, you really want to do this, right?

122
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:08,241
Right.

123
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:11,247
Let's go. Okay.

124
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:16,259
Says here she registered an ability
under the Dinstman-Lenhoff bill.

125
00:07:16,296 --> 00:07:18,750
Some kind of precognitive insight?

126
00:07:19,302 --> 00:07:22,646
Yes, her visions stopped about four months ago.
We're not sure why.

127
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:24,008
Oh, too bad.

128
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:27,777
I was going to ask if Teledex
will hit its quarterly projection.

129
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,331
Well, we'd like to get started,
if that's all right.

130
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:32,293
Certainly.

131
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,231
If you'll just sign where indicated.

132
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:39,925
Diana Skouris, your adoption of
Maia Rutledge is hereby complete,

133
00:07:39,964 --> 00:07:42,124
legal, and binding.

134
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:44,807
So witnessed by me, Henry Biederman,

135
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:47,690
10th circuit family court of Seattle.

136
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,730
You know, some of us have to look far and wide
to find the people we'll call "family".

137
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,595
You two had to look clear across time.

138
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:59,482
Diana, let me introduce you
to your daughter Maia.

139
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:02,071
Maia, say hello to mommy.

140
00:08:15,782 --> 00:08:16,944
I'm not doing it.

141
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,400
I mean it this time. No way.

142
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:20,948
It's just a cat scan, Kyle.
You've had them before.

143
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:24,685
This one's gonna tell them the same thing
the last 150 told them... nothing.

144
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,128
There's nobody in here but me.

145
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:28,245
I know that,

146
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:30,652
and sooner or later,
they're going to stop looking.

147
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,031
When? When?

148
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:34,909
I wish I knew,

149
00:08:34,945 --> 00:08:38,772
but with NTAC, the Government, they've got
bigger issues than you or me, okay? Just...

150
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:43,808
Kyle, they're still trying to make sense about what
happened that night at Highland Beach. That's all.

151
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:48,316
They're afraid if they let me out
I'm gonna spill the beans about their big secret?

152
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:50,958
Well, they can relax,
because I just want to get out of here

153
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:53,565
and be normal again,
and normal people don't go around

154
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,676
sounding off about future humans
and the end of the world.

155
00:08:56,712 --> 00:08:59,306
Besides, I don't even remember what happened.

156
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,795
I know.

157
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:04,634
You listening?
I don't remember!

158
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:06,187
Just calm down. Just calm down.

159
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:06,832
Dad,

160
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:08,391
get me out of here.

161
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:11,115
Talk to someone. Anyone.
Please, 'cause...

162
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,309
Sshh. Okay, okay.
Okay

163
00:09:15,657 --> 00:09:16,432
Okay.

164
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,121
Okay.

165
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:27,032
Tom.

166
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,224
Been awhile, huh?

167
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:33,936
Yeah, you know how it is.

168
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:37,844
Us desk jockeys don't have much cause
to mingle with you hot-shot field agents.

169
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,850
Someone feeling
a little sorry for himself today?

170
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:43,127
"The path to oblivion starts here".

171
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,915
The 4400 were sent back to save humanity,
and I'm supposed to help them.

172
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:50,076
I was there on the beach, remember?

173
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:51,827
They gave me a mission,

174
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,267
and what's my biggest
accomplishment of the week?

175
00:09:56,324 --> 00:09:59,084
I convinced my son to take another cat scan.

176
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:02,536
Somehow, I don't think that's
what they had in mind.

177
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,438
Diana, you ready to roll?

178
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:06,117
In a minute.

179
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:08,061
It's just we have to check in
on three more returnees.

180
00:10:08,096 --> 00:10:10,456
I want to make sure we get our reports in by 5:00.

181
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:13,415
Okay, why don't you keep the car warmed up?
And I'll be right there.

182
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:15,035
You bet.

183
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:24,228
Vic Hubbard's the best
lead investigator you could find?

184
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:27,578
Oh, no, he's the fourth one this year.
Two more, I break a record.

185
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:31,876
We've  got to get you out from behind that desk.

186
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:34,330
I'm lucky to have a job here.

187
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,265
I put a gun to another agent's head, remember?

188
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,200
Yeah, well,
I never said it was going to be easy.

189
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:43,298
It's obvious what really happened.

190
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:45,550
Are you going to start in
with your negative energy again?

191
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:47,241
White holes. See, they're the answer.

192
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:49,261
That's how they took them,
and that's how they brought them back.

193
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,345
- Yeah, but white holes... the second law of...
- Yeah, because I'm right.

194
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,296
Come on, come on.

195
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,990
- Guys!
- What's it like to not be right?

196
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:56,408
Am I interrupting?

197
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,562
Brady's back on his "white hole" kick again.

198
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:03,838
Well, one day you'll explain to me the difference
between the white ones and the black ones, right?

199
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:05,728
Well, how about tonight?

200
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,906
How about you just give me
that thing that we discussed?

201
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:11,467
- Can't.
- Why not?

202
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:13,416
I already sent it upstairs.

203
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:16,810
I wonder if anyone's read it yet.

204
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,695
When they do, I'm sure you'll hear about it.

205
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:22,783
I owe you one, handsome.

206
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,529
H. P. Lovecraft's

207
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,231
The Mountains of Madness.

208
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,411
Are you trying to tell me something?

209
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:22,679
Which orderly did you steal it from?

210
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:24,288
Matt?

211
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:25,650
Arlo?

212
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:31,648
You're so sweet.

213
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,662
You're the only person here
who doesn't want me dead.

214
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,282
I wish I could take you with me when I go,
but I can't.

215
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:46,089
They  only want me.

216
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,739
But I'll be leaving soon.

217
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:53,707
Very soon.

218
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,691
Joanne ? Paul?

219
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:19,169
What are you doing?

220
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:23,114
Sex maniac.
Don't go flashing those bedroom eyes at me.

221
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:25,049
Joanne, I'm serious.

222
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:27,538
Put that stuff down before you hurt yourself.

223
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,006
We're building something.

224
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:30,638
I can see that.

225
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:31,965
Can you really?

226
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,226
It's gonna be gigantic.

227
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,668
Humongous.
Rival the pyramids.

228
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:40,545
But some things are better left
to the imagination, Joanne.

229
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,590
Besides,

230
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:43,432
you two have physical therapy now.

231
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:47,858
Let's go.

232
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,122
Building something...

233
00:13:51,672 --> 00:13:52,917
Building nothing.

234
00:13:53,011 --> 00:13:54,525
Help me get rid of this junk.

235
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,702
I'm sorry. Too hard?

236
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,164
Oh, no. Hey,

237
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:44,125
go ahead.
Give it your best shot.

238
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:48,434
Whatever you do, you must be pretty good at it.

239
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:51,603
Uh, yeah, I work with my hands.
Same as you.

240
00:14:51,638 --> 00:14:54,057
My apartment doesn't look anything like this.

241
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:56,793
Well, it helps to have friends in high places.

242
00:14:57,638 --> 00:15:00,069
I'm always open to making new friends.

243
00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:04,853
Come in.

244
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:07,941
Speak of the devil.

245
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:09,549
Give us a moment.

246
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:19,787
Has anyone ever told you your timing sucks?

247
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:22,842
If they did, I probably fired them.
For you.

248
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:23,863
Oh...

249
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:25,636
It's in bookstores tomorrow.

250
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:30,215
Jordan, this is gonna sell,
like, a million copies.

251
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:32,150
People are gonna freak out
when they read this.

252
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,991
Big ideas make a loud noise
when they land, Shawn.

253
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,600
You wanted to see me, Nina?

254
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:03,844
Are you sleeping with Tom Baldwin?

255
00:16:05,593 --> 00:16:07,942
Should I come back in?
Maybe we could start over...

256
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:09,268
Answer the question.

257
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:12,685
Never even held hands.

258
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:14,519
Do you owe him money?

259
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:16,544
Okay, what game are we playing here?
Because if I knew the rules...

260
00:16:16,562 --> 00:16:18,417
I am playing the theory room paper game.

261
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,589
- I don't know that one.
- Well, let me give you a hint.

262
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:25,769
"The necessity for the immediate reassignment
of Thomas Baldwin to active field duty".

263
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,284
Catchy title.

264
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,231
Did you come up with it yourself,
or did the big brains in the basement pitch in?

265
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,556
Let's just say that I agree with the sentiment.

266
00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:36,067
Tom is the best agent I've ever worked with,
maybe the best you've got in this division.

267
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,025
In the three months that
Baldwin was investigating the 4400,

268
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,547
this department learned more, far more,
than it has in the entire year

269
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:44,097
he's been shuffling paper.

270
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:45,575
He threatened another agent's life.

271
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,555
He was trying to protect his son,
who these future people, whoever they are,

272
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,140
chose as their spokesman.

273
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,317
That's not to mention that
his nephew Shawn is one of the 4400.

274
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:56,630
All of which sound like
major conflicts of interest to me.

275
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:58,145
That's not what Dennis Ryland believed.

276
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,244
Dennis Ryland is no longer in charge here.

277
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:01,970
Maybe you should call Washington and talk to him.

278
00:17:02,005 --> 00:17:05,187
I don't have to call washington.
They've got me on speed dial.

279
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:08,698
Congressmen, senators,
committee chairs, subcommittee chairs,

280
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:11,492
all of them looking to this department, to me,
for answers.

281
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:14,872
Which is why you can't keep an agent
like Tom Baldwin on the shelf.

282
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:18,194
He's a major player in this case.
He's maybe the major player.

283
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:20,813
See, funny,
that's exactly what it says in this paper.

284
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:24,830
Maybe Marco had me check it for typos.

285
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,811
Uh, the next time that
you want to send me a message,

286
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:30,631
put your own name on it.

287
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:43,146
Mr. Walcott!

288
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:44,661
Get down from there!

289
00:17:45,342 --> 00:17:46,704
Arlo!

290
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:49,228
Mr. Walcott, get down from there!

291
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:51,729
Arlo!
You heard the man!

292
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:55,088
Mr. Walcott,
Get down from there this instant!

293
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:58,787
I'm calling security
if you don't come down right now.

294
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:02,565
Arlo!

295
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,137
This is your last chance.

296
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:09,598
What the hell are you doing up there?

297
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,345
I got it.

298
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:13,106
Arlo!

299
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,478
Arlo, this is your last warning.

300
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:18,249
Arlo, please!

301
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,926
Be careful!

302
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,028
I'm coming down.

303
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:24,435
Arlo, be careful!

304
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,891
Watch what you're doing.

305
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,692
I got it.

306
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:30,242
I got it.

307
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,044
Oh, oh... oh, my god.
Oh, my god!

308
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:43,465
No!

309
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:11,837
Lily, I'm home.

310
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:14,755
Lily, relax.
We don't have to leave.

311
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,758
Some nut papered the entire town with these things.
He wasn't singling us out.

312
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:21,048
Well, I still think we should go.

313
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,242
I was scared last night too,

314
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,862
but did you read this?

315
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:27,633
It's a rant, not a witch hunt.

316
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:29,676
Maybe, but Richard,

317
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,118
we still don't feel safe here anymore.

318
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,525
You mean Isabelle doesn't feel safe.

319
00:19:34,992 --> 00:19:37,681
Richard, we've gone over this a dozen times.

320
00:19:38,737 --> 00:19:40,910
I don't know why she talks to me and not to you.

321
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:41,849
"talks?"

322
00:19:42,624 --> 00:19:44,865
Communicates.
Whatever.

323
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,692
Did she happen to mention where we should go?

324
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:51,955
Does she have a place picked out,
or will she know it when she sees it?

325
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,693
We can find a town.

326
00:19:53,716 --> 00:19:55,313
We already did. Right here.

327
00:19:56,182 --> 00:19:58,267
Isabelle is six months old.

328
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,921
I know she's a special kid,
but we're still her parents.

329
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,631
We make decisions for her.
She doesn't make them for us.

330
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:22,549
I know. It's time
we get out of here. You're right.

331
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,569
You're absolutely right.

332
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,112
We're staying put.

333
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:41,421
Maia?

334
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:47,056
Party time.

335
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:54,101
Macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes,
and white bread.

336
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:55,637
Everything I like.

337
00:20:55,871 --> 00:21:00,650
The only things you'll eat. You've got to
promise me that you'll outgrow this phase soon.

338
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:09,601
Mommy, how do you make this taste so good?

339
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,290
Well, it's a hidden talent, I guess.

340
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:15,695
You just called me "mommy".

341
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:17,652
You're my mom now, right?

342
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:21,715
Now and forever.

343
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:24,416
- I like that.
- Me too.

344
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:27,982
So do you think I'll ever go back to school?

345
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:32,890
Weren't you just telling me you got,
like, a 97 on your math test?

346
00:21:32,937 --> 00:21:35,438
Not home-school.
Real school,

347
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,891
With a playground, and recess.

348
00:21:39,137 --> 00:21:40,593
Well, sure you will...

349
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:42,190
You know, when you get a bit older.

350
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:43,575
How much older?

351
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:46,298
I'm not seeing things
that are going to happen anymore,

352
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:49,586
So it should be ok for me to be around other kids.

353
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:52,275
I think I'd be happy at school.

354
00:21:53,143 --> 00:21:54,588
Well, you're happy now.

355
00:21:54,764 --> 00:21:56,751
I'm glad you're my mom for real...

356
00:21:57,021 --> 00:22:01,400
- ... but could I still use a, like a friend or two.
- Ahh...

357
00:22:07,154 --> 00:22:08,868
More "Mac and Cheese", please.

358
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:16,181
Just a little.

359
00:22:26,476 --> 00:22:27,603
Sign this.

360
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,540
What is it?

361
00:22:29,587 --> 00:22:31,255
Your letter of resignation.

362
00:22:33,495 --> 00:22:35,209
I thought I was being reassigned to field duty.

363
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:36,172
You are

364
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,559
Effective immediately.

365
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:40,459
I need results.

366
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:43,412
We have a high-priced collection
of sheepskin in the basement

367
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:45,443
that tells me you're the best way to get them.

368
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,052
So I'm willing to take a risk.

369
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,315
But I need some insurance.

370
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:50,618
This.

371
00:22:51,141 --> 00:22:52,609
I left the date blank.

372
00:22:52,832 --> 00:22:54,863
You cross the line, I fill it in.

373
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:00,863
Fair enough.

374
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,038
Good.

375
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:08,290
Here. Look at this.

376
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:10,850
Tess Doerner.

377
00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:14,006
Diagnose of paranoid schizophrenia
at the age of 15.

378
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,646
Disapeared from
Abendson Psychiatric Hospital in April of 1955.

379
00:23:17,682 --> 00:23:20,147
Let me guess, they sent her back
without bothering to cure her?

380
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:22,308
Curing people was not part of their agenda.

381
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,115
We just got a call
from the C.A. over the hospital.

382
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:26,606
One  of their orderlies is dead.

383
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:29,046
He claims that there's some kind of connection.

384
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:31,001
We'll check it out.

385
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:32,938
Hold on.

386
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:36,596
There's still one piece of business
we need to get straight.

387
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,966
You're setting conditions?

388
00:23:51,504 --> 00:23:53,077
This is your new house?

389
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:54,705
It's yours too.

390
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:15,160
Well, all your stuff is here. I...

391
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:17,650
Kind of looks like your old place, huh?

392
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:21,124
Well, I tried, anyway.

393
00:24:24,893 --> 00:24:26,572
Only one thing missing,

394
00:24:27,124 --> 00:24:28,111
Mom.

395
00:24:30,522 --> 00:24:33,610
Yeah I know.
Sometimes I can't believe she's not here either.

396
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:36,205
But we tried, Kyle, you know, we...

397
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:37,666
we really tried to make it work.

398
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:40,029
I wish you both would have tried a little harder.

399
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:42,426
I'm sorry, it's just...

400
00:24:43,086 --> 00:24:44,910
You know, when something terrible happens to a family,

401
00:24:44,911 --> 00:24:47,111
like when you were in the hospital, it can...

402
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:50,089
bring people closer together or...

403
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:52,687
drive them apart. Your mom and me...

404
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:56,943
I'll have to call her,
let her know I’m out the quarantine.

405
00:24:57,249 --> 00:24:59,289
Yeah, you should do that.
You know, it'd make her really happy...

406
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,314
Shawn is gonna freak out too.

407
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:03,648
What? You know I’m gonna see him, right?

408
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:04,939
You're a good cousin.

409
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:07,934
Just don't expect too much.
You know, people change in four years.

410
00:25:16,188 --> 00:25:18,727
I can't believe you're standing here. I...

411
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,457
I've been looking forward
to this moment for too long.

412
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:25,661
Hey...

413
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,493
You remember how we used to love
to go to the batting cages?

414
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,871
You never could hit that curve ball.

415
00:25:30,915 --> 00:25:32,530
Me? No, it was you,

416
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:34,144
And I got plenty of quarters saved up, so...

417
00:25:34,188 --> 00:25:36,815
Maybe we should stop off at the driving range too.

418
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:39,639
You want to learn how to play golf?

419
00:25:40,182 --> 00:25:41,928
I used to beg to teach you!

420
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,732
Lot of things I want to try now, dad.

421
00:25:47,564 --> 00:25:49,913
You make a list. You want it, and we'll do it.

422
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:51,000
Anything.

423
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:54,082
You can show me tonight, okay?

424
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:56,166
You're leaving? I just got here!

425
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:57,971
That's my job, buddy.

426
00:25:58,045 --> 00:25:59,953
Now, get started on that list.

427
00:26:05,018 --> 00:26:08,467
You people really take
your arts and crafts seriously, don't you?

428
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:11,109
You're sure Tess drew this
before they started building?

429
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,382
Ske made her first sketch 2 weeks ago.

430
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:16,906
That thing started going up yesterday.

431
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:20,176
And you think that the orderly
who died is connected to all of this?

432
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:23,083
Arlo was on the ledge of "B" building
prying loose a weather vane.

433
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,649
I believe it was this weather vane.

434
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,951
So why don't you just confine
all the other patients to their rooms?

435
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:35,811
Well, I've been tempted, but this kind of cooperative
behavior, it's unheard of with these illnesses.

436
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,304
Besides, I wanted you to get a look at that thing
before we tore it down again.

437
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,942
It's all right, Kevin.

438
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:44,027
They're just here to talk to Tess.

439
00:26:45,157 --> 00:26:47,050
He's very protective of her.

440
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:49,222
She's his only friend in here.

441
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:52,304
Really, it's okay.

442
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,821
I'll just let her know you're coming.

443
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,731
Great.

444
00:27:15,445 --> 00:27:19,158
We saw some of the pictures you did, Tess.
They're really good.

445
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:21,093
They'll hear you.

446
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:23,926
There's microphones in the walls.

447
00:27:24,587 --> 00:27:27,537
They broadcast by sattellite to the submarines.

448
00:27:27,727 --> 00:27:28,711
Who does?

449
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:31,338
The doctors.

450
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,917
The doctors here in the hospital?

451
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,542
Some of them are in the hospital.

452
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:40,038
Some of them are stationed on the submarine.

453
00:27:40,302 --> 00:27:42,900
All right, we'll just talk really softly.

454
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,905
They took my crayons away, but they're too late.

455
00:27:47,994 --> 00:27:49,314
Yeah? Why's that?

456
00:27:49,491 --> 00:27:51,986
Because it's gonna get built anyway.

457
00:27:52,543 --> 00:27:56,550
They want me to get in touch with them,
that's why they put the plans in my head.

458
00:27:57,915 --> 00:28:01,878
Huh, now, are we talking about the doctors
here in the hospital or the doctors

459
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:03,228
under the sea?

460
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:05,826
Neither

461
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:09,040
We're talking about the people who took me...

462
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,376
... stupid.

463
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:18,726
So the people who took you...

464
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:22,278
they want the patients here to build that tower?

465
00:28:22,425 --> 00:28:24,494
They'll do anything to get me back.

466
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:27,154
They like me.

467
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:35,329
Did you ask the other patients for help, Tess?

468
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,277
I don't like talking t them.

469
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,421
They're crazy.

470
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,562
Was Arlo crazy?

471
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:49,948
I never thought he was...

472
00:28:52,678 --> 00:28:54,820
but maybe crazy is catching.

473
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:59,194
So my first day back, and what's going on?

474
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,148
Nothing much.

475
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:04,023
Just a bunch of mental patients building
a machine to contact the future.

476
00:29:04,255 --> 00:29:06,060
Well, that's what Tess thinks, anyway

477
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,893
She also thinks there are doctors
stationed under the pacific ocean,

478
00:29:08,937 --> 00:29:11,872
listening to a radio broadcast
of her private conversations.

479
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:15,365
Could be some kind of collective hysteria.
Doesn't explain this guy Arlo, though.

480
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:19,265
He's a middle-aged hospital orderly whose wife
just left him. It could have been suicide.

481
00:29:19,294 --> 00:29:22,494
Lost his nerve at the last minute,
tried to grab the weather vane?

482
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:25,224
I wonder how long it is since
Marco got some sun, you know?

483
00:29:25,253 --> 00:29:27,851
I was thinking we could bring him down
to have a look at that thing they're building.

484
00:29:27,895 --> 00:29:29,128
A road trip for Marco?

485
00:29:29,157 --> 00:29:30,798
He goes outside, Tom,

486
00:29:30,842 --> 00:29:32,985
but, you know, we could have some sunblock handy.

487
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:34,541
It would be something, though, huh?

488
00:29:34,585 --> 00:29:37,359
If she could actually do it. Contact the future.

489
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:38,929
Tess is right.

490
00:29:39,293 --> 00:29:41,451
Maybe crazy is catching.

491
00:29:49,552 --> 00:29:51,328
He was dictating a letter.

492
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,044
I don't know what happened.
He just grabbed his head and started screaming.

493
00:29:54,499 --> 00:29:56,231
Wait outside. Now.

494
00:29:57,038 --> 00:29:58,535
Hold still. Hold still.

495
00:30:19,214 --> 00:30:21,239
Thanks. Thank you.

496
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:25,907
They're getting worse.

497
00:30:25,995 --> 00:30:27,184
Jordan...

498
00:30:27,345 --> 00:30:29,432
They're coming more often too.

499
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,440
- You're okay?
- I'm fine

500
00:30:34,011 --> 00:30:37,328
I don't get it.
I don't get why these attacks keep coming back.

501
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:40,641
I've cured...

502
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:42,887
... emphysema, leukemia...

503
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:44,443
... broken bones...

504
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,538
That baby really kicked your ass.

505
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:50,665
Well, you just remember that
when we find Richard and Lily.

506
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:54,620
You sound pretty confident,
Jordan, but it's been a year.

507
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,134
Sometimes I forget they're still out there.

508
00:30:58,157 --> 00:30:59,554
I never forget,

509
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:02,748
and neither do the men I'm paying to find them.

510
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:07,404
Okay, but if I were you,

511
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,103
I wouldn't want to be
in the same time zone as that kid.

512
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:13,334
If you two meet up again,

513
00:31:14,238 --> 00:31:16,384
it might just finish you off.

514
00:31:17,465 --> 00:31:18,979
I have my reasons.

515
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,656
- Now, get some rest, okay?
- Alright.

516
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:35,218
Big day tomorrow.

517
00:31:43,629 --> 00:31:44,815
In the breaking news,

518
00:31:45,097 --> 00:31:48,760
revelation about the origins of the 4400.

519
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:51,120
In his newly published autobiography,

520
00:31:51,164 --> 00:31:53,759
former real estate mogul, Jordan Collier, claims

521
00:31:53,795 --> 00:31:55,826
that the 4400 were abducted

522
00:31:55,861 --> 00:31:58,327
by human beings, from the future.

523
00:31:58,404 --> 00:32:02,208
The book contains copies of
classified government memoranda, that Collier says

524
00:32:02,243 --> 00:32:03,758
prove his claims.

525
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:08,383
The documents are said to come from an anonymous
source within the national threat assessment command.

526
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,690
According to Collier,

527
00:32:09,736 --> 00:32:14,586
the 4400 were returned to avert a catastrophe
that threatens the survival of mankind.

528
00:32:14,587 --> 00:32:15,387
Why didn't you tell me?

529
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,030
Collier charges

530
00:32:16,075 --> 00:32:21,864
that the government has had this information for
more than a year, but has kept it secret
in an effort to avert a public panic.

531
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:27,299
The government claims that the documents are purely
speculative and have been quoted out of context.

532
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:28,884
Don't care who took them.

533
00:32:29,413 --> 00:32:31,813
Don't care who sent them back.
The government should have kept them behind bars.

534
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,039
Didn't you hear what the man said?
They're here to save the world.

535
00:32:34,062 --> 00:32:35,972
What do you expect him to say?
He's one of them.

536
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:38,142
You're awful quiet.

537
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:42,592
I deal in facts...

538
00:32:43,132 --> 00:32:44,365
And the fact is,

539
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,265
I've got to flush this radiator before lunch.

540
00:33:00,957 --> 00:33:04,550
You'll be happy to hear that Mr. Collier's
anonymous source is anonymous no more.

541
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:07,544
Agent Hubbard will be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.

542
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:08,957
So, what about Collier?

543
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:10,789
Guy bought national secrets on the black market.

544
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:14,300
I'm sure we'd all like to see Collier
charged with treason, but it's unlikely.

545
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:17,223
I doubt we'll be able to trace
the payments directly to him.

546
00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:19,244
Now...

547
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:22,262
... as for this so-called "4400 Center"...

548
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:24,892
Round-the-clock surveillance is
in effect until further notice.

549
00:33:24,927 --> 00:33:27,710
I want pictures of everyone who comes
within a hundred yards of that place.

550
00:33:27,745 --> 00:33:31,042
Is it true that Collier's filing
for tax-exempt status?

551
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:31,841
Apparently.

552
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,201
He's turning the 4400 into some kind of religion?

553
00:33:34,236 --> 00:33:35,516
More like a cult.

554
00:33:36,502 --> 00:33:39,569
Well, "cult" is what the big congregation
calls the little congregation.

555
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,938
Cult, religion, whatever. What's he basing it on?

556
00:33:42,974 --> 00:33:44,653
Have you read this thing?

557
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:48,528
Collier claims that he can unlock
the 4400 within anybody.

558
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:51,763
So he expects a guy punching a clock in Pittsburgh

559
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:54,107
to believe he has some kind of latent superpower?

560
00:33:54,142 --> 00:33:57,101
Most of the 4400 don't even have
those kinds of abilities.

561
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,111
Not yet, anyway.

562
00:33:58,146 --> 00:34:00,166
No, but if you thought there was a chance

563
00:34:00,213 --> 00:34:03,274
that you had an ability locked away inside you...

564
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:05,959
You sound like you're ready to sign up.

565
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:07,520
No,

566
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:10,174
but I wouldn't blame anyone for being curious.

567
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:12,652
We keep telling the public that biologically,

568
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:15,131
the 4400 aren't any different than the rest of us.

569
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:18,208
They haven't been altered genetically, neurologically...

570
00:34:18,243 --> 00:34:20,403
As far as we can tell.

571
00:34:20,462 --> 00:34:23,503
But if Collier thinks people
are just going to sign their lives

572
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,781
and their life savings over to some...

573
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,199
metaphysical pyramid scheme, then...

574
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:30,090
He's in for a rude awakening.

575
00:35:04,623 --> 00:35:07,065
Welcome to the Center. My name's Devon.

576
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,413
- What's yours?
- Kyle.

577
00:35:09,459 --> 00:35:12,159
Nice to meet you, Kyle. Can I sign you up for a tour?

578
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:15,095
Huh, thanks. I'm just looking
for my cousin, Shawn Farrell?

579
00:35:15,142 --> 00:35:17,654
I'm sorry, Mr. Farrell's not available right now.

580
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,293
Could you tell him Kyle's looking for him?
He does live here, right?

581
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:24,297
I'm afraid policy prohibits me from
discussing our membership.

582
00:35:24,743 --> 00:35:27,009
I'm not looking for a discussion.
I just want to say hi to my cousin.

583
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:28,312
If you'd like to leave your name and number...

584
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,416
I'm not leaving anything!
What's the problem here?

585
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:31,966
There's no problem.

586
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,172
Then tell Shawn I'm here! If he doesn't want
to see me, fine, but that's up to him, right?

587
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:37,168
Would you lower your voice, please?

588
00:35:38,543 --> 00:35:41,173
Look, I've got nothing against you. Personally,

589
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:44,085
I hope the pod people return your body to you someday.

590
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:46,856
If it's all the same, I'll find Shawn myself.

591
00:35:52,909 --> 00:35:54,013
This way, sir.

592
00:35:54,054 --> 00:35:56,009
- Get your hands off me!
- You have to leave.

593
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:01,578
You guys didn't tell me this thing was so big.

594
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,504
- It wasn't.
- Not yesterday.

595
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:06,416
And those don't look like patients to me.

596
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:07,426
They're not.

597
00:36:07,473 --> 00:36:08,541
Dr. Clayton!

598
00:36:08,574 --> 00:36:10,747
I know what you're going to say.
We're falling behind.

599
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:12,390
We'll make up the time this afternoon.

600
00:36:12,426 --> 00:36:15,478
So is the entire hospital working on this thing?

601
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,398
It's the only way to get it done.

602
00:36:19,326 --> 00:36:20,218
Excuse me.

603
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:23,224
Uh, Randy, Winston, we need a little help here.

604
00:36:23,259 --> 00:36:25,490
Dr. Cho's back there with the satellite dish.

605
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:27,250
Okay.

606
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:30,538
So first the patients, now the staff.

607
00:36:30,561 --> 00:36:33,649
If this is some kind of mass hysteria, it's spreading.

608
00:36:39,372 --> 00:36:41,215
Who does daddy love?

609
00:36:43,094 --> 00:36:44,139
Mommy...

610
00:36:45,043 --> 00:36:46,734
... and Isabelle.

611
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,516
Yes, he does.

612
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,152
You know what he sees when he looks at you?

613
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,695
Huh?

614
00:36:57,069 --> 00:36:59,699
A beautiful baby. Yes, he does.

615
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:02,916
But mommy sees much more than that,

616
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:05,747
And you know why?

617
00:37:07,262 --> 00:37:09,352
Because you communicate with mommy.

618
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:11,888
But you never talk to daddy.

619
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,589
So how about it?

620
00:37:16,997 --> 00:37:18,993
Anything you want to say to daddy?

621
00:37:19,756 --> 00:37:20,695
Huh?

622
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:23,690
Cause I'm listening.

623
00:37:25,063 --> 00:37:26,531
Okay, then.

624
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,341
Guess I'm left to muddle along all alone.

625
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:37,488
Richard. We got to get a copy
of that book. I want to read it.

626
00:37:37,511 --> 00:37:39,848
You and me both, but I checked in town.

627
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,727
They won't have any copies till tomorrow.

628
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:48,256
I don't know about you, but I kind of got used
to the idea we'd never know where she came from.

629
00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:53,466
Well, if we went to the future,
at least we came back with a souvenir.

630
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:02,073
The people who took us,

631
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:03,764
they made all this happen, right?

632
00:38:04,926 --> 00:38:07,380
They saw to it that we got Isabelle.

633
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,445
They must have something in mind for her.

634
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:12,328
I have something in mind for her too,

635
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:14,371
a normal life.

636
00:38:15,072 --> 00:38:16,472
Sounds good but,

637
00:38:16,684 --> 00:38:19,267
we left normal behind a long time ago.

638
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:31,843
This is outrageous! We have work
to finish here. Important work.

639
00:38:31,878 --> 00:38:35,455
The doctors want to work. Tell them to make their rounds.
No one's stopping them from taking care of their patients.

640
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,605
Now on...

641
00:38:36,629 --> 00:38:39,235
- ... the tower and the courtyard
are off-limits, you got it?
- Got it.

642
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,453
Man, look at the size of that thing.

643
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:45,492
Wouldn't mind having one of those in my backyard, huh?

644
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,204
Road trip's over. Wait in the car.

645
00:38:53,963 --> 00:38:57,274
So yesterday, a few patients were compelled to work on this thing,

646
00:38:57,309 --> 00:38:59,658
and today it's the entire hospital.

647
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:01,172
If we get Tess out of here,

648
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:03,238
do you think this compulsion will fade?

649
00:39:05,184 --> 00:39:06,147
I don't know.

650
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:07,591
It's worth a try, isn't it?

651
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,368
All right, I got you.

652
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,686
It's okay.

653
00:39:16,956 --> 00:39:18,706
I'm not a bad person.

654
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:20,021
I'm not.

655
00:39:20,045 --> 00:39:21,618
No, no, no one's saying you are, Tess.

656
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:24,037
Then why are you going to stick wires in my brain?

657
00:39:24,084 --> 00:39:25,663
I promise, Tess. No one's going to hurt you.

658
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,988
That's what everyone says, right before they hurt you.

659
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:31,769
Why am I being punished? I'm a good person.
Really. I'm only doing what they want.

660
00:39:35,732 --> 00:39:37,692
Guys! Guys! Get over here!

661
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,683
Kevin!

662
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:56,853
Okay, Tess. Let's go. Come on.

663
00:39:57,088 --> 00:39:58,050
- It's all right.
- Kevin...

664
00:40:09,258 --> 00:40:11,723
- Do you have a seven?
- Go fish.

665
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:15,140
I am so sorry I'm late.

666
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:18,345
Who do we have here?

667
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,482
This is Carrie. She lives downstairs.

668
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:23,182
The U.P.S. man left their package
with us by mistake,

669
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:25,789
and when her mom came to get it,
Carrie was with her,

670
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:28,141
and now I'm invited to her birthday party,

671
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:29,867
and it's a sleep-over.

672
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:31,558
I can go, right?

673
00:40:34,177 --> 00:40:35,304
Hi, Carrie.

674
00:40:35,468 --> 00:40:36,513
I'm Diana.

675
00:40:36,631 --> 00:40:37,944
It's nice to meet you.

676
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:39,282
Nice to meet you.

677
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:41,795
I already said it's okay.

678
00:40:41,877 --> 00:40:45,567
Well, I think we should probably talk
to Carrie's mom first, don't you?

679
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:50,686
Oh, look, you know what? It sounds fine to me.

680
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,338
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

681
00:40:53,408 --> 00:40:55,651
You never told me I was a prisoner.

682
00:40:55,674 --> 00:40:58,927
Have you ever seen a prison cell, Shawn?
It looks nothing like your apartment.

683
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,541
Goddammit, Jordan, since when
do you decide who I see and talk to?

684
00:41:02,564 --> 00:41:04,302
This is about your cousin, isn't it?

685
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:06,862
So you did know he was here.

686
00:41:07,038 --> 00:41:10,175
I know he was rude and aggressive,
and had to be escorted from the premises.

687
00:41:10,198 --> 00:41:11,830
You mean thrown out.

688
00:41:12,006 --> 00:41:14,719
It might have been handled more smoothly, Shawn,

689
00:41:15,247 --> 00:41:18,067
but all in all, I'd have to say it was for the best.

690
00:41:18,113 --> 00:41:19,746
Kyle is my friend.

691
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,059
He was your friend.

692
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:26,427
Look, a year ago, you came to me looking for a new life,

693
00:41:26,462 --> 00:41:28,340
your old one in shambles.

694
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,398
Kyle, friend or not,

695
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,924
is part of that old life.

696
00:41:31,971 --> 00:41:32,981
So what do you want me to do?

697
00:41:33,016 --> 00:41:35,365
You just want me to cut him loose
and forget he exists?

698
00:41:35,388 --> 00:41:39,004
He's no different than your mother,
your brother, or your friend Nikki.

699
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:39,599
Don't you...

700
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:42,867
They do not understand what it is
we're trying to accomplish here.

701
00:41:47,846 --> 00:41:49,801
You know, maybe I don't either.

702
00:41:53,326 --> 00:41:57,459
Well, then, I suggest you pack your bags and...
Leave.

703
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:18,925
So, what happens next time
you start screaming out in pain?

704
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:20,786
Do what's right for you, Shawn.

705
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,986
I'll take care of myself.

706
00:42:30,562 --> 00:42:33,275
I just got the full medical workup on Tess.

707
00:42:33,404 --> 00:42:35,717
Let me guess...
Physically normal across the board.

708
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,829
You can say this for the 4400...
They're consistent.

709
00:42:38,853 --> 00:42:41,905
Tess draws a picture of a...
a tower, or a monument...

710
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:42,772
Yeah, or a beacon...

711
00:42:42,796 --> 00:42:45,085
And the people around her drop everything
and start building it.

712
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:47,833
Well, they can't help themselves.
They have to work.

713
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:50,533
It's like ants.

714
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:51,905
Come here.

715
00:42:54,206 --> 00:42:57,048
The queen secretes a chemical,
tells the other ants what to do.

716
00:42:57,917 --> 00:43:00,533
The drones don't stop working until
the job is done.

717
00:43:00,557 --> 00:43:03,058
Doesn't matter if one of them dies,
or if

718
00:43:03,093 --> 00:43:05,453
a storm comes and washes away the anthill.

719
00:43:05,488 --> 00:43:07,026
They just keep working...

720
00:43:07,144 --> 00:43:08,785
Unless you take the queen away.

721
00:43:09,478 --> 00:43:11,557
Let's hope our drones respond the same way.

722
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:14,243
Right, so the future sent back
a schizophrenic queen ant

723
00:43:14,278 --> 00:43:17,824
with a blueprint for what,
some interstellar walkie-talkie?

724
00:43:18,787 --> 00:43:20,513
Let's see what Tess can tell us.

725
00:43:21,552 --> 00:43:23,102
We'd just better not get too close,

726
00:43:23,137 --> 00:43:26,742
because if your theory's right, anyone
who gets exposed to her could be vulnerable.

727
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:31,812
All right, I'll talk to Tess.
You check in with Garrity at the hospital.

728
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,286
These friends of yours,

729
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,012
the ones who took you,

730
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:41,290
what do you think they want to talk about?

731
00:43:43,673 --> 00:43:47,020
They're so much smarter than you,
it isn't even funny.

732
00:43:47,194 --> 00:43:48,027
Yeah, well...

733
00:43:48,427 --> 00:43:49,683
Yeah, I don't doubt it.

734
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:52,712
I mean, they figured out how to take you
and how to send you back.

735
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:57,278
Sending me back was a mistake, and they know it.

736
00:43:58,687 --> 00:44:00,518
I'm supposed to be there.

737
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:04,532
Where exactly is "there?"

738
00:44:06,598 --> 00:44:08,630
There were doctors there too.

739
00:44:08,935 --> 00:44:11,211
They were nice. All of them.

740
00:44:12,913 --> 00:44:14,040
They were nice.

741
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,385
You remember where you were taken?

742
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:22,590
We slept a lot, but not all the time.

743
00:44:23,647 --> 00:44:25,619
We wore gray clothes.

744
00:44:28,074 --> 00:44:30,154
There was a giant building.

745
00:44:31,093 --> 00:44:33,559
The doctors wore shiny jackets.

746
00:44:36,118 --> 00:44:37,938
I miss it so much.

747
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:44,735
Go on.

748
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:48,152
I really like hearing you talk about it.

749
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,214
Our rooms had round windows.

750
00:44:54,118 --> 00:44:56,925
High doorways with arches in them.

751
00:44:58,733 --> 00:45:02,993
The stones had writing in them.
Math symbols or something,

752
00:45:03,991 --> 00:45:05,600
inscriptions,

753
00:45:07,854 --> 00:45:10,397
jars of purplish metals,

754
00:45:10,444 --> 00:45:13,344
and rods with stained tips.

755
00:45:18,158 --> 00:45:20,704
These symbols, Tess, what did they look like?

756
00:45:23,028 --> 00:45:23,991
Tess?

757
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:26,410
Tess, do you remember
what the inscriptions said?

758
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:28,345
They're waiting to hear from me.

759
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,989
I need to get in touch with them.

760
00:45:30,024 --> 00:45:31,527
Tess. Tess. Just wait...

761
00:45:31,689 --> 00:45:32,921
Tess, just wait.

762
00:45:54,959 --> 00:45:57,331
Garrity, why haven't you been
picking up your cellphone?

763
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:59,268
I'm sorry.
It's been kind of crazy down here.

764
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:00,583
So is everything all right?

765
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:02,732
Yeah. Fine.
We're just about done here.

766
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:03,611
Done?

767
00:46:03,646 --> 00:46:06,593
Well, the satellite dishes are a bitch to hook up,
but we'll get 'em.

768
00:46:08,272 --> 00:46:11,973
Come on, people. Let's get those
dishes secured. We don't have all day.

769
00:46:14,051 --> 00:46:17,221
I just had the most unbelievable
conversation with Tess.

770
00:46:17,245 --> 00:46:21,213
Well, it couldn't have been any more unbelievable
than the one I just had with Garrity.

771
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:32,691
Can't say I see it that way.

772
00:46:32,727 --> 00:46:35,404
No other way to see it.
That book is blasphemy.

773
00:46:35,427 --> 00:46:37,188
Well, don't buy it if that's how you feel.

774
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:42,340
"The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great
star fell from heaven, burning like a torch".

775
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:44,477
Revelations 8:10.

776
00:46:44,651 --> 00:46:46,048
I'll take your word for it.

777
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:49,054
The day they came back
was the beginning of the end times.

778
00:46:49,077 --> 00:46:51,437
Sounds like you've done a little more thinking
on it than I have.

779
00:46:51,473 --> 00:46:53,373
Either remove the book from the store,

780
00:46:53,396 --> 00:46:55,850
or my boy here will remove it for you.

781
00:46:55,886 --> 00:46:57,189
Like hell he will!

782
00:47:04,247 --> 00:47:07,898
Do you know what you're carrying there, woman?

783
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:09,683
It's just a book.

784
00:47:10,587 --> 00:47:12,801
It's the doorway to hell.

785
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:21,596
That child yours?

786
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:22,897
That's my daughter.

787
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:28,327
Abomination begets abomination.

788
00:48:09,768 --> 00:48:10,837
Richard!

789
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,868
What's going on?

790
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:14,958
We've got to get out of here.
Now.

791
00:48:29,733 --> 00:48:30,484
Ok...

792
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,563
Sheriff, what's the hell happen?

793
00:48:32,586 --> 00:48:34,547
These new guys you sent us are no good.

794
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:36,942
Park told me he had experience with a welding torch.

795
00:48:36,966 --> 00:48:40,744
Experience at what? Starting fires?
Now our schedule's in the toilet.

796
00:48:40,803 --> 00:48:42,870
Did either of you call the fire department?

797
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,437
Time to go.

798
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:35,868
Hurry, Richard.

799
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,721
Hurry!

800
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:29,290
As of tonight, Abendson State Hospital
is officially under quarantine.

801
00:50:29,314 --> 00:50:31,204
The patients will remain locked down.

802
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:35,102
Hospital staff and affected NTAC personnel
will be confined to the site until we've

803
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:37,181
isolated the source of the compulsion.

804
00:50:37,275 --> 00:50:39,695
That sounds like a good plan,
but who's going to watch over them?

805
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:41,835
The last group we sent was compromised
within hours.

806
00:50:41,882 --> 00:50:44,383
Which is, quite frankly,
a little disturbing.

807
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:46,658
If you think of this like an epidemic...

808
00:50:46,876 --> 00:50:49,881
In the CDC, we'd call Tess
"the sole disease vector".

809
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:52,206
You remove her, you remove the urge to build,

810
00:50:52,242 --> 00:50:53,580
except as far as we know...

811
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:55,764
None of those agents had any contact with Tess.

812
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:58,527
So it's like the flu,
or any other airborne virus.

813
00:50:58,585 --> 00:51:00,446
You catch it, you can pass it on.

814
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,513
What is this thing supposed to be, anyway?

815
00:51:03,029 --> 00:51:06,721
My guess, and I cannot emphasize
the word "guess" strongly enough,

816
00:51:06,967 --> 00:51:10,525
Is that Tess is telling us the truth.
It's some kind of communication device.

817
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,838
To contact who?
The future?

818
00:51:13,763 --> 00:51:16,734
The only way to find out
is to let the patients finish building it.

819
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:20,949
That night on Highland Beach, they were trying to
tell us something. The conversation was cut short.

820
00:51:20,985 --> 00:51:23,896
Which is why we've been stumbling
around in the dark this last year.

821
00:51:23,931 --> 00:51:27,242
Tess is the only 4400
who remembers where she was taken...

822
00:51:27,265 --> 00:51:29,625
No, claims to remember where she was taken.

823
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,068
She's also the only paranoid schizophrenic.

824
00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:36,524
And it sounds to me like you two have been
spending a little too much time around her.

825
00:51:37,241 --> 00:51:40,035
Well, maybe I caught the bug too,
but, uh...

826
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:41,515
I agree with them.

827
00:51:43,499 --> 00:51:46,732
The quarantine orders at the hospital
remain in effect until further notice.

828
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:49,656
The guards will rotate shifts to minimize their exposure.

829
00:51:49,984 --> 00:51:51,710
So where does that leave us?

830
00:51:52,465 --> 00:51:54,637
Until we're sure the compulsion's
not spreading anymore,

831
00:51:54,672 --> 00:51:57,173
you two aren't going anywhere near that facility.

832
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:03,787
Isabelle's asleep.

833
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:09,541
Rainy day came sooner than expected.

834
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,006
Do you think we lost them?

835
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:13,765
I'm not ready to stop for pie just yet.

836
00:52:13,894 --> 00:52:15,620
I got 1,200 here.

837
00:52:15,656 --> 00:52:17,264
Another 300 in my pocket.

838
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,742
I'm carrying two.

839
00:52:20,116 --> 00:52:22,617
We're going to have to get those back windows
replaced in the morning.

840
00:52:22,711 --> 00:52:25,059
This should be enough to carry us
through to Montana.

841
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:26,770
What did Eric say when you called him?

842
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:28,731
He was a little surprised to hear from me,

843
00:52:29,295 --> 00:52:33,275
but even back in quarantine, he used to say
how us 4400s should stick together.

844
00:52:33,311 --> 00:52:35,812
Yeah, we didn't have much choice back then,
though, did we?

845
00:52:39,769 --> 00:52:41,883
The bank will wire us our savings
when we get there.

846
00:52:41,918 --> 00:52:44,842
If things get really bad, we can sell these.

847
00:52:46,484 --> 00:52:48,222
I put that ring on you forever.

848
00:52:53,881 --> 00:52:56,981
Guess you and Isabelle were right.
We should have taken off when we had the chance.

849
00:53:00,147 --> 00:53:01,579
It's gonna be a long night.

850
00:53:02,154 --> 00:53:03,622
You want me to drive a shift?

851
00:53:04,479 --> 00:53:05,736
Get some sleep.

852
00:53:34,466 --> 00:53:36,039
Maia, what's wrong?

853
00:53:36,075 --> 00:53:37,648
I'm sorry.
I know it's late, but...

854
00:53:37,683 --> 00:53:39,724
Maia really wanted to come home.

855
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:41,086
Why is that, sweetie?

856
00:53:41,121 --> 00:53:42,835
I don't want to talk about it.

857
00:53:43,399 --> 00:53:45,371
Some of the girls,
not my daughter, but

858
00:53:45,407 --> 00:53:47,589
some of the other girls,
were teasing Maia.

859
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:50,594
I guess she said she has a crush on Frank Sinatra.

860
00:53:51,557 --> 00:53:53,647
Well, ol' blue eyes. Do you blame her?

861
00:53:53,683 --> 00:53:57,238
Most nine-year-olds don't even know
who Frank Sinatra was.

862
00:53:57,919 --> 00:53:59,458
I want to go to bed.

863
00:54:02,616 --> 00:54:04,633
I guess it got pretty nasty.

864
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:07,228
I feel terrible.

865
00:54:07,263 --> 00:54:10,528
Maybe Maia can come back another time?
Just her and Carrie.

866
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,498
Yeah. We'll talk about it.

867
00:54:13,144 --> 00:54:14,012
Thank you.

868
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:16,067
- Good night.
- Good night.

869
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,326
Maia.

870
00:54:33,111 --> 00:54:36,305
I know you didn't fall asleep that fast.

871
00:54:39,815 --> 00:54:41,025
It was awful.

872
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:42,669
You were right.

873
00:54:43,162 --> 00:54:45,123
Well, I didn't want to be right.

874
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:48,376
I don't need any friends.

875
00:54:48,611 --> 00:54:50,583
Everyone needs friends, Maia.

876
00:54:52,341 --> 00:54:54,724
Come on, I really think we should talk about this.

877
00:54:54,748 --> 00:54:56,321
Well, I don't.

878
00:55:23,058 --> 00:55:25,496
Buck's burgers.
Good as I remembered.

879
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:27,974
Kind of a strange thing to have on top of your list,

880
00:55:27,997 --> 00:55:29,289
but hey, you know what?

881
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:32,307
I'm glad I could make your dreams come true.

882
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:36,104
Kyle, shouldn't you be in bed?

883
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,476
Dad, I'm 21.

884
00:55:39,404 --> 00:55:41,952
So I have to keep reminding myself.

885
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,911
I'm making some popcorn. You want some?

886
00:55:46,946 --> 00:55:48,132
You're kidding me.

887
00:55:48,543 --> 00:55:49,611
You could eat more?

888
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:51,948
I've been eating quarantine food for a year.

889
00:55:51,971 --> 00:55:55,564
You guys might be keeping the country safe,
but your cafeteria sucks.

890
00:55:58,695 --> 00:55:59,587
Hello?

891
00:56:01,431 --> 00:56:02,253
Hello?

892
00:56:04,683 --> 00:56:05,505
Kyle.

893
00:56:11,486 --> 00:56:13,635
We got to get the baby out of the cold.

894
00:56:14,157 --> 00:56:17,362
I don't think there's any motels on this road.

895
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:20,036
I was thinking we'd head south,

896
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:21,750
catch the 35.

897
00:56:31,017 --> 00:56:32,872
Guy should lose his high beams.

898
00:56:35,056 --> 00:56:37,252
That's the first car we've seen in, what, like,

899
00:56:37,522 --> 00:56:38,861
15 miles?

900
00:56:47,544 --> 00:56:49,223
Get your head down.

901
00:56:58,151 --> 00:57:00,077
Oh, my god, Richard.
It's them.

902
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,500
Hold on! Hold on!

903
00:57:29,052 --> 00:57:30,402
Everybody okay?

904
00:57:30,637 --> 00:57:31,717
Yeah, I think so.

905
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:33,418
Okay. Let's go.

906
00:57:51,825 --> 00:57:53,058
Spread out.

907
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:04,023
Hey, Maia, sweetie.

908
00:58:05,221 --> 00:58:06,663
It's wake-up time.

909
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:08,894
- Okay.
- Huh?

910
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:11,453
It was a late night, huh?

911
00:58:14,013 --> 00:58:16,230
All right. 15 more minutes.

912
00:58:20,772 --> 00:58:22,950
You know what?
Frank Sinatra is the coolest...

913
00:58:22,984 --> 00:58:25,800
... and don't you let anyone
ever tell you're different.

914
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:48,251
So you didn't read any of it?

915
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:51,104
No. I wouldn't want
my daughter reading my diary.

916
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:52,771
You keep a diary?

917
00:58:53,018 --> 00:58:53,828
Am I in it?

918
00:58:53,861 --> 00:58:55,669
Come on, don't flatter yourself.

919
00:58:56,162 --> 00:58:59,133
So, really, you don't even know
if "what she sees" means...

920
00:58:59,262 --> 00:59:02,902
... things during the day,
tv shows, ponies, whatnot...

921
00:59:03,142 --> 00:59:05,326
Or it could be "what she sees"...

922
00:59:05,385 --> 00:59:07,076
... a week, a month, a year down the line.

923
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:10,211
She hasn't had one of those visions
in, like, four months.

924
00:59:10,821 --> 00:59:12,876
Well, that's what she tells you, anyway.

925
00:59:12,923 --> 00:59:14,259
Why would she lie?

926
00:59:14,975 --> 00:59:17,371
She wants to be normal, right?

927
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,259
Every time she makes a prediction,
someone calls her a freak.

928
00:59:21,044 --> 00:59:22,594
Look, I understand.

929
00:59:22,629 --> 00:59:25,306
You're her mom now.
There are certain protocols.

930
00:59:25,386 --> 00:59:27,218
Next time I'm over, why don't I take a peek?

931
00:59:27,241 --> 00:59:29,496
You think that'd be any less of a betrayal?

932
00:59:31,586 --> 00:59:34,251
Respecting Maia's privacy is no small thing,
but

933
00:59:34,286 --> 00:59:38,023
you've got to weigh that against the information
that could be in that diary.

934
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:38,880
You know what?

935
00:59:38,915 --> 00:59:41,769
When you stop trusting a parent,
it's really hard to start again,

936
00:59:41,804 --> 00:59:44,082
And yes, I'm speaking from experience.

937
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:46,111
Hey.

938
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:48,412
I'm glad it's not my decision,

939
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:51,579
but if Maia's having visions,
you should know about it,

940
00:59:51,617 --> 00:59:53,555
and you should know what they are.

941
00:59:58,248 --> 00:59:59,257
Is it bad?

942
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:03,647
I just jammed it when we spun out.

943
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:05,878
Just need to walk it off a little more.

944
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:10,678
We'll follow this stream south.

945
01:00:11,195 --> 01:00:12,651
Hike through the water a bit,

946
01:00:12,874 --> 01:00:14,306
throw 'em off our trail.

947
01:00:14,682 --> 01:00:16,006
It'll be cold.

948
01:00:16,194 --> 01:00:17,615
It'll keep us awake.

949
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:19,224
After a mile, we'll...

950
01:00:20,797 --> 01:00:22,300
we'll double back west.

951
01:00:23,755 --> 01:00:25,798
Head straight for the highway.

952
01:00:26,861 --> 01:00:28,658
Sounds easy when you say it.

953
01:00:29,609 --> 01:00:30,759
We can do it.

954
01:00:31,335 --> 01:00:32,861
We're going to do it, right?

955
01:00:37,571 --> 01:00:39,896
Keep her quiet.
She's going to bring them right to us.

956
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:05,961
Does the name "Gene Pecusa" ring a bell?

957
01:01:06,384 --> 01:01:08,181
Yeah, returnee 927.

958
01:01:08,419 --> 01:01:09,276
Oh, let me guess.

959
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:12,622
He still has the ability
to turn 20 bucks into a crushing hangover.

960
01:01:12,646 --> 01:01:16,309
And a night in the drunk tank.
Come on, we've got to ferry him back to his halfway house.

961
01:01:16,344 --> 01:01:18,094
Give it to Mortimer and Falcone.

962
01:01:18,566 --> 01:01:20,386
We got something else on our plates?

963
01:01:20,421 --> 01:01:21,279
No.

964
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:25,623
Everything's quiet at Abendson.
No one's been allowed near the tower.

965
01:01:28,262 --> 01:01:29,730
That's the problem, isn't it?

966
01:01:29,765 --> 01:01:31,550
Tom... Tom, no.

967
01:01:31,585 --> 01:01:34,544
You do remember that Jarvis has still
got your letter of resignation.

968
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:36,634
She wants results.
I'm going to give them to her.

969
01:01:36,716 --> 01:01:39,215
And besides, you want to know
what that thing is as badly as I do.

970
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:40,800
I'm trying not to think about it.

971
01:01:40,835 --> 01:01:42,819
Yeah, well, I can't think of anything else.

972
01:01:43,806 --> 01:01:46,318
So it sounds like Tess has got her hooks in you.

973
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:49,170
I don't have the urge to pick up a tool belt.

974
01:01:54,206 --> 01:01:55,604
I'm coming with you.

975
01:01:56,931 --> 01:01:59,502
It's all right, Tess.
We're taking you back to Abendson.

976
01:02:00,547 --> 01:02:03,130
We signed you out, Tess.
No one from NTAC is coming after you.

977
01:02:03,165 --> 01:02:05,652
Not you people. The doctors in the submarines.

978
01:02:05,675 --> 01:02:07,061
They're watching us.

979
01:02:08,212 --> 01:02:09,926
Come on, what, you're having second thoughts?

980
01:02:10,349 --> 01:02:11,488
No, just get in.

981
01:02:25,569 --> 01:02:28,622
So you still owe me

982
01:02:29,244 --> 01:02:32,778
four or five dollars for those two
six-packs? Something like that?

983
01:02:32,811 --> 01:02:35,676
I've got a 20 right here,
if you think you can take it from me.

984
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:41,487
Look at you, man.
Back among the living. You look great.

985
01:02:41,522 --> 01:02:44,927
I walk. I talk.
I seem to have full control of my limbs.

986
01:02:45,902 --> 01:02:47,628
You still hit like a girl.

987
01:02:47,921 --> 01:02:49,307
Nothing's changed.

988
01:02:49,354 --> 01:02:51,430
Four years? Plenty's changed.

989
01:02:51,453 --> 01:02:54,095
What are you talking about?
We saw each other right when you got out of the hospital.

990
01:02:54,136 --> 01:02:55,545
I don't remember any of that.

991
01:02:55,745 --> 01:02:56,600
You don't?

992
01:02:57,046 --> 01:02:59,946
So you don't remember sitting naked in the sprinklers?

993
01:02:59,981 --> 01:03:02,518
No.
Sounds like something you'd do.

994
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:03,598
Well...

995
01:03:03,844 --> 01:03:04,910
Thank you.

996
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:08,621
I never got a chance to say that.
For getting me out of the coma... thank you.

997
01:03:10,394 --> 01:03:13,094
You know, if it hadn't been for me,
you wouldn't have been

998
01:03:13,684 --> 01:03:16,291
in that stupid hospital anyway, so...

999
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:19,649
No, I'd have been the one who disappeared into 4400 boot camp.

1000
01:03:19,814 --> 01:03:21,633
Maybe I'd have come back with the magic hands.

1001
01:03:21,657 --> 01:03:23,430
All right, all right. Okay.

1002
01:03:23,627 --> 01:03:25,379
Speaking of disappearing, you jerk...

1003
01:03:25,403 --> 01:03:26,915
Oh, Kyle, don't go there yet.

1004
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:30,036
Don't go there?
Your mom is so freaked out.

1005
01:03:30,282 --> 01:03:32,701
You haven't seen her in a year.
You haven't seen anybody.

1006
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:35,296
Your brother.
My dad.

1007
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,876
What was going on with you and Nikki?

1008
01:03:37,912 --> 01:03:39,426
Kyle, I don't want to talk about Nikki.

1009
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:42,585
We're all really worried about you, man.

1010
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:47,921
You don't need to be.
I mean,

1011
01:03:47,968 --> 01:03:49,048
I'm fine.

1012
01:03:51,185 --> 01:03:53,205
I've been to that place where you're living.

1013
01:03:53,498 --> 01:03:57,831
There are some serious Stepford Wives vibes going on there, you know that, right?

1014
01:03:59,381 --> 01:04:02,704
All that stuff about
"unlocking the 4400 inside everybody..."

1015
01:04:02,728 --> 01:04:03,444
Yeah?

1016
01:04:07,002 --> 01:04:09,332
You don't really believe Collier can do that, do you?

1017
01:04:11,821 --> 01:04:12,666
Kyle...

1018
01:04:15,613 --> 01:04:17,034
Look around us, man.

1019
01:04:17,058 --> 01:04:19,228
The world is in a total freefall.

1020
01:04:19,991 --> 01:04:21,388
These centers,

1021
01:04:21,529 --> 01:04:24,970
they're a chance to bring people together,
maybe our last chance.

1022
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:28,328
I don't just believe that he can do it.

1023
01:04:29,243 --> 01:04:31,521
I believe that he has to do it.

1024
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,725
Sounds like someone got inside your head.

1025
01:04:39,764 --> 01:04:41,396
He said you wouldn't understand.

1026
01:04:41,431 --> 01:04:42,300
Collier?

1027
01:04:43,486 --> 01:04:44,202
Yeah.

1028
01:04:45,165 --> 01:04:47,055
I got to tell you, man, he was right.

1029
01:05:05,162 --> 01:05:06,043
Isabelle...

1030
01:05:13,604 --> 01:05:14,309
Richard!

1031
01:05:15,894 --> 01:05:17,115
God. What happened?

1032
01:05:17,761 --> 01:05:19,532
Guess I wasn't looking where I was going.

1033
01:05:19,555 --> 01:05:21,810
Okay. We just need to rest.

1034
01:05:23,406 --> 01:05:25,402
You think they're stopping for breaks?

1035
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:29,427
Come on, Richard.

1036
01:05:29,674 --> 01:05:30,531
Alright.

1037
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:31,728
Five minutes.

1038
01:05:39,572 --> 01:05:40,957
All right, people, come on!

1039
01:05:41,122 --> 01:05:43,083
Everyone out to the tower.

1040
01:05:43,203 --> 01:05:44,048
Come on.

1041
01:05:44,213 --> 01:05:47,336
We've got a lot of work to do, and not a lot of time to do it,
so let's go, come on.

1042
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:48,980
Go, go.

1043
01:05:49,396 --> 01:05:50,958
Come on, you heard me. Let's go.

1044
01:05:50,993 --> 01:05:52,907
This one's mine. Stand over there.

1045
01:05:53,587 --> 01:05:54,738
Hey, Kevin!

1046
01:05:55,924 --> 01:05:57,708
Look. I escaped.

1047
01:06:00,139 --> 01:06:01,724
Always thinking of me.

1048
01:06:02,828 --> 01:06:04,930
Kevin's a genius, you know,

1049
01:06:04,965 --> 01:06:06,527
but he doesn't brag about it.

1050
01:06:22,868 --> 01:06:25,287
I bet in a couple of days all
these berries will be ripe.

1051
01:06:26,109 --> 01:06:27,424
Don't eat them now.

1052
01:06:28,316 --> 01:06:30,981
The last thing we need is to start cramping up.

1053
01:07:05,181 --> 01:07:05,815
Look.

1054
01:07:08,222 --> 01:07:09,584
I thought you said they weren't ripe.

1055
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:12,191
They weren't.

1056
01:07:13,069 --> 01:07:13,750
Well...

1057
01:07:16,831 --> 01:07:17,676
Isabelle?

1058
01:07:19,015 --> 01:07:20,318
Had to be.

1059
01:07:24,427 --> 01:07:26,177
Way to go, little girl.

1060
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:46,964
They're going to have to work fast.

1061
01:07:49,206 --> 01:07:50,448
I'm going to help them.

1062
01:07:50,836 --> 01:07:51,693
That's not funny, Diana.

1063
01:07:51,716 --> 01:07:53,536
I really want to do this.

1064
01:07:53,572 --> 01:07:55,074
No, you'd only be in the way.

1065
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:57,796
You don't understand.
I really need to do this.

1066
01:08:29,978 --> 01:08:31,176
Have these sent to my house.

1067
01:08:31,446 --> 01:08:33,287
Shawn, I've been looking for you.

1068
01:08:33,313 --> 01:08:34,581
Yeah, I took a walk.

1069
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,361
We have a special visitor tonight.

1070
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:39,377
She has pancreatic cancer.
Her husband

1071
01:08:39,576 --> 01:08:43,287
is willing to donate real estate
for a 4400 center in Los Angeles.

1072
01:08:43,322 --> 01:08:45,682
Well, tonight doesn't really work for me, Jordan.

1073
01:08:46,148 --> 01:08:49,542
Well, you have five...
no, six hours to get in the mood.

1074
01:08:49,565 --> 01:08:51,303
Mood's got nothing to do with it.

1075
01:08:51,326 --> 01:08:52,888
I'm just not working tonight.

1076
01:09:15,524 --> 01:09:16,241
Richard,

1077
01:09:16,673 --> 01:09:18,704
please.
Don't do this.

1078
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:20,371
We don't have another choice.

1079
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:22,555
There's three of them.

1080
01:09:22,849 --> 01:09:23,953
They're going to kill you.

1081
01:09:23,976 --> 01:09:26,345
Not if I get my hands on one of those shotguns.

1082
01:09:26,392 --> 01:09:27,590
You can barely walk.

1083
01:09:30,854 --> 01:09:32,569
It's our only chance.

1084
01:09:33,717 --> 01:09:36,088
I've got to do it now,
while I still have the strength.

1085
01:09:39,033 --> 01:09:40,700
If I'm not back by sundown,

1086
01:09:41,663 --> 01:09:44,070
take the baby and walk due west.

1087
01:09:44,584 --> 01:09:45,735
It's that way.

1088
01:09:45,982 --> 01:09:47,555
Just keep going in a straight line.

1089
01:09:49,645 --> 01:09:50,631
Understand?

1090
01:10:03,697 --> 01:10:06,280
I'd give up another 50 years if it meant finding you again.

1091
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:34,976
You knew about this, didn't you?

1092
01:10:35,012 --> 01:10:36,397
Knew about what?

1093
01:10:36,421 --> 01:10:40,401
Baldwin and Skouris signed Tess Doerner out of here
and took her back to Abendson.

1094
01:10:42,078 --> 01:10:43,780
They're rebuilding the tower.

1095
01:10:44,696 --> 01:10:46,199
That would be one theory.

1096
01:11:22,165 --> 01:11:23,457
No crying.

1097
01:11:23,927 --> 01:11:25,617
You can't cry now.

1098
01:11:39,979 --> 01:11:40,988
Drop it.

1099
01:11:42,409 --> 01:11:44,109
I'll cut you in half.

1100
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:48,653
Yeah...

1101
01:11:48,923 --> 01:11:50,356
Turn around.

1102
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:05,753
I taught you boys better than this.

1103
01:12:06,657 --> 01:12:07,631
Get up!

1104
01:12:24,398 --> 01:12:25,115
Diana,

1105
01:12:25,409 --> 01:12:26,489
how's it going?

1106
01:12:26,524 --> 01:12:28,450
Well, it turns out we're in better shape
than I thought.

1107
01:12:28,485 --> 01:12:29,988
The fire missed most of the wiring.

1108
01:12:30,023 --> 01:12:31,585
So how soon till it's ready to go?

1109
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:35,445
Well, we've got to finish triangulating the dishes,
and then we're good.

1110
01:12:37,113 --> 01:12:38,440
Just get it done.

1111
01:12:38,827 --> 01:12:39,755
Baldwin.

1112
01:12:40,136 --> 01:12:42,144
We've got your man!

1113
01:12:42,814 --> 01:12:44,486
Either you come out,

1114
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:48,380
or the next sound you hear
is him being blown

1115
01:12:48,394 --> 01:12:49,908
straight to hell!

1116
01:12:49,942 --> 01:12:53,006
I told you, she's miles away by...

1117
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:56,294
Open your mouth again,
I'll cut your tongue out.

1118
01:12:57,959 --> 01:12:58,722
Okay...

1119
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:06,493
Watch him.

1120
01:13:09,029 --> 01:13:10,802
Lily! Run!

1121
01:13:24,677 --> 01:13:26,720
Are you sure you don't want to say
goodbye to me?

1122
01:13:27,542 --> 01:13:29,266
I'm gonna miss you most of all.

1123
01:13:42,348 --> 01:13:44,649
Last time, Baldwin, unlock the door.

1124
01:13:44,884 --> 01:13:46,082
Can't do that

1125
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,559
You said you wanted results.

1126
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:50,260
Listen to me Baldwin, you are not in your right mind.

1127
01:13:50,295 --> 01:13:52,843
These are not the results that I was talking about.

1128
01:13:52,972 --> 01:13:55,250
Now step away before you get hurt.

1129
01:14:00,866 --> 01:14:01,629
Take it.

1130
01:14:03,619 --> 01:14:05,328
No, no, just wait, wait!

1131
01:14:05,373 --> 01:14:06,664
Just wait, just wait...

1132
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:11,851
We need answers that tower might provide.
Just listen, listen to me...

1133
01:14:13,471 --> 01:14:14,880
It's a risk, I know.

1134
01:14:15,972 --> 01:14:19,668
But sometimes when you want to get to the truth
you have to take a leap of faith, just...

1135
01:14:19,704 --> 01:14:20,584
just listen to me.

1136
01:14:21,477 --> 01:14:22,275
Hmmm.

1137
01:14:24,104 --> 01:14:25,360
You want the truth?

1138
01:14:31,795 --> 01:14:33,867
Tess Doerner's memories of the future...

1139
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,194
They're not memories.

1140
01:14:35,229 --> 01:14:37,859
She read the mini-short story by H. P. Lovecraft.

1141
01:14:37,971 --> 01:14:40,355
"The Shadow Out of time", I have it right here.

1142
01:14:40,554 --> 01:14:43,995
I underlined some of the passages that show up verbatim in your report.

1143
01:14:45,556 --> 01:14:47,165
Just another delusion.

1144
01:14:49,024 --> 01:14:49,670
No.

1145
01:14:49,964 --> 01:14:51,067
I'm sorry Tom.

1146
01:14:51,114 --> 01:14:53,404
Ok, let's go, okay, guys take it.

1147
01:15:04,545 --> 01:15:06,864
Everyone step away from that tower.

1148
01:16:08,946 --> 01:16:09,967
Isabelle...

1149
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,263
Isabelle...

1150
01:16:27,492 --> 01:16:30,509
My son! What did you make me do?

1151
01:16:30,545 --> 01:16:33,509
Gabriel, my god... my son!

1152
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:35,982
Richard!

1153
01:16:41,172 --> 01:16:42,637
It wasn't me!

1154
01:16:45,631 --> 01:16:48,473
That creature... made me pull the trigger.

1155
01:16:48,907 --> 01:16:52,025
You've unleashed the Devil into this world!

1156
01:16:52,331 --> 01:16:54,785
And we all are going to burn!

1157
01:17:09,049 --> 01:17:09,895
Richard!

1158
01:18:24,088 --> 01:18:25,426
Where are you?

1159
01:18:30,932 --> 01:18:32,177
Where are you?

1160
01:18:32,331 --> 01:18:33,803
Let's get everyone back in their rooms.

1161
01:18:33,864 --> 01:18:36,451
We're gonna need a full head count before the next round of medications.

1162
01:18:37,449 --> 01:18:38,809
Where are you?

1163
01:18:39,818 --> 01:18:42,226
I did what you wanted, right?

1164
01:18:43,517 --> 01:18:44,738
Talk to me.

1165
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:46,591
Come on, Tess.

1166
01:18:47,706 --> 01:18:50,020
We all could use a little rest.

1167
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:52,614
But they lied to me.

1168
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:56,503
Or did I lie to you?

1169
01:19:05,401 --> 01:19:07,972
Well, somehow I wanted more.

1170
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,438
I don't know what I expected.

1171
01:19:10,873 --> 01:19:12,305
Another ball of light,

1172
01:19:12,364 --> 01:19:14,290
a booming voice from the sky... something.

1173
01:19:15,869 --> 01:19:17,243
Could we have built it wrong?

1174
01:19:17,865 --> 01:19:18,734
Maybe.

1175
01:19:19,427 --> 01:19:20,730
All I know is that

1176
01:19:20,754 --> 01:19:24,910
I don't feel like picking up a hammer anymore,
and 10 minutes ago,

1177
01:19:25,045 --> 01:19:26,840
that was all I could think of.

1178
01:19:28,266 --> 01:19:29,429
- Yeah...
- Alright.

1179
01:19:31,784 --> 01:19:34,978
NORAD said the pulse dissipated
before it left the atmosphere.

1180
01:19:35,823 --> 01:19:38,594
Could be all this sound and fury
was for absolutely nothing.

1181
01:19:40,929 --> 01:19:44,545
Now, our first priority is to help the hospital
personnel restore order here.

1182
01:19:44,569 --> 01:19:48,641
Okay? And then I want all of you who were infected
with this thing to be checked out by NTAC medical.

1183
01:19:48,664 --> 01:19:50,719
You including me in that order?
Because I'm not sure...

1184
01:19:50,742 --> 01:19:52,140
You were infected,

1185
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,357
because if you're standing here telling me you weren't,

1186
01:19:54,397 --> 01:19:56,845
I'm putting a date on that letter of resignation.

1187
01:19:59,219 --> 01:20:01,285
I was definitely infected.

1188
01:20:02,119 --> 01:20:03,246
I thought so.

1189
01:20:03,269 --> 01:20:05,665
We could use a little help policing the area here,

1190
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:09,702
and we need to get rid of these tools
before one of the patients hurts themselves.

1191
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:11,041
You heard the man.

1192
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:13,377
Excuse me. Dr. Clayton?

1193
01:20:17,933 --> 01:20:18,778
Kevin...

1194
01:20:19,964 --> 01:20:21,530
Did you just speak to me?

1195
01:20:23,244 --> 01:20:24,372
I guess I did.

1196
01:20:26,074 --> 01:20:27,213
I haven't

1197
01:20:27,812 --> 01:20:30,923
said anything for a long time, have I?

1198
01:20:32,852 --> 01:20:34,449
Try six years.

1199
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:44,856
I can think again too.

1200
01:20:46,594 --> 01:20:47,897
I don't know what happened...

1201
01:20:49,013 --> 01:20:49,823
... but...

1202
01:20:50,915 --> 01:20:52,324
... I feel...

1203
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:55,204
... better.

1204
01:21:06,961 --> 01:21:08,381
You had me followed?

1205
01:21:08,722 --> 01:21:10,788
I could have had your conversation recorded.

1206
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,855
I just thought that might be pushing it.

1207
01:21:12,878 --> 01:21:15,730
God, Kyle's right.
I am some kind of prisoner.

1208
01:21:15,965 --> 01:21:19,394
Shawn, I've told you,
you can leave here anytime you want,

1209
01:21:19,429 --> 01:21:20,685
and I meant it,

1210
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,599
but until you do,

1211
01:21:22,866 --> 01:21:26,823
I will not allow these shadows from your past
to alter your perceptions

1212
01:21:26,859 --> 01:21:29,759
of what it is we're trying to accomplish here.
You're too important.

1213
01:21:29,794 --> 01:21:34,061
No, no, you mean you need me
to help bring in the big checks.

1214
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:36,304
Shawn, the money...

1215
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,547
... is a means to an end.

1216
01:21:39,286 --> 01:21:41,247
The goal is what matters.

1217
01:21:41,494 --> 01:21:43,408
Ensure the future.
Save...

1218
01:21:43,437 --> 01:21:44,459
... the planet.

1219
01:21:46,209 --> 01:21:48,463
I can't do that without you.

1220
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:58,879
You want proof the future works in mysterious ways?

1221
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,899
Look no further than Mr. Kevin Burkhoff.

1222
01:22:00,934 --> 01:22:03,271
Yeah, instead of contacting the future,
we got him.

1223
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,094
Well, not as disappointing as it might seem at first blush.

1224
01:22:06,123 --> 01:22:09,709
Burkhoff was a tenured professor of neurochemistry at Stanford university.

1225
01:22:09,748 --> 01:22:12,907
Neuroscience.
Only class I ever got a "b" in.

1226
01:22:13,459 --> 01:22:15,173
Yeah, you're not alone.

1227
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:18,663
Only a handful of people work at the top of the field at any given time.

1228
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:21,057
Our Mr. Burkhoff was the heir apparent,

1229
01:22:21,638 --> 01:22:24,366
until he suffered his first delusion at the age of 30,

1230
01:22:24,424 --> 01:22:26,139
and he was institutionalized two years later.

1231
01:22:26,169 --> 01:22:27,438
What was he working on?

1232
01:22:27,642 --> 01:22:29,004
You want a ripple effect?

1233
01:22:29,162 --> 01:22:30,209
How's this...

1234
01:22:30,393 --> 01:22:31,372
Burkhoff

1235
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:34,202
specialized in dormant neural pathways.

1236
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:39,672
He was trying to wake up parts of the brain
that we can't use.

1237
01:22:41,151 --> 01:22:42,666
Parts that would do what?

1238
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,703
Well, parts that could lead to all kinds of special new abilities,
like...

1239
01:22:46,738 --> 01:22:48,464
... precognition.
Right, Marco?

1240
01:22:48,488 --> 01:22:51,176
Precognition, Telekinesis...

1241
01:22:51,374 --> 01:22:52,865
Stop me if any of this sounds familiar.

1242
01:22:52,888 --> 01:22:55,460
Maia Rutledge.
Orson Bailey.

1243
01:22:55,507 --> 01:22:59,182
You're saying that Burkhoff is the father of the 4400 technology?

1244
01:22:59,626 --> 01:23:00,917
It's possible.

1245
01:23:00,953 --> 01:23:02,362
And we just woke him up.

1246
01:24:53,599 --> 01:24:56,252
Miss Usher, next door, is getting a kitten.

1247
01:24:56,288 --> 01:24:59,258
Hope she'll let me play despite the fact there's going to be a book about how we all...

1248
01:24:59,293 --> 01:25:01,383
... me and Diana get to be a real family...

1249
01:25:01,407 --> 01:25:02,645
... a computer for Christmas...

1250
01:25:07,886 --> 01:25:11,183
... mommy's bosses...

1251
01:25:11,216 --> 01:25:14,771
Mommy's bosses will be punish for betraying us.

1252
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:18,881
Mommy's bosses will be punish for betraying us.
