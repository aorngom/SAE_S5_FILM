1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,499
previously on the 4400...

2
00:00:03,467 --> 00:00:04,838
We're not sure what's just happened.

3
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:05,676
The light is gone.

4
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:07,941
and thousands of people
have just suddenly appeared.

5
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:10,181
Some of them have been missing over 60 years.

6
00:00:10,182 --> 00:00:12,491
None of them have any memory
of what happened to them.

7
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:13,457
I saw your brother.

8
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:15,326
Shawn?

9
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:17,755
You know those visions that maia used to have.

10
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:20,519
It turns out she was only
pretending that they stopped.

11
00:00:20,569 --> 00:00:21,904
Don't give me that look, tom.

12
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:24,467
You kept shawn's ability to yourself for quite some time.

13
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:27,837
I've cured emphysema, leukemia...

14
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:29,800
I don't get why these attacks keep coming back.

15
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:31,239
That baby really kicked your ass.

16
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:32,689
Heidi, it's mommy.

17
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:33,852
Who?

18
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:35,274
I have another family now, and I'm sorry.

19
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:37,128
I know that's not fair to you, but...

20
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:38,975
brian, I am still part of your life.

21
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:40,536
If you're losing chunks of time,

22
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,259
you should talk to your dad about it.

23
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,706
You told me everything that happened that night, right?

24
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:45,394
Yeah.

25
00:00:57,717 --> 00:00:59,157
It's okay, it's okay.

26
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:00,162
Jordan.

27
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:17,016
You don't have to keep vigil, shawn.

28
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:19,419
Are you going to cancel the appearance at riverfront park?

29
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,863
No. That would be a mistake.

30
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:22,217
They're not just honoring me.

31
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:25,276
They're honoring the center and all the work we've done.

32
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:30,338
- A new neurological clinic just opened in atlanta.
- No, look, look.

33
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:33,508
I've been to all the specialists, shawn.

34
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:35,246
There's no name for what I have.

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,741
We can't just give up.

36
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:39,268
There's got to be a way to
figure out what that baby did to you.

37
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,822
I know what that baby did to me.

38
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:41,944
It saved my life.

39
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:43,540
What?

40
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:44,707
What are you talking about?

41
00:01:44,982 --> 00:01:48,233
When I touched lily's pregnant
belly and was hit with that pain

42
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,963
I realized I'd been judged and found wanting.

43
00:01:50,964 --> 00:01:54,343
- By a baby that wasn't even born yet?
- In that moment...

44
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,101
I was forced to see the truth about myself,

45
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:01,704
about my motives toward the 4400,

46
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,497
and they were...not pure.

47
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:06,226
That baby tried to kill you.

48
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:07,883
And it succeeded.

49
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,686
It killed the old jordan collier,

50
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,232
and I was reborn,

51
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,488
pure of purpose.

52
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:18,922
All I've done since,

53
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:20,125
everything I've built,

54
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:21,419
I owe to richard,

55
00:02:22,124 --> 00:02:26,202
to lily... and to that child.

56
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:31,495
I'll get it.

57
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:40,366
- Hey.
-  Hi.

58
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:42,784
Come in. Lily...

59
00:02:43,593 --> 00:02:44,516
look who's here.

60
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:47,877
We would have called,

61
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:49,655
but heidi wanted to surprise you.

62
00:02:51,078 --> 00:02:51,842
Heidi...

63
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:53,280
hi, mom.

64
00:02:54,444 --> 00:02:55,604
She's so cute.

65
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,252
Now that you guys are living on the block,

66
00:02:57,516 --> 00:02:59,743
I figured it was time for heidi to meet her real mom.

67
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:02,006
That makes you my second dad.

68
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:03,654
I guess so.

69
00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:05,818
Mom, why are you crying?

70
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,114
Lily, are you all right?

71
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:09,112
- Lily?
- Lily?

72
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:12,700
Lily?

73
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:15,604
Lily?

74
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:17,746
sweetheart, wake up.

75
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:25,025
It was a dream...

76
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:26,499
more like a nightmare.

77
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:29,161
No, no.

78
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:32,110
We were living next door to heidi and brian,

79
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,704
and we were all getting along.
And the house...

80
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,758
richard, it was so pretty.

81
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:38,013
So why were you crying?

82
00:03:41,017 --> 00:03:42,499
I guess I knew it wasn't real.

83
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:49,093
How long can we keep going
before someone catches up to us?

84
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,937
We just got to keep moving,

85
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,038
stay ahead of collier and ntac.

86
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,845
I'm just so tired of running.

87
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,070
We're going to find a place to stop running.

88
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:02,030
It's out there...

89
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:03,247
got to be.

90
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:52,994
That's good.

91
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:54,016
You've come so far.

92
00:04:58,143 --> 00:04:59,631
Nice use of color.

93
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,650
It's shaping up, greg,

94
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:09,988
but I think it could use some work.

95
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:13,236
That's as good as it gets.

96
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:26,357
Don't waste your time.

97
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:42,229
Ms. Tobey,

98
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:44,377
would you come with us, please?

99
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,004
Harmon.

100
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:49,156
Harmon...

101
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,979
sam...

102
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,386
what's this all about?

103
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:54,838
Ms. Tobey,  I'm placing you under arrest.

104
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:55,991
Arrest?

105
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:57,648
For what?

106
00:05:57,905 --> 00:05:58,803
Child abuse.

107
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:00,910
Oh, my god. What...

108
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:24,434
<i>So long ago, another life</i>

109
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:28,422
<i>I can feel your heart beat</i>

110
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:33,760
<i>it's not a dream remember us</i>

111
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:38,016
<i>I can see it in your eyes</i>

112
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:41,528
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>

113
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:46,156
<i>our place in time beyond the sun</i>

114
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:51,061
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>

115
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:56,127
<i>our place in time to call our own</i>

116
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,500
Look

117
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,200
I know his birth certificate says the kid's 21.

118
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,500
but emotionally kyle is still a teenager.

119
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,100
I've got to accept the fact that he's gonna screw up like a teenager.

120
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,600
He'll learn from his mistakes.

121
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,800
get it out of his system.

122
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,000
but shawn--

123
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,100
it's been a year.

124
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,000
How could he cut us out like that?

125
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,400
And danny.he's eating himself up inside.

126
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,100
He used to be such a sweet boy.

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,500
Yeah.I remember what pop used to say--

128
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,700
"you think you've got problems?

129
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,100
Wait till you become a parent.

130
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,800
Little did we know.

131
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,200
Yeah.

132
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,500
What do you want to bet they're talking about us downstairs?

133
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,400
That's what they live for.

134
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,600
If they didn't have us to worry about.they'd die of boredom.

135
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,600
I've seen you around campus.

136
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,200
I saw you too.

137
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,200
Why didn't you say something?

138
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,900
It's been.like. four years.

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,900
I mean.what was I supposed to say.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,500
"welcome back from coma world"?

141
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
I don't know.I guess

142
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
seeing you reminded me of shawn.

143
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,800
You two were always so tight.

144
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
And you were like our shadow--

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,300
"where you going?Can I come too?"

146
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,800
I thought you guys were so cool.

147
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,200
I was 14.What did I know?

148
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,200
Mom says you talked to him?

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,500
I don't think he heard me.

150
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,200
You know.

151
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,700
I used to blame shawn for everything--

152
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
stealing nikki.

153
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,500
running out on us the way he did.

154
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
breaking mom's heart.

155
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
But it wasn't his fault.

156
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,900
And the bastards who took him sent him back a freak.

157
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,700
They're the ones.

158
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,500
Guess they screwed us all up.

159
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,900
Well.I want to thank councilman lowe on behalf of the 4400 center for this wonderful honor.

160
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,400
In funding this cleanup project.

161
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:22,100
I wanted to pay tribute not only to the glories of the past but to the promise of the future.

162
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:24,200
I believe that the actions we take.

163
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,400
the choices we make

164
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,400
will create the kind of future that we and our children and their children will live in.

165
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,200
Thank you.

166
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,800
Hey.

167
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,500
Hey!

168
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,400
What?

169
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,900
Get your hands off of me.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,400
What do you want to do.break it?

171
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,004
Stop it!

172
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,000
Hey! What's the deal?

173
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,200
These people don't belong here.

174
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,100
No.you're the ones who don't belong here.

175
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,600
This used to be our home until you scumbags decided to make everything beautiful and kicked us out.

176
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,600
It's okay.You can let 'em go.

177
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,200
They were stealing food.

178
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,200
Well.last time I checked.the food was free.

179
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,200
Don't make me pull rank.

180
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Come on.

181
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,300
Yes.sir.mr.Farrell.

182
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,010
Thank you.

183
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,200
Big shot.huh?

184
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,900
I'm impressed.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
I'm really sorry that we trashed your home.

186
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,600
I am.

187
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,000
You should be.

188
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,400
It's a hell of a lot warmer here than crashing near I-90 bridge.

189
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,600
Food's still free.right?

190
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,800
Yes.Absolutely.

191
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,100
Please be my guest.

192
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah.we will.

193
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,800
Protect the future.huh?

194
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,300
Got to have one first.

195
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,400
Even on the map.fairview seems far away.

196
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,700
That's four hours tops.

197
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,900
This is my first time spending the night away from maia.

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,800
Isn't your sister with her?

199
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,100
The one with all the tattoos?

200
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,700
Sorry.

201
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,700
Those beer kegs kyle ordered should be showing up right about now.

202
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,900
Yeah.You read these charges?

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,800
"Teacher is accused of reckless endangerment.

204
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,800
placing her students' health.welfare.and safety at risk.

205
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,500
" Could that be any more vague?

206
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,200
Well.that could be anything from grabbing them on the arms to touching them on the privates.

207
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,100
Or maybe she did nothing.

208
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,600
Yeah."Nothing" would be my vote.

209
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,200
A 4400 serial killer was bad enough.

210
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,000
but a 4400 child molester?

211
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,100
You're damn right we don't want her back!

212
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,400
Not now.not ever.

213
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Look.

214
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,300
I don't know what's going to happen with ms.Tobey.

215
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,200
She's out on bail.right?

216
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,600
That's right.

217
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,695
And her bond was paid by
parents from this school.

218
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah.and if they're not worried about their kids.

219
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
then we'll worry for them.

220
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,600
Ask sal here.He'll tell you.

221
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,700
His kid was abused.

222
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,700
same as melinda and teddy.

223
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,100
What about your child.mr...

224
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,300
Venner.Frank venner.

225
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,200
It's not like she didn't try with my boy.

226
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,100
Greg just happened to be one of the lucky ones.

227
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,900
Tried what?

228
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,100
Now.who the hell are you two?

229
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,900
I'm agent skouris.This is agent baldwin.

230
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,200
We're with ntac.

231
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,000
Great.

232
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,000
You got here just in time.

233
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,300
Yeah.Cops let her go.

234
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,000
You can take her to quarantine or stick her back in jail.

235
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,900
She hasn't been found guilty of anything yet.

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,400
She's a 4400.isn't she?

237
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,800
She should never have been allowed back in this school in the first place.

238
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,800
According to the preliminary exams.

239
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,100
none of the kids showed any signs of abuse.

240
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,900
No marks.no bruises?

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
No physical signs.at any rate.

242
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,800
So what are we talking about? Some kind of mental abuse?

243
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,400
Personally.I'm not convinced it's abuse at all.

244
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,000
but there's no denying that some of her students have been changed.

245
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,900
Changed?

246
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,700
In what way?

247
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,300
That was beautiful.

248
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,600
I guess.

249
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,500
You're telling me two weeks ago you'd never played a violin.

250
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Never even touched one.

251
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,300
Hey. I only took this class 'cause
art appreciation's supposed to be a guaranteed "A.

252
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,300
You're supposed to learn about dead painters and stuff.

253
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,600
It's so cool.

254
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,600
I look at a bunch of clay.

255
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,000
I see the figure I want to mold.

256
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,200
I just carve away the pieces
I don't need and there it is.

257
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,200
You should see the way she stares at you.

258
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,700
It's like she's drilling a hole.

259
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,500
trying to get in there and rearrange your brain.

260
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,700
One minute. she was touching my shoulder.

261
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,500
The next thing I remember.she was handing me a violin.

262
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,100
And I'm standing there wondering what the
hell am I doing with a paintbrush in my hand.

263
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,300
And then I see this block of clay.

264
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,800
and it was like.

265
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,400
"where have you been all my life?

266
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,400
" My dad's big dream was to get me a football scholarship.

267
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,400
It used to be my dream.too.

268
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,500
But this painting stuff.

269
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,400
I'm really into it now.

270
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,400
Ms.Tobey's the best teacher I ever had in my life.

271
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,000
My dad says these kids may seem normal now.

272
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,500
but in.like.two years.

273
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,700
they might develop brain tumors.go blind.crazy.

274
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,100
who knows?

275
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,600
You guys should throw her back in jail.

276
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,700
Your dad.

277
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,500
he wouldn't be frank venner.by any chance.would he?

278
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,200
How'd you know?

279
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,100
Oh.just...

280
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,500
a wild guess.

281
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,300
Hurt my students?

282
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,800
That's so ridiculous.

283
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,300
Well.it's not ridiculous to these parents.

284
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,800
People get scared when they don't recognize their kids.

285
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,300
But they're still the same kids.

286
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,900
I just find what's already inside them and help bring it out.

287
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
How do you do that?

288
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,500
I study them.

289
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,741
Sometimes.

290
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:17,361
there's a light in their eyes.

291
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,800
like a tiny flame.

292
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,200
and while I'm watching.

293
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,200
it gets brighter.

294
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,400
That's when I know there's something in them.

295
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,100
something beautiful.

296
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,312
So this light.have you seen it in anyone else?

297
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,000
It doesn't seem to work with grownups.

298
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,600
It doesn't work with every kid.either.

299
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,000
like this one boy.greg venner.

300
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,200
I keep looking.

301
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,500
but so far...

302
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,000
I think his father's pretty adamant that you stop looking.

303
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,900
Frank?

304
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,300
I taught frank.

305
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,400
He was one of my first students back in '72.

306
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
The fact is.

307
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,900
I probably taught half the parents who are out to get me.

308
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,100
This is crazy.

309
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,400
I-- I haven't done anything wrong.

310
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,600
I need to get back to my kids.

311
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,800
The people who took me.

312
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,800
it can't be an accident they gave me this wonderful gift.

313
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,100
That's why they sent me back.

314
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,400
to use it.

315
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,500
Tyler?

316
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,200
Richard tyler?

317
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,600
Richard tyler.

318
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,000
Yes.I'm richard tyler.

319
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,200
as wind carved the lung feel like 10 hours
WHAT've WE GOT SHOW FOR IT?

320
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,700
less than 20 bucks

321
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,000
what we ganna do?

322
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,200
gotta make it lived

323
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,600
who's got this 

324
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,300
no one  friends treat

325
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,500
Hey.shawn.

326
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,500
look who showed.

327
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,500
I was in the mood for pizza.

328
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,900
I didn't feel like eating alone.

329
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,500
so。。。

330
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,900
my very own fairy godfather.

331
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,100
Or are you just some rich boy looking to rent some down-and-dirty for the night?

332
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,500
I'm not here for that.

333
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,000
What's the matter? Am I not good enough for you?

334
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,600
Maybe I'm not good enough for you.

335
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
I can get behind that.

336
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,600
Yo.wayne.Pepperoni.

337
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,200
You going to stand there and watch.

338
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,400
or you going to sit down and eat?

339
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,300
Hello?

340
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,800
Brian.

341
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,400
It's me.lily.

342
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,900
Lily.where are you?

343
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,400
You know.ntac's been calling me all summer trying to find you.

344
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,600
Brian.look.

345
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,200
I need your help.

346
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,900
Richard。。。he's been arrested.

347
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,500
ou're a lawyer.

348
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,800
I need you to call the sheriff's office in weldon.idaho.

349
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
See what you can find out.

350
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,200
Well.I don't know what I can do for the guy.

351
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,400
I'm not a criminal lawyer.

352
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,900
Brian.if you don't want to help--

353
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,300
I swear to god.lily.

354
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,700
you disappear for over a year.

355
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,800
and then you call me up with these stories about the police arresting your boyfriend--

356
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:14,100
richard's my husband.

357
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,000
We have a child.

358
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,500
a six-month-old girl.

359
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,200
How's heidi?

360
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,600
She's good.

361
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,300
Started seventh grade and。。。

362
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,600
aced her first semester.

363
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,700
That's wonderful.

364
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,800
Brian.

365
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
I'm sorry to be bothering you with this.

366
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,500
but I have nowhere else to turn.

367
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,600
Okay.I'll make a few calls and do whatever I can.

368
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,800
I got to admit.

369
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,200
the first time mike came home with that violin and started playing.

370
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,500
his mom and me.we were both a little spooked.

371
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,300
So why did you help pay heather's bail?

372
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,900
I would've paid the whole thing if I could've afforded it.

373
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,700
My wife.she shot a video of mike playing.

374
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,600
sent it over to the conservatory.

375
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,300
Next day.they called back.

376
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,700
said our son was a prodigy.

377
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,600
Did you tell them he'd been playing for only two weeks?

378
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,500
Well.they thought I was putting them on.

379
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,600
talked about how his playing was worthy of a scholarship.

380
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,000
You know.I thought this kid was going to wind up working on the assembly line like his old man.

381
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,900
Now he's got a way out.

382
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Hmm.

383
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,500
Ms.Tobey's at ntac today for a physical.

384
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,400
We're asking the parents of the students she's "gifted" to come in to be interviewed.

385
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,400
No problem.I'll call his mom.

386
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,300
We'll do anything we need to to get heather back in that classroom.

387
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,500
Great.

388
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,400
Thanks.

389
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,600
You should've seen them chowing down on the pizza.

390
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,400
Just getting enough to eat.

391
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,800
you konw it's such a struggle.

392
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,500
And you made that struggle a little easier.

393
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,400
I'm proud of you.shawn.

394
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,800
I'm thinking about going back down there.

395
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,300
There's so much they need--jackets.sleeping bags.

396
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,400
maybe a couple of first aid kits.

397
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,600
Basic stuff to survive.you know.

398
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,500
You give them all the supplies they need.

399
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,800
- All right.
- But look.

400
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,600
whatever you do.shawn.

401
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,700
don't reveal your healing ability.

402
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,400
Why?

403
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,900
'Cause they can't pay? No.

404
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,600
because if you heal one of them.

405
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,900
you'll have to heal them all.

406
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,500
I mean it.

407
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,300
Not even you can do that.

408
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,100
Yeah.

409
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,100
I'm listening.

410
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,400
When was this?

411
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,000
Sweet.

412
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,600
I'm a little rusty.

413
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,200
One of these days.I'm going to write a concept album

414
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,700
about my time on the street.

415
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,500
Oh.

416
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,800
I'm gonna win a grammy.

417
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,500
make the bling-bling.

418
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,300
you know.and get a private jet.

419
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,900
one of those big old gated houses with enough room for wayne.kimmy.and shadow.

420
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,100
Sounds like a plan.

421
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,600
Yeah. It matches your eyes.sweetie.

422
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,000
Hey.

423
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,300
First time in months I haven't seen him shivering.

424
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,800
It's amazing what a warm coat'll do.

425
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,600
You got yourself that guitar. huh?

426
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,900
No.Actually.you know what?

427
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,900
I got you a guitar.

428
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,100
What's the matter. baby girl?

429
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,800
You act like you never had a present before.

430
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,900
It's been a while.

431
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,600
You touch this.you die.

432
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,600
- "Touch it.you die?"
- I guess so.

433
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,500
What does that mean?

434
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,000
I hate lines.Hate waiting in 'em.

435
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,300
Trust me.there'll be no waiting tonight.

436
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,200
I been to this club plenty of times.

437
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,600
I know the bouncer.He'll let us walk right in.

438
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,100
I hope you're right.

439
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,600
I hate waiting in lines.

440
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,700
Hey.that book you're reading is nothing but lies.

441
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,600
Excuse me.

442
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,100
I'm talking to you.

443
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,300
That trash is going to rot your mind.

444
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,300
Danny.What's going on?

445
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,900
She ought to be careful.

446
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,500
That book's a load of bull.

447
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,800
- I bought it for her.
- Yeah?

448
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,000
Big mistake.

449
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,900
Anyone ask your opinion?

450
00:22:56,901 --> 00:22:58,300
Danny.come on.man.

451
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,100
Just watch my back.okay?

452
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,100
Listen. pal.

453
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,900
Let me tell you a little something about cults.

454
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,600
What's going on?

455
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,600
You letting me go?

456
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,600
Hello.richard.

457
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,200
What's with the dopey grin?

458
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,600
Nothing.Just the way that you...

459
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,700
you bite on your tongue when you're trying to concentrate.

460
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,300
I've been doing that since I was a kid.

461
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,700
How long have you been in seattle?

462
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,900
Two years.

463
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,300
Left my mom and her new boyfriend

464
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,900
and came out here for the music.

465
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,900
Somehow.my life took a weird turn.

466
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,100
I've had a few of those myself.

467
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,600
What.you run away from home too?

468
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,300
Um...

469
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,000
sort of.

470
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,500
except I lucked out.I found a place to run to.

471
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,200
Otherwise--

472
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,400
you would have wound up like the rest of us rejects?

473
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,200
Something like that.

474
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,800
You're one of those 4400 guys.huh?

475
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,300
Can you make my eyes turn green?

476
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,800
What.you able to walk on water?

477
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,900
I like your eyes the way that they are.

478
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,100
and I can barely swim.

479
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,100
Come on.now.

480
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,000
What the hell is this?

481
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,000
Dewey...

482
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,500
I see you been keeping busy.

483
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,100
No.baby.

484
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:50,700
he's just some guy--

485
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,600
bought us some food and blankets.

486
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,000
Liv.who is this guy?

487
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,200
Shawn.you got to go.

488
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,900
I'd listen to her.

489
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,000
What are you doing?

490
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,200
Well.see.she does whatever I tell her to do.

491
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Do you have a problem with that?

492
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,000
Yeah.

493
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,800
Yeah.I do.

494
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,900
Shawn.please.

495
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You've done your good deed.Just...

496
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,600
just go home.okay?Please.

497
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,600
Come with me.

498
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,800
Come with me.

499
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,900
And then what?

500
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,300
What.you gonna rescue me?

501
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,000
I don't want to be saved.

502
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,200
Get the hell out of here.

503
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,100
Go.I mean it.

504
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,000
Go!

505
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,500
Hey.

506
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,300
You're not going back to that school.

507
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,900
not till that woman is gone.

508
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,800
But what about my other classes?

509
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,200
I've got homework.

510
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,900
Since when do you care about school?

511
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,200
You want me to wind up like you?

512
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,300
Hey.you watch your mouth.

513
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't want to fall behind.

514
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,400
"Fall behind"?

515
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,200
With the grades you've been bringing home?

516
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,900
You been behind since your first report card.

517
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,500
What.you just going to sit there.

518
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,900
or are you going to talk to me?

519
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,600
'Cause I really think you owe me an explanation.

520
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,200
You know.those guys wanted to kill me.

521
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,400
and I turn around.

522
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,700
and my cousin's nowhere in sight.

523
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
I don't know what happened.

524
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:25,200
Yeah.I know what happened--you ran out on me.

525
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,800
It's a good thing that security guard was there.

526
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,200
The other time.I could blame it on the beer.

527
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,100
You drink too much.

528
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:29,900
you can black out.right?

529
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,500
But today.I didn't drink anything.

530
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I'm blacking out.

531
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,000
losing chunks of time.

532
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,200
It's like they did something to my wiring.

533
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,800
They?

534
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,300
Kyle.who are you talking about?

535
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,200
The same ones who took shawn.

536
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
who put me in the coma.

537
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,800
They left me messed up inside.

538
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,500
Hey.man.you're scaring me.

539
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,800
How do you think I feel?

540
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,000
Brian.

541
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,800
Any news?

542
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,400
Yeah.I got ahold of the weldon authorities.

543
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
and richard's been released from custody.

544
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,700
Oh.thank god.

545
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,100
When?

546
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,400
about an hour ago.

547
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,700
Why hasn't he called?

548
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,600
You sure you don't want to call lily.

549
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,900
let her know you're all right?

550
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,000
Am I?

551
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,900
You're in no danger from me.richard.

552
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,200
All I want is to make you an offer.

553
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,200
If it's not to your liking.

554
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,500
you can walk out of here.

555
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,300
You'll never see me again.

556
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,500
How much did you pay those cops to call you instead of ntac to get my picture into their hands?

557
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:47,000
It's my money.richard.

558
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,000
Look.

559
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,700
you said I was free to go after I heard your offer.

560
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
If you got one for me.

561
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,400
make it.

562
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,400
I want you to come home.

563
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,900
you and your family.

564
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,600
to the 4400 center.

565
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,800
I don't think so.

566
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,700
you said you read my book.

567
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,000
which means you know why we were taken and what we're meant to do.

568
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,900
The future...

569
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,600
The future rests in our hands.richard.

570
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,900
You.me.lily-- we are the chosen ones.

571
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,900
Come on.jordan.

572
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,600
we both know this has nothing to do with me or lily.

573
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,200
This is all about isabelle.

574
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,900
Isabelle.

575
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,200
Well.that's a lovely name.

576
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,200
For once.

577
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300
why don't you say what you really want--

578
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,100
to take her from us.control her.

579
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Your daughter is the future.

580
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,900
I believed that then.I believe it now.

581
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Then what's changed?

582
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,200
I have.

583
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,800
I'll need more than your word.

584
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,400
Of course.

585
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Bring me to isabelle.

586
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,400
Let her judge me.

587
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,700
Isabelle's not coming anywhere near you.

588
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,200
What are you afraid of.richard?

589
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,800
I'm the one at risk.

590
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,600
I'm still suffering the after-effects of our last encounter.

591
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,900
Richard.it's simple.

592
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,600
If I'm lying.

593
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,500
if my motives are not pure.

594
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,100
isabelle will punish me accordingly.

595
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,300
and you'll be free of me once and for all.

596
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,400
But if I'm sincere.

597
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,900
if isabelle accepts me.

598
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,200
well.then.I can offer you and lily and the child a new life.

599
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,800
Stop running.richard.

600
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Forget it.

601
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,300
It's not going to happen.

602
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,200
There's no way I'm going to allow isabelle anywhere near that man.

603
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,000
But think about it.

604
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,300
If collier really has changed.

605
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,800
it means we can get off the road.stop running.

606
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,600
That's a big if.

607
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,200
He offered to act as a middleman between us and ntac.

608
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Says he can get them to back off.

609
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,300
And you believe him?

610
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
He's got lawyers.

611
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,900
a whole organization behind him.

612
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,100
We can barely even pay for gas.

613
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,900
He's lied to us before.

614
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,400
The man tried to destroy our relationship.

615
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,700
Okay.let's say he is lying.

616
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,200
Maybe all of this is some kind of trap...

617
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:23,800
to get his hands on our daughter.

618
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,200
He wants a face-to-face with isabelle?

619
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,900
I say we give it to him.

620
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,400
You've seen what she's capable of.

621
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,400
what she can do if she feels threatened.

622
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
It still feels like an awful big risk.

623
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:34,300
For collier.

624
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,200
Stand back.Let her through.

625
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,500
Get out of here!

626
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,500
Welcome back.heather.

627
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,100
I'm sorry about all of this.

628
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,900
Once the media loses interest.

629
00:32:00,901 --> 00:32:02,100
things will die down.

630
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,800
Until it does.

631
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:05,100
we need to discuss how you intend to handle security.

632
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Let me get heather situated.

633
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,800
then I'll meet you in my office.

634
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:11,300
- Come on.
- Don't get comfortable.freak! You're not staying!

635
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,200
I like this one with the smoke and the clouds--

636
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,300
Greg.

637
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,300
Does your father know you're here?

638
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,300
It's all your fault.

639
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,300
Everything was okay till you showed up.

640
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,700
Greg.

641
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,200
please put the gun down.

642
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,600
No.

643
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,000
You made me do this.

644
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,000
I have no choice.

645
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,400
Yes.you do.

646
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,600
but only if you put the gun away.

647
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,100
I can't be here anymore.My dad won't let me.

648
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:52,600
This is my last chance.

649
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:53,700
Greg.calm down--

650
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,100
no!

651
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,000
Not until you change me like you did them.

652
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,900
You have to!

653
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
there's nothing to discuss.

654
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,900
I'll take anything.

655
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,900
Violin.

656
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,700
painting.

657
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,100
photography.I don't care!

658
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,100
Listen.greg.

659
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,000
You're problem is with me.

660
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,000
not your classmates.

661
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,200
Let them go.

662
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,400
and you and i will deal with this alone.

663
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,900
Yeah.sure.

664
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,100
That works for me.

665
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,900
Okay.

666
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,200
I'd like you all to leave now.

667
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,700
quietly.don't run.

668
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:35,100
Ms.Tobey.will you be okay?

669
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,600
Move!

670
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,200
Go on.

671
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,300
For an entire week?

672
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,600
Is that really necessary?

673
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,600
To and from school.strictly as a precaution.

674
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,830
- A continued police presence will send a 
clear message to anyone who feels they can--
- Okay.

675
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,600
so now we're alone.

676
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,900
Now.do whatyou promised!

677
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
would you put the gun down.

678
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,800
- No!
- greg?

679
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,100
Please.put the gun down.

680
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,500
It scares me.

681
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,000
Well.good.

682
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:07,200
It's supposed to scare you!

683
00:34:07,201 --> 00:34:08,000
Greg...

684
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,700
D.A. Says we don't have a criminal case.

685
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,200
fine.We'll take it to civil court.

686
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,900
- One way or another--
- excuse us.

687
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,100
Hey.buddy.what's your problem?

688
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,000
You're needed inside.

689
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,600
I don't feel any different.

690
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,700
Greg.I'm trying.

691
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,500
Well.try harder.

692
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,300
You found it in mike.in rita...

693
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,000
you can find it in me!

694
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,900
I told you.

695
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,300
I told you she was dangerous.

696
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,100
None of you would listen.

697
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,500
She's not the one holding the gun.

698
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:36,300
Greg is a kid.

699
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,100
He doesn't know what he's doing.

700
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
She's got his mind all twisted.

701
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,400
I got news for you.

702
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,900
I knew everything I needed to know the first time I talked to greg.

703
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,900
You're the one who twisted his mind.

704
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
- You put that gun in his hand.
- That is not true.

705
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,200
We both know it's true...

706
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,200
and now you're the only one who's going to get your son out of this alive.

707
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,800
Good.

708
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,700
Whatever talents they have were there to begin with.

709
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,400
But we're only talking about a handful of students.

710
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,200
You found it in them.

711
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
You can find it in me.

712
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,100
You have to.

713
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,500
before I wind up like him--

714
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
you know.my dad.

715
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,900
Is that what you're afraid of?

716
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,500
- You were worried she was going to damage your son?
- You know what my dad's like.

717
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,900
He's nothing.

718
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,100
He's a big.angry nothing.

719
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,800
and that's exactly what he wants me to be.

720
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,100
and I can't let that happen.

721
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,300
Now.goddamn it.do something!

722
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,500
It's no good.is it?

723
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,300
There's nothing there.

724
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,700
I'm sorry.Greg.

725
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,100
not everybody's meant to be an artist or a musician.

726
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
You'll find a place.

727
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,100
Sure I will.

728
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,900
I have a talent for failure.just like him.

729
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,700
You don't have to become like your father.

730
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,300
Somewhere along the line.he made a choice.

731
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,000
You can make a different one.

732
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,000
a better one.

733
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,700
She's right.greg.

734
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,500
Dad?

735
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,500
The mistakes I made...

736
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,000
they're mine.

737
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,000
They're not yours.

738
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,800
Just because I failed.

739
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,600
it doesn't mean that you have to.

740
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,200
Please put down the gun.greg.

741
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,500
Don't-- don't let my mistakes get you killed.

742
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,100
Yo.shawn!

743
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,200
You got to do something.man.

744
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,200
He's knocking the crap out of her.

745
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,200
What are you talking about?

746
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:00,600
Dewey sold that guitar you got liv.

747
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:02,700
Now he's all cranked up.screaming and whatnot.

748
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
She needs you.

749
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,700
Come on.Come on

750
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,000
A liv?

751
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,700
I begged him.

752
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:21,700
Told him he was taking too much!

753
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,000
Dude's dying.

754
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,000
No!

755
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,900
No!

756
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,500
No!

757
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,900
Jesus...

758
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,200
what did you do?

759
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,900
He brought him back.

760
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,800
What the hell happened?

761
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,600
What happened?

762
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,000
This guy just saved your life.

763
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,100
Thank you.

764
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,100
My leg...

765
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,900
please fix it.

766
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,900
I'm sorry,it doesn't work like that.

767
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,100
Why not? You helped him.

768
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,900
I...

769
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,600

770
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,000
No, I can'T.

771
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,000
I can't help everyone.I'm sorry.

772
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,000
Have mercy on us.

773
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm sorry.

774
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,000
I can't help everyone.

775
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,000
I can't help everyone.

776
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,100
I...

777
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,800
I can't help everyone!

778
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,600
No!They need you.

779
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,600
You sure about this?

780
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,400
Yeah, I'm sure.

781
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,700
Lily...

782
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,200
good to see you.

783
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,900
And this is isabelle.

784
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,000
Hi.

785
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,700
Yes.

786
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,900
Yes.

787
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,000
How's that?

788
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,200
Well, I guess that's it.

789
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,900
Good-bye fairview.

790
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,500
At least,this time,it's your call.

791
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,300
I'll find another town,

792
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,100
another school,

793
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,000
maybe work as a private tutor for a while.

794
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:01,000
I just have to figure out a way to use this gift of mine without causing so much pain.

795
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,600
Well, the world could always use a little more beauty.

796
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,600
I hope so.

797
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,100
Good luck.

798
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,000
Thanks.

799
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,200
You know,I was thinking of getting maia piano lessons.

800
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,500
Oh yeah?

801
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,900
I bet she'd like that.

802
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,700
Or maybe even study painting,

803
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,100
'cause she's always coloring.

804
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,700
I guess you could call that a ripple effect.

805
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,600
A positive one.
