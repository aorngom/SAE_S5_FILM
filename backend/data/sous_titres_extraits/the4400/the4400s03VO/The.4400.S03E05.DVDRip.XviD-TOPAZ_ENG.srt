1
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:42,302
We're not a threat, We're salvation,

2
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,568
The world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,109
Previously on The 4400:

4
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,272
I see you've been spending
a lot of time With ShaWn,

5
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,112
People see her, they see a woman.
A beautiful woman.

6
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,914
And they might forget that inside
she's just a little girl.

7
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,114
I'm glad she has you around
to be a friend,

8
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,383
You killed people.

9
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,390
That's not what we discussed
when you approached me.

10
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,722
We are in a war.
It's gonna cost money.

11
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,891
You sold us out.

12
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:11,026
I'm very disappointed in you, Shawn,
and I'm afraid I can't forgive you.

13
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,263
Diana Skouris,
your adoption of Maia Rutledge

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,637
is hereby complete,
legal, and binding,

15
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,300
Ms. Skouris, my name is Sarah.

16
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,706
I'm Maia's sister.

17
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,144
Do you see the future more clearly
since you stopped taking the inhibitor?

18
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,307
- Who are you?
- I'm Lindsey.

19
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,654
I'm a part of her collection.
We all are.

20
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,681
Tyler! Duncan!

21
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,523
You've been here
ever since you Walked

22
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,182
through the front door of my house,

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,622
You're in the future.

24
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,195
We had to bring you here, Maia,
you and your friends.

25
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,457
Before we put you back
in your new time,

26
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,123
we'll make you forget your mother.

27
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,496
Please, don't!

28
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,968
They'll forget you too,

29
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,546
Hey.

30
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,481
Marco, they're beautiful.

31
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,883
How did you know I like anemones?

32
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,081
You remember
that bad ltalian restaurant?

33
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,453
I asked you what your favorite
flower was, and you said:

34
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,390
Anemones.

35
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,223
Most guys don't even listen
to table talk.

36
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,422
You not only heard me,
you remembered.

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,329
Do you know how lucky
you're gonna get tonight?

38
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,062
Then my plan is working.

39
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,567
I thought it was just gonna be
the two of us.

40
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,176
It is.

41
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,905
Then who is the other plate for?

42
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,239
Di?

43
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,145
I don't know what I was thinking.

44
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,701
- Are you having fun?
- Of course, I'm having fun.

45
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,498
You sure you don't want
a turn at the wheel?

46
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,765
It's your fantasy.

47
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,431
Okay, honey. Hold on.

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,885
Look out!

49
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,054
- You all right?
- I think so.

50
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,296
- You saw her too, right?
- Of course, I did.

51
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,332
Why would a girl
be in the middle of the road?

52
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,528
- I have no idea.
- A joy ride in the country.

53
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,104
That's what we agreed on, right?

54
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,104
A great car, a deserted road.

55
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,039
Hitting some kid at 80 miles plus?
Where the hell does that come in?

56
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,873
What happened to her?!

57
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,345
Thomas.

58
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,119
Hey!

59
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,450
Hey. Hey.

60
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,591
Hey, what...? You...?

61
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,953
You okay?

62
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,731
Who was she?

63
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,372
I have no idea.

64
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,363
How many times
have we done this?

65
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,562
Gone away in one
of these fantasy worlds you create?

66
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,707
- A dozen times? Two dozen?
- At least.

67
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,638
And these worlds,
they always feel real.

68
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,644
Except this time, a girl without a face
appears out of nowhere.

69
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,940
It felt more like a nightmare.

70
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,016
But something like that was bound
to happen sooner or later.

71
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,415
I build these worlds
out of our memories.

72
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,488
I guess this time I dredged up
something incomplete.

73
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,820
A fragment of something.
A sort of mental hiccup.

74
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,155
Okay, but this girl?
Is she part of my memory or yours?

75
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,821
Yours, mine, both.
There's no way to know, is there?

76
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,990
One of us might have
seen her picture in a book,

77
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,635
or seen her in the street.

78
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,737
Yeah, we just
don't remember her face.

79
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,338
It might have just been a glimpse.

80
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,440
Yeah, well,

81
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,275
that glimpse pretty much
ruined our night.

82
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,679
Well, tomorrow night will be better.
I promise.

83
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,784
Anywhere you wanna go,
anywhere we wanna go,

84
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,944
- and anything we wanna do.
- You know, for his 1 2th birthday

85
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,023
I took Kyle fishing
up at the Dosewallips River.

86
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,353
I thought maybe the three
of us could go there.

87
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,119
That sounds great.

88
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,288
And maybe this time we could
actually catch some fish.

89
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,796
Okay.

90
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,897
I don't know what's wrong
with my bedroom.

91
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,870
Or yours for that matter.

92
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,608
We've already done it there
a bunch of times.

93
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,509
Experts say you should do
adventurous things

94
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,479
to keep relationships
more interesting.

95
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,447
They say that, huh?

96
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,912
What could be more adventurous
than a quickie in the staircase?

97
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,856
Did you switch
from Encyclopaedia Britannica

98
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,052
to Cosmo magazine or something?
What--?

99
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,822
Well, I read lots of stuff.

100
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,270
- I'll take the elevator.
- Devon.

101
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,804
How embarrassing for her.

102
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,443
Isabelle, just stop! Just...

103
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,250
What's the matter, Shawn?
What's wrong?

104
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,479
She's not gonna tell my father.

105
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,555
- She'd be too afraid of me.
- lsabelle.

106
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,090
She's gonna tell someone,
and then they'll tell someone else.

107
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,694
And then, everybody's gonna know.

108
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,535
Where's your partner?

109
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,106
Late.

110
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,371
A 4400, Christopher Dubov, was
attacked outside his home last night.

111
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,310
I wanna know if we're looking
at a hate crime.

112
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,040
It says he's a lawyer
at Teller and Dutch.

113
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,014
That's a major mergers
and acquisitions firm.

114
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,120
They've been all over
the financial pages this year.

115
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,256
Yeah, which makes him
a high profile 4400.

116
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,186
A target for somebody
looking to make a point.

117
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,723
No, it makes him a corporate raider

118
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,827
who's put a lot of people
in the unemployment line.

119
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,123
His 4400 status isn't the only motive
someone might have to attack him.

120
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,132
Just talk to him.
See if he can write you up a list.

121
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,863
- Oh, alarm clock need new batteries?
- No, it's a crappy morning.

122
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,698
Are you opening up a newsstand?

123
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,471
No. Just a project
that I'm working on.

124
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,704
So, what do we got?

125
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,911
Yeah, you could call it a hate crime.

126
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,014
My son, Michael, certainly hates me.

127
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,779
Your son did this to you, Mr. Dubov?

128
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,253
His mom and I split up.

129
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,686
He blames me.

130
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,919
I'm the one who introduced her to Bob,
her new husband.

131
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,524
I knew they belonged together.
I could smell it.

132
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,791
- I'm not sure I follow.
- It's my ability.

133
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,527
It showed up once I stopped taking
the promicin inhibitor.

134
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,432
I can smell pheromones.

135
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,073
You mean the stuff people put out
to attract other people?

136
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,903
- Weird, huh?
- Things between my wife and l

137
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,544
haven't been too good for a while.

138
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,340
Then I met Bob.
He's my new dentist.

139
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,313
Right away, there was
something familiar about him.

140
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:42,250
Then I realized what it was.
He smelled just like Caroline.

141
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,785
So I made her an appointment.

142
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,482
I had to know whether
or not they belonged together.

143
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,059
Let me guess, love at first sight.

144
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,426
Sight, smell, whatever.

145
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,895
You and your son
look very happy together.

146
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,902
Those were taken
when Michael was 1 0.

147
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,737
Ten.

148
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,067
That's a... That's a great age.

149
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:07,701
Mr. Dubov, do you want us
to talk to Michael?

150
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,576
Explain to him that assault
is a serious crime?

151
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,808
No, forget it.

152
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,680
I'm sorry my secretary called you.

153
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,687
Besides, I think I know a way
to get him to forgive me.

154
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,291
There's a new bar
around the corner.

155
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,395
One of the waitresses,
she smells just like my kid.

156
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,258
Let's hope she's not married.

157
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,831
Amen to that.

158
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,570
You know, I bet if that guy quit his job
and opened up a dating service,

159
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,834
he'd make a fortune.

160
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,376
I'm not sure how turning
a corporate lawyer into cupid

161
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,480
is gonna help save the future.

162
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,445
Wha--? Hey.

163
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,812
Honey, what's going on?

164
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:53,922
- Are you all right?
- Dubov was gone for five years, right?

165
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,624
I...

166
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,990
I bet his son really missed him.

167
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,930
Probably.

168
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,431
I mean, every 4400
left someone behind.

169
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,127
Are you sure
it's not something else?

170
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,838
No. It's fine, really.

171
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,999
It'll pass.

172
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,005
Okay.

173
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,247
Physical.

174
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,279
You and lsabelle?

175
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,118
You wanna explain that?

176
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,199
I asked you a question! What is going
on between you and my daughter?!

177
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,232
We never planned
on going behind your back.

178
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,963
In fact, we never planned it at all.
It just kind of happened.

179
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,073
Friendship! Remember?
We talked about that.

180
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,708
That's as far as it
was supposed to go!

181
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,707
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

182
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,346
I'm sorry too.
I'm sorry I ever trusted you.

183
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,846
- lsabelle is just a child!
- No, Richard, she isn't.

184
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,211
She's emotionally immature
and you took advantage of that!

185
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,752
That's what you think?
You know me better. That's not fair.

186
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,718
I know your judgment stinks,
that's what I know.

187
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,619
You're gonna stay away
from my daughter.

188
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,316
I'm not gonna make
that promise to you.

189
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,355
I am not giving you a choice here,
you understand me?

190
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:09,834
This thing between the two of you,
it is over.

191
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,168
I don't recall saying "come in."

192
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,933
I thought perhaps a referee
might be in order.

193
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,235
May I advise you gentlemen
to go to your neutral corners?

194
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,038
This is a private conversation,
Matthew!

195
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,409
It may have started out that way, but
I assure you, it's becoming very public.

196
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,209
I could hear you out in the hallway.

197
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,284
And for the record,
I happen to agree with Richard.

198
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,853
This relationship with lsabelle
is ill-advised at best.

199
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,751
I thought referees didn't take sides?

200
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,916
If I were you, Shawn, I'd take this
opportunity to make a graceful exit.

201
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,686
Think about what I said, Shawn.

202
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,964
I'm expecting you to do
the right thing.

203
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,243
What's for lunch?

204
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,845
Prosciutto with figs.

205
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:02,454
Rosemary chicken,
couscous, and raspberries.

206
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,680
Wow. You know,
when Kyle and I used to go fishing,

207
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,087
we'd take a half a dozen
peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches

208
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,194
- and think we were living like kings.
- I like to think the reality I create

209
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,989
is a little bit tastier than that.

210
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,256
Good.

211
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,992
Hey, we gotta get going. Hey, Kyle!

212
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,336
Come on, buddy!

213
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,699
Come on, Kyle. Let's go.

214
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,665
Come on--

215
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,073
It's you.

216
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,846
The girl on the road.

217
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,315
That's right. You remember.

218
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,749
Maia.

219
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,879
Maia.

220
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,883
Have we met before?

221
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,525
Don't be silly.

222
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,163
No, I'm sorry, l...

223
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:46,954
I don't remember you.

224
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,293
Sure you do.

225
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,198
Think harder.

226
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,869
Is that why you keep showing up?

227
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,439
Because you want me
to remember?

228
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,702
I'm here because
you brought me here.

229
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:06,445
There has to be a reason
why this girl keeps showing up.

230
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,246
There was nothing familiar about her?
Nothing at all?

231
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,083
No.

232
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,418
But she kept acting
like we knew each other.

233
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,322
And if she's right,
if I did bring here there,

234
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,623
then I must know her
from somewhere.

235
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,730
Tom.

236
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,396
Shouldn't you be at work?

237
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:33,033
- Jarvis said you called in sick.
- Well, I'm allowed.

238
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,813
Thanks for checking in on me.

239
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,915
Diana, talk to me, will you?

240
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:40,974
What the hell's all this?

241
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,323
Just a project I'm working on.
I mentioned it to you.

242
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,361
- Who's this supposed to be?
- I wish I knew.

243
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,259
I know this might sound creepy,
but I was up all night last night

244
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,629
cutting up pictures of little girls. None
of them seemed to be the right one.

245
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,667
I mean, I think I'm going crazy.

246
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,930
Then we both are.

247
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,838
You know those little dream vacations
I take with Alana?

248
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,533
This little girl keeps showing up
in them. This little blond girl.

249
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,373
Says her name is Maia.

250
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,506
Maia?

251
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,048
- Oh, Tom.
- What?

252
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,322
You have to come with me.
I have to show you something.

253
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,637
Who is she, Tom?

254
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,705
Who is Maia?

255
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,133
I don't know.

256
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,543
I've already checked. There's no
mention of Maia in any of our case files.

257
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,381
Okay, well, maybe we met her
together someplace else?

258
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,645
Maybe at one
of Garrity's barbecues?

259
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,223
No, that does not feel right.

260
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,417
I didn't just meet this girl once
at a barbecue.

261
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,152
I know her better than that.

262
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,353
All right, just calm down.

263
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,896
Well, there's a reason this girl
is haunting us, Tom, okay?

264
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,591
She's out there somewhere,
and she wants us to find her.

265
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,327
Right now the only place
I know she exists

266
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,234
is in one of these dream worlds
Alana and I create.

267
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,569
Well then, I need for Alana
to take me there.

268
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,371
I need to meet this girl, talk to her.

269
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,570
No, but you wouldn't really
be talking to her, Diana.

270
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,342
You'd just be talking to whatever
your subconscious remembers of her.

271
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,209
Well, maybe that would be enough
for me figure out who she is.

272
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,808
How do I sound?

273
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,809
Like you've been playing for years.

274
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,914
I haven't. It's my first time.

275
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,276
I kind of figured that.

276
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,385
Isabelle, do you have a minute?

277
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,351
Have a seat.

278
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,457
Isabelle, you know I'm proud
of you, don't you?

279
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,868
This is about Shawn
and I having sex, isn't it?

280
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,132
That's part of it, yeah.
Yeah, but only a part of it.

281
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,336
Right now everything's new to you.

282
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:23,805
You're learning so much so fast.
How to be a daughter.

283
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,513
- A friend.
- A lover.

284
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,347
That part you might be learning
too fast.

285
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,318
You don't want me
to get my feelings hurt.

286
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,084
I would just like if you and Shawn
slow down.

287
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,193
- Stop sleeping together?
- For the time being.

288
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,296
There's no reason to stop.

289
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:42,397
Shawn cares about me.
I care about Shawn.

290
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,135
The sex is wonderful.

291
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,238
It makes us both very happy.
It should make you happy too.

292
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,001
Maybe it should, but it doesn't.

293
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,268
I suppose that's normal.

294
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,145
But everything is gonna be okay.

295
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,076
Shawn would never
do anything to hurt me.

296
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,478
He's way too smart for that.

297
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,853
So you see?
You have nothing to worry about.

298
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,626
I wonder if anyone at the Center
has a cello.

299
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,767
So, what do I have to do?

300
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,963
Well, the main thing is to relax.

301
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:26,177
Well, I usually close my eyes
and count backwards from ten.

302
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,074
Before I reach zero,
we're somewhere else.

303
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,078
Have any idea where you want
Alana to take you?

304
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,846
We usually have
a destination picked out.

305
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,111
Well, wherever Maia is.

306
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,278
You can do that, can't you?
You can take me to her?

307
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,481
She seems to show up
anyplace we go.

308
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,784
So it's really up to you.

309
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,086
Well, let's just keep it simple.
How about my apartment?

310
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,695
All right.

311
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,797
Now, let's begin.

312
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,347
Alana,

313
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,779
this is not my apartment.

314
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,717
I know. I'm not quite sure
what just happened.

315
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,350
You done talking to your friend?

316
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,093
- You're Maia.
- Stop fooling around.

317
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,890
Come on. He's waiting for us.

318
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,307
There you are, Ms. Skouris.
The documents are all ready.

319
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,773
If you'll just have a seat,

320
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,538
and sign where indicated,
we can finish up.

321
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,622
You still wanna do this, don't you?

322
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,101
Diana Skouris,
your adoption of Maia Rutledge

323
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,871
is hereby complete,
legal, and binding.

324
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,209
So witnessed by me,
Henry Biederman,

325
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,711
of the 1 0th Circuit Family Court
of Seattle.

326
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,816
You know, some of us
have to look far and wide

327
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,321
to find the people we'll call family.

328
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,760
You two had to look
clear across time.

329
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,726
Diana, let me introduce you
to your daughter, Maia.

330
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,388
Maia, say hello to Mommy.

331
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,080
Oh, my God, Maia.

332
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,856
Oh, my God.

333
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,335
- Oh, my God.
- Diana, what happened?

334
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,027
She was kidnapped, Tom.

335
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,799
She was taken by a woman
pretending to be her sister.

336
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,134
She took Maia,

337
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,301
Tyler Downing, Lindsey Hammond,
and a whole bunch of 4400 kids.

338
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,343
Do you remember any of this?

339
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,674
No. No, I don't.

340
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,076
So this woman took these children

341
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,616
and somehow made everyone forget
they ever existed.

342
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,686
Yes, but they existed.
Maia Rutledge disappeared

343
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,448
from Crescent City, California,
March 3rd, 1 946.

344
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,091
So wait, you're saying
she was abducted,

345
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,454
then returned with the other 4400s,
then taken again.

346
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,152
And none of us remember this
but you.

347
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,163
- It's like they've wiped our memories.
- But why?

348
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,392
Because they didn't want us
looking for them.

349
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,095
The 4400 were taken and returned
to change the future in some way.

350
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,968
Maybe Maia and the others were taken
so that they could change it again.

351
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:47,669
I don't know and I don't care. All I know
is four days ago she was here with me.

352
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,508
And I need you to believe
that I have a daughter named Maia

353
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,979
and that she's been taken from me.

354
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,642
I don't remember Maia,
or the kidnapping, or any of it.

355
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,415
The idea that my memory's been
messed with scares the hell out of me.

356
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,582
But after everything
we've been through with the 4400,

357
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,320
yes, Diana, I believe you.

358
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,506
- Hello?
- Richard Tyler?

359
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,204
- Yes, who's this?
- My name is Daniel Armand,

360
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,350
- You knoW Who I am?
- With the NOVA Group?

361
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,212
I think it's time you and I met,
Richard.

362
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,580
We have a lot to discuss,

363
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,450
I have a lot to say to you too,
but I don't think you'll wanna hear it.

364
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,557
Well, now you see,
that's the problem right there.

365
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,454
We should be allies,
not adversaries,

366
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,061
My group and your organization
have the same goals,

367
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,630
We're advocating
for the rights of the 4400.

368
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,199
Except that you advocate
through assassination and intimidation.

369
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,892
We lack the strength in numbers,
Richard,

370
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,197
so we use the tools at our disposal.

371
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,272
Is that what you called me for?
To have a debate?

372
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,136
I called to arrange a truce,

373
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,834
And to talk about Shawn Farrell.

374
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,041
- You'll make more threats against him?
- No, we need to discuss his future.

375
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,740
Because unless you and I can come
to some kind of agreement,

376
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,044
I'm not sure he's gonna have one.

377
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,188
I should meet him on the corner
of Pike and Gorch Thursday at 4:00.

378
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,388
And then?

379
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,863
A car will be there to pick me up

380
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,059
and take me someplace
for a face to face with Armand.

381
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:21,034
Sounds to me like the NOVA Group's
been reading too much John le Carré.

382
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:24,235
- What did you say?
- I told him I'd think about it.

383
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,673
What is there to think about?
You're not going.

384
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,005
Let's not rush to judgment.

385
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,943
I've dealt with this guy before,
remember?

386
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,049
He wants one thing.
You know what it is: Money.

387
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,684
And probably the names

388
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,945
and addresses of every 4400
in our computer.

389
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:39,716
If they have an ability that he can use,
he will exploit it and people will die.

390
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,791
People have already died.
Maybe I can stop him.

391
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,393
Are you gonna make him
see the light?

392
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,086
No, but I can stop him
from killing you.

393
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,027
How? How?

394
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,063
By putting this place and everything
that we've worked for in jeopardy?

395
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:55,400
- I won't let you do that.
- Noble words, but may I remind you?

396
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,907
If the NOVA Group wants to strike
at you, I don't think we can prevent it.

397
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,806
Thank you for the pep talk, Matthew.

398
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,879
I'm just being realistic.

399
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,312
So am l. If I don't show,
it's like a declaration of war,

400
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,281
and we all know
who the first casualty will be.

401
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,913
You and Jordan Collier built this place.
You're its heart and soul.

402
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,456
Then listen to me, Richard.

403
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,093
I tried to deal
with these people before.

404
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,196
It was a disaster.

405
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,628
I'm warning you. I'm asking you:

406
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,665
Please do not make
the same mistake.

407
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:24,824
Please.

408
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,668
Skouris, I have a list right here

409
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,742
of ever 4400 who returned that night
to Highland Beach.

410
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,902
There's no Maia Rutledge.
There's no Tyler Downing.

411
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,308
There's no Lindsey Hammond.

412
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,847
I've explained that:
They've been erased.

413
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,814
From the records,
from our memories.

414
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,454
Someone has tried to wipe out
every trace of them.

415
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,611
We talked to the families.

416
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,815
In the last week,
all of them have been haunted

417
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,358
by phantom memories of children
they supposedly lost years ago.

418
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,587
Okay, let's say I am buying
any of this, and I'm not.

419
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,357
But if I did, we don't even know
where they were taken.

420
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,160
The future?

421
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,269
- That's kind of out of our jurisdiction.
- I've seen Maia.

422
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,530
I've spoken to her.

423
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:01,763
We both have.

424
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,464
Look, you're asking me
to commit manpower

425
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,372
and resources to find a little girl
that only exists

426
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,877
in some shared fantasyland
you guys play around in.

427
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,708
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't do it.

428
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,372
You guys through?

429
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,349
Because I think I found your kids.

430
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,050
Here we go. Watch this.

431
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,886
That's him. That's Tyler.

432
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,358
It's dated September 1 9th, 1 893.

433
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,793
They sent him back
further into the past. Why?

434
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,593
Well, that I can't tell you.
But Tyler Downing

435
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:33,169
did graduate first in his class
from Yale University in Engineering.

436
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:34,862
I knew I'd heard the name before.

437
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,134
In 1 91 5, he helped develop
synthetic petroleum.

438
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,801
You drove to work this morning
because of this guy.

439
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,412
This is from the estate
of Robert Goddard.

440
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:47,745
You know, the rocket guy.

441
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,217
He adopted an orphan
named Lindsey Hammond.

442
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,118
She lived with the family,
eventually worked in his lab.

443
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,054
And she invented
all the composite materials

444
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,751
used in the first lunar colonies.

445
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,260
Okay, so, what about Maia?
Did you find any photos of her?

446
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,963
No, she was a little harder
to track down.

447
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,865
But I finally found something.

448
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,600
That's Maia's handwriting.

449
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,037
It's a diary from Maia Rutledge

450
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:14,372
dated April 1 9th
through September 2nd, 1 847.

451
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,411
It was written while
she was part of a wagon train

452
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,014
making its way
along the Oregon Trail.

453
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,050
I'm sorry. She crossed the Rockies
in a covered wagon?

454
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:24,611
No.

455
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,786
She died of smallpox
in October of '47.

456
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,953
She was 25.

457
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,134
No. I'm sorry, Shawn.
It's not my father's decision.

458
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,434
- It's mine. I'm not breaking up with you.
- It's got nothing to do with your dad.

459
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,076
Not really.

460
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,614
You and I made some decisions,
we did some things.

461
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,545
We did what we wanted to do.

462
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,117
And there's no reason
we can't keep doing that.

463
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,152
We'll be more careful.
My father won't know it.

464
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,756
That's not gonna work.
Not anymore.

465
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,756
Lying to him, going behind his back?

466
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,785
We've done enough of that.

467
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:07,454
The truth is, lsabelle,
I kind of took advantage of you.

468
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,759
And I'm really sorry.

469
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,134
You are so sweet
the way you worry about me.

470
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,270
I don't want this relationship to end.

471
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,904
So it's not going to.

472
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,892
I need to see her.

473
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,324
Please, can you take me
to see my daughter?

474
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,929
Diana, you know it's not really Maia
you'd be seeing.

475
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,690
Oh, I don't care.

476
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,834
Today I found out that my daughter,
who I loved,

477
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:47,199
was sent back into the past
and died 1 50 years ago.

478
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,671
I'm sorry, but that's gonna take me
a while to come to terms with.

479
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:51,866
I just...

480
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,807
Please let me do this.
I need to say goodbye.

481
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,470
Give me your coat.

482
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,843
I'll put some coffee on.

483
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,544
Ready?

484
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,057
Mommy?

485
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,025
Mommy, I'm starving.
Can we have pancakes?

486
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,965
I'll help make them.

487
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,471
Okay.

488
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,406
Well, I'll need the eggs
from the fridge.

489
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,982
And bring me the big, plastic bowl.

490
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,158
Oh, my God. Alana! Alana! Alana!

491
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,387
Honey, my God, you're bleeding.
You okay?

492
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,326
I think so.

493
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,967
Diana. Diana, can you hear me?

494
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,399
Diana, look at me.
What the hell happened?!

495
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,037
I thought I was bringing us out.

496
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,229
Well, why isn't she awake?

497
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,069
I couldn't hold onto her.
It's as if she pulled away.

498
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,371
Thomas, I think she's still
inside the dream world.

499
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,377
Wait, how can she be in there
without you?

500
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,841
I'm not sure.

501
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,945
When you and I separate,
we let go of the illusion.

502
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,782
But she's not letting go.

503
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,719
Wha--? She's not coming out?

504
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:16,122
I think she's happy there
with her daughter,

505
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,525
and she has no intention
of ever leaving.

506
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:21,791
Oh, come on.

507
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:30,101
At first, I thought she'd suffered some
kind of intracerebral hemorrhage.

508
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,709
But the MRl didn't show
any bleeding in the brain.

509
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,902
So she hasn't suffered
any damage?

510
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,708
Not yet, but the EEG
was very troubling.

511
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,347
Her brain activity is far above normal
and continues to accelerate.

512
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,647
The same is true for her heart rate,
her breathing, her blood pressure.

513
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,882
They're all redlining, if you will.

514
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,286
Any idea what's causing it?

515
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,257
I really can't say at the moment.

516
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,726
Her metabolic rate can't stay
at this level for very long.

517
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,489
Eventually her organs will fail.

518
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,224
What, she could die?

519
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:00,838
Unless we can slow down her rates,
we're looking at a very poor outcome.

520
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,830
Does she have any family?

521
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,802
- Yeah.
- You should call them.

522
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,078
I need to talk to her, Alana.
Can you do that?

523
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,481
Take me to see Diana?

524
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,458
- Push me a little, Mommy.
- Okay, I'm pushing you.

525
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,259
Then make it higher.

526
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,026
Look, not too high.

527
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,670
But that's the whole fun.

528
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,931
She has a point.

529
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,605
I thought I'd be seeing you two.

530
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,713
I didn't hurt you, did l?
It felt a little jarring when you left.

531
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,873
- No, I'm fine.
- You, on the other hand, are not.

532
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,177
Well, that's where you're wrong,
because I feel great.

533
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,718
You're in an lCU, Diana.

534
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,981
I thought I might end up there.

535
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,682
What's my heart rate?
Is it 1 70? 1 75?

536
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,656
- Higher.
- That still probably gives me

537
00:29:56,828 --> 00:30:00,696
what, anywhere from three weeks
to two months?

538
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,332
That could be forever in here.

539
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,968
You're talking about suicide.

540
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,376
I appreciate your concern,
Tom, I do.

541
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,368
But really, I'd like you to leave now.

542
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:16,536
Both of you.

543
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,512
Listen, Diana, believe--
Don't walk away.

544
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,312
The first time I came to these places,
I never wanted to leave.

545
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,354
But I came to realize,
this is not the world.

546
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,189
None of this is real.

547
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,849
Including Maia.

548
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,533
Mommy, push me a little harder.

549
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,033
She's real enough for me.

550
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,574
Oh, she's not coming back, is she?

551
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,084
She's going to die in there.

552
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:00,021
That seems to be her plan.

553
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,085
I can't help but think this is my fault.
I took her there.

554
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,162
No, don't do that to yourself.

555
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,389
You didn't take Maia away.

556
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,125
The people who did that,
they're to blame.

557
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,329
Maybe.

558
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,032
But these people in the future?

559
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,198
They don't seem to care
who they hurt, do they?

560
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,241
No, they don't.

561
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,845
Four o'clock is fast approaching.
Have you come to a decision?

562
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,617
Do I want to get in bed with a terrorist,
or go to war with one?

563
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,157
That does appear to be the question.

564
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,091
Whatever you decide,
you can count on my support.

565
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,659
Isabelle?

566
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:43,730
Isabelle?

567
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,668
My relationship with Shawn
has nothing to do with you.

568
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,005
That's not true. I just care
about what happens to you.

569
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:59,115
You can care about me all you want,
just stay out of my business.

570
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,478
I'm not gonna do that.

571
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,547
Yes, you are.

572
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,091
Isabelle...?

573
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,185
Daddy?

574
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,480
Daddy?

575
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,524
I'm sorry.

576
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,993
I'm sorry.

577
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,057
Okay, move on.

578
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,162
It's all right, baby.

579
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,917
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I've been thinking.

580
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:16,757
Ever since the 4400 came back,
it's been one sacrifice after another.

581
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,896
You and your daughter.

582
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,089
My son.

583
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,402
It has to stop.

584
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,833
So I have a plan.

585
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,775
I'm not sure it's gonna work.

586
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,447
It might be the stupidest thing
I've ever done.

587
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,347
I kind of wish you were here
to stop me.

588
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,911
But you're not,
and I have to try something.

589
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:50,124
Maybe this is goodbye,
maybe it isn't.

590
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,967
The job wouldn't have been
any fun without you.

591
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,321
Okay, okay. Okay.
This is gonna work, right? Okay.

592
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,278
It worked, right?

593
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:42,743
I'm not dead.

594
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,313
Not this time, no.

595
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,417
Next time,
you might not be so fortunate.

596
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,218
The children you took,
Maia and the others.

597
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,481
I want them back.

598
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,852
You were never meant
to remember them.

599
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,152
We went to great lengths
to erase them from your memory

600
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,193
to spare you any pain.

601
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:00,990
It didn't work.

602
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,690
It appears we underestimated
the bonds they had forged.

603
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,031
It's called "family."
Are you familiar with the concept?

604
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:10,231
You had no right to take them,
treat people like that.

605
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:13,571
Maia was only 25 when she died.

606
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,439
Now, either return the children,

607
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,446
or put that rope back around my neck,
because I'm done.

608
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,345
In that case,

609
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:23,112
I need to show you something.

610
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,871
They're alive.

611
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,977
You forced us to go back,
extract them from the timeline.

612
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,137
But returning them to you
would be a mistake.

613
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,340
For our time, and for yours.

614
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,855
The 4400 were an experiment
we always knew might fail.

615
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,995
There were so many variables.

616
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,926
It was impossible to predict them all.

617
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,066
So you're telling me everything
you've done--

618
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:13,863
Taking the 4400, sending them back.
--it hasn't changed anything?

619
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,862
The catastrophe's still coming?

620
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:21,743
Our enemies are more resourceful
than we imagined.

621
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,911
Enemies?

622
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:27,881
There are those among us who would
prefer history to remain unchanged.

623
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,247
That the 4400 fail in their mission.

624
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,013
You mean they want
humanity to die out?

625
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,091
They are convinced
that they will survive.

626
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:38,353
Not only survive,
but benefit from the chaos.

627
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,626
If you think we are heartless,

628
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:44,734
I assure you, that the other side
is unimaginably more brutal.

629
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:48,360
And they've let loose
a terrible evil into your time.

630
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,031
Sending these children further back
into the timeline

631
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,644
was an attempt to combat that evil.

632
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:55,972
If we return them to you,

633
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,615
all the good that they have done
in the past will be negated.

634
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,911
The 4400 and everything
that they were meant to achieve

635
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,576
will be in jeopardy.

636
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:06,314
This evil, there has to be
some other way to deal with it.

637
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,253
There is.

638
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:13,621
You. You are the other way.

639
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,323
It's a burden that we had hoped
not to place on you.

640
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,560
If you return Maia and the others,
I'll do whatever you want.

641
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,001
What we want,
you may not be willing to give.

642
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,800
Do we have a deal or not?

643
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,609
We do. But it's a deal I'm afraid
you'll come to regret.

644
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,828
Hello?

645
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,469
Hello?

646
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,608
Is there anyone here?

647
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,637
Maia?

648
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:38,307
- Tom!
- Maia! Maia!

649
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,052
It's okay. He works with my Mom.

650
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,744
- We were kidnapped!
- Where's Sarah?

651
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:47,322
- Did you catch her?
- Can we go home now?

652
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,890
Yes. Yes, you guys.

653
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,652
- Where's my Mom?
- You're all going home.

654
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,762
It's over. You're all safe now.

655
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:54,558
Is my Mom here?

656
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:58,429
She's not here,
but I'll take you to her, okay?

657
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,477
Hello.

658
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,021
Has he arrived yet?

659
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,589
Then he's made my choice for me.

660
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,249
Where are you hiding? Come on!

661
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,083
I know you're watching me.
I know you're listening.

662
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,730
Where are you?

663
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,177
I found you. I found your bug.

664
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,513
I found your stupid little bug.

665
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,856
Okay, sweetie, lights out.

666
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,225
But it's still early.

667
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,924
It's 9:30, and it's time for bed.

668
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,832
Okay, but first I need you
to do something for me.

669
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:44,441
- Maia, no stalling.
- Mommy, please. It won't take long.

670
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,041
All you have to do is shut your eyes.

671
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,938
All right. Okay.
Well, they're shut. Now what?

672
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,444
Maia?

673
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,817
I'm here, Mommy.
You can open your eyes now.

674
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,987
Mommy?

675
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,122
Wake up.

676
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,527
It's okay.

677
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,660
I'm back.

678
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,034
Everything's fine.

679
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,341
But you have to wake up.

680
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,904
Mommy, please.

681
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,710
