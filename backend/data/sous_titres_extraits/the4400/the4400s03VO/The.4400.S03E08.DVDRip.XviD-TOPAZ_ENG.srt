1
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,269
We're not a threat, We're salvation,

2
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,569
The world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,907
Previously on The 4400:

4
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,480
I need you to talk to Shawn.

5
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,243
Tell him he can't break up with me.
It would be a mistake.

6
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,114
Isabelle's not giving up,
not without a fight.

7
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,784
I don't want this relationship to end,
so it's not going to.

8
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,152
I know I haven't always been there
for you, Kyle,

9
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,123
but I thought
we had a pretty good relationship.

10
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,525
We do. It's just, you know,
growing up with a dad

11
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:08,428
who works for the FBl, NTAC,
it can be pretty intense, you know?

12
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,297
You're supposed to say,
"l wanted to."

13
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,036
Don't push your luck.

14
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,240
I told you what we were doing
and you used it to betray me.

15
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,315
Ryland is responsible
for the death of 28 4400s.

16
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,078
TWenty-eight people that might
have changed the World for the better,

17
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,447
Were they alloWed to live,

18
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,419
Alana Will be prosecuted like any
other member of the NO VA Group,

19
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,219
You're one of the only good men
left in this fight.

20
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,295
I'll find a way to bring you back.
I promise.

21
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,156
Hi, Erika.

22
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,795
- Stay away.
- I'm not gonna hurt you, Erika.

23
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,630
I just want to talk.

24
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,636
I know. That's what you always said.

25
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,536
That's how you used to get me
up into your room.

26
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,644
I mean it now. I swear.

27
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,904
This time I'm for real.

28
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,380
I'm not gonna let you touch me!

29
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,565
It's okay.

30
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,361
Uncle Patrick's here.

31
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,237
Tom Baldwin?

32
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,750
Need your initial by the X.

33
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,791
- What is it?
- Sorry, man. Not a psychic.

34
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,394
"These are not dinner.
Hang in there. Diana."

35
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,436
Baldwin.

36
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,746
Jarvis said this is a suicide.
Any idea why we got called?

37
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,150
Not really. She said
there's a DEA agent at the scene.

38
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:19,814
Apparently,
he requested an NTAC presence.

39
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,761
Hey, by the way,
thanks for the cookies. That was...

40
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,660
- That was really thoughtful.
- Cookies?

41
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,666
Yeah. The basket full of cookies.
The ones you sent.

42
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,468
Why are you looking at me like that?

43
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,505
I didn't send you anything, Tom.
In fact, I was gonna thank you.

44
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:35,868
Thank me? For what?

45
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,533
I got a basket of cookies too,
maybe an hour ago. From you.

46
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,372
At least that's what the card said.

47
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,979
I didn't send you anything either.

48
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,582
- You two from NTAC?
- Yes.

49
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:48,152
Matt Ruddy.
I'm with the DEA. Come on in.

50
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,289
I guarantee
you're gonna find this interesting.

51
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,582
Her name's Erika Lundgren.

52
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,851
She's our third suicide
in the past two weeks.

53
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,495
Why is the DEA
investigating suicides?

54
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,130
Because we think
they're all connected.

55
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,095
For the past six weeks or so,
we've been hearing

56
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,133
about a new recreational drug
hitting the streets.

57
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,299
It's called Blink.

58
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,405
We got a small sample
off the dealer we arrested.

59
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,564
But why call us?
It's hardly our area of expertise.

60
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,073
We had the sample analyzed.

61
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,371
One of the components
our laboratory guys isolated

62
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,242
was like nothing we've seen before.
So they did some more checking.

63
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,111
It's similar to what they found
in the 4400s.

64
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,842
What do you call it? Promicin?

65
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:24,649
What, so this drug Blink,
you think a 4400 is synthesizing it?

66
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,018
That's why I called you guys.

67
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,659
If there's a 4400 involved in this,

68
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,261
I figure you could help
track him down.

69
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,263
Absolutely. It'd help if we knew more
about this drug.

70
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,593
We don't know much about it,

71
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,735
except it seems to be
a powerful hallucinogen.

72
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,235
How do you know Erika Lundgren
was on Blink when she jumped?

73
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,373
Her roommate told us.

74
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,902
Erika took Blink this morning.

75
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,479
Pretty soon after that, she started
telling me she was seeing her uncle.

76
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,206
She was really freaked out.

77
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,375
I mean, the guy's in some prison
for 1 2 more years.

78
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,248
Do you know
where she got the drug?

79
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,547
When Erika wanted to get high,

80
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,021
she'd go see this guy
she went to school with.

81
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,625
I guess he deals now.

82
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,784
I mean, I don't know
if that's where she got it from,

83
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,725
but his name's Greg.

84
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,058
He usually hangs out
in Cowen Park.

85
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,396
He always wears
this old high school varsity jacket.

86
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,767
Erika said he used to be a track star
or something.

87
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,767
Tony, take care of her.

88
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,903
Thank you.

89
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,481
We should probably
head to Cowen Park.

90
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,083
Find out where this guy Greg
gets his Blink.

91
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,381
Hello, Tommy.

92
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,249
Dad?

93
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,128
Hey, Tommy, you're standing
in the middle of the street.

94
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,060
- Better be careful.
- Tom.

95
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,392
Tom, what are you doing?

96
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,998
Come on. What's going on?

97
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,804
Diana, that DEA guy, he said Blink
causes hallucinations, right?

98
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,742
Of course. Why?

99
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,313
Because I think I just saw my father.

100
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,948
He was right over there.

101
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,246
Tom, your father's been dead
nine years.

102
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,220
Exactly.

103
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,214
- It was the cookies. It had to be.
- Tom, slow down.

104
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,151
Why would anyone
wanna slip you Blink?

105
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,191
I don't know. Maybe some bitter 4400.
Someone who hates NTAC.

106
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,691
Yeah, maybe.
But I had a cookie too,

107
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,023
and I'm not seeing a dead relative.
I feel fine.

108
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,222
Listen, Tom,
you've been under a lot of stress lately.

109
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,162
I mean, all this talk of hallucinations,

110
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,270
your mind has decided
to play tricks on you.

111
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,405
Yeah, maybe.

112
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,838
Still though,
I think I should probably drive.

113
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,608
Well, what do you wanna
talk about?

114
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,280
- Diana, do you see him?
- See who?

115
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,683
- My father. He's right there.
- Tom, I don't see anything.

116
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,191
Nobody else can see me, pal.
I'm just here for you.

117
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,761
Just be quiet. You're not real.

118
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,864
Listen to me, Tom.
There's no one there.

119
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,966
Real or not real, I'm here.

120
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,567
And you're gonna have
to deal with me.

121
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,295
What do you want, Dad?

122
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,995
It's not what I want,
it's what you want.

123
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,605
You're the one
who brought me here.

124
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,401
There must be something
you wanna say to me.

125
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,800
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- Tom, listen to me.

126
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,674
There is no one back there. You're
gonna have to try and calm down.

127
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,281
Yes, there is, Diana. He's right--

128
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,077
He's gone.
He was right there, Diana. I swear.

129
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,115
Tom, I'm gonna take you
to NTAC Medical, all right?

130
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,055
It's gonna be fine.

131
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,763
That was nice.

132
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,496
See? It all still works between us.

133
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,468
I'm glad you came back.

134
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,471
Isabelle. Hey, not right now, okay?

135
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,506
- I've got stuff I should do.
- Let it wait.

136
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:38,666
Isabelle.

137
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,402
This time, if you want,

138
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,104
I could make you think
I'm someone else.

139
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,917
Anyone you've ever had
a fantasy about.

140
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,610
I can make the earth move for us.

141
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,916
Literally.

142
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,249
Isabelle, you don't need
to use your abilities to tempt me.

143
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,827
Believe me,
you're just fine on your own.

144
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,626
- I just gotta go.
- You never used to leave right after.

145
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,464
We've lost something, haven't we?

146
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,696
I mean, we still fit together
and everything,

147
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,737
but it's not the same, is it?

148
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,943
No, it's not.

149
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,377
And we keep pretending everything's
the same way it used to be.

150
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,877
Well, I still keep pretending.

151
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,113
How is it working for you?

152
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,116
Not well.

153
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,692
I think I know what we need to do.

154
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,965
Good. I'm glad you realize it too.

155
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,802
We have to get married.

156
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,300
It's the only way we can be sure
we'll never lose each other.

157
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,070
Isabelle.

158
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,779
You go do your stuff,
I'll start thinking about a guest list.

159
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,653
Your CAT scan came back fine.

160
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,721
but your blood pressure's
still a little elevated.

161
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,348
Aside from that,
your vitals are holding steady.

162
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,859
What about his labs?
Any drugs in his system?

163
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,464
The tox screen was negative,
but that's not surprising

164
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,896
because we don't know a lot
about testing Blink.

165
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,262
We've given you a mild sedative,

166
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,960
but that's all we can do
for the moment.

167
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,435
So I can go home, right?

168
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,733
I haven't seen my dad in,
what, six hours.

169
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,637
Well, typically it takes
about 48 hours

170
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,710
for a psychotropic drug
to leave your system.

171
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,210
We don't know much about Blink.

172
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,746
Well, so it's impossible to say
how long the effects will last.

173
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:24,905
Or how severe they'll be.

174
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,552
Hallucinogens tend to affect everyone
differently.

175
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,314
It depends what kind of issues
you're carrying in your subconscious.

176
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,787
All right, I am gonna have
Garrity give you both a ride home.

177
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,155
- You two are taking a couple days off.
- I don't need a couple days. I feel fine.

178
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,590
But you ate the cookies too.

179
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,458
Until we're sure the drugs
are out of your system,

180
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,759
you're both on medical leave.

181
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,727
I spoke to your dad
about our conversation.

182
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,203
We wanted to talk to you together.

183
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,741
I don't know if you're serious
about this whole proposal thing,

184
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,811
but we need to nip it in the bud
right now.

185
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,311
You and me getting married
is not a good idea.

186
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,471
You're both too young.

187
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,448
Neither of you are ready for that kind
of commitment. I can't allow it.

188
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,383
I'm your father and I'm telling you,
it's not gonna happen.

189
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,116
Your father speaks for both of us.
I'm not going along with this.

190
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,453
I get what the both of you
are saying.

191
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,152
There are millions of reasons
why we shouldn't get married.

192
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,957
There are just more reasons
why we should.

193
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,190
Did either of you ever think

194
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,766
that maybe this relationship
was meant to happen?

195
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,700
That Shawn and I were set up
to meet?

196
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,499
Fall in love?

197
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,268
- lsabelle, I don't love you.
- Shawn, you and l

198
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,468
are the two most powerful people
on the planet.

199
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,011
We're supposed to be together.
Who else is good enough for you?

200
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,911
Isabelle, the man just told you straight
up, he doesn't wanna marry you.

201
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,574
How much clearer
does he have to be?

202
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,152
- You have to accept that.
- No.

203
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,247
I don't.

204
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,421
Actually, you two need to change
the way you're thinking.

205
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,186
Maybe it would help
if you thought about it

206
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,387
Iike an arranged marriage.

207
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,167
The future wants us to be together.

208
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,360
We're gonna be together.

209
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,996
I'll make sure of it.

210
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,905
Are you sure
you're going to be okay alone?

211
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,635
I mean, I could stay with you
if you want.

212
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,712
No, I'm fine.

213
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,542
With any luck,
that stuff's worn off already.

214
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,343
Well, call if you need anything.

215
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,544
- I will. Good night.
- Good night.

216
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,988
Okay, Garrity.
You can take me home now.

217
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,094
Hey, Diana.

218
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,396
- Josh?
- It's good to see you.

219
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,227
You look different.

220
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,260
You look exactly the same.

221
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,133
What are you doing here?

222
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,497
There's some stuff
that we need to talk about.

223
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,744
I don't think so.

224
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,212
I mean, we haven't spoken
in, what, 1 1 years?

225
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,374
I don't see any reason
to change that.

226
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,752
That's a bit harsh, don't you think?

227
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,287
We've been through a lot together.

228
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:47,152
No. You put me through a lot.
There's a difference.

229
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,920
Hey, are you all right?

230
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,859
It looked like
you were just talking to yourself.

231
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,329
No, I'm not okay.

232
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,230
I think I got slipped a dose
of Blink too.

233
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,201
Really? Now, who'd you see?

234
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,067
No one.

235
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,366
Just some guy I used to know.

236
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,207
- You were engaged?
- Yeah, in grad school.

237
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:11,943
I had to take a physics course.

238
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,382
Josh Sandler was a teaching assistant,
and we dated for three years.

239
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,513
I'm sorry.
I know it's a lot to spring on you.

240
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,783
You never said anything.

241
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,053
Well, it's not something
I particularly like to talk about.

242
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,658
I don't wanna sound jealous
of a hallucination,

243
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,599
but you must think
about this guy a lot, huh?

244
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,795
Tom's seeing his dad, you know,
that makes sense.

245
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,407
Every kid's father
is buried deep in their psyche.

246
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,803
Erika Lundgren saw her uncle.

247
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,444
Who knows
what kind of history they had.

248
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,704
Look. I can't answer for her.

249
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,371
But I can tell you that Josh and l
have plenty of our own history,

250
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,573
and most of it bad.

251
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,547
We had a fight about 1 0 days
before the wedding,

252
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,311
broke the engagement.

253
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,579
It was ugly.

254
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,319
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- No.

255
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,120
The last thing I wanna do
is talk about Josh Sandler.

256
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,229
Listen, I'm exhausted

257
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,992
and I just wanna take a shower
and get into bed.

258
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,998
Want some company?

259
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,236
No, not tonight.

260
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,906
I'll call you in the morning.

261
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,099
Okay.

262
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,315
You got the place
to yourself now, huh?

263
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,585
Lot of room for one guy.

264
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,589
You know, now that Alana's gone,

265
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,354
you ought to think
about selling the place.

266
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,827
Get some kind of apartment.

267
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,967
Thanks for the suggestion, Dad.

268
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,662
I like it fine here.

269
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,099
You're still holding out for your son
to come home.

270
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,675
I gotta tell you, buddy,
I don't think that's gonna happen.

271
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,207
Hey, don't get mad.
I'm trying to have a conversation here.

272
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,315
Except you're not saying anything.

273
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,376
I wouldn't even know where to start.

274
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,351
Pick a topic.

275
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,023
Fine. Let's talk
about when I was a kid.

276
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,718
I used to hate coming home
when I knew you were gonna be there.

277
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,694
You were nasty to Mom. You drank.
You hated being a beat cop so much,

278
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,231
you did everything you could
to keep me out of law enforcement.

279
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,392
When I did get into the FBl,
you never called,

280
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,800
you never said congratulations.

281
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,032
You were too busy being jealous
of your own damn kid.

282
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,749
Okay, I'm officially talking
to myself now.

283
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,983
You feeling better?

284
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,648
Come on, Tommy.
You're a grownup.

285
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,887
I never figured you'd still be carrying
so much anger, Tom.

286
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,999
Being a father...

287
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,828
You know how complicated it gets.

288
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,163
Look at you and Kyle.

289
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,828
The kid's in jail. He won't even
talk to you, let alone see you.

290
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,601
Kyle needs some time,
and I'm giving it to him.

291
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,573
That's called respect.

292
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,509
I have always been there for him.
Good times and bad.

293
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,775
- I didn't learn that from you.
- I know I wasn't much of a father.

294
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,277
I tried to be there
for you and Susan.

295
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,421
Look for understanding
someplace else.

296
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,422
In fact, why don't you
do us both a favor and just go away?

297
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:10,459
- That's not gonna happen.
- Fine. Then I will.

298
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,296
You can't just walk away, pal.

299
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,335
It ain't gonna be that easy
to get rid of me.

300
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,201
You won't go away?
I'll make you go away.

301
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,209
I'm gonna find the 4400
who's doing this to me.

302
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,346
- I'm gonna force him to stop it.
- You're going back on the case?

303
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,482
- I'll come with you.
- No, no, no.

304
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,083
I'm not working an investigation
with my dead father.

305
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,954
I don't think you got much
of a choice, Tom.

306
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,181
Either I come along for the ride,

307
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,885
or you and me go back inside
and talk some more.

308
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,522
Fine.

309
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:46,686
Just don't show up

310
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,060
when I'm in the middle
of talking to somebody, okay?

311
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,724
No problem.

312
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,461
Been a long time
since I've worked a case.

313
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,469
This is gonna be fun.

314
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,788
You still make those late-night bowls
of Ben & Jerry's, huh?

315
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:18,422
Josh, I want you to go away.
Just stop showing up in my life.

316
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,963
You know, it's funny.

317
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,565
But you'd only
make yourself ice cream

318
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,328
after everybody else
had gone to bed.

319
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,804
I used to wonder
what that said about you.

320
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,878
You know, you're gonna
have to talk to me eventually.

321
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,314
No. You see, you're a hallucination.

322
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,080
So I just have to make
a conscious choice to ignore you

323
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,382
and eventually you'll be gone.

324
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,351
It's a good plan.

325
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,519
I just don't think it's gonna work.

326
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,956
See, there's a reason I'm here, Diana.
There has to be.

327
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,659
You're random.
Just a mental hiccup.

328
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,530
Josh Sandler isn't even dead.
I Googled him tonight.

329
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,297
He teaches astronomy
at Pomona College.

330
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,668
So? That's the present-day
Josh Sandler.

331
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,208
Your issues are with me,
the guy you were engaged to.

332
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,074
I don't have any issues!

333
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:14,816
Mommy? Are you okay?
I heard noises.

334
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,582
I'm fine, sweetie.
I'm just practicing something for work.

335
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,194
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

336
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,522
You Were engaged?

337
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,789
Why does everyone
have such a hard time believing that?

338
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,457
It's not a hard time believing it,
it just-- Well, you never told me.

339
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:34,504
It was a long time ago.
It didn't work out.

340
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:36,765
Listen, I'm glad you called.

341
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,569
I don't like the idea
of a drug in my system

342
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,075
that caused three suicides.

343
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,644
And these hallucinations
we're having,

344
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,542
so far, it doesn't seem
like the same thing

345
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,114
Erika Lundgren went through.

346
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,549
- All my dad wants to do is talk.
- I know.

347
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,381
Josh hasn't threatened me either.

348
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,285
As long as it stays that way,
there's no reason

349
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,187
we can't use our free time
to look into this case.

350
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,486
There's that delivery service.

351
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,323
If we track down the source
of those cookies,

352
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,226
maybe we could find the 4400
who's behind this.

353
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,300
And there's Cowen Park. That dealer
doesn't know anyone's looking for him.

354
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,595
I'll take the park,
you take the delivery service.

355
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:06,760
Sounds good.

356
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,601
Anything but waiting around
for my ex to show up.

357
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,071
Devon, all of these messages
are from this morning.

358
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,510
Well, everyone wants to congratulate
you on your engagement.

359
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,344
- Do you wanna start returning?
- No. I don't wanna talk to anyone.

360
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,486
Not even your mother?
I have her on hold.

361
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,820
Yeah. Thank you, Devon.

362
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,420
Mom, hey.

363
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,284
No-- Mom.

364
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,828
Mom, who told you I got engaged?

365
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,560
No, I'm coming right over.

366
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,860
Mom, where are you?

367
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,405
- A little mischievous one, wasn't he?
- I love that little old face. It's so cute.

368
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,736
Look at those eyes.

369
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,473
Look at that little butt.

370
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,580
So somebody tell me
what's going on here.

371
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,215
If it isn't Mr. Secretive.

372
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,874
I'm just showing your fiancée
your baby pictures.

373
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,850
Consider it punishment
for not making me the first phone call.

374
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,011
Come on, sit.

375
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,420
I'd love to, but lsabelle and l
have to actually get going.

376
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,685
- We have a lot to talk about.
- You bet we do.

377
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,830
My oldest boy is getting married
and I'm gonna help plan the wedding.

378
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,863
I promise we won't make any decisions
without you.

379
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,126
- But, lsabelle, we need to go now.
- You're being rude.

380
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,703
I don't mean to be,
but we really need to go. Now.

381
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,010
- It was really nice seeing you again.
- You too.

382
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,437
I love your son very much.

383
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,624
We should probably be heading
in the other direction.

384
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,852
Great. You're back.

385
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,055
- We're going to Covington, right?
- You shouldn't back-seat drive, Josh.

386
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,030
You know, it was always
one of your least flattering qualities.

387
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,432
Could you speak up a bit, ma'am?
I didn't catch that.

388
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,631
I wasn't talking to you. I was just--

389
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,679
Sorry. I don't mean to be annoying.

390
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,381
I'm sorry for everything, actually.

391
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,611
The way things worked out with us.

392
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,756
I just had to say that out loud.

393
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,357
Apology not accepted.
Do you mind just being quiet?

394
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:10,762
You know, I have to admit,
this is not how I pictured you at all.

395
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,523
I mean, working for the government.
You're carrying a gun.

396
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,759
The whole thing with us, the wedding,
it really must have changed you.

397
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:21,201
As usual, Josh, you're placing yourself
at the center of everything.

398
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,906
Maybe I have changed.
But it's got nothing to do with you.

399
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,566
In fact,
until you showed up yesterday,

400
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:29,544
I mean, I hadn't thought about you
in five years.

401
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,107
What?

402
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:38,017
It's just that your left eye still does
that little twitching thing when you lie.

403
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,991
Yeah, I remember you.
The gift basket.

404
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,757
Right. Well, there were cookies inside,
and we have reason to believe

405
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,265
that they were laced
with an illegal drug.

406
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:53,871
Hey, I don't know anything about that.
I just pick stuff up and deliver.

407
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,836
Well, you delivered it to me.

408
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,942
- Where did you pick it up?
- That's supposed to be confidential.

409
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,773
I guess it's okay this one time.

410
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,079
It was an old building downtown.

411
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,878
Here it is. 1 56 Liberty Avenue.

412
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,050
Look at these people.

413
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,457
They don't even try to hide
what they're doing.

414
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,790
I tell you, things have changed
since I was walking the beat.

415
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:23,093
Yeah, I know. You'd have won the war
on drugs single-handed.

416
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,634
You've become a really angry guy,
you know that?

417
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,568
I'm not trying to pick a fight here.

418
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,800
- I know I'm not perfect.
- You're not even alive.

419
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,338
All right, fair enough.
I wasn't perfect.

420
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,948
I blame most of that on the job.

421
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:43,178
You get burned out
dealing with this crap.

422
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,352
Violence, ugliness.

423
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,219
It got inside my head.

424
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,020
I couldn't switch it off
when I got home.

425
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,355
That's why I drank.

426
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:54,826
It's why I got nasty sometimes
with you and your mother.

427
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,490
I'm not making excuses for myself.

428
00:23:56,668 --> 00:24:00,798
I mean-- You seem to need some kind
of an explanation for what I did.

429
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,701
That's the best one I can give you.

430
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,302
Okay.

431
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,207
It's not anything
I didn't already know, but...

432
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:10,808
Okay.

433
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,248
That dealer we're looking for,

434
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:16,910
did you say he wears some kind
of a high school varsity jacket?

435
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,783
Yeah, why?

436
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,696
I don't know
what you're so worked up about.

437
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,892
You won't find anything.

438
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,661
This wouldn't happen to be Blink,
would it?

439
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,238
And so what if it is?
Blink's brand-new, man.

440
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,272
Feds haven't even had time
to make it illegal yet.

441
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,909
Yeah, well, we'll find time.

442
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,840
That's what we do
when people start dying.

443
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,810
- So who's supplying you with this?
- You think I'd tell you that?

444
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:47,878
Baldwin.

445
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,511
Did Jarvis say what this is about?

446
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,023
No. Just that there'd been
some break in the case.

447
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,261
These are the agents
that were affected?

448
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,061
This is Tom Baldwin, Diana Skouris.

449
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,666
They were compromised yesterday.

450
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,029
Oh, I am so sorry about all this.

451
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,171
You were drugged against your will.

452
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,500
And those young people
committing suicide...

453
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,539
It's all so terrible.

454
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,610
Ma'am, who are you?

455
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,939
My name is Naomi Bonderman.

456
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:19,045
It's my ability that did this to you.

457
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,412
I caused all this.

458
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,059
One day, about three months ago,

459
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:32,628
I woke up with what I thought
were sweaty palms.

460
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,856
Then I realized it wasn't sweat.

461
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,594
It was some kind of oil,
I suppose you'd call it.

462
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,867
And that's when I first saw
my sister.

463
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,667
This sister of yours,
you hadn't seen her for a while?

464
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,867
Ruth's been dead for 30 years.

465
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,035
And there she was,
standing at the foot of my bed.

466
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,771
We were never close.

467
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:53,111
But once I realized
I hadn't gone completely batty,

468
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,048
we had a very nice visit.

469
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,656
Finally, after all these years,
we worked things out between us.

470
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:02,782
In the morning, she was gone.
And then I touched Gordon's hand.

471
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,991
Gordon? Is that your husband?

472
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,721
No, my mailman.

473
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,834
And that night, he was visited
by some Army buddy of his

474
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,300
who was wounded
in the first Gulf War.

475
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,200
That's when I started
wearing my gloves.

476
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,000
Mrs. Bonderman, have you any idea

477
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:20,303
how your ability came to be sold
on the streets?

478
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:21,911
At first I had no idea.

479
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,641
But now, I think it had something to do
with my fried chicken.

480
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,919
I use a lot of herbs in my cooking.
I grow them myself.

481
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,248
That's the only place
I don't wear my gloves,

482
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,118
when I'm working in the garden.

483
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,350
And the herbs absorbed the oil
from your hands.

484
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,095
My family had come over
for Sunday dinner.

485
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,393
And that night, they all started
having their own encounters.

486
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,263
It was very emotional for everyone.

487
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,298
But it all seemed to work out
for the best.

488
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,804
No one died or anything.

489
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,000
Could someone have gotten ahold
of these herbs,

490
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,235
used them to make this drug?

491
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,639
That must have been
what happened.

492
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,941
The Tuesday after the dinner,
I went out to water,

493
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,381
and all of my plants were gone.
Pulled out.

494
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,282
Someone stole the herbs
from your garden,

495
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,150
someone who knew the effect
they could have.

496
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:08,121
I had hoped one day
my ability might be used

497
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,591
as a kind of therapy to help people.

498
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,458
But now it's being sold on the street
and people are dying.

499
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,623
It's just horrible.

500
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,361
Mrs. Bonderman, have you any sense
of how long these visions usually last?

501
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:24,270
Sometimes the visitors stay for days,
weeks even.

502
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,000
I know one thing, though.

503
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,543
The more you ignore them,
the longer they stay,

504
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,181
and the more insistent they become.

505
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,116
I know
we're officially on medical leave,

506
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,349
but I thought I might check out
that address

507
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:42,220
we got from the delivery company.
Try and find out who sent the cookies.

508
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,383
You wanna come along?

509
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,153
I was gonna stop by
Mrs. Bonderman's house,

510
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,854
go over the guest list
from that dinner.

511
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,023
She seemed a little vague
about who was there.

512
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,465
Think one of them might have gone
into business with Grandma's recipe?

513
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,764
That's a place to start.

514
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,132
Isabelle, this has to stop.

515
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,775
You can't force me to marry you.

516
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:02,845
- You've got cold feet. I read about this.
- No. It's not cold feet.

517
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,879
I want you to understand
this is not gonna happen.

518
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,416
I'm not gonna marry you.
And if you can't accept that,

519
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,884
if you wanna hurt me for rejecting you,
you go ahead and do it.

520
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,025
I'm right here. Let's get it over with.

521
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,756
I would never hurt you, Shawn.

522
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,990
That's good to hear.

523
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,464
Okay, we're clear, right?
It's over between the two of us.

524
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,629
You once told me
that good and evil was a choice.

525
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,798
One you get to make.

526
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,409
Well, right now, I'm at a place
where I have to make that choice.

527
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:37,207
And I'm afraid if I lose you,
I'm going to make the wrong one.

528
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,077
Who are you gonna threaten this time?
My mom?

529
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,547
Shawn, I'm not threatening anyone.

530
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,653
- I'm asking for your help.
- My help?

531
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,948
There are things I was sent here to do.
Brutal things.

532
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,223
Your mother
and millions of other people

533
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,518
could die because of me.

534
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,628
I don't know how you could know that,
but it doesn't have to happen that way.

535
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,630
- You can fight it.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

536
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,835
That's why you and me,
we need to be together.

537
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,838
Because I think you're the only one
who can stop me.

538
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,148
You sure this is the place?

539
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,255
Yeah. Stood right here, guy came out
from the back, handed me the cookies.

540
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,412
That was it.

541
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,615
The management company said

542
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,783
that this office has been vacant
for eight months.

543
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,095
You said these guys are drug dealers,
right?

544
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,026
I mean,
maybe they move around a lot.

545
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,462
Maybe they operate out
of a whole bunch of different places.

546
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:30,862
The man who gave you the cookies,

547
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,593
you don't remember anything
about him?

548
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,262
I wasn't really paying attention.
If I saw him again, maybe.

549
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:42,609
Look, since no one's here, can I go?
I gotta get back to work.

550
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,512
Yeah, sure. Thanks for trying.
Call me if something comes to you.

551
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,174
Sure.

552
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,560
Is that a clue?

553
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:02,791
I'm trying to work here.

554
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,594
You know what?
This isn't fun for me either.

555
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,396
I've got my job too.

556
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,402
There must be something
that you wanna say to me.

557
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,201
- What, you wanna talk about old times?
- Old times?

558
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,105
You cheated on me two weeks
before the wedding.

559
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,974
- Who does something like that?
- Figured you'd still be mad about that.

560
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,206
Oh, it took me forever
to get over what you did.

561
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,819
The hurt, the betrayal. But I did it.
I put you behind me.

562
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:26,150
I moved on. And I'm not interested
in a single thing you have to say.

563
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,325
Josh?

564
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:33,722
Are we done?

565
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,309
Anybody could get over that fence.

566
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,843
Thanks for pointing that out.

567
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:58,010
Remember when you were a kid,
you used to help me mow the lawn?

568
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,317
I remember you yelling at me
for missing spots.

569
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,984
I wanted you to do a good job.
Take pride in your work. Be a man.

570
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,755
Yeah, well, it worked.

571
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,023
No matter what the situation,

572
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:12,033
I just think about what you would do
and I do the opposite. Never failed.

573
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,601
That's my Tommy.
He's got all the answers, huh?

574
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,637
When it comes to you, I do.

575
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,435
All right then, answer me this.

576
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,977
The last time I went in the hospital,
the time I didn't make it out,

577
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,408
why didn't you come see me?

578
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,642
It's a simple question, Tom.

579
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:35,150
Agent Baldwin,
would you like some iced tea?

580
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:43,996
Let's see, there were Barry,
Kathleen and the twins--

581
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,363
Oh, and they cried
all through dinner.

582
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,199
--Philip and his new girlfriend.

583
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,605
Oh, I'm afraid
I don't remember her name.

584
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,211
Roger and Julie.

585
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,316
Oh, I'm sorry.
Julie was sick that day.

586
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,419
Sinus headache.
She gets them all the time.

587
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,782
- That's my grandson Randy.
- He works for door-to-door delivery?

588
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,389
- He's still finding himself.
- Does he know about your ability?

589
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,497
Oh, of course he does.
He was here at that dinner.

590
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,861
He had two helpings of chicken.

591
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,107
The neighbor says
Randy left a few hours ago.

592
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,941
No idea where he went.

593
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,083
We know he's not at work.

594
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:36,448
I'm gonna check the bedroom,
see if I can find an address book.

595
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,493
Don't you guys ever stop for lunch?

596
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,699
I thought I'd gotten rid of you.

597
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:52,233
No, no, no.
We still have some ground to cover.

598
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,667
You know that thing that you said
about how you've moved on,

599
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,101
that you put me behind you?

600
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,139
You know,
I'm not really sure I'm buying it.

601
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,367
I don't care.

602
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,977
Well, maybe not.

603
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,010
But if you're so over me,
how come you haven't had

604
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,342
a single serious relationship
since we broke up?

605
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,677
I have had plenty
of serious relationships.

606
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,979
Ones that were a lot more respectful
and successful

607
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,485
than the one I had with you.

608
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,715
- You wanna name one?
- What do you call Marco?

609
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,984
I'd call him a very sweet guy
who'd do anything for you.

610
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,457
You could learn something
from him.

611
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,789
Still, it's a relationship
with no future and you know it.

612
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:20,988
That's why you're with him.

613
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,463
Look, I have no idea
what kind of future I've got with Marco.

614
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:24,965
We haven't been going out
that long.

615
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,763
So you're gonna go out
for a couple months,

616
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,599
and then when he pushes you
for a commitment,

617
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,764
you're gonna finally tell him
the truth:

618
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,911
That there isn't any chemistry.
That you're not right for each other.

619
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,670
All things you already know.

620
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,608
Is that really the way
I treat the guys I date?

621
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:44,285
Di, you're an amazing woman,
and I blew it.

622
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,513
What I did to you was cruel,

623
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,419
but you can't keep
protecting yourself forever.

624
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,423
It's not fair to you.

625
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,096
It's not fair to Marco.

626
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,941
Offhand, I'd say
somebody's been doing some baking.

627
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,671
Yeah,
but where did all the cookies go?

628
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,784
Look, buddy, I know you're busy,
but you never answered my question.

629
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,818
Why didn't you come see me
when I was dying?

630
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:21,186
Dad,
I really can't talk about this now.

631
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,919
It's not my favorite memory either.

632
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,296
Well, so let's get it over
and done with.

633
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,228
I'll leave you alone.

634
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,233
You mean if I tell you, that's it?
We're done? You're gone?

635
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,333
Be a step in the right direction.

636
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,601
I was in Baltimore
working on a case for the Bureau.

637
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:40,471
When I got the call from Mom,
I booked a flight home.

638
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,442
I was all set to go,
but then the case heated up

639
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:43,807
and I missed my plane.

640
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,812
By the time I could get another,
it was too late.

641
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,508
I asked you for the truth, Tommy.
You're just giving me excuses.

642
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,586
You want the truth?

643
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,118
I stayed away as a favor to you.

644
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,350
You didn't want me there, Dad.

645
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,360
Whatever I'd say, whatever I'd do,
it'd only piss you off like always.

646
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,329
I figured my not being there
would make it easier for you.

647
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,533
I let you die in peace.

648
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,635
I wanted to see you one last time.

649
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,138
You're my son, Tommy. I love you.

650
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,575
Yeah, well, that's nice to hear,
but it's a little too late.

651
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:19,512
I know. It was my fault. I'm sorry.

652
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,616
But I did want you there, Tommy.

653
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:26,148
You were wrong about me,
about how I felt.

654
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,916
Maybe you're wrong
about some other things.

655
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:32,290
I hope you're gonna show me
a cabinet filled with cookies.

656
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,925
I wish.
I think he took them with him.

657
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,536
You better take a look at that.
I found it wedged behind the dresser.

658
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,771
Looks like he kept a record
of everyone he dosed.

659
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,338
Think it's some kind of enemies list?

660
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,135
He's trying to get back
at all these people?

661
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,137
Diana.

662
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,638
That's the food fair. It starts today.

663
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,577
Now we know
where he took the cookies.

664
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,193
Tom.

665
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,024
Stop!

666
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,209
Get up.

667
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,941
- Where are the rest of the cookies?
- There aren't any more. I swear.

668
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,606
He's only just opened the box.
Looks like we made it just in time.

669
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,342
Diana.

670
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,347
Go.

671
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,424
Nice work, you two.

672
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,833
NTAC Medical is gonna be busy
for some time.

673
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,599
We'll keep them under observation,
get them some counseling.

674
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,209
I take it you both have been too busy
ignoring your medical leave

675
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,935
to deal with your own situations.

676
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,342
We figured first things first.

677
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:58,743
Yeah, I know.
If my dad showed up,

678
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,884
I'd be spending
a lot of time at work too.

679
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,350
But now, I want you both to go home
and deal with this thing.

680
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,113
If you feel you can't,

681
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,816
we'll book you adjoining suites
at NTAC Medical. Okay?

682
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,691
I just want you to know,
I never meant to hurt anyone.

683
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,061
Tell that to Erika Lundgren
and the others who died.

684
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,431
I'm really sorry about that. Honestly.

685
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:23,267
But all I did was give them a chance
to deal with their problems.

686
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,601
You know, face to face.

687
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,902
I just wanted to share
the enlightenment.

688
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,375
I guess they couldn't handle it.

689
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,276
Well, I don't get the connection.
Why send the cookies to us?

690
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,076
What are you talking about?

691
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,185
You guys exposed
the promicin scandal.

692
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,014
You saved my grandmother's life.

693
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,314
It was a gift.

694
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,650
My way of saying thank you.

695
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,658
"Thank you"?

696
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,821
I guess no good deed
ever goes unpunished, huh?

697
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,638
All this stuff lsabelle told you,

698
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,479
sure she wasn't making it up,
scaring you?

699
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,636
Trying to keep you close?

700
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:07,147
Because I'm telling you, Shawn,
this sounds crazy.

701
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,644
I can heal people.
You can move things with your mind.

702
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,051
We live in a crazy world.

703
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:17,922
When she was a baby, even younger,
when she was in her mother's womb,

704
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,356
I knew she was different.
Dangerous.

705
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:25,059
Richard, if I believed that staying
with lsabelle would save all those lives,

706
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,362
I would marry her tomorrow.

707
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,832
But what happens a month from now?
Or a year?

708
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,441
What happens if she gets tired of me?
Or I make her angry?

709
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,306
I get it.
But marrying her is not the answer.

710
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,913
We gotta find another way
to stop her.

711
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,374
She's my daughter, Shawn.

712
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,076
What would you have me do?

713
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,332
Hey, I was out
with some of the guys.

714
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,168
I came right over
as soon as I got your voice mail.

715
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:06,637
You okay?

716
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,177
I picked up some ltalian
on the way here.

717
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,440
Don't be nice to me.

718
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,319
I don't like the sound of that.

719
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,621
I know this isn't pleasant,
but you're doing the right thing.

720
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,885
Does this mean
we can say goodbye?

721
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,325
As a matter of fact, it does.

722
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,623
Try not to miss me, Di.

723
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,728
I won't.

724
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,272
Goodbye?

725
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,078
You mean you're leaving?

726
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,318
All I've been doing
is making you miserable.

727
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,287
I figure I did enough of that
when you were a kid growing up.

728
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,458
Yeah, we're done here.

729
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,152
Made about as much progress
as we can make.

730
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,161
You take care.

731
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,428
I'd shake your hand
but it doesn't work that way.

732
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,496
Dad?

733
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,578
You know what I said before about...

734
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,681
Why missing that flight home
was a favor to you?

735
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,650
That wasn't true.

736
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,079
I never thought it was.

737
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,889
I did it for me.

738
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,859
Just the idea of standing around
that hospital room watching you die,

739
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,991
with all that anger still between us,

740
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:40,600
knowing that we'd never work it out,
that we'd...

741
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,543
We'd never be as close
as I wanted us to be? I couldn't do it.

742
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,604
It's okay, Tommy.

743
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,515
I didn't deserve to have you there.

744
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,182
I should have been there anyway.
I'm sorry.

745
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,388
The clock just ran out on us, huh?

746
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,224
Well, I guess
there's no clock now, is there?

747
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:05,851
I got all the time in the world.
Not that we have to use it.

748
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,822
Why don't you come and sit down?

749
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:13,559
- Tommy, we don't have to do this.
- I know. Why don't you...?

750
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,504
Why don't you just come back
in the kitchen and park it, okay?

751
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,198
I never liked eating alone.

752
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,009
Nothing worse.

753
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,108
So,

754
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,047
what do you wanna talk about?

755
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,691
Happy now?

756
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:16,930
You tried.

757
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,794
Didn't work.
You can't kill me, Shawn.

758
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,575
I guess we're gonna get married
after all.
