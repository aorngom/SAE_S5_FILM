1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,230
I dragged you out of hell.
I can throw you back in.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,960
You should show me
some respect.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,430
In the coming months,you will
have more decisions to make.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,030
Sam:
Dean,what was it like?

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,900
What,hell?

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,300
I don't know.
I-I must have blacked it out.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,200
I don't remember
a damn thing.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,160
This is uriel,
a specialist.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,030
Specializing in what?

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,230
Both of you,you need to leave
this town immediately.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,760
Why?

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,530
Because we're about
to destroy it.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,800
The only reason you're still
alive,Sam winchester,

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,400
Is because
you've been useful.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,200
The moment that ceases
to be true,

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,300
Then I will
turn you to dust.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,760
Ask Dean what he remembers
from hell.

18
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,830
Hello?

19
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,200
Is anybody there?

20
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,830
Um,hello?

21
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,500
It just doesn't make
any sense,Dean.

22
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,730
I mean,
why would uriel tell me

23
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,400
You remembered hell
if you didn't?

24
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,400
Maybe because he's a
prick -- Might have
something to do with it.

25
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,800
Maybe,but he's
still an angel.

26
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,800
Yeah,an angel who was ready
to level an entire town.

27
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,460
Look,I don't know what --
Man: radical.

28
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,060
What else can I get
you guys?

29
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,030
Uh,I think we're good.
Yeah?

30
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,100
You want to try a couple
of fryer bombs

31
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,400
Or a chipotle
chili changa?

32
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,800
No,no,
we're still good.

33
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,030
Okay,awesome.

34
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,860
Sam,honestly,

35
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,230
I have no idea why uriel
told you what he did,okay?

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,960
Right.

37
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,300
What?
Okay.

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,030
Fine. Then look me
in the eye

39
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,730
And tell me
you don't remember a thing

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,360
From your time
down under.

41
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,930
I don't remember a thing
from my time down under.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,560
I don't remember,Sam!

43
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,360
Look,Dean,
I just want to help.

44
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,660
<i>You know everything I do. Okay?
That's all there is.</i>

45
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,500
Outstanding.
Dessert time?

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,730
Huh? Am I right?

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,860
Dude.
Listen,bros.

<i>You have got to try
our ice cream extreme.</i>

49

It's extreme.

50

Uh,no extremities,
please.

51
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,800
Just the --
Check?

52
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,630
All right,awesome.
Thanks.

53
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,200
All right,
so,where do we go from here?

54
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm not sure.

55
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,330
Uh,looks like
it's been pretty quiet lately.

56
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,960
No signs of demon activity,
no omens or portents I can see.

57
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,530
That's good news
for once.

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,160
Yeah,just
the typical smattering

59
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,860
Of crank ufo sightings

60
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,630
And one possible
vengeful spirit.

61
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,530
Here,check this out.
Uh...

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,060
Up in concrete,

Eyewitness reports
of a ghost

64
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,760
That's been haunting the showers
of a women's health facility.

65
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,060
The victim claims
that the ghost

66
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,930
Threw her down
a flight of stairs.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,230
<i>I can see
you're very interested.</i>

68

Women,showers.

69
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,130
We got to save
these people.

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,600
I'm not surprised

Chose to make contact
with me.

72
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,200
I'm something of a...

73
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,160
Natural sensitive.

74
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,800
I can sense that about you,
candace,that whole...

75
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,130
Sensitive thing.

76
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,400
So,what did you say
you're calling your book?

77
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,630
Oh,well,um...

78
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,630
Well,the working
title is...

79
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,060
"Supernatural."

80
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,930
Yeah,I've been crossing
the country,

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,430
Gathering stories
like yours.

82
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,400
But,anyways,you were telling
me about your encounter.

83
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,760
Yes. Well [sighs]

84
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,600
Once I saw the apparition,

85
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,030
That's when I started
to run.

86
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,830
And you said
the ghost chased you?

87
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,600
Not just that.
It knew my name.

88
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,130
It kept yelling,

89
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,730
"Mrs. Armstrong!
Mrs. Armstrong!"

90
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,230
And that's when I hit
the stairs and fell.

91
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,200
You fell?
The ghost didn't push you.

92
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,500
Oh,I don't --
I don't know.

93
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,930
<i>I mean,I think it did.</i>

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,430
Maybe.

95
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,000
Did you feel like it meant
to hurt you,

96
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,200
Like it was violent,or...

97
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,160
<i>It was a ghost.
I'm lucky to be alive.</i>

98
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,260
Anyway,I was at the bottom
of the stairs,

99
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,530
And that's when
it got weird.

100
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,460
[ Chuckles ]
it helped me up.

101
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,530
Say again?

102
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,060
Yeah.
It helped me up.

103
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,060
And it kept saying
over and over,

104
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,330
"Please,
don't tell my mom."

105
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,930
Yeah,that's weird.

106
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,660
Well,you pick up
anything?

107
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,600
No emf in the shower
or anywhere else.

108
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,900
This house is clean.

109
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,330
Yeah.
I'm not surprised.

110
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,100
I kind of got the feeling
back there

111
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,660
<i>That crazy pushed mrs. Armstrong
down the stairs.</i>

112
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,400
I got to tell you,
I'm pretty disappointed.

113
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,460
[ Exhales sharply ]
you wanted to save naked women.

114
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,060
Damn right I wanted to save
some naked women.

115
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,530
[ Chuckles lightly ]

116
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,960
Come on,guys,get him!

Boy: I got him!
I got him!

118

Run,forrest,run!

119
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,060
Sorry,Dean,but I
don't think anything's
going on around here.

120
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,060
Gus: how the hell was I supposed
to get a look at it?

121
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,060
It grabbed me from behind
and threw me into a tree!

122
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,560
<i>Something's going on.</i>

123

Man: yeah,okay,gus.
I understand you got shook up.

124
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,160
Anyone would be.

125
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,800
But don't you think it --

126
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,400
Don't you think
it had to be a bear?

127
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,960
I know a damn bear track
when I see one!

128
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,900
This thing didn't leave
bear tracks!

129
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,730
Its feet were huge!
Now,gus --

<i>It was bigfoot,hal --

Gus,you're not talking
sense here.

132

There's a bigfoot out there,

Yes,I can.

What the hell's going on
in this town?

And now a bigfoot
sighting?

144

Well,every hunter worth
his salt knows bigfoot's a hoax.

145
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,700
Well,maybe somebody's
pumping lsd

00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,300
<i>Makes a wish,
it turns on the well.</i>

357
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,630
Then it starts granting wishes
to all comers.

358
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,560
But the wishes get twisted.
You ask for a talking teddy...

359
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,160
You get a bipolar nut job.

360
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,730
And you get e. Coli.
Mm.

361
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,700
This thing has turned
more than one town

362
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,030
Upside down
over the centuries.

363
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,060
It's even wiped a few
off the map.

364
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,400
I mean,one person gets
their wish,it's trouble,

365
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,300
But everybody
gets their wish...
it's chaos.

366
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,630
Mm-Hmm.

367
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,160
Any way to stop it?

368
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,430
Yeah. One way.

369
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,530
We got to find
the first wisher.

370
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,030
Whoever dropped the coin in
and made the first wish,

371
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,130
They're the only ones
who can pull it back out

372
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,960
And reverse the wishes.

373
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,030
So for now,we've got a couple
of nutso dreams come true,

374
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,400
But once the word gets out
about the well,

375
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,500
Things are just gonna get
crazier and crazier.

377

but you are.

don't you?

What do you want
from me,huh? What?

The truth,Dean.

I just wish you'd talk to me.

sometime in the last two weeks.

supposed to know

Who else wished
for what when?
