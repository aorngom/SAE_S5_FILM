1
00:00:02,366 --> 00:00:05,921
Lilith is trying to break the 66 seals
to free lucifer from hell.

2
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:08,424
Lucifer will bring the apocalypse.

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,809
- Sam, I'm sorry.
- For what?

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,035
Does this mean I have
demon blood in me?

5
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:16,807
I don't want to be
the freak for once, Dean.

6
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,475
I want to be normal.

7
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:20,770
Your brother is headed
down a dangerous road, Dean.

8
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:24,315
Do you even know how far off
the reservation you've gone?

9
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,472
How far from normal, fromhuman?

10
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:28,444
If I didn't know you,
I would want to hunt you.

11
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,799
You want to know
if I know about the demon blood.

12
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:33,324
You didn't tell Dean?
Where the hell are you, Ruby?

13
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:36,005
I'm all out. Call me. I need more.

14
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:39,302
This is for your own good.

15
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:41,979
Guys?

16
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:45,956
<i>Guys, this isn't funny!</i>

17
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:10,223
- Let me out. This is not funny.
- Damn straight.

18
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,072
Come on, this is crazy.

19
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:16,026
Not until you dry out.

20
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,730
Look, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,826
I shouldn't have lied to you.
Open the door.

22
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:25,286
You don't have to apologize.

23
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:26,869
It's not your fault.

24
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:30,502
It's not your fault that you
lied to me over and over again.

25
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,092
I get it now.
You couldn't help it.

26
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,410
- I'm not some junkie!
- Really?

27
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:38,776
I guess I've just imagined how
strung out you've been lately.

28
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:41,058
You're actually trying

29
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,145
to twist this into some kind
of ridiculous drug intervention?

30
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,722
- If it smells like a duck.
- I'm not drinking

31
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:48,823
the demon blood forkicks.

32
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,540
I'm getting strong
enough to kill Lilith.

33
00:01:51,623 --> 00:01:52,734
- Strong?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:55,321
It's about as far away
from strong as you can get.

35
00:01:55,404 --> 00:01:57,241
Try weak. Try desperate.

36
00:01:57,466 --> 00:01:58,466
Pathetic.

37
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:01,760
Killing Lilith is what matters.

38
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,933
Or are you so busy being
self-righteous you forgot about her?

39
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:10,069
Lilith's gonna die.

40
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:12,572
Bobby and I will kill her.

41
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:14,677
- But not with you.
- You're not serious.

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,829
Congrats, Sammy.

43
00:02:15,912 --> 00:02:19,208
You just bought yourself
a benchwarmer seat to the apocalypse.

44
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:21,436
Dean. No, wait.

45
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:23,378
<i>Come back here!</i>

46
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:25,619
Dean!

47
00:02:26,368 --> 00:02:27,822
Let me out of here!

48
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:30,366
<i>Dean!</i>

49
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:32,024
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

50
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:35,727
Guys! Get down here!

51
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,260
Something's coming!

52
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:40,482
Hello, Sam.

53
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,978
It's a pleasure to see you again.

54
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:48,293
And looks like I have
you all to myself here.

55
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:49,852
Goodness.

56
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:53,255
How will we pass the time?

57
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,694
No, no, don't.

58
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:18,468
Alastair...

59
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:20,997
Please!

60
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:22,486
Please.

61
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,514
So polite all of a sudden.

62
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:28,869
Very nice.

63
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,023
I appreciate that.

64
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:39,029
No, no. Alastair.

65
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:53,315
Please! Please!

66
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,130
How long is this gonna go on?

67
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:11,640
Here, let me look it up
in my demon-detox manual.

68
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:14,063
Oh, wait.
No one ever wrote one.

69
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,194
No telling how long it'll take.

70
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:23,489
Hell, or if Sam will
even live through it.

71
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:31,994
Hello?

72
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:36,773
Suck dirt and die, Rufus.
You call me again, i'll kill you.

73
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:41,131
- What's up with Rufus?
- He knows.

74
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:49,802
I'm busy, you sumbitch.
This better be important.

75
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:12,496
The answer's "yes."

76
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,256
You're hallucinating.

77
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,044
That's right. It's me.

78
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:22,228
Or, I mean, it's you.

79
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:25,832
I'm losing my mind.

80
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:27,789
Definitely.

81
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,224
- What do you want?
- An explanation.

82
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,592
How could you do this to me?

83
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:39,991
- I thought we were gonna be normal.
- I tried. I did.

84
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,490
It didn't pan out that way.

85
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:45,070
Sorry, kid.

86
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:47,457
"Sorry, kid"?

87
00:06:47,864 --> 00:06:49,732
That's what you have to say?

88
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:51,515
It's all we ever wanted.

89
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,330
We were so close!
You got away from dad.

90
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,417
You quit hunting. You were gonna
become a lawyer and get married.

91
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:01,213
- Why did you blow it?!
- Look!

92
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,380
They killed Jessica.

93
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:06,629
If you hadn't run off with Dean,

94
00:07:06,712 --> 00:07:10,112
if you'd been there
to protect her, she'd still be alive.

95
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:12,088
I know.

96
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:14,016
Think Jess would want
you to turn into this?

97
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,134
She loved you.

98
00:07:16,932 --> 00:07:19,688
You think she would be happy
you using her as an excuse?

99
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:21,387
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:24,276
I am. But life doesn't

101
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,344
turn out the way you thought it
would when you were 14 years old.

102
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:30,737
We were never gonna be normal.
We were never gonna get away.

103
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:32,804
Grow up.

104
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:37,057
Maybe you're right.

105
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:39,936
Maybe there's...

106
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,365
No escape.

107
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:43,716
After all...

108
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:47,244
How can you run from
what's inside you?

109
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:51,868
The news.
And the news ain't good.

110
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:56,164
This is what Rufus called about?

111
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:59,478
"Key west sees
10 species go extinct"?

112
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:01,727
Yep. Plus, Alaska...

113
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:04,441
15-man fishing crew,
all stricken blind...

114
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:06,860
Cause unknown. New york...

115
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,988
Teacher goes postal, locks the door,
kills exactly 66 kids.

116
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:12,693
All this in a single day?

117
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:16,440
I looked them up.
There's no doubt about it.

118
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:18,864
They're all seals.
Breaking... fast.

119
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:23,423
- How many are left?
- Who knows?

120
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:24,899
Can't be many.

121
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,172
Where the hell are your angel pals?

122
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,466
You tell me.

123
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,476
I'm just wondering...

124
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,580
What?

125
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:39,476
With the apocalypse being

126
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,794
nigh and all,

127
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,472
is now really the right time to be

128
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,717
having this little domestic
drama of ours?

129
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,129
What do you mean?

130
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:50,250
Well, I don't like this any
more than you do, but...

131
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:53,407
Sam can kill demons.
He's got a shot

132
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,841
- at stopping armageddon.
- So, what,

133
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:57,582
sacrifice Sam's life,

134
00:08:57,985 --> 00:09:00,956
his soul, for the greater good?
Is that what you're saying?

135
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:04,251
Times are bad,
so let's use Sam as a nuclear warhead?

136
00:09:06,593 --> 00:09:10,278
I know you hate me for suggesting it.
I hate me for suggesting it.

137
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,342
I love that boy like a son.

138
00:09:13,604 --> 00:09:15,691
All I'm saying is, maybe he's

139
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,586
here right now instead
of on the battlefield,

140
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:21,804
'cause we love him too much.

141
00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:56,697
<i>Poor baby.</i>

142
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:01,261
Mom!

143
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,852
Sam.

144
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:07,940
You look just awful.

145
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:15,530
Let's hear it.

146
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,991
- Go ahead.
- What do you mean?

147
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:23,939
You're disappointed.

148
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,191
You never thought I'd...

149
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,777
turn out this way.

150
00:10:29,802 --> 00:10:30,802
I'm a...

151
00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:33,852
Pisspoor excuse for a son.

152
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,744
Your heart is broken.

153
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:43,100
Am I close?

154
00:10:43,988 --> 00:10:45,038
Not at all.

155
00:10:47,138 --> 00:10:48,689
You're doing the right thing.

156
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:52,529
What you're doing is brave.

157
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,989
You're not being crazy.
You're being practical.

158
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:02,413
Sam, I am so proud of you.

159
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:07,238
But...

160
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:09,902
But... Dean.

161
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,436
Your brother doesn't understand.

162
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:18,875
I was raised a hunter,
from a long line.

163
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:23,015
We understand that there
are gonna be hard choices.

164
00:11:23,927 --> 00:11:26,768
And we do what we have
to to get the job done.

165
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:31,087
Yes, our family is cursed.

166
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:34,376
But you...

167
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,946
You have the power
to turn it into a gift.

168
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,130
You can use it against them.

169
00:11:42,276 --> 00:11:43,376
For revenge?

170
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:45,990
No, for justice.

171
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:51,460
I know how scared you are.

172
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:56,301
What's...

173
00:11:57,943 --> 00:11:58,943
In me...

174
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:01,990
Mom?

175
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:04,222
- It's...
- Evil.

176
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:06,102
And you know it.

177
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:10,771
What if it's stronger than me?

178
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,289
Look at me.

179
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:16,061
What if Dean's right?

180
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:20,781
Dean can never know
how strong you are...

181
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:25,494
because Dean is weak.

182
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:29,373
Look at what he's done to you.

183
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:32,176
Locking you in here?
He's terrified.

184
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:35,525
He's in over his head.

185
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:38,992
You have to go on without him.

186
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:41,718
You have what it takes.

187
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:47,088
- You have to kill Lilith.
- Even if it kills me.

188
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:55,107
Make my death mean something.

189
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:58,555
I'm counting on you, Sam.

190
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,695
Don't let anyone
or anything get in your way.

191
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:03,914
Not even Dean.

192
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:42,612
Well, it's about time.

193
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,366
I've been screaming myself hoarse
out here for about 21/2 hours now.

194
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:48,047
What do you want?

195
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,763
You can start with what
the hell happened in Illinois.

196
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:53,196
What do you mean?

197
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:56,405
Cut the crap.
You were gonna tell me something.

198
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:58,188
Well, nothing of import.

199
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:02,591
You got ass-reamed in heaven.
But it was not "of import"? Dean.

200
00:14:03,612 --> 00:14:04,634
I can't.

201
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:07,497
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:13,344
Get to the reason
you really called me.

203
00:14:13,427 --> 00:14:15,027
It's about Sam, right?

204
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,706
Can he do it?

205
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:22,444
- Kill Lilith, stop the apocalypse?
- Possibly, yes.

206
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:27,564
But as you know,

207
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,327
he'd have to take certain steps.

208
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,163
Crank up the hell-blood regimen.

209
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,513
Consuming the amount of blood
it would take to kill Lilith

210
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:38,251
would change your brother forever.

211
00:14:39,676 --> 00:14:40,962
Most likely, he would

212
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,965
become the next creature
that you would feel compelled to kill.

213
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:49,836
There's no reason this would
have to come to pass, Dean.

214
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:55,460
We believe it's you, Dean,
not your brother.

215
00:14:57,556 --> 00:15:01,306
The only question for us is whether
you're willing to accept it.

216
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:04,977
Stand up and accept your role.

217
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:09,032
You are the one who will stop it.

218
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:16,994
If I do this...

219
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,980
Sammy doesn't have to?

220
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:24,631
If it gives you comfort
to see it that way.

221
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,885
God, you're a dick these days.

222
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,147
Fine. I'm in.

223
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:44,649
You give yourself over

224
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,568
wholly to the service
of god and his angels?

225
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:50,068
Yeah. Exactly.

226
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:51,811
Say it.

227
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:02,872
I give myself over wholly

228
00:16:03,698 --> 00:16:04,879
to serve god...

229
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:07,142
and you guys.

230
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:09,551
You swear to follow his will

231
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:11,386
and his word as swiftly and

232
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,513
obediently as you did
your own father's?

233
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,830
Yes. I swear.

234
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:22,305
Now what?

235
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,334
Now you wait.

236
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:28,941
And we call on you when it's time.

237
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,448
Guys! Help!

238
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:29,278
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but

239
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,258
you willingly signed up
to be the angels' bitch?

240
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:35,970
I'm sorry.
You prefer "sucker"?

241
00:17:37,398 --> 00:17:39,974
After everything you said about them,
now you trust them?

242
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:42,894
Come on,
give me a little credit, Bobby.

243
00:17:43,305 --> 00:17:45,105
I've never trusted them less.

244
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:48,154
I mean, they come on like shady
politicians from planet Vulcan!

245
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:51,236
- Well, then why in the hell...
- Because what other option do I have?!

246
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:54,364
It's either trust the angels,
or let Sammy trust a demon?!

247
00:17:57,064 --> 00:17:58,414
I see your point.

248
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,066
Do you hear that?

249
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:08,886
That's a little too much nothing.

250
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:27,480
- What if he's faking?
- You really think he would?

251
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:30,900
I think he'd do anything.

252
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:33,528
That ain't faking.

253
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,451
We're gonna have to tie him
down for his own safety.

254
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:00,564
Dean? You with me?

255
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,562
- Before he has another fit!
- Let's just get it over with!

256
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:25,693
We had to.

257
00:19:26,686 --> 00:19:29,786
The demon blood was flinging
you all over the room.

258
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:33,046
Tell me something, Sam.
Why did you do this to yourself?

259
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:37,675
You know why.

260
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,750
Right.

261
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:41,930
"Kill Lilith." The big excuse.

262
00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:45,128
But why?

263
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:48,631
What, revenge? Right?

264
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,564
- Of course.
- Revenge forwhat?

265
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:53,586
For sending me to hell?

266
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:57,264
Did you happen to notice i'm back?
Alive and kicking.

267
00:19:57,828 --> 00:20:00,106
- So what's the point?
- The point?

268
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:05,817
How about stop the damn apocalypse?

269
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,844
My gig! Not yours!

270
00:20:08,343 --> 00:20:09,791
The angels said so, remember?

271
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:12,677
God picked me, man.

272
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,964
So, have you got any
other fantastic excuses?

273
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:28,144
I'm gonna ask one more time.

274
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:31,479
Are we absolutely sure
we're doing the right thing?

275
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,766
Bobby, you saw what was happening
to him down there.

276
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:36,455
The demon blood is killing him.

277
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,725
No, it isn't.

278
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:40,572
- We are.
- What?

279
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:41,877
I'm sorry.

280
00:20:42,097 --> 00:20:44,575
I can't bite my tongue any longer.
We're killing him.

281
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,681
Keeping him locked up down there.

282
00:20:46,764 --> 00:20:48,538
This "cold turkey"
thing isn't working.

283
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,536
If he doesn't get what he needs...

284
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:52,688
Soon...

285
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:55,297
Sam's not gonna last much longer.

286
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:01,718
No.

287
00:21:03,437 --> 00:21:05,325
I'm not giving him demon blood.
I won't do it.

288
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:06,795
And if he dies?

289
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,486
Then at least he dies human!

290
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:13,180
I know why you really
drink that blood, Sam.

291
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:16,729
Just leave me alone.

292
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:20,958
Makes you feel strong.

293
00:21:21,438 --> 00:21:22,333
Invincible.

294
00:21:23,063 --> 00:21:25,265
A big bad wolf
in a world of little pigs.

295
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,552
No.
You're wrong, Dean.

296
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:29,626
It's more than that, isn't it?

297
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:33,871
It's because your whole life,
you felt different.

298
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,414
Am I right?

299
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,072
Stop.

300
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:40,214
I hit a little close to home?

301
00:21:42,873 --> 00:21:44,641
Not different
because you were some...

302
00:21:45,076 --> 00:21:48,385
lonely kid or because
of your weirdo family...

303
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:49,204
Stop it.

304
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,397
- Because you're a monster.
- Shut up!

305
00:21:56,726 --> 00:22:00,007
Just shut the hell up!

306
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,336
You were always a monster.

307
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:06,269
And you only feel right when you're
sucking down more poison

308
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,305
and more evil!

309
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,455
I would die for him in a second.

310
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:16,296
But I won't let him
do this to himself.

311
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:18,544
I can't.

312
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:22,478
I guess I found my line.

313
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:27,541
I won't let my brother turn
into a monster.

314
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,255
Monster, Sam.

315
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,454
- You're a monster.
- Dean, no.

316
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,917
I tried so hard to pretend
that we were brothers,

317
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:39,235
that you weren't one
of the filthy things that we hunt.

318
00:22:39,465 --> 00:22:41,818
But we're not even the same species.

319
00:22:42,283 --> 00:22:44,153
You're nothing to me.

320
00:22:45,986 --> 00:22:47,756
Don't say that to me.

321
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:45,756
Hello?

322
00:24:08,123 --> 00:24:09,033
Someone here?

323
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,614
What did you do?

324
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:23,573
You shouldn't have come.

325
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:25,627
Why would you let out
Sam Winchester?

326
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,442
- Those were my orders.
- Orders?

327
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:33,124
Cass... you saw him.

328
00:25:34,185 --> 00:25:36,127
He's drinking demonblood.

329
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,786
It's so much worse than we thought.

330
00:25:39,565 --> 00:25:41,414
Dean was trying to stop him.

331
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:45,501
You really shouldn't have come.

332
00:26:28,997 --> 00:26:31,123
The only place you're going
is back inside with me.

333
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:37,006
No.

334
00:26:38,934 --> 00:26:39,972
Damn it, boy.

335
00:26:42,838 --> 00:26:44,129
You won't shoot me, Bobby.

336
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:47,333
Don't test me.

337
00:26:50,372 --> 00:26:51,363
You won't do it.

338
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:01,246
You can't do it.

339
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,815
We're trying to help you, Sam.

340
00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:20,509
Then shoot.

341
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,258
How in the hell did he get out?

342
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:08,559
Maybe he had help.

343
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,480
Room full of busted devil's traps.

344
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,622
Demons?

345
00:28:14,229 --> 00:28:14,975
Ruby.

346
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:16,665
That'd be my guess.

347
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:19,231
How did she even touch the door?

348
00:28:20,103 --> 00:28:21,437
You think she's got the mojo?

349
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,645
I didn't think so.

350
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,380
I don't know, man.

351
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:31,048
What difference does it make?

352
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:33,544
How he got gone ain't as important
as where he got gone to.

353
00:28:34,104 --> 00:28:36,551
I'll tell you one thing.
At this point, i hope he's with ruby.

354
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:37,848
Why?

355
00:28:37,931 --> 00:28:40,181
'cause killing her's the next big item
on my to-do list.

356
00:28:40,808 --> 00:28:42,803
I thought you were
on call for angel duty.

357
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,890
I am on call... In my car,
on my way to murder the bitch.

358
00:28:46,967 --> 00:28:47,763
One thing.

359
00:28:47,962 --> 00:28:48,793
What?

360
00:28:49,338 --> 00:28:50,625
Sam don't want to be found.

361
00:28:51,336 --> 00:28:53,633
Which means he's gonna be
damn near impossible to find.

362
00:28:56,304 --> 00:28:57,440
Yeah, we'll see.

363
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:27,973
Honeymoon suite.
Really, I'm flattered.

364
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:31,736
Did you bust me out of that room?

365
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:32,762
How could I?

366
00:29:32,845 --> 00:29:35,238
The whole thing's engineered
to bite me in the ass.

367
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:38,295
Then how did I get out of there?

368
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:40,835
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

369
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:43,509
You're out.
That's all that matters.

370
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,866
I'm glad you're here.

371
00:29:46,212 --> 00:29:48,702
Yeah?
Where the hell have you been?

372
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,396
- I got here as quick as I could.
- I mean the past three weeks!

373
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:52,248
I've been calling you!

374
00:29:52,484 --> 00:29:54,562
I've been pretty deep in it,
trying to dig out Lilith.

375
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:56,909
Sometimes I can't sit around
and check my voicemail.

376
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,898
I'm sorry you're hurting.

377
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:02,586
Really.

378
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,195
I had no idea
that Dean would do that to you.

379
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:09,604
You and me both.

380
00:30:13,341 --> 00:30:16,438
You didn't book this joint just
to impress me, did you?

381
00:30:16,762 --> 00:30:18,352
Dean's gonna come after me.

382
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:23,115
And he knows my habits,
my aliases, everything.

383
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:26,115
He know sexactly
which motel I'd pick.

384
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,982
Hence the room.

385
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,533
Whatever it takes to shake him.

386
00:30:32,054 --> 00:30:33,307
It won't be easy.

387
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:35,017
He knows you better than anyone.

388
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:38,772
Not as well as he thinks.

389
00:30:39,962 --> 00:30:41,028
You know, it's sad.

390
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:44,243
What?

391
00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:48,330
That things have gotten
this bad between you two.

392
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:33,355
Police found my car.

393
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:36,644
Abandoned in an alley
in Jamestown, North Dakota.

394
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:38,519
He's switching up.

395
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,439
Any other cars stolen in Jamestown?

396
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,365
Two.

397
00:31:41,448 --> 00:31:42,775
1999 Honda Civic...

398
00:31:43,087 --> 00:31:43,814
Blue...

399
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:46,153
Nice and anonymous, like Sam likes.

400
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:47,860
What was the other one?

401
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:51,283
White'05 escalade with custom rims.

402
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:52,692
It's a neon sign.

403
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:54,397
You're right.
He'd never take that.

404
00:31:55,563 --> 00:31:56,914
Which is exactly what he did.

405
00:31:58,027 --> 00:31:59,108
You think?

406
00:31:59,963 --> 00:32:00,936
I know that kid.

407
00:32:02,262 --> 00:32:04,048
All right, I'll head
in that direction.

408
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:06,549
You stay here,
ride the police databases.

409
00:32:08,783 --> 00:32:10,162
We got to find him quick.

410
00:32:12,937 --> 00:32:14,548
Your appetite's gotten much bigger.

411
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,114
What's that supposed to mean?

412
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:21,772
Sam, relax. It's okay.

413
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,799
It's good.

414
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,901
It just means you're getting stronger.
That's all.

415
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:28,097
It means you're
strong enough to kill Lilith.

416
00:32:29,172 --> 00:32:31,615
Just in time, too,
because the final seals are breaking.

417
00:32:32,714 --> 00:32:33,884
How many are left?

418
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:36,620
- Three? Two?
- What?!

419
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:38,539
Where are the angles?

420
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:40,249
Screwing the pooch,
wherever they are.

421
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:43,419
It's looking more and more like we're
getting down to the final seal.

422
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:46,466
And I found out something big.

423
00:32:47,188 --> 00:32:47,965
What?

424
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:49,717
Seal 66?

425
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:52,885
It can't be broken
by just any demon.

426
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,472
Apparently,
only Lucifer's first can do it.

427
00:32:56,368 --> 00:32:57,608
"Lucifer's first"?

428
00:32:58,955 --> 00:33:00,311
Demon sunday-school story.

429
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,647
God prefers humans to angels.

430
00:33:04,385 --> 00:33:05,705
Lucifer gets jealous.

431
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,251
And then he gets creative.

432
00:33:07,334 --> 00:33:10,400
And he twists and tempts a human soul
into the very first demon...

433
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:12,590
As a "screw you" to god.

434
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:15,443
It's what got him locked up
in the first place.

435
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,299
That was Lilith?

436
00:33:19,236 --> 00:33:21,276
She's way older than she looks.

437
00:33:23,547 --> 00:33:25,117
Wait, so...

438
00:33:26,734 --> 00:33:29,300
If lilith is the only one
who can break the final seal,

439
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:31,284
if I get to her in time...

440
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,844
Then lucifer never busts out
of his cage... exactly.

441
00:33:34,182 --> 00:33:34,986
Great.

442
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,835
You figure out where she is?

443
00:33:36,918 --> 00:33:38,299
That bitch can hide.

444
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:42,141
Buti finally have a lead on someone
who might be able to help us.

445
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,397
I closed in on a member
of Lilith's entourage.

446
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:48,131
You might call her a...

447
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:49,985
Personal chef.

448
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,476
Chef? Seriously?

449
00:33:53,989 --> 00:33:55,049
What does she eat?

450
00:33:56,647 --> 00:33:57,857
You don't want to know.

451
00:34:00,682 --> 00:34:02,712
Did you hear about
that horrible thing at St.Paul's?

452
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:03,821
No.

453
00:34:04,297 --> 00:34:07,828
One of the neonatal nurses walked
right off the unit with two babies.

454
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,047
- You are kidding me.
- Swear to god.

455
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:13,437
Worked there 17 years, then one day,
out of the blue, she just does it.

456
00:34:19,747 --> 00:34:21,539
That's just horrifying.

457
00:34:22,034 --> 00:34:24,659
Now she's saying that she doesn't
even rember what happened.

458
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,381
Like she was possessed.

459
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:28,673
- Nuts.
- I know.

460
00:34:29,586 --> 00:34:31,186
Who could ever lay a finger on them?

461
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:32,485
I know.

462
00:34:34,412 --> 00:34:35,608
They're just delicious.

463
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:50,058
So, our demon gourmet nurse...

464
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:51,814
... you sure?

465
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:54,763
She'll be there.

466
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,895
Graveyard shift.
Tomorrow night.

467
00:34:57,536 --> 00:35:00,347
In the meantime, if you're gonna be
strong enough to kill Lilith,

468
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,476
you're gonna need more
than I can give you now.

469
00:35:06,506 --> 00:35:07,393
Sam.

470
00:35:09,104 --> 00:35:10,807
Come on.
It's okay.

471
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,332
I know, I need more.
I get it.

472
00:35:13,415 --> 00:35:15,553
I know it's okay.
I just...

473
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,047
I wish he'd trusted me, you know?

474
00:35:20,574 --> 00:35:21,429
I'm sorry.

475
00:35:23,644 --> 00:35:24,560
I just hope...

476
00:35:26,382 --> 00:35:27,900
You know, when all this is over...

477
00:35:30,663 --> 00:35:31,975
I hope we can fix things.

478
00:35:37,228 --> 00:35:40,268
The cops found the escalade
in a ditch outside Elk River.

479
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:42,431
- How far away am I?
- Couple of hours.

480
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:46,225
I pulled up a weather map,
made some calls.

481
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,078
There's a town
not far from there, Coldspring,

482
00:35:49,338 --> 00:35:50,705
lighting up with demon signs.

483
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:52,170
That's a good place to look.

484
00:35:53,165 --> 00:35:54,677
- Hey, listen.
- What?

485
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:56,069
Us finding Sam?

486
00:35:56,978 --> 00:35:59,865
That's got to be about getting him back,
not pushing him away.

487
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,128
Right.

488
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:04,704
- I know you're mad, Dean.
- I understand.

489
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,365
You got a right to be.
But...

490
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:07,967
I'm just saying...

491
00:36:08,798 --> 00:36:09,954
Be good to him anyway.

492
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,196
You got to get through to him.

493
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,337
Let her go!

494
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,104
Just take it easy.

495
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,892
That must have been someparty
you two had going,

496
00:37:01,832 --> 00:37:04,183
considering how hard you tried
to keep me from crashing it.

497
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,276
Well, solid try, but...

498
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,114
Here I am.

499
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,908
Dean, I'm glad you're here.

500
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,580
Look... let's just talk about this.

501
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:16,707
Soon as she's dead,
we can talk all you want.

502
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,198
- Ruby, get out of here.
- She's not going anywhere.

503
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:29,079
She's poison, Sam!

504
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,843
- It's not what you think, Dean.
- Look what she did to you!

505
00:37:33,356 --> 00:37:35,019
She up and vanishes,
weeks at a time,

506
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:36,779
leaves you cracking out
for another hit!

507
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:38,303
She was looking for Lilith!

508
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:42,454
That is french for "manipulating
your ass 10 ways from sunday."

509
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:43,679
You're wrong, Dean.

510
00:37:45,884 --> 00:37:47,351
Sam, you're lying to yourself.

511
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:50,364
I just...

512
00:37:50,793 --> 00:37:52,263
Want you to be okay.

513
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:56,690
You would do the same for me.
You know you would.

514
00:37:57,499 --> 00:37:58,478
Just listen.

515
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,233
Just listen for a second.

516
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,743
We got a lead
on a demon close to Lilith.

517
00:38:08,173 --> 00:38:09,372
Come with us, Dean.

518
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:11,132
We'll do this together.

519
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,206
That sounds great.

520
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,484
As long as it's you and me.

521
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:16,960
Demon bitch is a deal breaker.

522
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,975
You kiss her goodbye,
we can go right now.

523
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:22,119
I can't.

524
00:38:22,705 --> 00:38:23,774
Dean, I need her...

525
00:38:24,058 --> 00:38:25,343
To help me kill Lilith.

526
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:27,556
I know you can't wrap
your head around it.

527
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,810
But maybe, one day...

528
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:30,615
You'll understand.

529
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:35,145
I'm the only one
who can do this, Dean.

530
00:38:40,757 --> 00:38:42,528
No, you're not the one
who's gonna do this.

531
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,947
Right. That's right. I forgot.
The angels think it's you.

532
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,952
- You don't think I can?
- No.

533
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:49,126
You can't.

534
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,086
- You're not strong enough.
- And who the hell are you?

535
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:53,453
I'm being practical here.

536
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,290
I'm doing what needs to be done.

537
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:56,687
Yeah?

538
00:38:57,224 --> 00:38:58,961
You're not gonna do
a single damn thing.

539
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,812
Stop bossing me around, Dean!

540
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:03,172
Look.

541
00:39:04,222 --> 00:39:08,454
My whole life, you take the wheel,
you call the shots.

542
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:11,181
And I trust you
because you are my brother.

543
00:39:12,323 --> 00:39:16,622
Now, I am asking you, for once...

544
00:39:17,597 --> 00:39:18,646
Trust me.

545
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,160
No.

546
00:39:26,337 --> 00:39:28,407
- You don't know what you're doing.
- Yes, I do.

547
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,574
- Then that's worse!
- Why?

548
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:31,858
I'm telling you...

549
00:39:31,941 --> 00:39:34,366
Because it's not something that
you're doing! It's what you are!

550
00:39:37,086 --> 00:39:38,146
It means...

551
00:39:39,948 --> 00:39:40,706
What?

552
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:45,923
No.

553
00:39:51,727 --> 00:39:52,475
Say it.

554
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:57,324
It means you're a monster.

555
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,964
You don't know me.

556
00:41:15,952 --> 00:41:16,977
You never did.

557
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,112
And you never will.

558
00:41:24,766 --> 00:41:26,010
You walk out that door...

559
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:29,164
Don't you ever come back.
