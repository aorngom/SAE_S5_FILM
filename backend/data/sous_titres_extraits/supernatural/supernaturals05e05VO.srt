1
00:00:00,724 --> 00:00:02,470
I just don't think i can trust you.

2
00:00:03,595 --> 00:00:05,683
You think i'll take
one look at a demon

3
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:07,675
and suddenly fall off the wagon,

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,231
as if, after everything,
i haven't learned my lesson.

5
00:00:10,356 --> 00:00:11,837
Have you?

6
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:17,004
- I know you don't trust me.
- So, what are you saying?

7
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:19,085
It's best we just
go our separate ways.

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,673
- I think you're right.
- You know who i am.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,590
You're the one.
You're my vessel.

10
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:26,693
That'll never happen.

11
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,202
- You're the michael sword.
- I'm the sword?

12
00:00:29,327 --> 00:00:31,181
- You're michael's weapon.
- I'm a vessel?

13
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:32,390
You're the vessel.

14
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:34,624
You want back in...

15
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:36,359
- i won't let you down.
- I know it.

16
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:46,823
OK, buddy, what's so important
you couldn't tell me over the phone?

17
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:48,447
Trust me.

18
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:50,088
It's important.

19
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,377
Wait a minute.
You're not...

20
00:00:54,978 --> 00:00:56,612
you're not telling me
that this is...

21
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:58,825
you found it?!

22
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:09,926
You found it.

23
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:15,339
Oh... my... god.

24
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:17,989
Are you sure?

25
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:19,697
Vin number's a match.

26
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:23,182
How much did you pay?

27
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:25,618
- A lot.
- Come on. How much?

28
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:27,987
A lot.

29
00:01:28,112 --> 00:01:29,472
I'll bet.

30
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:40,867
- You start her up yet?
- Been waiting for you.

31
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:43,640
- Waiting to rub my nose in it, right?
- Exactly.

32
00:01:43,765 --> 00:01:45,198
Wait.

33
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:48,141
We need to record this
for posterity's sake.

34
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:49,308
Great idea.

35
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:50,901
Yeah. Great idea.

36
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:53,203
That...

37
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:00,966
the critics call it a blockbust...

38
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:17,727
you all right, man?

39
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,630
I thought i heard something.

40
00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:34,705
Oh, my god.

41
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:45,705
= 505 =

42
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:48,705
= Supernatural Team =

43
00:03:01,051 --> 00:03:02,505
What's with this job?

44
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:05,377
Dude suffers a head-on
collision in a parked car?

45
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:08,387
- I'd say that's worth checking out.
- Yeah, definitely.

46
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:11,696
But we got bigger problems,
don't you think?

47
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:15,421
I'm sure the apocalypse will
still be there when we get back.

48
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,464
Right, yeah, but,

49
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:20,333
if the colt is really
out there somewhere.

50
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,460
Yeah, we've been looking for
three weeks. We got bupkus.

51
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:27,139
But, dean...

52
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,343
if we're gonna ice the devil...

53
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:32,611
this is what we're doing, okay?

54
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,137
End of discussion.

55
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:43,286
It's just that this
is our first real case

56
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:44,814
back at it together.

57
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:48,714
I think we ought to ease into it,
put the training wheels back on.

58
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,948
You think i need training wheels?

59
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:55,925
We need training wheels.
You and me, as a team.

60
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:06,979
I really want this
to be a fresh start, you know?

61
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:08,505
For the both of us.

62
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:32,038
Agents bonham and copeland.

63
00:04:32,163 --> 00:04:34,206
Rick carnegie.
Good to know you.

64
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:36,493
You're here on account
of cal hopkins' death?

65
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:38,793
Afraid you came
a long way for nothing.

66
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:40,892
We already booked
the guy that did it.

67
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,174
I'm sorry.
Who do you think did it?

68
00:04:56,487 --> 00:04:58,725
Sicko taped his own handiwork.

69
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,300
I don't follow.

70
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:03,126
It was jim grossman that killed cal.

71
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,603
Wait. What?

72
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:07,195
He was the only one
on the scene for miles.

73
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,540
They were best friends.

74
00:05:08,665 --> 00:05:11,285
Most violent crimes are committed
by someone close to the victim.

75
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,480
And how exactly did jim slam cal
into a windshield

76
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,229
with all the force
of an 80-mile-per-hour crash?

77
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:20,329
Drugs, maybe?

78
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:24,298
You know
this ain't brain surgery, boys.

79
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:27,059
Whatever it looks like,
that's what it usually is.

80
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:28,724
It's simple.

81
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:30,786
"Simple." Right.

82
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:33,630
Right.
If you don't mind,

83
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:35,769
we'd like to speak
to jim grossman anyway.

84
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:38,232
I was in the house when it happened.
I didn't even see it.

85
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:40,406
And for argument's sake,
say we believe you.

86
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:43,142
- Why would you? The cops didn't.
- We're not your typical cops.

87
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,176
Please, just tell us what you saw.

88
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,139
It's not what i saw.
It's what i heard.

89
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:51,021
Tires squealing, glass breaking.

90
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,011
It was the car that did it.

91
00:05:56,987 --> 00:05:59,358
- The car?
- I heard about the curse,

92
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:01,222
but i just thought
it was a load of crap.

93
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:03,039
Curse?
What do you mean, curse?

94
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:05,158
The car.
Little bastard.

95
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,835
Little bastard?
As in the little bastard?

96
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,532
Wait.
What's little bastard?

97
00:06:11,657 --> 00:06:13,708
It's james dean's car.
It's the one he was killed in.

98
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,164
Yeah, that's the one.

99
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:17,209
Cal had been looking for it
for years.

100
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:18,942
Hell, we both had.

101
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:20,685
But he found it first.

102
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:26,145
We are definitely checking this out.

103
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:34,016
So, what, this is like "christine"?

104
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,645
No, "christine" is fiction.

105
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:38,673
This is real.

106
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,293
Enlighten me.

107
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:47,039
After james dean died,
his mechanic bought the wreckage,

108
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:48,802
and he fixed it up.

109
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,968
And it repaid him by falling on him.

110
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:55,847
Then tony mchenry was killed
when it locked up on the racetrack.

111
00:06:55,972 --> 00:06:58,774
Death follows
this car around like exhaust.

112
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:01,632
Nobody touches it
and comes away in one piece.

113
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,849
Then in 1970, it vanished
off the back of a truck.

114
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,395
Nobody's ever seen it since.

115
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,630
I'm telling you, man.
If this...

116
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:14,251
if this car is little bastard,
i will bet you dollars to doughnuts

117
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:17,336
- it's what killed the guy.
- How do we find out?

118
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:18,914
Cal matched the vin number,

119
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,554
but the only real way to know
is the engine number.

120
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,340
- I'm guessing the engine number...
- on the engine.

121
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:26,554
Yeah.

122
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:35,360
You want me to do it?

123
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,241
No, i've got it.

124
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:44,975
Okay, baby...

125
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:47,931
i'm not gonna hurt you, so...

126
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:50,570
don't hurt me.

127
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:16,283
Need a flashlight?

128
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:18,755
No.

129
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,901
Don't do anything.
Just go away.

130
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:26,044
- You... okay.
- Don't speak, all right?

131
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:29,399
In fact, don't even look at her.
She might not like it.

132
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:09,648
Find out who owned it.
Not just the last owner...

133
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:12,169
you got to take it
all the way back to 1955.

134
00:09:12,743 --> 00:09:14,777
That's a lot of research.

135
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,135
I guess i just made your afternoon.

136
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:25,966
You want to be an actress?

137
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:27,790
That is so funny. Because

138
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,336
i am actually...

139
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:33,195
an agent
for william morris endeavor.

140
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:39,602
You mind filling me up again?

141
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,442
You're a star, all right?

142
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,185
Took me a while, but i traced
all the car's previous owners.

143
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,074
- Any of them die bloody?
- Nope. In fact...

144
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:53,015
are you in a bar?

145
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,531
No, i'm in a restaurant...

146
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:57,724
here's your beer.

147
00:09:57,986 --> 00:09:59,365
Thanks.

148
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,134
That happens to have a bar.

149
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:04,270
I've been working my ass off here.

150
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,535
World's smallest violin, pal.

151
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,451
I spent the afternoon
up christine's skirt. I needed a drink.

152
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,580
- Actually, you didn't.
- Meaning?

153
00:10:11,705 --> 00:10:13,746
The car's first owner
was a cardiologist

154
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:16,848
in philadelphia, drove it
till he died in 1972.

155
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:18,216
So you're saying...

156
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:20,819
that porsche is not,
nor has it ever been,

157
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:22,154
james dean's car.

158
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,756
It's a fake little bastard.

159
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:26,114
Then, what was it
that killed the guy?

160
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,584
Good question.

161
00:10:33,814 --> 00:10:35,334
Okay, mr. Hill.
I finish.

162
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,073
Thank you, consuela.
Have a good night.

163
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,129
Oh, my god.

164
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:54,257
It's you.

165
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:57,370
But you're dead.

166
00:10:57,815 --> 00:10:59,982
You're supposed to be dead.

167
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:22,444


168
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:25,727
I want you to use a fine-tooth comb.

169
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,553
The evidence is here.
Just got to find it.

170
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,864
Heard you got another weird one.

171
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:33,503
It's a little
strange on the surface, i admit,

172
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:36,953
but, you know,
once you look at the facts...

173
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:40,410
william hill died from
a gunshot wound to the head.

174
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:43,764
No gun, no gunpowder, no bullet.

175
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:45,926
Nope.
Nothin' strange about that.

176
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:50,394
There's got to be a reasonable
explanation. There always is.

177
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,504
What's your reasonable explanation?

178
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:55,779
Professional killer.

179
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:57,380
Come again?

180
00:11:57,505 --> 00:12:00,126
Cia, nsa,
one of them trained assassins...

181
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:01,942
like in "michael clayton."

182
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,926
Right.

183
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:10,486
You're welcome to look around,

184
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:12,562
but these guys
don't leave fingerprints.

185
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:14,226
Mind if we talk with the witness?

186
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:16,461
Be my guest.
She's not making any sense.

187
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:18,964
And she's not making any sense
in spanish, either.

188
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,279
Right.

189
00:12:21,404 --> 00:12:24,240
No puedo vivir aquí.
Necesito mi familia.

190
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:27,243
Me voy ahora.
Me voy a la casa.

191
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:30,704
No... me voy a la casa
en el salvador ahora.

192
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:32,873
Consuela alvarez?

193
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:35,358
Fbi.

194
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:37,754
Now, you said you saw something

195
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,088
in the professor's house.
Right? Something in the window.

196
00:12:40,213 --> 00:12:42,408
Estaba sacando la basura.
Imiré por la ventana

197
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:45,412
y vi al
hombre que mató al señor hill!

198
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:48,561
Señora alvarez.
Cálmese, por favor.

199
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:55,438
Díganos lo que vio.

200
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:57,694
- Nice.
- Freshman spanish.

201
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,434
Era alto, muy alto.

202
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,179
Y llevaba el abrigo negro largo

203
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,168
y tenía bigotes.

204
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,618
Tall man. Very tall.

205
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:11,287
With a long black coat.

206
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:13,890
And, a beard?
Beard.

207
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:15,424
Y un sombrero.

208
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:16,993
Dude was wearing a sombrero?

209
00:13:17,118 --> 00:13:18,974
A hat. Not a...

210
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,951
no.
Un sombrero alto.

211
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:23,232
- A tall hat?
- Like a top hat?

212
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:26,602
Iun sombrero alto!
Muy alto.

213
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:28,983
You mean like a stovepipe hat?

214
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,534
- Sí.
- Yeah, like abraham lincoln.

215
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:35,202
Sí. El presidente lincoln.

216
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:40,207
Abraham lincoln killed mr. Hill.

217
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:45,889
So i go home now?

218
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:48,410
- Sí. Gracias.
- Gracias.

219
00:14:10,771 --> 00:14:11,805
What?

220
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:20,047
Here's a freeze-frame
from jim grossman's video.

221
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:25,268
Am i crazy, or does that
look like james dean?

222
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:27,955
That looks like james dean.

223
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,269
We got abraham lincoln
and james dean?

224
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:35,772
Famous ghosts?

225
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:37,306
Maybe.

226
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:39,028
That's just silly.

227
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:42,841
No, actually, there's
a ton of lore on famous ghosts.

228
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,315
More than the, you know,
not-famous kinds.

229
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,408
I'm surprised
we haven't run into one before.

230
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:49,882
But now we got two of them?
Two extremely pissed-off ghosts?

231
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:52,779
- Who are apparently ganking their fans.
- What do you mean?

232
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,492
Professor Hill was a civil war nut.

233
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:57,771
He dug Lincoln.

234
00:14:58,135 --> 00:15:00,031
And Cal must have been
a James Dean freak.

235
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:02,891
He spent 17 years of his life
tracking down the guy's car.

236
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:07,692
So, you're saying that we've got two
super-famous, super-pissed-off ghosts

237
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:09,950
killing their super fans?

238
00:15:12,716 --> 00:15:14,164
That's what it looks like.

239
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:17,374
That is "muchos loco".

240
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:19,289
"Muy."

241
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:21,836
Not "muchos."

242
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:25,920
The big question is
what the hell are they doing here?

243
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,147
Ghosts usually haunt
the places they lived.

244
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:31,522
I get Abraham Lincoln
at the white house.

245
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:33,444
And James Dean
at a racetrack, but...

246
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,956
What the hell are they doing
in Canton?

247
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,612
You got to be kidding me.

248
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:51,020
What?

249
00:15:56,848 --> 00:15:58,498
You got to be kidding me.

250
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:21,755
Dude, he's short.

251
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:25,378
Gandhi was a great man.

252
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:27,569
Yeah, for a smurf.

253
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:32,784
Sorry to keep you waiting.
This is our busiest time of the year.

254
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,620
This is busy?

255
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:39,122
Well, not right now.
But it's early.

256
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:40,970
It's 4:30.

257
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:42,740
So, what can I do for you?

258
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:44,801
We are writing a piece
for travel magazine.

259
00:16:45,348 --> 00:16:48,648
On how totally non-sucky
wax museums are.

260
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:51,551
That's fantastic!
A little press, just what we need.

261
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:53,846
Great, we're interested
in a few of your exhibits,

262
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,264
specifically Abraham Lincoln
and James Dean.

263
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,093
Two of our most popular displays.

264
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,185
Oh, yeah?
So they bring in a lot of visitors?

265
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,551
We have our regulars.

266
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:05,607
I don't suppose that William Hill and
Cal Hopkins were regulars, were they?

267
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:08,109
As a matter of fact, they were.

268
00:17:08,463 --> 00:17:11,359
I heard what happened to them.
That's tragic, just tragic.

269
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:14,240
That's not gonna be
in the article, is it?

270
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,680
No. Of course not.

271
00:17:16,193 --> 00:17:19,829
You know, I got to tell you, that...
that Lincoln is so lifelike.

272
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:24,041
You can just imagine
him moving around.

273
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:26,177
You ever see anything like that?

274
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,139
Is there anything you can think of
that would make your museum...

275
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:37,223
Unusual?
You know, for the article.

276
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,882
I'll say. There isn't
another place like us, not anywhere.

277
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:43,395
- How so?
- For one, that's honest Abe's real hat.

278
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:46,125
It is?

279
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:48,525
Almost like his remains.

280
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:52,828
I guess.

281
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:56,449
You wouldn't happen to have
any of James Dean's personal effects,

282
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,418
- Would you?
- Got his key chain.

283
00:17:58,629 --> 00:17:59,885
We got a bunch of stuff...

284
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,664
Gandhi's bifocals, FDR's iron lung,

285
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:03,868
This.

286
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:10,153
- And who did that belong to?
- The fonz. Seasons 2 through 4.

287
00:18:11,997 --> 00:18:14,112
That's really cool... ish.

288
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:15,774
This? This is nothing.

289
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:17,887
I've been working on
a new collection of figures,

290
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,605
stuff that'll really wow the kids.

291
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,679
- The kids?
- Yeah, gen "Y".

292
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,894
Computer games,
cellphones, "sexting".

293
00:18:25,992 --> 00:18:27,204
They're just fads.

294
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:29,226
I'm gonna make
wax museums hip again.

295
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:54,499
Abraham Lincoln and James Dean.

296
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:55,968
Can you believe that?

297
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,932
Why so kill-crazy?

298
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,737
Maybe the apocalypse has
got them all hot and bothered.

299
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:02,932
We all know whose fault that is.

300
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,185
I'm sorry but it's true.

301
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,465
I'll call you later.
Bye.

302
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:13,791
What's going on?

303
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,601
Did you get the trunk packed up?

304
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:17,453
The trunk's packed.
Who was on the phone?

305
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:18,875
Bobby.
And?

306
00:19:19,615 --> 00:19:20,491
Nothing.

307
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:24,387
So, we're just gonna pretend
I didn't hear what I just heard?

308
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:27,725
Pretend or don't pretend,
whatever floats your boat.

309
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:30,150
This was supposed to be
a fresh start, Dean.

310
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:32,128
This is about as fresh as it gets.

311
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:33,765
Now, we going or not?

312
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:10,084
Check it out.

313
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:14,753
Four score and seven years ago,
I had a funny hat.

314
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:19,941
- I can't have any fun with this?
- Let's just torch the objects,

315
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,428
torch the ghosts,
and get out of here, okay?

316
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:24,597
I'll go grab
"East of Eden's" key chain.

317
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,264
Is that Gandhi?!
Yeah!

318
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,067
Dude, he's squirrelly.

319
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,399
Get the...

320
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,740
Get the what?!

321
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:06,936
Glasses!

322
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:26,829
You couldn't have been a fan
of someone cool?

323
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,745
Really? Gandhi?

324
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:33,257


325
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:40,587
You ready to blow this joint?

326
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:45,899
Didn't it strike you as strange,
the way Gandhi just vanished?

327
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:47,431
Strange how?

328
00:22:47,556 --> 00:22:49,242
No screaming, no big flameout.

329
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,554
That isn't the way
ghosts usually go.

330
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,287
Still I torched, he vanished.

331
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:54,729
Yeah, but i...

332
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:56,195
also, I feel like he was...

333
00:22:57,313 --> 00:22:58,873
Trying to get a bite out of me.

334
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:02,144
- A bite?
- Yeah, like he was hungry.

335
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:05,276
But the thing is, Gandhi...
or the real Gandhi...

336
00:23:05,744 --> 00:23:06,759
He was a...

337
00:23:07,824 --> 00:23:08,626
A what?

338
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:11,673
Spit it out.

339
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:14,052
He was a fruitarian.

340
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,586
Let me get this straight.

341
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:21,448
Your ultimate hero

342
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:23,514
was not only a short man in diapers,

343
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:25,486
but he was also a fruitarian?

344
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,308
- That's not the point.
- That is good.

345
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:29,169
That is...
even for you, that is good.

346
00:23:29,294 --> 00:23:31,743
I'm just saying
I'm not so sure this thing is over.

347
00:23:32,654 --> 00:23:33,669
It was a ghost.

348
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:36,744
It was a weirdly supercharged
fruitarian ghost.

349
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:38,561
But it was still a ghost.
Now let's go.

350
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:42,518
So, first, you drag me into town,
and now you're dragging me back out?

351
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,870
You ain't steering this boat.

352
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:46,574
Let's go. Chop-chop.

353
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,019
You know, this isn't gonna work.

354
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,119
- What isn't?
- Us. You, me, together.

355
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,862
I thought it could, but it can't.

356
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:57,518
You're the one that wanted back in.

357
00:23:57,643 --> 00:23:59,435
And you're the one
who called me back in.

358
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:01,978
I still think we got
some trust-building to do.

359
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:04,381
How long am I gonna be
on double-secret probation?

360
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:06,431
Until I say so.

361
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:09,916
Look... I know what I did,

362
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,267
What I've done.

363
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:14,279
And I am trying to climb
out of that hole. I am.

364
00:24:14,404 --> 00:24:16,081
But you're not making it any easier.

365
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,117
Am I supposed
to just let you off the hook?

366
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,787
You can think whatever you want.

367
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,593
I deserve it and worse.

368
00:24:22,771 --> 00:24:25,004
You'll never punish me as much as
I'm punishing myself.

369
00:24:25,652 --> 00:24:26,870
But the point is,

370
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,228
if we're gonna be a team, you and I,

371
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,803
it has to be a two-way street.

372
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:34,760
So we go back
to the way we were before?

373
00:24:34,885 --> 00:24:36,452
No, we were never that way before.

374
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:37,750
"Before" didn't work.

375
00:24:38,317 --> 00:24:39,769
How do you think we got here?

376
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:42,131
What's that supposed to mean?

377
00:24:42,256 --> 00:24:44,886
Dean, one of the reasons
I went off with ruby...

378
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,192
... was to get away from you.

379
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:50,530
What?

380
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:52,867
It made me feel strong,

381
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,159
like I wasn't your kid brother.

382
00:24:57,283 --> 00:24:58,920
Are you saying this is my fault?

383
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:00,260
No, it's my fault.

384
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,346
All I'm saying is that
if we're gonna do this.

385
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:06,652
We have to do it different.
We can't just fall into the same rut.

386
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,256
What do you want me to do?

387
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:12,552
You're gonna have to
let me grow up, for starters.

388
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:37,542
I guess you were right
about this not being over.

389
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,024
Sheriff Carnegie.

390
00:25:45,354 --> 00:25:46,619
Sheriff, what happened?

391
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,370
I don't know.

392
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,409
Excuse us, girls.
Hi, we're with the FBI.

393
00:25:59,998 --> 00:26:01,627
Can you tell us what happened?

394
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,103
- It was horrible.
- Way horrible.

395
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,647
- What was horrible?
- I thought she'd be nice.

396
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,315
I still can't believe it.

397
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:10,817
- Believe what?
- She took Danielle!

398
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:12,273
Who?

399
00:26:13,977 --> 00:26:16,073
It's okay. You're safe.
Just tell us.

400
00:26:16,397 --> 00:26:17,700
Who took your friend?

401
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:20,404
It was...

402
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:21,992
Paris Hilton.

403
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:25,886
- Sorry?
- She looked really good, though.

404
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:27,906
- Skinny.
- Skinny and fast.

405
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:33,759
Where did they go?

406
00:26:33,996 --> 00:26:36,302
We don't know.
They just vanished.

407
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,298
Would you excuse us
for just a minute?

408
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,086
Paris Hilton's not dead,
as far as we know?

409
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:45,189
Pretty sure, no.

410
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:48,314
- Which means it's not a...
- ... Ghost, no.

411
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:51,106
So either Paris Hilton
is a homicidal maniac or...

412
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:53,131
Or we missed something.

413
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:54,616
What do you want to do?

414
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,680
That's ripe.

415
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,553
What the hell?

416
00:27:44,655 --> 00:27:46,747
- I can't believe I missed it.
- Missed what?

417
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:48,515
Went back over the other two vics.

418
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:50,567
There was blood loss... major.

419
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:52,422
Being a gory smear will do
that to you.

420
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:53,717
I mean more blood loss

421
00:27:53,842 --> 00:27:55,688
than a car crash
or a head wound should cause.

422
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:57,425
Almost like... something's feeding.

423
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,793
- Awesome.
- And then... there were these.

424
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:04,675
What are those, seeds?

425
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:06,686
They were in both vics' bellies.

426
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:08,700
I hope you washed your hands.

427
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,191
They're unlike any other seed
I've ever seen before, Dean.

428
00:28:12,286 --> 00:28:14,383
Just when I thought
you couldn't get any geekier.

429
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:26,145
Yahtzee!

430
00:28:26,891 --> 00:28:28,869
- What?
- The seeds aren't from around here.

431
00:28:28,994 --> 00:28:31,688
In fact, they're not from any tree
or plant in the country.

432
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,709
- Where are they from?
- Eastern europe,

433
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:36,422
from a forest in the balkans,
which is not even there anymore.

434
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,294
It was chopped down
like 30 years ago.

435
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:39,244
So?

436
00:28:39,637 --> 00:28:42,378
So, local legend has it
that the forest was guarded

437
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:44,805
by a pagan god
whose name was Leshii.

438
00:28:45,635 --> 00:28:48,142
A mischievous god,
could take on infinite forms.

439
00:28:48,418 --> 00:28:51,227
And let me guess...
he liked to munch on his fans.

440
00:28:52,892 --> 00:28:55,191
"Could be appeased only with
the blood from his worshippers."

441
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,462
It would drain them then stuff
their stomachs with the seeds.

442
00:28:58,714 --> 00:28:59,985
How's he doing it?

443
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:03,145
What, he touches
James Dean's key chain

444
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,744
and then morphs into James Dean?

445
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:09,620
That's good a guess as any.

446
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:13,192
Whatever. How do we kill him?

447
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:16,585
Says here to chop off his head
with an iron ax.

448
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:17,971
All right.

449
00:29:18,497 --> 00:29:20,684
Let's go gank ourselves
a Paris Hilton.

450
00:30:41,324 --> 00:30:42,513
She alive?

451
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:44,999
Yeah, barely.

452
00:31:01,797 --> 00:31:02,860
Awesome.

453
00:31:06,836 --> 00:31:07,484


454
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,510
I'm so glad you're awake for this.

455
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:45,486
This is gonna be huge.

456
00:31:49,384 --> 00:31:51,575
Super.
I wouldn't want to miss it.

457
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:55,454
I mean, I've been stuffing
myself with fast food lately.

458
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:58,123
So it's nice to do the ritual right,

459
00:31:58,788 --> 00:32:01,615
Prepare a nice,
slow meal for a change.

460
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,175
Just like the good old days?

461
00:32:04,485 --> 00:32:05,986
You have no idea.

462
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:07,882
People adored me.

463
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:09,843
They used to throw themselves at me,

464
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:12,054
with smiles on their faces.

465
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,222
Yeah, I guess these days,
nobody gives a flying crap

466
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:17,547
about some backwoods-forest god?

467
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,078
No, not since
they cut down my forest

468
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:25,693
to build a yugo plant.

469
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:28,106
March of progress, sister.

470
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:31,007
For years now, I've been wandering.

471
00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:33,548
Hungry. Scared.

472
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,114
Scrounging for scraps.

473
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:38,038
So not sexy.

474
00:32:39,227 --> 00:32:40,163
But then...

475
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,681
the best thing ever happened...

476
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:45,794
Someone tripped the apocalypse.

477
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,715
And I thought, what the hell...

478
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:49,964
I'm tired of watching what I eat.

479
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:52,511
I want to pig out.

480
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:55,682
So I found this little place.

481
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,841
It's awesome.

482
00:32:56,966 --> 00:32:59,309
Adoring fans stroll right
in the door.

483
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,313
Yeah.
But they're not your fans.

484
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:03,509
So?

485
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:06,637
They worship Lincoln,
Gandhi, Hilton.

486
00:33:06,924 --> 00:33:09,444
Whatever.
I'll take what I can get.

487
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:11,921
I got to tell you,
you are not the first god we've met,

488
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:14,116
but you are the nuttiest.

489
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,826
No. You. You people.

490
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,429
You're the crazy ones.

491
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,623
You used to worship gods.

492
00:33:21,282 --> 00:33:22,417
But this?

493
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:25,252
This is what passes for idolatry?

494
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:27,062
Celebrities?

495
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,466
What have they got besides
small dogs and spray tans?

496
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,404
You people used to have
old-time religion.

497
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,096
Now you have us weekly.

498
00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:39,433
I don't know. I'm more
of a penthouse forum man, myself.

499
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:45,120
Maybe, but...

500
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:48,882
There's still a lot of yummy
meat on those bones, boy.

501
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:53,260
I hate to break it
to you, sister, but...

502
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:55,075
You can't eat me.

503
00:33:55,854 --> 00:33:58,649
See, I'm not a Paris Hilton BFF.

504
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,319
I've never even seen "House of wax."

505
00:34:04,566 --> 00:34:06,794
But I can totally
read your mind, Dean.

506
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:08,629
I know who your hero is.

507
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:09,838
Your daddy.

508
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:12,090
Am I right?

509
00:34:14,904 --> 00:34:16,844
And this belonged to him.

510
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,891
Didn't it?
Poor little Dean.

511
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:23,936
All you ever wanted
was to be loved by your idol.

512
00:34:25,075 --> 00:34:27,356
One distant father figure,
coming right up!

513
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,750
- Not a word.
- Dude.

514
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:08,473
You just got whaled on
by Paris Hilton.

515
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:11,108
Shut up.

516
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,470


517
00:35:20,295 --> 00:35:22,367
All right. Thank you.

518
00:35:24,075 --> 00:35:25,377
Sheriff Carnegie.

519
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:27,256
Danielle's gonna be all right.

520
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:30,296
She's sworn off "The simple life",
but other than that...

521
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,419
Glad she's okay.

522
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,282
It gets better...

523
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,632
Sheriff's putting out
an APB on Paris Hilton.

524
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:37,998
That ought to be good.

525
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:47,002
Listen, I was thinking
about what you said yesterday...

526
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,900
About me keeping
too tight of a leash on you.

527
00:35:51,953 --> 00:35:53,212
Maybe you're right.

528
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:58,522
I'm not exactly... Mr. Innocent
in this whole mess, either.

529
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,060
I did break the first seal.

530
00:36:00,185 --> 00:36:02,116
- You didn't know.
- Neither did you.

531
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:04,828
I'm not saying demon blood
was a great way to go,

532
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,538
but you did kill Lilith.

533
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,377
- And start the apocalypse.
- Which neither of us saw coming.

534
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:11,877
Who would've thought killing Lilith
would've been a bad thing?

535
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:18,627
Point is, I was so worried
about watching your every move

536
00:36:18,752 --> 00:36:20,983
that I didn't see what
it was actually doing to you.

537
00:36:24,236 --> 00:36:25,773
So, for that, I'm sorry.

538
00:36:26,725 --> 00:36:27,674
Thanks.

539
00:36:32,741 --> 00:36:34,094
So, where do we go from here?

540
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:36,275
The way I see it, we got
one shot at surviving this.

541
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:38,583
- What's that?
- Maybe I am on deck for the devil.

542
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:41,313
Maybe the same with you and Michael.
Maybe there's no changing that.

543
00:36:41,438 --> 00:36:42,538
That's encouraging.

544
00:36:42,663 --> 00:36:45,120
But we can stop wringing
our hands over it.

545
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:47,554
We got to just grab on
to whatever's in front of us,

546
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,388
kick its ass and go down fighting.

547
00:36:53,572 --> 00:36:55,608
- I can get on board with that.
- Okay.

548
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:58,714
But we're gonna have to
do it on the same level.

549
00:37:03,149 --> 00:37:04,215
You got it.

550
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:11,014
What do you say
we get the hell out of here? 

551
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:22,857
You want to drive?

552
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:26,492
You sure?

553
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:30,247
Yeah. I could use a nap.
