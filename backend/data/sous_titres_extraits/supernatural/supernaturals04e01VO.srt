1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,430
- So this is Ruby?
- She's a deamon Sam!

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,891
Her name's Lilith.
She doesn't like you very much?

3
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:14,809
- How long did they gave you?
- One year.

4
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:54,808
Did you know?
About Dean's deal?

5
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:57,184
- That Lilith holds the contract?
- Yes.

6
00:00:57,346 --> 00:00:59,646
You got two months left, dean.
You're not gonna go to hell.

7
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:01,606
It's not Ruby. It's Lilith!

8
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:07,821
- Where's Ruby?
- I sent her far, far away.

9
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:09,989
Sic him, boy.

10
00:01:30,628 --> 00:01:31,857
Somebody help me!

11
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:37,274
Sam!

12
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:12,540
Help!

13
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:15,566
Help!

14
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:17,414
Help.

15
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:54,837
<i>www.seriessub.com</i>

16
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:11,916
Hello?

17
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,157
September...

18
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,905
We're sorry. You have reached a number
that has been disconnected.

19
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:42,653
- Bobby?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

20
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:43,819
It's me.

21
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,921
- <i>Who's "me"?</i>
- Dean.

22
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:57,193
<i>Who is this?</i>

23
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:59,177
- Bobby, listen to me.
- <i>This ain't funny.</i>

24
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:00,908
Call again and I'll kill you.

25
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:40,672
Surprise.

26
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:44,111
I don't...

27
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,639
Yeah, me neither.

28
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:49,165
But here I am.

29
00:08:55,472 --> 00:08:56,998
Bobby, it's me!

30
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:57,957
My ass.

31
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:00,427
Wait! Your name is
Robert Steven Singer.

32
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:02,647
You became a hunter after
your wife got possessed.

33
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,755
You're about the closest thing
I have to a father.

34
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,352
It's me.

35
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:23,387
- I am not a shapeshifter.
- Then you're a revenant!

36
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:28,621
If I was either,
would I do this with a silver knife?

37
00:09:42,257 --> 00:09:44,149
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

38
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,498
It's...
It's good to see you, boy.

39
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:01,229
Yeah, you too.

40
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,925
But...

41
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,067
How did you bust out?

42
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:07,485
I don't know.

43
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:10,424
I just, uh...

44
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:12,490
Just woke up in a pine bo...

45
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:21,207
I'm not a demon, either, you know.

46
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:22,737
Sorry.

47
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,404
Can't be too careful.

48
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,867
That don't make a lick of sense.

49
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:32,385
Yeah, you're preaching to the choir.

50
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:37,013
Your chest was ribbons,
your insides were slop,

51
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:39,183
and you'd been buried four months.

52
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:42,102
Even if you could slip out of hell
and back into your meats --

53
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:44,855
I know. I should look like
a "thriller" video reject.

54
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:46,301
What do you remember?

55
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:47,799
Not much.

56
00:10:49,176 --> 00:10:51,028
I remember I was a hellhound's
chew toy...

57
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:53,336
And then lights-out.

58
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:56,762
Then I come to six feet under.
That was it.

59
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,746
Sam's number's not working.

60
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:02,039
He's... He's not...

61
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:04,133
Oh, he's alive, as far as I know.

62
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:07,684
Good.

63
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:11,008
What do you mean...
As far as you know?

64
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,425
- I haven't talked to him for months.
- You're kidding?

65
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:16,369
- You just let him go off by himself?
- He was dead set on it.

66
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:18,848
You should have been looking after him.

67
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,169
I tried.

68
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,729
These last months haven't been
exactly easy, you know, for him or me.

69
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:26,439
We had to bury you.

70
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:28,107
Why did you bury me, anyway?

71
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:31,319
I wanted you salted and burned...
Usual drill...

72
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,695
But sam wouldn't have it.

73
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:34,905
I'm glad he won that one.

74
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:38,617
He said you'd need a body
when he gotou back home somehow.

75
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:41,244
- That's about all he said.
- What do you mean?

76
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:42,576
He was quiet...

77
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,808
Real quiet.

78
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:47,835
Then he just took off.

79
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:49,503
Wouldn't return my calls.

80
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:52,067
I tried to find him,
but he don't want to be found.

81
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:53,883
Oh, damn it, Sammy.

82
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,287
What?

83
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:56,635
Oh, he got me home okay.

84
00:11:56,795 --> 00:11:58,888
But whatever he did,
it is bad mojo.

85
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:01,598
- What makes you so sure?
- You should have seen the grave site.

86
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,399
It was like a nuke went off.
Then there was this...

87
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:06,979
This force,
this presence, that, I don't know,

88
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,483
but it... It... It blew past me
at a fill-up joint.

89
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:13,624
And then this.

90
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:21,990
What in the hell?

91
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,288
Yeah, it's like a demon just
yanked me out or rode me out.

92
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,416
But why?

93
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:30,503
- To hold up their end of the bargain.
- You think Sam made a deal?

94
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:33,034
It's what I would have done.

95
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:38,733
Yeah, hi. I have a cellphone account
with you guys and, uh, lost my phone.

96
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,871
I was wondering if you could turn
the gps on for me.

97
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,191
Yeah. The name's "Wedge Antilles."

98
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:47,742
Social is 2474.

99
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,701
Thank you.

100
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:55,443
How'd you know he'd use that name?

101
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:58,385
You kidding me?
What don't I know about that kid?

102
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:07,790
What's the deal with the liquor store?
Your parents out of town or something?

103
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:09,774
Like I said...

104
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:13,559
The last few months ain't been...
All that easy.

105
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:17,007
Right.

106
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,390
Sam's in Pontiac, Illinois.

107
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:28,146
- Right near where you were planted.
- Right where I popped up.

108
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,187
Hell of a coincidence, don't you think?

109
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:44,535
So, where is it?

110
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,372
Where's what?

111
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:51,519
The pizza that takes
two guys to deliver.

112
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,370
I think we got the wrong room.

113
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,582
Hey, is...

114
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:05,388
Hey, ya, Sammy.

115
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:19,444
- Who are you?!
- Like you didn't do this!

116
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:20,823
- Do what?!
- It's him.

117
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,960
It's him, Sam.
I've been through this already.

118
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,408
It's really him.

119
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:26,948
But...

120
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:30,539
I know.

121
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:34,293
I look fantastic, huh?

122
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:55,688
So, are you two, like...

123
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,399
Together?

124
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:59,026
What? No.

125
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:00,943
No.

126
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:03,393
He's my brother.

127
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,159
Got it...
I-I guess.

128
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:10,704
Look, I should probably go.

129
00:15:10,864 --> 00:15:13,457
Yeah, yeah. That's probably
a good idea. Sorry.

130
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:17,261
So, call me.

131
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:19,129
Yeah, sure thing, kathy.

132
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,589
Christie.

133
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:22,595
Right.

134
00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:39,160
So, tell me, what'd it cost?

135
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:41,294
The girl?

136
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:42,970
I don't pay, Dean.

137
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,545
That's not funny, sam.

138
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:47,116
To bring me back.

139
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,284
What'd it cost?

140
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,620
Was it just your soul, or was it
something worse?

141
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,998
- You think I made a deal?
- That's exactly what we think.

142
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:55,374
Well, I didn't.

143
00:15:57,095 --> 00:15:58,307
Don't lie to me.

144
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:00,588
I'm not lying.

145
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:04,258
So, what now? I'm off the hook,
and you're on, is that it?

146
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:06,764
You're some demon's bitch boy?

147
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,666
I didn't want to be saved like this.

148
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:11,371
Look, Dean, I wish I had done it,
all right?

149
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:13,641
There's no other way
that this could have gone down.

150
00:16:13,803 --> 00:16:16,353
- Now tell the truth!
- I tried everything. That's the truth.

151
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,018
I tried opening the devil's gate.

152
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:21,066
Hell, I tried to bargain, Dean,
but no demon would deal, all right?

153
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:26,595
You were rotting in hell for months...
For months...

154
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:27,905
And I couldn't stop it.

155
00:16:29,497 --> 00:16:31,745
So, I'm sorry it wasn't me, all right?

156
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:36,290
Dean, I'm sorry.

157
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,585
It's okay, Sammy.

158
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,213
You don't have to apologize.
I believe you.

159
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:47,343
Don't get me wrong...

160
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:51,299
I'm glad that Sam's soul remains intact,
but...

161
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:53,557
That does raise a sticky question.

162
00:16:56,226 --> 00:16:58,758
If he didn't pull me out, then what did?

163
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:12,201
So what were you doing around here if
you weren't digging me out of my grave?

164
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,042
Well, once I figured out
I couldn't save you,

165
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,957
I started hunting down Lilith,
trying to get some payback.

166
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,210
All by yourself?

167
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,045
Who do you think you are, your old man?

168
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:28,007
Yeah, I'm sorry. I should have called.
I was pretty messed up.

169
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:30,678
Oh, yeah.

170
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:32,968
I really feel your pain.

171
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:36,874
Anyways...

172
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:39,728
I was checking these demons
out of tennessee, and out of nowhere

173
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:41,612
they took a hard left, booked up here.

174
00:17:41,732 --> 00:17:43,295
- When?
- Yesterday morning.

175
00:17:43,415 --> 00:17:44,441
When I busted out.

176
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:47,277
You think these demons
are here 'cause of you?

177
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:49,230
But why?

178
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,416
Well, I don't know. Some badass demon
drags me out, and now this?

179
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:54,290
It's got to be connected somehow.

180
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,798
How you feeling, anyway?

181
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:58,272
I'm a little hungry.

182
00:17:58,392 --> 00:18:00,711
No, I mean,
do you feel like yourself?

183
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:03,877
- Anything strange or different?
- Or demonic?

184
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:06,422
How many times
do I have to prove I'm me?

185
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:10,092
No demon's letting you loose out
of the goodness of their hearts.

186
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:12,174
They got to have something
nasty planned.

187
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:14,429
I feel fine. Look, we don't know
what they're planning.

188
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,848
We got a pile of
questions and no shovel.

189
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:18,279
We need help.

190
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:20,892
I know a psychic a few hours from here.

191
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:24,167
Something this big, maybe
she's heard the other side talking.

192
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:26,567
- Hell, yeah. It's worth a shot.
- I'll be right back.

193
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:30,695
Hey, wait.

194
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,741
You probably want this back.

195
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,661
Thanks.

196
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,542
Don't mention it.

197
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,338
Hey, Dean, what was it like?

198
00:18:50,127 --> 00:18:51,421
What? Hell?

199
00:18:53,394 --> 00:18:55,637
I don't know.
I must have blacked it out.

200
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,850
I don't remember a damn thing.

201
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:03,270
Thank god for that.

202
00:19:03,582 --> 00:19:04,663
Yeah.

203
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:32,863
She's about four hours
down the interstate.

204
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:35,960
Try to keep up.

205
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:40,731
I assume you'll want to drive.

206
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:43,917
I almost forgot.

207
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:46,326
Hey, sweetheart, did you Miss me?

208
00:19:56,589 --> 00:19:57,741
What the hell is that?

209
00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:58,991
That's an ipod jack.

210
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:01,453
You were supposed to take care of her,
not douche her up.

211
00:20:02,783 --> 00:20:04,497
Dean, I thought it was my car.

212
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,383
Really?

213
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:22,975
Tthere still one thing
that's bothering me.

214
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:25,727
The night that I bit it --

215
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:27,173
Or got bit --

216
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:30,899
How'd you make it out?
I thought lilith was gonna kill you.

217
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:32,985
Well, she tried.
She couldn't.

218
00:20:33,145 --> 00:20:34,545
What do you mean she couldn't?

219
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:37,883
She fired this, like,
burning light at me...

220
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:39,371
And...

221
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:43,245
It didn't leave a scratch,
like I was immune or something.

222
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:45,820
Immune?

223
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:48,584
I don't know who was
more surprised -- her or me.

224
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,350
She left pretty fast after that.

225
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:56,264
What about Ruby?
Where is she?

226
00:20:56,384 --> 00:20:57,632
Dead or in hell.

227
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:03,996
So, you been using your,
freaky E.S.P. stuff?

228
00:21:04,116 --> 00:21:04,850
No.

229
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,198
Sure about that?

230
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:10,224
Now that you got immunity...
Whatever the hell that is...

231
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:12,982
Just wondering what other kind
of weirdo crap you got going on.

232
00:21:13,144 --> 00:21:14,359
Nothing, dean.

233
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:17,642
Look, you didn't want me to go down
that road, I didn't go down that road.

234
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:19,907
It was practically your dying wish.

235
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:23,577
Yeah, well, let's keep it that way.

236
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,389
You're a sight for sore eyes.

237
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,954
So, are these the boys?

238
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:48,204
Sam, Dean...

239
00:21:48,324 --> 00:21:50,978
Pamela barnes.
Best damn psychic in the state.

240
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:52,439
- Hey.
- Hi.

241
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:57,512
Dean Winchester.

242
00:21:57,687 --> 00:22:00,446
Out of the fire and back
in the frying pan, huh?

243
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:01,990
Makes you a rare individual.

244
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:04,155
If you say so.

245
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,322
Come on in.

246
00:22:08,586 --> 00:22:09,984
So, you hear anything?

247
00:22:10,883 --> 00:22:13,988
Well, I ouija-ed my way
through a dozen spirits.

248
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,381
No one seems to know who broke
your boy out or why.

249
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,643
- So, what's next?
- A séance, I think.

250
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:21,764
See if we can see who did the deed.

251
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:23,762
You're not gonna summon
the damn thing here?

252
00:22:23,922 --> 00:22:24,891
No.

253
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:28,709
I just want to get a sneak peek at it,
like a crystal ball without the crystal.

254
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:31,144
I'm game.

255
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,163
Who's jesse?

256
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:53,959
It wasn't forever.

257
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:55,252
His loss.

258
00:22:58,872 --> 00:23:00,328
Might be your gain.

259
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:07,082
- Dude, I'm so in.
- She's gonna eat you alive.

260
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:09,438
Hey, I just got out of jail.
Bring it.

261
00:23:10,052 --> 00:23:12,005
You're invited, too, grumpy.

262
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:14,187
You are not invited.

263
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:20,532
Take each other's hands.

264
00:23:23,405 --> 00:23:26,700
And I need to touch something
our mystery monster touched.

265
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,369
Whoa! Well, he didn't touch me there.

266
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:30,996
My mistake.

267
00:23:53,377 --> 00:23:55,666
I invoke, conjure, and command you...

268
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:57,731
Appear unto me before this circle.

269
00:23:57,891 --> 00:24:00,053
I invoke, conjure, and command you...

270
00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:02,256
Appear unto me before this circle.

271
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:04,867
I invoke, conjure, and command you...

272
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,115
Appear unto me before this circle.

273
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:09,951
I invoke, conjure, and command...

274
00:24:10,111 --> 00:24:10,911
Castiello?

275
00:24:11,821 --> 00:24:14,331
No. Sorry,
Castiello, I don't scare easy.

276
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:15,610
Castiello?

277
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,960
Its name. It's whispering to me,
warning me to turn back.

278
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,838
I conjure and command you...
Show me your face.

279
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:24,551
I conjure and command you...
Show me your face.

280
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,802
I conjure and command you...
Show me your face.

281
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,512
- I conjure and command you...
- Maybe we should stop.

282
00:24:29,674 --> 00:24:30,639
I almost got it.

283
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:31,889
I command you...

284
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:33,100
Show me your face.

285
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:34,457
Show me your face now!

286
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:44,595
Call 911.

287
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:54,788
I can't see.

288
00:24:55,298 --> 00:24:56,447
I can't see!

289
00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:06,353
I'll be up in a jiff.

290
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:07,571
Yeah, you bet.

291
00:25:07,691 --> 00:25:10,184
- What'd bobby say?
- Pam's stable and out of ICU.

292
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,281
And blind 'cause of us?

293
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:15,475
We still have no clue
what we're dealing with.

294
00:25:15,636 --> 00:25:17,270
- That's not entirely true.
- No?

295
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,062
We got a name --
Castiello or whatever.

296
00:25:19,222 --> 00:25:21,605
With the right mumbo jumbo, we can
summon him, bring him to us.

297
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,300
You're crazy.
Absolutely not.

298
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,318
We'll work him over.
I mean, after what he did?

299
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:27,476
Pam took a peek at him and her eyes

300
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:29,900
burned out of her skull, and you want
to have a face-to-face?

301
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,286
- You got a better idea?
- Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.

302
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,400
I followed some demons to town, right?

303
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:36,850
So we go find them.

304
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,462
Someone's got to know something
about something.

305
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:41,845
Thanks.

306
00:25:47,418 --> 00:25:48,592
You angling for a tip?

307
00:25:48,752 --> 00:25:51,284
I'm sorry. I thought
you were looking for us.

308
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,407
To hell and back.

309
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:15,285
Aren't you a lucky duck?

310
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:17,162
That's me.

311
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:20,095
So, you get to just stroll out
of the pit?

312
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:23,376
Tell me, what makes you so special?

313
00:26:23,822 --> 00:26:26,629
I like to think it's because
of my perky nipples.

314
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,281
I don't know.

315
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:33,261
It wasn't my doing.
I don't know who pulled me out.

316
00:26:33,978 --> 00:26:35,305
Right. You don't.

317
00:26:35,466 --> 00:26:36,723
No, I don't.

318
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:38,441
Lying's a sin, you know.

319
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:43,021
I'm not lying.

320
00:26:45,815 --> 00:26:47,066
But I'd like to find out.

321
00:26:47,228 --> 00:26:49,319
So if you wouldn't mind
enlightening me, flo.

322
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:51,864
Mind your tone with me, boy.

323
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:54,031
I'll drag you back to hell myself.

324
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:02,097
No, you won't.

325
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:05,669
'cause if you were,
you'd have done it already.

326
00:27:06,032 --> 00:27:08,539
The fact is, you don't know
who cut me loose.

327
00:27:09,285 --> 00:27:11,424
And you're just as spooked as we are.

328
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:13,553
And you're looking for answers.

329
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:17,639
Maybe it was some
turbocharged spirit?

330
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:20,361
Or, uh, Godzilla.

331
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,270
Or some big, bad boss demon.

332
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,314
But I'm guessing at your pay grade
that they don't tell you squat.

333
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:30,145
'cause whoever it was,
they want me out...

334
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:33,530
And they're a lot stronger than you.

335
00:27:36,534 --> 00:27:38,254
So, go ahead.
Send me back.

336
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:40,937
But don't come crawling to me when
they show up on your front doorstep

337
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:42,664
with some vaseline and a fire hose.

338
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,417
I'm gonna reach down your throat
and rip out your lungs.

339
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,098
That's what I thought.

340
00:28:06,925 --> 00:28:08,041
Let's go, Sam.

341
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,159
For the pie.

342
00:28:32,737 --> 00:28:34,674
Holy crap, that was close.

343
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,848
We're not just gonna leave them
in there, are we?

344
00:28:36,968 --> 00:28:39,597
There's three of them, probably more.
We only got one knife between us.

345
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,781
I've been killing a lot more demons
than that lately.

346
00:28:41,901 --> 00:28:44,353
Not anymore. The smarter brother's
back in town.

347
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,420
Dean, we got to take them.

348
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,605
- They are dangerous.
- They're scared, okay?

349
00:28:48,725 --> 00:28:50,652
Scared of whatever had
the juice to yank me out.

350
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:53,276
We're dealing with a bad mofo here.
One job at a time.

351
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:56,345
How you doing, kid?

352
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,545
Aside from the church bells
ringing in my head...

353
00:30:59,665 --> 00:31:00,665
Peachy.

354
00:31:10,198 --> 00:31:11,249
What are you doing?

355
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,708
- Couldn't sleep. Went to get a burger.
- In my car?

356
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:15,668
Force of habit.
What are you doing up?

357
00:31:15,828 --> 00:31:19,005
Well, uh, bobby's back.
We're going to grab a beer.

358
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,676
All right.
Well, uh, spill some for me, huh?

359
00:31:24,002 --> 00:31:26,072
Done. Yeah, i'll catch you later.

360
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,740
Why the hell didn't you tell him?

361
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,816
- 'cause he'd just try to stop us.
- From what?

362
00:31:38,976 --> 00:31:40,360
Summoning this thing.

363
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:42,963
It's time we face it head on.

364
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,239
- You can't be serious.
- As a heart attack.

365
00:31:46,857 --> 00:31:49,344
- It's high noon, baby.
- We don't know what it is.

366
00:31:49,464 --> 00:31:51,287
I-it could be a demon.
It could be anything.

367
00:31:51,447 --> 00:31:53,581
That's why we got to be ready
for anything.

368
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:57,877
We got the big-time magic knife.

369
00:31:58,037 --> 00:32:00,004
You got an arsenal in the trunk.

370
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:01,756
This is a bad idea.

371
00:32:02,413 --> 00:32:04,551
I couldn't agree more,
but what other choice do we have?

372
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:05,926
We could choose life.

373
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:08,680
Bobby, whatever this is,
whatever it wants, it's after me...

374
00:32:08,853 --> 00:32:10,233
That much we know, right?

375
00:32:10,353 --> 00:32:11,838
Well, I got no place to hide.

376
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:15,687
I can either get caught with my pants
down again, or we can make our stand.

377
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:20,275
- We could use Sam for this.
- Nah, he's better off where he is.

378
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:37,862
Your eyes.

379
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,344
I could still smell
your soul a mile away.

380
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:41,983
Who was here?

381
00:33:42,301 --> 00:33:44,150
- You saw it.
- I saw it.

382
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,319
What was it?

383
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:49,405
It's the end.

384
00:33:49,934 --> 00:33:51,407
We're dead.
We're all dead.

385
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,492
What did you see?

386
00:33:55,295 --> 00:33:56,204
Go to hell.

387
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:00,421
Funny...

388
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:03,032
I was gonna say the same thing to you.

389
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:55,986
Damn it.

390
00:34:59,935 --> 00:35:01,394
Getting pretty slick there, Sam.

391
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:03,121
Better all the time.

392
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:13,435
What the hell's going
on around here, Ruby?

393
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:15,866
I wish I knew.

394
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,829
We were thinking some high-level
demon pulled dean out.

395
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:21,171
No way.

396
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:25,553
Human souls don't just walk out of hell
and back into their bodies easy.

397
00:35:25,673 --> 00:35:28,013
This guy bleeds, the ground quakes...

398
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:29,505
It's cosmic.

399
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,544
No demon can swing that.

400
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,484
Not Lilith...

401
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:37,924
Not anybody.

402
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:39,264
Then what can?

403
00:35:40,143 --> 00:35:41,768
Nothing I've ever seen before.

404
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:58,372
That's a hell of an art project
you got going there.

405
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:01,364
Traps and talismans from
every faith on the globe.

406
00:36:02,415 --> 00:36:03,605
How you doing?

407
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:06,051
Stakes, iron, silver, salt, a knife...

408
00:36:06,171 --> 00:36:09,239
I mean, we're pretty much set to catch
and kill anything I've ever heard of.

409
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,925
This is still a bad idea.

410
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:13,257
Yeah, Bobby, I heard you
the first 10 times.

411
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:16,177
What do you say we ring
the dinner bell?

412
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:33,694
Amate spiritus obscure...

413
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:36,883
So, million-dollar question --

414
00:36:37,003 --> 00:36:39,385
You gonna tell dean about
what we're doing?

415
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,976
Yeah, I just got to figure out
the right way to say it.

416
00:36:44,108 --> 00:36:46,613
Look, I just need time, okay?
That's all.

417
00:36:47,076 --> 00:36:49,866
He's gonna find out, and if it's not
from you, he's gonna be pissed.

418
00:36:49,986 --> 00:36:51,557
Oh, he's gonna be pissed anyway.

419
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:54,298
He's so hardheaded about this psychic
stuff, he'll just try and stop me.

420
00:36:54,928 --> 00:36:58,010
Look, maybe I'll just take
a step back for a while.

421
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:01,720
I mean, I'm not exactly
in your brother's fan club,

422
00:37:02,415 --> 00:37:06,070
but he is your brother,
and i'm not gonna come between you.

423
00:37:06,846 --> 00:37:08,660
I don't know if what I'm doing is right.

424
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,404
- I don't even know if I trust you.
- Thanks.

425
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,634
What I do know is I'm saving people...

426
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:16,012
And stopping demons.

427
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:19,240
And that feels good.

428
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:22,321
I want to keep going.

429
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,732
You sure you did the ritual right?

430
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:43,246
Sorry.

431
00:37:43,588 --> 00:37:45,122
Touchy, touchy, huh?

432
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,019
Wishful thinking, but maybe
it's just the wind.

433
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:42,533
Who are you?

434
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:45,701
I'm the one who gripped you tight
and raised you from perdition.

435
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:48,496
Thanks for that.

436
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,858
We need to talk, Dean.

437
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:21,200
Alone.

438
00:39:31,405 --> 00:39:32,581
Your friend is alive.

439
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:34,040
Who are you?

440
00:39:34,446 --> 00:39:35,334
Castiello.

441
00:39:35,494 --> 00:39:37,378
Yeah, I figured that much.
I mean what are you?

442
00:39:40,497 --> 00:39:41,965
I'm an angel of the lord.

443
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:50,995
Get the hell out of here.

444
00:39:51,882 --> 00:39:53,176
There's no such thing.

445
00:39:57,267 --> 00:39:58,921
This is your problem, Dean.

446
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:01,375
You have no faith.

447
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:18,341
Some angel you are.

448
00:40:19,748 --> 00:40:21,948
You burned out that poor woman's eyes.

449
00:40:23,306 --> 00:40:25,641
I warned her not to spy
on my true form.

450
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,340
It can be...

451
00:40:27,776 --> 00:40:30,556
Overwhelming to humans
and so can my real voice...

452
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:32,058
But you already knew that.

453
00:40:32,218 --> 00:40:34,869
You mean the gas station and the motel?

454
00:40:35,888 --> 00:40:37,063
That was you talking?

455
00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:41,051
Buddy, next time, lower the volume.

456
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:43,037
That was my mistake.

457
00:40:43,749 --> 00:40:45,563
Certain people...
Special people...

458
00:40:45,683 --> 00:40:47,030
Can perceive my true visage.

459
00:40:47,192 --> 00:40:48,908
I thought you would be one of them.

460
00:40:49,295 --> 00:40:50,159
I was wrong.

461
00:40:51,171 --> 00:40:53,303
And what visage are you in now?

462
00:40:53,423 --> 00:40:55,114
What...
Holy tax accountant?

463
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:58,459
This?
This is... a vessel.

464
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,586
You're possessing some poor bastard?

465
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:03,589
He's a devout man.
He actually prayed for this.

466
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:05,625
Look, pal, I'm not buying
what you're selling.

467
00:41:05,745 --> 00:41:07,064
So who are you, really?

468
00:41:08,989 --> 00:41:09,928
I told you.

469
00:41:10,962 --> 00:41:12,111
Right.

470
00:41:13,145 --> 00:41:16,310
And why would an angel
rescue me from hell?

471
00:41:18,211 --> 00:41:20,106
Good things do happen, Dean.

472
00:41:23,499 --> 00:41:24,692
Not in my experience.

473
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,380
What's the matter?

474
00:41:30,712 --> 00:41:33,285
You don't think you deserve to be saved.

475
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:37,877
Why'd you do it?

476
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,295
Because God commanded it.

477
00:41:46,723 --> 00:41:48,717
Because we have work for you.
