<i>Previously on "one tree hill"... we could
really use a good young coach like you.</i>

2
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:05,128
I thought you wanted me
to play.

3
00:00:05,128 --> 00:00:06,627
Well, nathan,
your playing days are over.

4
00:00:06,694 --> 00:00:08,228
Come on.
You must know that.

5
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:11,228
The magazine, the line -
You can have everything.

6
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:13,550
Do you know they didn't even
want to do a book tour?

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,894
What could possibly be more
important than chicago?

8
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:17,995
My wedding.

9
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:19,627
It's peyton.

10
00:00:19,694 --> 00:00:22,295
It's mick.
He's my father.

11
00:00:22,362 --> 00:00:24,362
He's coming over for dinner.

12
00:00:24,428 --> 00:00:26,175
Shut up and pour, okay?

13
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:32,594
I'm not dead.

14
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:33,527
Sure, you are.

Why do guys insist
on packing their bags

19
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:52,928
At the last
possible minute?

20
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:56,128
We do it to torture you.
????

21
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:58,228
Big day, huh?

22
00:00:58,295 --> 00:00:59,594
Yeah.

23
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:01,861
Anyhow, the first signing's
always the most stressful.

24
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:02,961
Yeah.

25
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:04,195
But i get to see
mouth today.

26
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:06,362
That'll be fun.

27
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:08,794
I still don't understand why
they're sending you to omaha

28
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,462
To launch the book tour.

29
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:12,961
Well, they like to generate
a little buzz

30
00:01:13,028 --> 00:01:15,095
Before the bigger markets,
you know?

31
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:17,161
Worked for the last book.

32
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:19,061
I wish i could go
with you.

33
00:01:19,128 --> 00:01:20,961
It's not too late.

34
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:22,794
Oh, yeah. 'Cause that wouldn't
be awkward -

35
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:25,928
You, your fiancE,
your ex-FiancE.

36
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:27,527
Peyton.
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:30,828
I know lindsey is your editor.
I just -

38
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:33,661
I'm jealous that she gets you
for the next week,

39
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:35,494
And i get mick.

40
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,694
Great.

41
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:38,694
Why do you think
he's avoiding

42
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,627
Admitting that
he's your father?

43
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:43,894
I don't know.

44
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:46,328
Maybe i'm wrong.
Maybe he's not.

45
00:01:46,395 --> 00:01:50,128
Either way, i will be all right.
Don't worry about me.

46
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,928
You know i will.

47
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:54,794
I'll call you when i land. Yeah.

48
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:57,494
I love you.

49
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,861
Don't forget me when you're
a big star, lucas scott.

50
00:02:01,928 --> 00:02:02,928
Mm-Hmm.

51
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:09,928
* so many years apart
i've missed *

52
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:12,195
You know, hales, with everything
you've been through lately,

53
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:13,828
I'm sure principal turner
would understand

54
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:15,362
If you needed a little
more time off.

55
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:17,861
I think two weeks
of replaying that day

56
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:19,295
In my head is enough.

57
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:21,728
It's time for me to get back
to my life.

58
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:24,728
Besides, it will be nice
to have the distraction.

59
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:26,828
If you need me,
you know i'm here.

60
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:28,661
Yeah.

61
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:30,761
You know what?
Let's cut through shop.

62
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:33,175
You can cut through shop?

63
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:34,769
You were such a nerd
in high school.

64
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:36,261
I was an honor student!

65
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:38,561
Exactly.

66
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:40,728
Nerd.

67
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,728
"Nerd."

68
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,925
You don't know what you'd do
without me.

69
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:46,800
Nathan!

70
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:05,728
So, you want to tell me
why you were sleeping

71
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,295
In the backseat of a car
at school?

72
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:08,594
Well, it was either there

73
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:10,295
Or that smelly couch
in the teacher's lounge.

74
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:11,761
I can't believe you sit
on that thing.

75
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:13,828
For the record,
i don't go near that thing.

76
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,128
So, tell me
where you live

77
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,300
Because i'm pretty sure
it's not in shop class.

78
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:20,694
I live in a foster home.

79
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:24,794
Okay.

80
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:26,128
Well,
give me your number.

81
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:28,362
I'm gonna need to speak
with your foster parents.

82
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:32,362
Hell no. Please.
That'll just make it worse.

83
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:35,128
This is none
of your business, okay?

84
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:37,261
Sam, if there's a problem
at home, tell me.

85
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:38,561
I can get you some help.

86
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:40,028
There's not a problem.

87
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,861
This is one of the better
fosteromes i've been in.

88
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:43,494
The others were...

89
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:46,627
Not so good.

90
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:49,195
So it's just a little crowded.
It's okay.

91
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:50,362
It's not okay, sam.

92
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:52,195
Is there anybody
that was worried

93
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:54,161
That you didn't come home
last night?

94
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:56,627
You don't get it.

95
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,527
Nobody cares.

96
00:03:58,594 --> 00:03:59,940
It's kind of like
being invisible.

97
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,561
Cash their checks, i don't get
slapped around. That's the deal.

98
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:04,494
And it's a pretty
good deal.

99
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:05,995
So don't screw this up
for me.

100
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:08,863
Sam, i can't just pretend
like this didn't happen.

101
00:04:08,863 --> 00:04:10,363
You're 15 years old.

102
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:11,928
There has to be something
better for you.

103
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:14,894
You seem nice,
but i'm not your girl.

104
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:18,494
I'm not anybody's girl.
It happens.

105
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:19,627
Sam!

106
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:25,809
Millie: look who it is -
The world's best boss.

107
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:28,143
And what are you
buttering me up for?

108
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,309
Nothing.
We just have lots to do.

109
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:33,143
Millie,
i love you dearly,

110
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:36,347
But you realize we are
standing in a clothing store

111
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:39,510
<i>That has no clothes
in it,</i>

112
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:41,709
And i am fresh out
of ideas.

113
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:44,009
<i>Are you sure about that?</i>

114
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:46,942
What is that?

115
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:48,942
I wrote down a list
of ideas.

116
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,363
And then you covered them
with a sheet?

117
00:04:51,363 --> 00:04:52,738
Yeah, that was more
for effect.

118
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:54,775
I've always wanted to pull
a sheet off something

119
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:55,942
And say "voil?"

120
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:57,909
All right, well,
now's your big chance.

121
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,519
"Go skydiving"?

122
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,243
You didn't let me
say "voil?"

123
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:05,775
I'm sorry.
But, look.

124
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:08,276
Skydiving sounds
really fun and all,

125
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:11,876
But how is it gonna help
this company?

126
00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:13,768
Well, maybe before
you can heal the company,

127
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:16,709
You have to heal your soul
a little first.

128
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:20,343
"Ride a motorcycle.

129
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:23,376
"Learn to speak french.

130
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:25,775
"Get drunk at oktoberfest.

131
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:28,642
Watch every
james bond movie."

132
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:34,476
Millie, why do these
all sound so familiar?

133
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,942
Because they're all
your ideas.

134
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:38,076
You're always talking
about stuff you wanted to try,

135
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:39,809
And victoria either said
they were stupid

136
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:41,176
Or you were too busy.

137
00:05:41,243 --> 00:05:42,775
So while she was
telling me

138
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,809
I couldn't do any
of these things...

139
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:47,742
I was writing them down
so someday you could.

140
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:50,543
Welcome to someday,
brooke davis.

141
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,550
* maybe they had it made
somehow *

142
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,315
* living for there and then *

143
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,476
* under a psychedelic spell *

144
00:05:58,543 --> 00:05:59,976
Thank you.

145
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:01,675
So, you gonna show
me something?

146
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:05,175
* still they had so much
to tell *

147
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:08,243
* whatever happens
to the dreamers *

148
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:10,642
Hey, man.
What the hell was that?

149
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:12,143
That was game.

150
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:13,276
We not working
on your jumper,

151
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:14,376
So why would you pull up
like that?

152
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:15,487
You cut off the lane.

153
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:17,209
So, don't let me cut
the lane off, then.

154
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,109
What if your jumper
not falling that day?

155
00:06:19,176 --> 00:06:20,976
So, what? You too scared
to get physical?

156
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:23,253
You want physical?
Yeah.

157
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:26,842
* it's only when they close
their eyes *

158
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:29,610
Hoo-Hoo. That's what i'm talking
about, baby.

159
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:30,876
Whoo!

160
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:32,809
You're doing great, honey.

161
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:34,343
Thanks.Thanks.

162
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:38,143
Just check the ball.

163
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:54,809
* i love you, i do *

164
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:02,842
* nothing's ever been
this way before *

165
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:08,842
* a dream is just a dream
and nothing more *

166
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,709
* nothing's ever been

167
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:20,176
* a dream is just a dream
and nothing more *

168
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:46,676
<i>Were you ever sober
for an entire year?</i>

169
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:50,143
What part of "rock guitarist"
don't you get?

170
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,943
That's what i thought.

171
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:57,410
If you don't mind,
i'll have that back.

172
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,410
Why? So you can keep lying
to yourself?

173
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:02,862
You wouldn't understand.

174
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:05,343
You're right. You're right.
I don't understand.

175
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,110
I don't understand
any of this.

176
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,644
Honestly, i wish
you hadn't have come here.

177
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,843
I would have sucked
at being your father!

178
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:19,443
???At's why ellie and i
gave you up.

179
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:25,377
There, i said it.
Are you happy now?

180
00:08:25,443 --> 00:08:28,644
After 22 years,

181
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,177
<i>That is the best
you can give me -</i>

182
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:34,277
"There, i said it"?

183
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:38,210
That's all i got.

184
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:53,577
Thanks, dad.
You can go now.

185
00:09:00,443 --> 00:09:03,610
This is why i like
being on the road.

186
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,843
Hey, grandpa.
Where's nanny deb?

187
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,410
<i>I'm here
to pick you up today.</i>

188
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:17,177
Really? Cool.

189
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:19,300
So, wh do you
want to do?

190
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,800
Well, that depends.

191
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,743
What do you and nanny deb
usually do after school?

192
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:24,300
Um, eat lots
of ice cream.

193
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,343
That doesn't sound
like deb.

194
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,644
Are you sure she lets you eat
ice cream after school?

195
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:29,300
No.

196
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,076
She makes me eat
veggies instead,

197
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:34,577
Because they'll help me
grow big and strong.

198
00:09:34,644 --> 00:09:37,210
You want to know
a little secret?

199
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,510
Most adults will tell you
almost anything

200
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:42,544
To get you to eat your veggies,
and most of it's not true.

201
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,743
Well, carrots really do
give you x-Ray vision, right?

202
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:47,210
No.

203
00:09:47,277 --> 00:09:49,610
What?

204
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,976
* so let me in *

205
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:54,610
So, grandpa, do i really
get to make a wish

206
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:56,238
For every brussels sprout
i eat?

207
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:59,210
No, actually, they taste bad
for no reason at all.

208
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:00,675
Come on.

209
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,941
Hey, slow down
there, buddy.

210
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:05,410
You're gonna give yourself
a brain freeze.

211
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,510
Mmm. Is that good?

212
00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:11,876
Well, well.
What have we here?

213
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:15,943
<i>Oh. Guess what?
They kiss a lot.</i>

214
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,110
* well, they said
you was long gone *

215
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:20,477
You want some more?

216
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:21,943
Hey, little buddy.

217
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,876
Hi, uncle skills.
Hi, nanny deb.

218
00:10:24,943 --> 00:10:27,425
Ice cream after school.

219
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:29,377
<i>And i thought
i was a bad nanny.</i>

220
00:10:29,443 --> 00:10:30,816
Yeah. Well, you know,

221
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:33,076
They ran out of all
those x-Ray vision carrots.

222
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:35,277
*... and said all right *

223
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,809
So, granny deb,
can i talk to you?

224
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:47,010
* babydoll, the men who hang
like flowers in your hall *

225
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:52,876
* are asking when
your love... *

226
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,976
Is skills
out of high school yet?

227
00:10:55,043 --> 00:10:56,644
Uh, yeah, dan.

228
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:59,277
He graduated the day you turned
yourself in for murder.

229
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:02,143
And if you've come here
to criticize me -

230
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,676
I haven't.

231
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:07,010
I wanted to thank you
for telling the parole board

232
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:08,676
The truth about carrie.

233
00:11:08,743 --> 00:11:10,644
You did the right thing.

234
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:11,743
Did i?

235
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,676
Are we done here?

236
00:11:14,743 --> 00:11:16,310
Yeah, that's all
i wanted to say.

237
00:11:16,377 --> 00:11:18,676
Good.
Have a nice life, dan.

238
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:19,976
What's left of it.

239
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,425
* 'cause i can stay
or, honey... *

240
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:27,910
Let's go, antwon.
See you at home, sweetie.

241
00:11:27,976 --> 00:11:32,410
* just to wherever
you tell me so *

242
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:35,544
* and find my place there *

243
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,910
<i>Oh, it hurts.
It really hurts.</i>

244
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,577
Yeah,
i know how you feel.

245
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:45,143
Oh, my head.

246
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,510
Hey.

247
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:49,443
Did you eat all
the orange chicken?

248
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,222
Sorry.

249
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:52,863
Mouth usually gets9a
the mongolian beef

250
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:55,343
And i eat all
the orange chicken.

251
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,709
<i>Lucky for you
i like mongolian beef.</i>

252
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:02,143
How you doing...

253
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,743
Being away from him?

254
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:06,143
To be honest,
i wish he'd just come home.

255
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,876
If you ever decide you want
to leave, you just o.

256
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:10,843
No questions asked.

257
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,709
Thanks, brooke, but you've
always been there for me.

258
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,377
I think it's my turn
to be here for you.

259
00:12:17,443 --> 00:12:20,676
* babydoll *

260
00:12:26,487 --> 00:12:27,743
Lucas scott.

261
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:29,277
Lon. I'm with
putnam and pratt.

262
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:31,510
It's nice to meet you.

263
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:34,143
So, is lindsey gonna mt us
at the bookstore?

264
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,743
No, lindsey's in new york.

265
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:38,243
I'm gonna be taking her place
on the tour.

266
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,610
<i>Oh.</i>

267
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,110
Well, i guess it's just
you and me, then. Yep.

268
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:44,676
So, uh, what'd you think
about the book?

269
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,362
To be honest, i haven't had
a chance to read it yet,

270
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:48,544
But, hey, it's at the top
of my to-Do list.

271
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,277
"Comet," right?
I love science-Fiction.

272
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:18,343
Taking a trip
down memory lane?

273
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,610
I was just
dropping off jamie.

274
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,210
I know.

275
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,709
I heard about quentin fields.
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:28,425
He was a good
basketball player.

277
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:29,425
Yeah.

278
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,487
???

279
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,943
Makes you wonder how somebody
could do something like that.

280
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:43,377
It was good
to see you, son.

281
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:50,709
You saved my wife.
You saved my son.

282
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:55,269
But you killed my uncle,
right here where i'm standing.

283
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,377
I don't know
where that leaves us.

284
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:05,943
At least my son
loves you.

285
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:10,709
And my son hates me.

286
00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:12,776
Both of them.

287
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:46,976
I thought i said
you could go.

288
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:50,276
Yeah, well,
i... thought we should talk.

289
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:52,175
Okay.

290
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:53,362
I want to know why
you came here

291
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:54,962
Pretending not to be
my real dad.

292
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,297
What's a real dad?

293
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,597
I mean, you got a dad,

294
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,300
And obviously he did a good job
with you.

295
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,816
So why do you have to keep
pushg it?

296
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:03,660
Because it matters!

297
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,827
So all this is just because
i couldn't tell you the truth?

298
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:07,360
No! No.

299
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:10,726
All of this because
you have missed my whole life,

300
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:13,626
And it really doesn't seem
to bother you.

301
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:16,960
You know,
i think you're right.

302
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:20,461
It's probably a good time for me
to just move on.

303
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:26,112
Great. I'm glad we can agree
on something.

304
00:15:40,494 --> 00:15:43,112
* good arms versus bad arms... *

305
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:46,300
You know, this turnout
isn't exactly inspiring me

306
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,934
To read your book, lucas.

307
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,300
Whose brilliant idea
was it

308
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:51,567
To put this signing in
the science-Fiction section?

309
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:53,033
It's a book
about space, right?

310
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,067
No, actually,
um, the comet's a metaphor.

311
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,300
It's a love story.

312
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:02,567
Well, you know what?

313
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:04,434
We could have had this thing
out in the middle of main street,

314
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:06,100
We wouldn't have gotten
any more traffic.

315
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,167
Thanks for the support.

316
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah.

317
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,767
Will you sign my book?

318
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:12,767
Yeah, of course i will.
What's your name?

319
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:14,434
Hadley.
Hadley.

320
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:15,300
That's a really
pretty name.

321
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,634
You know,
my best friend's name is haley.

322
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:19,767
But, uh,
i like "hadley" better.

323
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:22,000
Thanks.

324
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:28,367
Uh, actually,
this is a "gossip girl" book.

325
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:30,501
<i>I know - My favorite.</i>

326
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:33,534
*... rest at arm's length *

327
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:36,367
* when they reach out,
don't touch them *

328
00:16:36,434 --> 00:16:39,734
Here you go.
Thanks.

329
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,567
Mouth. Oh, my god.
It's good to see you, man.

330
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:47,434
Lucas scott -
Big-Time writer.

331
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:49,701
Am i the, uh,
last one to arrive?

332
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,767
A- Actually,
you're the first.

333
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,901
Oh?
Yeah.

334
00:16:53,968 --> 00:16:55,033
Oh.

335
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,267
* i decided this decision
some... *

336
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:02,300
When did brooke davis become
all work and no play?

337
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:03,834
I am actually playing
right now.

338
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:05,400
I'm gonna take
skydiving lessons.

339
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:06,634
You want to come
with me?

340
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:09,767
Ah, thanks,
but, no. No, thank you.

341
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:12,767
Come on. I'm looking up
the safest places to go.

342
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,868
Okay, well, i'm pretty sure
they're all equally unsafe.

343
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,634
Listen.

344
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:20,334
Would you be interested
in fostering a child?

345
00:17:22,237 --> 00:17:24,968
Well, i guess it would depend
on the situation.

346
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:26,634
Do you remember sam?

347
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:30,601
She's, um - She's the one
that stole from your store.

348
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:34,133
<i>It figures she'd get pregnant.
She's so young!</i>

349
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,701
No, she's not pregnant.
It's her.

350
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:37,334
She's the one
that needs fostering.

351
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,701
<i>But she's so old.</i>

352
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,634
Well, she's 15.

353
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:41,834
Look, i found her sleeping

354
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:43,701
In the backseat of a car
in shop class,

355
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:45,200
And her current
foster parents

356
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:46,834
Didn't even know
that she was gone.

357
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:49,033
Well, maybe they can
foster her in jail,

358
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,834
'Cause it's where
she's headed.

359
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:53,100
I think she's just acting out
for attention.

360
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,100
It kind of reminds me
of somebody else

361
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:57,238
I used to know
in high school.

362
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:02,334
Haley, i'm sorry, but...

363
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,234
I can't take in a teenager
right now.

364
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,467
Find me a cute little baby
in shop class,

365
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:10,901
We can talk about it.

366
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:14,501
That's okay.
I- I totally understand.

367
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,000
It's just...

368
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:20,534
I think of jamie and how i would
do anything to protect him.

369
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,601
And then i look at sam,

370
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:27,267
And i wonder...
who's protecting her.

371
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:39,868
Well, this is officially
embarrassing.

372
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:42,601
Luke, it's not that bad.

373
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,767
I've signed exactly
two books today,

374
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,133
One of which
was a "gossip girl" book.

375
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,934
I hear those
are pretty good.

376
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,634
That's not helping, mouth.

377
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:52,601
I'm sorry.

378
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:54,300
Look,
maybe it's just omaha.

379
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:57,801
I doubt it. My first book
sold really well here.

380
00:18:57,868 --> 00:19:00,033
This can't be good.

381
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Well, then,
look on the bright side.

382
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,067
You get to hang out
with an old friend.

383
00:19:05,534 --> 00:19:07,667
Can i get a picture?

384
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:09,501
Yeah, sure.

385
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:12,801
All right, sweet.
Okay.

386
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:15,033
Right there. Thanks.

387
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Sorry, luke.

388
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,434
Say it.

389
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:22,033
Actually,
i'd rather not.

390
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,868
Come on.
Just say it.

391
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,601
This is marvin mcfadden
on sports,

392
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,267
And you've just heard
a mouthful.

393
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,067
Nice!

394
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,234
Thank you.
Yeah.

395
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,300
Thank you.

396
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:48,767
So, how'd it go
with brooke?

397
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:50,968
She's just not ready
to take in

398
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:53,167
A rebellious teenager
right now.

399
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:57,534
Well...
she could stay with us.

400
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:58,934
No.
I thought about that,

401
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,767
But jamie's been through
so much.

402
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,501
It's just not a good time
for him.

403
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:05,601
Yeah. So have you.

404
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,067
Hello.

405
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:16,133
Nate - Mike wilson.

406
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,503
Listen. I heard
you were looking

407
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:19,400
For the opportunity
to play ball again.

408
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:20,300
Yes, sir?

409
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,334
Well, i have one for you.

410
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,754
But it might not be exactly
what you're thinking.

411
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:31,868
* come on *

412
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:32,801
* wow *

413
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,367
* wow *

414
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:45,901
Wow.

415
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,347
???

416
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:53,334
<i>Man, that can't be good
for nobody's back.</i>

417
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,434
This is the coolest thing
i've ever seen.

418
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:56,801
You have to do this, daddy.

419
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,300
Yeah.

420
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:17,501
Brooke.
What is all this?

421
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:26,834
I have to tell you
something.

422
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:29,367
Okay.

423
00:21:29,434 --> 00:21:32,701
I'm sorry,
but i lied to you.

424
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:39,816
I didn't fall
down the stairs, peyton.

425
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:54,946
So, what are you
thinking, man?

426
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,212
For real?
Yeah.

427
00:21:58,315 --> 00:21:59,946
Well, i was wondering

428
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:02,679
If your mom would ever get back
with your dad.

429
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:04,456
Man, i'm not talking about this
with you.

430
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,013
Well, you asked me
what i was thinking about.

431
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,979
That's what i was
thinking about.

432
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:08,212
That's not what i meant.

433
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,746
And will you stop
trying to act

434
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:11,913
Like this situation with my mom
is for real?

435
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:13,379
What's that
supposed toMean?

436
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:14,813
You know exactly
what it means.

437
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:16,546
The only people
signing off on this

438
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:18,913
Are you, her,
and jamie, okay?

439
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:25,913
Look at that boy.

440
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:29,212
He's just jumping around,
having fun.

441
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,312
I mean, after everything
he been through lately,

442
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:35,080
He just keep going.

443
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,846
Won't let nothing
beat him down.

444
00:22:36,913 --> 00:22:38,579
That's a strong kid
right there.

445
00:22:38,646 --> 00:22:40,080
He gets that
from his mom.

446
00:22:40,146 --> 00:22:41,779
No.

447
00:22:41,846 --> 00:22:43,245
He gets it
from both of you.

448
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:45,446
Owen: well, well.

449
00:22:45,512 --> 00:22:46,813
Guess it's official.

450
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:48,813
<i>They will let anyone play
in this league.</i>

451
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:50,579
I see that.

452
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:52,013
How you doing, man?
Good, man.

453
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,813
You know skills, right?
What's up, skills?

454
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,316
You really think victoria

455
00:22:56,316 --> 00:22:58,479
Could have done something
like that to you?

456
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:00,813
No.

457
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,779
I mean, i don't know.

458
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:06,679
I think i needed somebody
to blame.

459
00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:09,312
I wish you would have
told me.

460
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:12,946
I wanted to,
but i didn't know how.

461
00:23:13,013 --> 00:23:17,512
Honey, i am your best friend.
I love you.

462
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:19,245
That is why you have me.

463
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:22,913
And it kills me that i wasn't
able to be there for you.

464
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:24,813
It's gonna sound weird,

465
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:28,013
But i was just
really embarrassed.

466
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,279
I felt weak and...

467
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:34,679
<i>You and luke
were so happy,</i>

468
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,146
And i did not want to ruin that
for you.

469
00:23:37,212 --> 00:23:38,379
No. Hey.

470
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:40,412
<i>I never want you to think</i>

471
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:43,713
That you can't come to me
for anything.

472
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:45,446
I'm here for you
forever.

473
00:23:47,487 --> 00:23:48,279
Promise?

474
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,013
Yeah!

475
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,180
Of course i promise.
You're stuck with me.

476
00:23:55,245 --> 00:23:59,979
I'm really sorry
that i've been distant.

477
00:24:00,046 --> 00:24:01,679
I'm trying to get back.

478
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:04,312
It's just gonna take
a little while.

479
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:08,412
I'm not going
anywhere... ever.

480
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:16,279
Lucas.
We need to talk.

481
00:24:16,345 --> 00:24:19,363
Okay, but, please,
when we get to seattle,

482
00:24:19,363 --> 00:24:21,925
Don't set me up
in the science-Fiction section.

483
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:23,146
There isn't gonna be
a seattle.

484
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:25,646
And what about the $est
of the tour?

485
00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:28,512
It's over.
I'm sorry.

486
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:30,300
Because of one bad
signing?

487
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,913
Let's face it.

488
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:32,813
If they didn't come out
to see you here in omaha,

489
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:35,846
They're not gonna come see you
in the bigger markets.

490
00:24:35,913 --> 00:24:40,180
I need to talk to lindsey.
She believes in this book.

491
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,479
It wasn't her decision.

492
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,979
And if it makes you feel
any better,

493
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:44,746
She didn't agree with it.

494
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:46,579
That's why you didn't read
the book.

495
00:24:46,646 --> 00:24:48,013
Lucas -

496
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,679
You are - You knew this
was gonna happen.

497
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:54,512
<i>They sent you to deliver
the bad news.</i>

498
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:56,212
What are you -
The grim reaper?

499
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,779
I've been called worse.

500
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,579
I'm sure you have.

501
00:24:59,646 --> 00:25:00,813
I am sorry, lucas.

502
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:02,579
Go home,
write another book.

503
00:25:02,646 --> 00:25:04,679
I promise i'll read
the next one.

504
00:25:04,746 --> 00:25:08,546
* guess it ends here *

505
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,813
Oh.

506
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,946
Dude, do you know what
this reminds me of? What?

507
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:17,312
Um, remember second grade

508
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:19,245
When you found out how much
money martha stewart made,

509
00:25:19,312 --> 00:25:20,979
And you started your own
cookie business?

510
00:25:21,046 --> 00:25:23,546
Oh, my god - Brookies.
Brookies!

511
00:25:23,612 --> 00:25:25,345
The only thing worse
than the name

512
00:25:25,412 --> 00:25:26,846
Was the actual cookie.

513
00:25:27,238 --> 00:25:28,457
???

514
00:25:28,457 --> 00:25:29,713
They were terrible!

515
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,180
And you almost burnt
my house down.

516
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:32,679
No. No, i didn't.
Yes, you did!

517
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:34,646
I did not.
I set off one smoke detector,

518
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:37,080
<i>And your dad acted like i almost
burned the house down.</i>

519
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:38,646
<i>He was so mad at me.</i>

520
00:25:38,713 --> 00:25:40,345
No, he was just worried
about us.

521
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:41,746
It felt kind of nice

522
00:25:41,813 --> 00:25:44,713
To have somebody worried
for a change.

523
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,312
Hey, speaking of larry,

524
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,180
Uh, you're not the only one
keeping secrets.

525
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:52,080
I probably should have
told you this.

526
00:25:52,146 --> 00:25:54,746
I've met my birth dad.

527
00:25:54,813 --> 00:25:56,113
What?

528
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,946
Yeah, it's mick -
The guitarist.

529
00:25:58,013 --> 00:26:00,046
Are you serious?
What's he like?

530
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:03,345
Ohh. Um...
he's a mess.

531
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:05,646
I mean, it's cool
that he's a musician,

532
00:26:05,713 --> 00:26:08,846
But he's just really not
what i expected him to be.

533
00:26:08,913 --> 00:26:11,913
Yeah, i'm sorry, peyton.

534
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:13,846
I know how it feels.

535
00:26:13,913 --> 00:26:17,013
If only we could pick
our parents.

536
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,815
Yeah, but then you look
at larry,

537
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:22,175
<i>And it's pretty cool
when they get to pick you.</i>

538
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:29,999
I'm sorry omaha
wasn't everything

539
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:31,199
You hoped it would be,
luke.

540
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:32,666
Oh, it isn't that bad.

541
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:35,766
At least oed today was mine.9?

542
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:38,592
How about you, huh?

543
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:40,993
Is omaha everything
you hoped it would be?

544
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,592
I like it here.
I mean, they love their sports.

545
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:45,691
You should see this place during
the college world series.

546
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:47,925
The whole city
gets into it.

547
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,792
I have the job
i've always dreamed of.

548
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:53,643
Well, it sounds like
you're right at home.

549
00:26:53,643 --> 00:26:55,315
<i>That's the thing.
It's not home.</i>

550
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:57,831
At least not
without millie.

551
00:26:57,831 --> 00:26:59,531
Yeah, how is that
working for you?

552
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:01,064
It hasn't been easy.

553
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:04,031
The truth is
i'm kind of lost without her,

554
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:06,430
But she knows how important
this job is to me,

555
00:27:06,497 --> 00:27:08,664
So we'll make it work.

556
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:11,330
I'm sure you will.

557
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:12,998
So, you're headed back
to tree hill.

558
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,131
You gonna be okay?

559
00:27:14,198 --> 00:27:16,098
I'll survive.

560
00:27:16,165 --> 00:27:17,697
Like my mom always says,
you know,

561
00:27:17,764 --> 00:27:19,297
"Whenever you're having
a bad day,

562
00:27:19,364 --> 00:27:22,464
"Someone else out there
is having a worse day.

563
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:24,330
So just stop and focus
on all the good things."

564
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:25,697
I mean, think about it.
She's right.

565
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:28,253
Today, i got to hang out
with one of my best friends,

566
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:32,113
And then tonight,
i get to go home to peyton.

567
00:27:32,113 --> 00:27:34,664
Sounds like
a pretty good day.

568
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:36,664
I mean, i'm not gonna lie.

569
00:27:36,731 --> 00:27:40,098
I was really looking forward
to this book tour.

570
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:43,098
I guess i just
thought that...

571
00:27:43,165 --> 00:27:45,931
I'd be on top of the world
for a couple weeks.

572
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,864
Yeah, me too.

573
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:12,550
Hey, what's up, jamie?
How you doing, buddy?

574
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,987
Sorry, owen.
I'm on team brooke.

575
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:16,738
Did it just get cold
in here?

576
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:19,937
Yeah, i don't blame him.
I screwed that up.

577
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:22,070
<i>It's none
of my business, man.</i>

578
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:24,638
So, what you think, man?
You gonna come play for us?

579
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,638
We need a scorer.

580
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,738
I - I don't know.

581
00:28:27,803 --> 00:28:30,704
It's fun out there, nate -
Flying through the air.

582
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,404
Nothing like it.

583
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:33,671
I'm just worried my back

584
00:28:33,738 --> 00:28:35,504
Can't take something like this
right now.

585
00:28:35,571 --> 00:28:36,487
It's not as bad
as it looks.

586
00:28:36,487 --> 00:28:38,437
Besides, they got springs
in the floor.

587
00:28:38,504 --> 00:28:40,437
It's gonna be easier
on your back than hardwood.

588
00:28:40,504 --> 00:28:41,937
Yeah, but
on a hardwood floor,

589
00:28:42,004 --> 00:28:43,704
The other players
can't knock you out.

590
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:46,999
Just remember - They can't hit
you if they can't catch you.

591
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,537
Ohh.

592
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:51,004
That won't be you.

593
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,803
<i>How do i look?</i>

594
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,070
For a guy wearing too much
makeup, you look pretty cute.

595
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,870
<i>Thanks.
I miss you.</i>

596
00:29:00,937 --> 00:29:03,304
<i>Omaha's just not the same
without you.</i>

597
00:29:03,371 --> 00:29:06,037
Tree hill's not the same
without you.

598
00:29:06,104 --> 00:29:07,371
Have a good show.

599
00:29:07,437 --> 00:29:08,847
Call me later.

600
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:13,999
<i>Hi. I was just heading home.
What do you got there?</i>

601
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:14,738
Cookies.

602
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:17,004
They're mostly burnt, but it's
the thought that counts.

603
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,137
Enjoy.

604
00:29:18,204 --> 00:29:19,471
Thanks.

605
00:29:19,537 --> 00:29:21,285
Um, i added a few more ideas
to the list.

606
00:29:23,237 --> 00:29:24,970
"Be a mom."

607
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:31,371
It's no fun being alone.

608
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,537
<i>Okay, before we jump
into the day's scores,</i>

609
00:29:33,604 --> 00:29:34,629
<i>I wanted to follow up
on a story</i>

610
00:29:34,629 --> 00:29:37,738
<i>We did a couple of weeks ago
about darren rivers.</i>

611
00:29:37,803 --> 00:29:40,097
<i>Now, for those of you
who just landed on earth,</i>

612
00:29:40,097 --> 00:29:41,425
<i>He's the pro-Bowl quarterback</i>

613
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:42,725
<i>Who shocked the world
last month</i>

614
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:44,192
<i>When he retired from the nfl,</i>

615
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:47,692
<i>Turning down a $68 million
contract extension</i>

616
00:29:47,758 --> 00:29:50,391
<i>So he could spend more time
with his family.</i>

617
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:53,238
<i>Now, naturally,
i put up a czy meter</i>

618
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:54,999
<i>With darren's face
in the middle of it.</i>

619
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:57,315
<i>I gave him an 8 out of 10.</i>

620
00:29:57,503 --> 00:30:00,675
<i>Well, it turns out he might be
the least crazy all of us.</i>

621
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:03,613
<i>You see, he just realized
that money isn't everything.</i>

622
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:05,238
<i>I think sometimes
we all lose sight</i>

623
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:06,692
<i>Of what really matters
the most.</i>

624
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:09,458
<i>Darren rivers just figured
it out before i did.</i>

625
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:12,999
<i>So, darren, please accept
my sincere apology,</i>

626
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:15,632
<i>And i'm officially moving you
down the crazy meter</i>

627
00:30:15,699 --> 00:30:16,899
<i>From an 8 to a 3.</i>

628
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:18,050
<i>Because let's face it -</i>

629
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,988
<i>You still turned down
$68 million.</i>

630
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,999
<i>In the american league...
hello?</i>

631
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:29,666
Hi. How's
my favorite author?

632
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:32,166
He was just thinking
about his fiancE.

633
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:35,033
Oh, well, should i give you
five minutes?

634
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,399
No, i was just packing.

635
00:30:37,466 --> 00:30:39,766
You off to seattle?

636
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:42,200
Um...

637
00:30:42,865 --> 00:30:44,753
Actually,
i'm coming home.

638
00:30:44,753 --> 00:30:46,409
They canceled
my book tour.

639
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:48,347
What are you
talking about? Why?

640
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,504
It doesn't matter.

641
00:30:50,504 --> 00:30:53,737
<i>No, it does matter.
You worked so hard for this.</i>

642
00:30:53,737 --> 00:30:55,238
Hey, it's okay, peyton.

643
00:30:55,303 --> 00:30:57,437
I still have you, and that's all
that really matters.

644
00:30:57,504 --> 00:31:00,804
Besides, this book brought us
back together, so...

645
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:02,837
It's the best thing
i've ever written.

646
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:06,238
You come home to me, then.
I love you.

647
00:31:06,303 --> 00:31:08,303
I love you, too.

648
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:11,004
I'll be home soon.
Bye.

649
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,937
<i>...1-0.</i>

650
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:16,804
<i>Two words - Batting practice.
Pass it on.</i>

651
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:17,971
<i>This isn't soccer.</i>

652
00:31:18,037 --> 00:31:20,171
<i>That's it, omaha.</i>

653
00:31:20,238 --> 00:31:22,004
<i>I'm marvin mcfadden on sports,</i>

654
00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:24,071
<i>And you've just heard
a mouthful.</i>

655
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:25,871
<i>We'll be right back
after this.</i>

656
00:31:37,503 --> 00:31:40,670
What are you doing here?

657
00:31:40,737 --> 00:31:43,337
It's kind of late
to be out alone.

658
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:45,800
Well,
i don't have a curfew.

659
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,737
Yeah. Hmm.

660
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:50,494
I didn't have a curfew
either.

661
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:52,294
When i was your age,

662
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:55,995
It was just me
and my parents' credit cards.

663
00:31:57,754 --> 00:31:59,062
Lucky you.

664
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,728
Not really.

665
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:03,831
It would have been nice
to have someone to talk to.

666
00:32:03,831 --> 00:32:05,175
Parents are overrated.

667
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:08,050
Sometimes.

668
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,425
Two weeks ago, my mom told me
she never wanted me.

669
00:32:12,425 --> 00:32:15,559
Well... my mom gave me up
when i was born,

670
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:19,159
So, in a way,
she told me she didn't want me.

671
00:32:19,225 --> 00:32:22,026
At least she didn't wait
35 years like yours did.

672
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:24,692
I'm not 35!

673
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:27,392
Do i look 35 to you?!

674
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:31,959
I don't know.
Uh, look, i-I got to get going.

675
00:32:32,026 --> 00:32:33,559
Like you said,
it's getting late.

676
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:34,692
Listen.

677
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,959
Look, i know this is...

678
00:32:37,026 --> 00:32:38,659
Totally out of the blue,

679
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:43,059
And i'm surprising myself
by saying it, but...

680
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:46,959
I have an extra room,
and it's yours if you want it.

681
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:50,258
You can come and go
as you please - Whatever.

682
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:52,559
So, what do you say?

683
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:55,759
I don't need this.
I can take care of myself.

684
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:57,225
Yeah, i know you can,

685
00:32:57,292 --> 00:33:01,059
???Right now.

686
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:05,592
* moon pours through
the ceiling tonight *

687
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:08,050
Sam, if you're that
uncomfortable in my house,

688
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,258
You can always sleep
in my car.

689
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:20,026
* shows me we're right
for each other *

690
00:33:23,026 --> 00:33:24,859
You don't come around
for 22 years,

691
00:33:24,926 --> 00:33:27,492
And now you won't go.

692
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,193
Well, i wanted to leave you
with something.

693
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:34,059
This chip is the only truly
meaningful thing that i own,

694
00:33:34,126 --> 00:33:37,059
And, um, now it's yours.

695
00:33:39,926 --> 00:33:43,926
That was ellie's the year
she was pregnant with you.

696
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:48,525
And, uh, to tell the truth,
you saved her life, peyton.

697
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:53,258
She was hell-Bent on staying
sober during the pregnancy,

698
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:55,492
And that was hard for her.

699
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:58,193
* only the heartaches
have given me sight *

700
00:33:58,258 --> 00:34:01,525
<i>But it was so much harder
giving you up.</i>

701
00:34:01,592 --> 00:34:04,826
Then why did she?

702
00:34:04,892 --> 00:34:06,392
Because we thought
there was a better life

703
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:08,358
For you out there.

704
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:11,926
We couldn't raise a kid,
not in our world.

705
00:34:11,992 --> 00:34:15,792
But i don't think ellie
ever really got past it.

706
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:20,659
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

707
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:24,926
I don't know.

708
00:34:24,992 --> 00:34:26,392
Maybi didn't want
to mess

709
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:27,316
With the picture you had
in your head

710
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:31,258
Of what your birth father
was really like -

711
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:35,193
Something better than me,
something more heroic.

712
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,392
I guess i just didn't want
to disappoint you.

713
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:44,059
* more than yesterday *

714
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:46,193
Anyhow,
i, uh, made a few calls.

715
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:47,659
I'm gonna jump
on the last leg

716
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:50,059
Of this tour
for a few weeks.

717
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:51,559
It's what i do.

718
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:57,258
I'm sorry.

719
00:34:57,325 --> 00:35:03,026
* only the heartaches
have given me sight *

720
00:35:05,126 --> 00:35:07,675
People always leave?

721
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:12,592
Sometimes that's
a good thing, huh?

722
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:17,237
But, for what it's worth,
you're doing great, kid.

723
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:23,193
I'll see ya.

724
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:26,625
Mick.

725
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:28,625
Thank you.

726
00:35:28,692 --> 00:35:30,592
For what?

727
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:34,726
For giving me up.

728
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:37,358
* yeah, yeah *

729
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:47,126
Oh.

730
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:55,859
Ugh.

731
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,559
Hey.

732
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,126
These are for you.

733
00:36:05,193 --> 00:36:07,258
I just figured you deserve
to be with somebody

734
00:36:07,325 --> 00:36:08,358
Who gave you flowers.

735
00:36:08,425 --> 00:36:11,392
Mmm, they're perfect.

736
00:36:20,126 --> 00:36:23,093
Hey! Saw the show.

737
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,559
What'd you think?

738
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:26,258
You were great, mouth.

739
00:36:26,325 --> 00:36:28,193
Thanks.
What time's your flight?

740
00:36:28,258 --> 00:36:30,566
About an hour.

741
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:32,358
Well, i have
this crazy idea.

742
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:33,926
What if you didn't
get on it?

743
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:37,325
No offense, mouth,
but i cangt be your millie.

744
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:39,726
<i>What do you think
about driving back?</i>

745
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:43,726
You're coming home.

746
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:46,159
I guess i never
really left.

747
00:36:46,225 --> 00:36:48,492
Yeah, but what about
your dream job?

748
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:50,592
Dream job or dream girl?

749
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:52,459
Dream girl.

750
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:53,892
No contest.

751
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:56,459
Although i'm kind of becoming
the flakiest employee ever,

752
00:36:56,525 --> 00:36:57,759
But i don't care.

753
00:36:57,826 --> 00:36:59,826
I miss millie,
and i miss my friends.

754
00:36:59,892 --> 00:37:01,525
It just took me
a little while

755
00:37:01,592 --> 00:37:03,331
To realize
what was important.

756
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:06,892
All right, let's do it.
Yes!

757
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,625
But i'm driving.
You got a book to read.

758
00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:10,292
<i>Are you gonna make me read
your book</i>

759
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:11,692
<i>With you sitting
right next to me?</i>

760
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:14,059
Cover to cover.

761
00:37:14,126 --> 00:37:15,425
I may even quiz you.

762
00:37:15,492 --> 00:37:17,258
Well, it's aaood thing
i like science fiction.

763
00:37:17,325 --> 00:37:18,193
Ohh.

764
00:37:20,347 --> 00:37:25,425
* the subject
of some new disgrace *

765
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:26,859
* her whole story
was so obvious to me *

766
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:28,592
Did you make the team?

767
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:31,826
Well, that all depends
on what my wife thinks.

768
00:37:31,892 --> 00:37:34,126
This league is -
Is different.

769
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:35,459
Different how?

770
00:37:35,525 --> 00:37:37,492
Well,
it's called slamball.

771
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:40,225
<i>It's called slamball?</i>

772
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,525
Yeah.

773
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,325
That sounds physical.

774
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:44,625
It's not... really.

775
00:37:44,692 --> 00:37:48,325
It's a lot of dunking,
and it's kind of

776
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:50,292
It's called slamball.

777
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:51,659
Uh...

778
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:53,425
Look, here's the thing.

779
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:54,792
I'm not ready
to give it up yet,

780
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:56,425
But no team is gonna give me
a tryout

781
00:37:56,492 --> 00:37:57,826
Unless i prove
that i'm healthy.

782
00:37:57,892 --> 00:38:00,826
So i thought this would...

783
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:03,392
I don't know.

784
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:06,193
<i>You really think
you can still play?</i>

785
00:38:06,258 --> 00:38:08,759
<i>I know i can.</i>

786
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:11,999
And no one else
will give you a tryout?

787
00:38:13,826 --> 00:38:15,392
Make that shot.

788
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:25,659
Okay. Back up now
and try it again.

789
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:31,625
One more time.

790
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:33,358
*... when we got married *

791
00:38:33,425 --> 00:38:39,292
* there were things
i never said *

792
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:44,159
They are crazy
not to give you a tryout.

793
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:46,126
Ugh.

794
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:48,525
Go play slamball.

795
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,193
Yeah?
Yeah.

796
00:38:50,258 --> 00:38:53,759
And this is officially
a comeback, nathan scott.

797
00:38:57,459 --> 00:39:00,193
* you know when a heart's
in pain *

798
00:39:00,258 --> 00:39:02,159
So, this is it.

799
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:03,726
* there's nobody... *

800
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:06,292
Check it out.

801
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:10,525
* the only light
under the doctor's knife *

802
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,059
* is that we're the same *

803
00:39:13,126 --> 00:39:15,759
* hearts in,
hearts in, hearts in *

804
00:39:15,826 --> 00:39:17,559
This is your room.

805
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:21,625
I've never had
my own room before.

806
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,792
No boys.

807
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:26,459
Yeah.

808
00:39:26,525 --> 00:39:30,859
* the battles you fight
in the war of your life *

809
00:39:30,926 --> 00:39:33,425

* to make this go away *

821
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:30,792
Hey, little man.

822
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:32,659
You've been through
a lot lately.

00:40:32,726 --> 00:40:33,826
How you doing?

824
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:37,559
I have nightmares sometimes.
I get scared.

825
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:40,258
You do?

826
00:40:40,258 --> 00:40:42,159

00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,659
Sure.

So do i.

829
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,959
Hey, i have an idea.

830
00:40:48,026 --> 00:40:50,093
How about i sleep
in here tonight

831
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,959
Just in case
i get scared?

832
00:40:52,026 --> 00:40:53,987
Okay.
I'll protect you.

833
00:40:53,987 --> 00:40:55,191
Oh! Okay.

834
00:40:57,325 --> 00:40:58,726
<i>What if i get scared?</i>

835
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:01,926
I'll protect you, too.

836
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,026
My hero.
Oh, geez.

837
00:41:06,093 --> 00:41:07,392
Ohh.

838
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:09,659
I didn't know it was
gonna get that crowded!

839
00:41:11,592 --> 00:41:13,659
So, what do you think
of the book so far?

840
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:15,816
Dude, seriously.
Quit asking me.

841
00:41:15,816 --> 00:41:17,459
I will throw this book
out the window.

842
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:20,093
That's the only signed one
in the world.

843
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,659
It's a collector's item.

844
00:41:28,026 --> 00:41:30,459
We'll always have
omaha, mouth.

845
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,675
You just said a mouthful.

846
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,050
Nice.
