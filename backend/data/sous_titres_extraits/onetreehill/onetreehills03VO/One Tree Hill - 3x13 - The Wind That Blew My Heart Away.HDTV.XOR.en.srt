1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:01,962
Nathan...

2
00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:04,808
did you pay Chris to help me with my music?

3
00:00:04,893 --> 00:00:07,054
If you are gonna help me with Haley's record,

4
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:09,350
you could maybe move into the house with me.

5
00:00:09,438 --> 00:00:11,217
You're even prettier than I remembered.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,607
Keith Scott? Put your hands behind your head.

7
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:16,183
You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Dan Scott.

8
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:17,766
The arrest was a favor.

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,132
Without anything solid, I can't hold him.

10
00:00:20,607 --> 00:00:24,903
2,798 miles -- that's how far apart our dream schools are.

11
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:28,173
If I tell you not to go to Stanford, I'm telling you not to follow your dreams.

12
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:30,928
If I tell you to go, I'm saying I don't want to be with you.

13
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,071
I need your help.

14
00:00:32,243 --> 00:00:33,784
She's using you.

15
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:34,303
How?

16
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:38,132
I know if she's being nice to you, it is for a reason, and not a good one.

17
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:39,458
I have cancer.

18
00:00:39,975 --> 00:00:42,829
I want you to be here when the album comes out.

19
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:44,412
I will be here, Peyton.

20
00:00:44,618 --> 00:00:46,154
It's okay that you're into Peyton.

21
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:48,015
I found the things in your closet.

22
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:49,386
I hurt you pretty bad.

23
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,043
I'm not gonna do it again.

24
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:49,987
It's crazy outside. You got a towel?

25
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,261
Do you have my next letter?

26
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:56,724
Linen closet.

27
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,333
Well, I hope I don't disappoint you.

28
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,765
I know I set the bar pretty high with the first two.

29
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,607
Shh, I'm reading here.

30
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:14,483
Oh, Lucas.

31
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:18,073
Naughty.

32
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:23,190
Is it okay?

33
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:28,832
Whoa, hold that thought.

34
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:39,549
You better not have finished all the hot chocolate.

35
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,120
What's going on?

36
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,224
It's time.

37
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:53,629
The record's done.

38
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:55,996
I've got to go.

39
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,939
It's late, Ellie. There's a storm, you know? Where are you rushing off to?

40
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:05,965
There's just some things that I can't do here.

41
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:09,570
So this is goodbye?

42
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:11,716
For now.

43
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:23,654
Hello?

44
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:26,515
Hello?

45
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,737
You braved the storm for me?

46
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:33,348
I braved the storm for you and "Say anything."

47
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:38,379
Your parents don't mind you having a boy in your room?

48
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,775
Under three boys is fine.

49
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:43,819
Under three beers, too, although, I break those rules from time to time.

50
00:03:44,997 --> 00:03:45,947
Want one?

51
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:49,789
No, thanks, I don't really drink... much.

52
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:51,182
Suit yourself.

53
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:52,286
Yeah.

54
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:54,770
Thanks.

55
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:00,578
What are you doing?

56
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,133
Sorry. I...

57
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:07,110
I just want to be able to prove I was really here,

58
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,533
you know, like in your bedroom.

59
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,463
You're so cute.

60
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,311
Come on.

61
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:15,980
Let's make it a good one.

62
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:23,778
This is so bad.

63
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:28,036
Yeah, I never should've let Lucas and Haley build that golf course on the rooftop.

64
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:31,526
Oh, speaking of, I got ahold of Lucas.

65
00:04:31,682 --> 00:04:33,507
He's having dinner at Brooke's,

66
00:04:33,748 --> 00:04:37,494
so I told him to stay put until the worst of the storm passes,

67
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,352
even if it's not until morning.

68
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:43,619
You told Lucas to spend the night with Brooke?

69
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:46,395
You're, like, every teenage boy's dream mom.

70
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:48,369
It's not like that.

71
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:49,937
Oh, yes, it is.

72
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:51,642
Single guy,

73
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,399
single girl,

74
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,093
lots of history.

75
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:56,983
Nothing's gonna happen.

76
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,346
We'll see about that.

77
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:13,380
Haley, what are you doing here? Aren't the roads all closed?

78
00:05:13,477 --> 00:05:14,902
It's like martial law or something.

79
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:18,001
I know, but I had to talk to you. I decided to go to Duke.

80
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,429
Okay, why don't you come inside?

81
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:27,075
Okay, so I've been doing some research. Duke has an amazing basketball program.

82
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:31,180
I mean, their coach -- this guy, coach Krez-a-zewski -- he's like a legend.

83
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:32,622
Coach Krzyzewski?

84
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,479
Ksha-- yeah. What?

85
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,970
People call him coach K.

86
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,837
So should you. You should have this opportunity.

87
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,978
Duke's  a really great school, and I think I could be really happy there,

88
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:44,153
especially if I was with you.

89
00:05:44,384 --> 00:05:46,493
Well, you can't go to Duke, Hales,

90
00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:48,055
and I don't want you to.

91
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:53,891
You don't want me to? Right.

92
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:58,521
Right. What was I thinking? Because you told me that you loved me after the game and,

93
00:05:58,632 --> 00:06:02,950
silly me, I thought that feeling would last for longer than, I don't know, one night.

94
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:04,578
But then again, I forgot.

95
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,313
You're the guy who loves to rip the rug out just when I feel

96
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:09,695
like we're getting some sort of stable ground.

97
00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:10,383
Haley --

98
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:13,886
You freak out after we have sex for the first time in god knows how long.

99
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:15,812
And by the way, I know exactly how long it was.

100
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,961
And frankly, I'm still pissed about that birth-control thing.

101
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:20,728
What?

102
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:24,434
Haley, you can't go to Duke because I'm going to Stanford.

103
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:30,565
Good sign or bad, do you think?

104
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:34,755
Mouth...

105
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,716
did you just try to kiss me?

106
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:39,355
Sort of.

107
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:42,723
Wow. Ballsy.

108
00:06:43,257 --> 00:06:44,868
So, is that why they call you Mouth?

109
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:48,013
No, but you're the one who invited me over to watch a movie...

110
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,328
in your bedroom,

111
00:06:49,582 --> 00:06:52,394
and then you offer me a beer and turn out the lights.

112
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,094
It's a blackout, Mouth.

113
00:06:55,571 --> 00:06:56,410
Oh.

114
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:57,858
Sorry.

115
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:01,868
Oh, don't laugh.

116
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:03,708
Don't cry. It's just a blackout.

117
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:06,584
I am not crying. I'm looking for a flashlight.

118
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:08,723
God, this is like the worst nightmare.

119
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:11,128
Where is my Powerpuff Girls night-light when I need it?

120
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,112
We should probably call Peyton.

121
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:17,253
I mean, I'm not sure if Ellie's around and if the lights are out everywhere,

122
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:18,915
I'm kind of worried about her being alone.

123
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:21,484
Yeah,  I'm sure you are.

124
00:07:21,593 --> 00:07:23,613
Oh. Finally.

125
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,683
Ow!

126
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,761
What the hell did you hit me for?

127
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:30,487
Because you're an ass.

128
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,990
Mr. Mayor, I have contacted the department of power,

129
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,420
but it's gonna take at least a couple of hours to fix.

130
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:45,416
And the entire city is dark?

131
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,663
Yes, sir.

132
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:48,510
Perfect.

133
00:07:49,996 --> 00:07:52,742
Wow, a blackout.

134
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:56,891
It looks like you've got some pull with the woman upstairs.

135
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:00,571
I guess you really don't want me to leave, huh?

136
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:02,177
I told you.

137
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:06,935
Well, assuming the lights don't pop back on in a minute or two,

138
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,360
are you in any way prepared to deal with this?

139
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,413
Oh, totally. Hold on.

140
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,400
My dad got me this for my 13th birthday --

141
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:18,411
about the time he stopped knowing what a girl would want.

142
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:20,833
I've just been waiting for an excuse to use it.

143
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,305
And when was the last time you changed the batteries?

144
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:29,283
When I was 13?

145
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:33,728
Okay, I'll stay.

146
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:35,681
Just this last night.

147
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,327
We've got dippin' dots -- no "g" --

148
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:47,218
snack pack puddin' -- no "g" --

149
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:50,331
and my personal favorite, Cap'n Crunch -- no "t."

150
00:08:51,177 --> 00:08:53,670
Basically foods missing consonants.

151
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,988
I used to love snarfing down Cap'n Crunch,

152
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:59,663
watching saturday-morning cartoons when I was a kid.

153
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:01,446
What was that, like a year ago?

154
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:05,582
How could I be so young and feel so old?

155
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:10,577
It's like I never thought that I would have this many big questions on my plate by now.

156
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:12,769
Maybe this blackout is a sign.

157
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:14,907
That we need to deal with everything --

158
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:17,454
the future and all the decisions we have to make.

159
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,168
Do we have to?

160
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,788
No, but until the lights come back on,

161
00:09:21,887 --> 00:09:24,048
it's just you, me, and the darkness, Hales.

162
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:27,356
That sounds kind of nice.

163
00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:49,323
Keith. Wow.

164
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:51,706
I've got to get the name of your decorator.

165
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:54,383
I'm so sorry, Rachel.

166
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,620
I mean, about kissing you. I just --

167
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:59,283
I thought maybe you'd invited me over here to...

168
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,343
well, I'm just sorry.

169
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,254
Stop apologizing, Mouth.

170
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:05,845
Sure. Sorry.

171
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:07,908
Just take a breath.

172
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:13,791
I  don't really have a lot of experience when it comes to girls and bedrooms.

173
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,865
Or girls at all, really.

174
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:17,178
What about Erica Marsh?

175
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:19,859
Exactly. Look how well that turned out.

176
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:23,331
Okay. You have got to be more confident, Mouth,

177
00:10:23,801 --> 00:10:25,356
more sure of yourself.

178
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,407
Like, um...

179
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,755
"yeah, I tried to kiss you.

180
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,233
What are you gonna do about it?"

181
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,425
Really?

182
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,041
And not so nice.

183
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,650
You tell a girl she's nothing,

184
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:42,398
she'll come running.

185
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:46,361
You've got to pick out a little flaw and then blow it out of proportion.

186
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:47,361
I don't know.

187
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:48,522
Come on, come on.

188
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:50,882
Give it a shot. Lay it on me.

189
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,902
Say something really mean.

190
00:10:54,755 --> 00:11:01,220
Well, your neck looks... kind of... long.

191
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:03,435
But pretty. Really pretty.

192
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,913
I don't want to be mean to you, Rachel, or any girl.

193
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,829
It's stupid.

194
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:09,880
Are you calling me stupid?

195
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:11,292
No, I just think that --

196
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,741
'Cause if you are, you are getting sexier by the minute.

197
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:28,946
Well?

198
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:31,932
Well, I'd start a fire, but all the wood's soaked.

199
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:37,841
I'd turn the flashlight on, but it's broke 'cause you lost your mind and clobbered me with it.

200
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,514
I mean, what got into you anyway?

201
00:11:40,627 --> 00:11:42,041
What got into me?

202
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:45,927
Yeah. I'm sorry your dinner got ruined.

203
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:52,523
Right, the dinner I was making for you with my stupid apron and my stupid pie.

204
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,781
Okay, I'll start a fire. I just have to find something else to burn.

205
00:11:56,886 --> 00:11:58,810
Great, why don't you start with this?

206
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:01,997
You want me to burn my letter?

207
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,751
You really are clueless, aren't you?

208
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:05,352
I put a lot of heart into that.

209
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:09,471
Okay, read it. Just skip to the last line.

210
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:10,636
Go ahead.

211
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:15,814
What's wrong with the last line? "You're my forever."

212
00:12:15,922 --> 00:12:17,362
That sounds pretty damn good to me.

213
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,739
Yeah, it sounds great.

214
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:21,477
It sounded even better when I read it the first time last spring

215
00:12:21,582 --> 00:12:24,135
in another letter you wrote -- to Peyton!

216
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,569
Brooke, stop! This is ridiculous!

217
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:28,781
Ridiculous?!

218
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:32,322
I found that letter in your sad box of Peyton whatever in your closet!

219
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:35,316
"Dear Peyton, blah, blah, blah. You're my forever. Love, Lucas."

220
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,433
I don't even remember writing that.

221
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:38,790
Well, you did!

222
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:41,010
Looks like forever just got a lot shorter!

223
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:43,690
Brooke, hey, I'm sorry! It was a mistake!

224
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:45,987
Which time -- when you wrote it to me or Peyton?!

225
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:48,240
No, you were the one snooping through my closet.

226
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,083
So not the point!

227
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:52,526
Look, I know you feel vulnerable about what you wrote.

228
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:54,456
That  is not why I'm upset right now!

229
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,849
And FYI, I am not your recycling bin!

230
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,707
No, you're psychotic!

231
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,902
Ah, this is a great album.

232
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:07,688
It's good to know that kids still listen to Led Zeppelin.

233
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,091
Well, this kid does.

234
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,895
"10 years gone."

235
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:14,247
It's one of the saddest songs ever.

236
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,425
Yeah, but in like an awesome way.

237
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:19,636
What's your saddest song ever?

238
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:22,599
"Celebration," Kool and the Gang.

239
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:24,177
"Celebration"?

240
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,654
It was playing in the hospital when my mom died.

241
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,085
I'm sorry, Peyton.

242
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:32,711
No, it's...

243
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:39,535
Anyway, happiest song would be "Happy Birthday."

244
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,030
I'm partial to any song that ends with cake.

245
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,337
What about you?

246
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,680
"Here comes a regular" -- The Replacements.

247
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:51,310
Huh. Not exactly an up-tempo number.

248
00:13:51,423 --> 00:13:54,019
Yeah, but there's a great story behind it.

249
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,073
Right before graduation, I went with some friends

250
00:13:56,153 --> 00:14:00,334
to this big outdoor music festival in Winston-Salem.

251
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,343
It was in the middle of a field called the Meadow.

252
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,539
Night comes.

253
00:14:06,264 --> 00:14:09,637
And this terrible thunderstorm rolls in -- 

254
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:13,137
thunder, lightning.

255
00:14:13,258 --> 00:14:14,766
None of the bands could play.

256
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:18,161
30,000 people, mud up to our knees,

257
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:19,778
waiting it out,

258
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:23,197
praying for the storm to break.

259
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:25,525
But  it never did.

260
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:27,284
The power's lost...

261
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:30,929
so nothing but the sound of rain.

262
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:38,084
Then out of the blackness, Paul Westerberg steps to center stage with an acoustic guitar

263
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:40,178
and plays "Here comes a regular."

264
00:14:40,284 --> 00:14:46,770
30,000 people fall silent to hear that one acoustic guitar

265
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:49,819
and the one voice that accompanied it.

266
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,219
It was transcendent,

267
00:14:56,587 --> 00:15:02,239
standing there in the darkness, listening to that song with my best friends.

268
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:08,456
I think that was the moment in my life when I felt most alive.

269
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:11,631
That's amazing.

270
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:14,939
I would kill to have seen Westerberg in his prime.

271
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:18,191
Well, he finished in typical fashion.

272
00:15:18,403 --> 00:15:22,579
The song ended -- he smiled, threw up,

273
00:15:22,695 --> 00:15:24,567
and then fell off the stage.

274
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:34,242
What? Yes, I had a second bowl. I was hungry.

275
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:36,454
It's not that. I was just remembering.

276
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:37,848
Remembering what?

277
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,218
Your hair.

278
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,838
You wore it that way the first day you tutored me.

279
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,671
You remember how I wore my hair the first day I tutored you?

280
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:46,975
Of course.

281
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,672
What else do you remember?

282
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:51,258
I remember the ugly-ass poncho that you wore.

283
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:55,866
Oh, my God, yes, you've made your feelings for that particular item of clothing very clear.

284
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:58,688
Come on. Tell me really.

285
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:03,896
Well... let's see, these jeans?

286
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:06,840
You wore them the day we fell asleep in the park together.

287
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:08,671
And these shoes?

288
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,295
You wore these the day we got stuck at the DMV for five hours

289
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:16,337
while we waited for your new license with my last name on it.

290
00:16:17,398 --> 00:16:18,572
What about my shirt?

291
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:23,902
You wore that shirt one morning when you sat in the living room

292
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:26,499
and you were playing that Beatles song on your guitar.

293
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:29,773
The sun just framed your face so perfectly.

294
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,516
"Blackbird."

295
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:35,735
That was the name of the Beatles song I played.

296
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:39,401
I remember more than you think.

297
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:45,155
I can't believe I didn't notice this.

298
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:49,011
This is the first dollar I ever earned in this café.

299
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:51,029
Now it's ruined.

300
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:53,586
Well, it's just a dollar.

301
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:57,085
Don't you remember who gave it to me?

302
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:58,610
Of course I do.

303
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:03,939
I bought the first cup of coffee the morning you opened.

304
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:07,445
I had Lucas on one hip, a tray on the other.

305
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:11,604
My parents thought I was crazy, as did the rest of the town.

306
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:13,839
Except for you.

307
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:18,456
I'll never forget what you said.

308
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,595
"Anyone who thinks this is more than you can handle

309
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:25,652
is less than the kind of person you need in your life."

310
00:17:26,016 --> 00:17:27,870
I can't believe you remembered that.

311
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:31,715
Oh, please, I stayed up all the night before, trying to figure out what I was gonna say.

312
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:37,313
How about a kiss instead of a coffee?

313
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:04,674
Keith! Keith! Keith! Keith!

314
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:05,913
Shh!

315
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:10,259
It's just a storm, Danny. It'll pass over soon.

316
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:11,793
I'm scared.

317
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:16,427
Here. Hold on to this.

318
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:21,038
This way I'll always be with you. It'll keep you safe. I promise.

319
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:23,512
Now go to sleep.

320
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:44,851
Brooke, I'm sorry I said that. You're not psychotic, a little disturbed, maybe.

321
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:45,949
You think this is funny?

322
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,083
No, what I think is I think you're trying to sabotage us.

323
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:51,091
Find any reason you can, so you can end it,

324
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:52,849
so that you don't have to worry about getting hurt again.

325
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:57,567
But the same words, Lucas -- the exact same words?

326
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:01,060
I never sent that letter to Peyton.

327
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,281
And I never sent my letters to you, either, but they still meant something.

328
00:19:05,697 --> 00:19:08,846
Just tell me, why me this time? Why not Peyton?

329
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,320
I can't say anything bad about Peyton.

330
00:19:11,437 --> 00:19:13,722
She's my friend. She's your best friend.

331
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,970
That's okay. You can say bad things about her.

332
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:17,396
Oh, Brooke.

333
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,377
The truth is I care about Peyton.

334
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:24,533
Then what is the difference?

335
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:26,239
The difference?

336
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:29,342
The difference is I love you, Brooke.

337
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:32,879
I want to be with you, not Peyton.

338
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:36,173
But why? I need to know why.

339
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,177
Because you kink your eyebrow when you're trying to be cute.

340
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:44,319
Because you quote Camus even though I've never actually seen you read.

341
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:48,543
Because  you miss your parents, but you'll never admit that.

342
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:54,933
And because I've given exactly two of these embarrassing speeches in my entire life

343
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:57,155
and they've both been with you.

344
00:19:58,837 --> 00:20:01,766
And that's got to mean something, right?

345
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,921
And because we're both gonna get pneumonia.

346
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:13,558
But if you need to hear why I love you,

347
00:20:13,976 --> 00:20:15,579
I can go on all night.

348
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,711
You did pretty good.

349
00:20:34,762 --> 00:20:37,803
Hey, Rachel, can I ask you a question?

350
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,045
I get all that stuff about being confident,

351
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,020
but I'm still trying to figure out why you invited me over here in the first place.

352
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:48,778
I thought we were gonna watch a movie.

353
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:52,237
Well, I know, but our friendship.

354
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:53,625
Why me?

355
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,779
Are you kidding me?

356
00:20:56,418 --> 00:21:00,091
You are more honest and comfortable about who you are

357
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:01,888
than most of the other guys in school.

358
00:21:01,988 --> 00:21:03,315
Is it that?

359
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:07,213
Or is it because you thought it would make Brooke jealous?

360
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:12,884
No offense, Mouth, but I don't need you to make Brooke jealous.

361
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,894
Great. I don't even get that.

362
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:20,451
There was something kind of cool about feeling like the pawn between two hot girls.

363
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:26,403
Look, let me help you, give you the benefit of my expertise,

364
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:30,666
and teach you how to become one of the guys the elite girls drool over.

365
00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:32,344
By being mean to them.

366
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,100
Sometimes.

367
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:36,914
But I'm not that guy, Rachel,

368
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:38,437
and I don't want to be.

369
00:21:38,552 --> 00:21:41,509
So maybe the elite girls just aren't for me.

370
00:21:41,628 --> 00:21:46,780
But one of these days, I'm gonna meet a girl who really loves me.

371
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:50,290
Maybe she won't be what you'll call hot, but I'll think she's beautiful,

372
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,187
and I'll tell her so.

373
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:56,033
I won't be mean to her because I won't have to play games with her.

374
00:21:56,762 --> 00:22:01,828
I'll just be the guy that she can always count on and that'll be enough.

375
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:05,775
And she'll be elite to me.

376
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,175
Are you okay?

377
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:14,105
Not really.

378
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:17,800
What are we doing? You've been here three weeks, Ellie,

379
00:22:17,902 --> 00:22:23,827
and all we've talked about is music and the CD and business.

380
00:22:24,224 --> 00:22:26,816
But it's not just a business arrangement, is it?

381
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,125
Of course not.

382
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:37,331
I need you to talk to me about your cancer.

383
00:22:45,995 --> 00:22:46,953
It's okay.

384
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:50,976
No. No, it's not okay.

385
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,922
How can you just act like nothing's wrong?

386
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:58,277
Aren't you afraid? Because I'm afraid for you.

387
00:23:02,604 --> 00:23:04,495
Don't be afraid, Peyton.

388
00:23:06,195 --> 00:23:08,399
Every song has a coda,

389
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:10,527
a final movement.

390
00:23:10,647 --> 00:23:13,559
Whether it fades out or crashes away,

391
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:15,798
every song ends.

392
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,607
Is that any reason not to enjoy the music?

393
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:21,860
It doesn't mean I can't want it to not end.

394
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,506
Look at you.

395
00:23:26,176 --> 00:23:30,203
You've had more life-changing events in the first 17 years of your life

396
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:32,140
than I'd wish on anyone.

397
00:23:32,862 --> 00:23:35,005
You got the surviving part down.

398
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:39,902
I want you to focus more on the living.

399
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,814
Sometimes surviving is about all the living I can handle.

400
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:48,406
I don't buy that for one second.

401
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:53,577
And if you keep this up, hiding in your art and your sadness,

402
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,685
you're really gonna miss out.

403
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:57,798
Because the truth is

404
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,115
there is nothing to be afraid of.

405
00:24:01,757 --> 00:24:04,195
It's just life.

406
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:07,605
Come on.

407
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:09,867
Come on.

408
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:11,497
Where are we going?

409
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:14,662
We are going into life.

410
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:22,744
I really like that you're telling me all these stories about how much you remember.

411
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:26,136
It's kind of scary, though. Now I have to be, like, supercute 24-7

412
00:24:26,226 --> 00:24:28,966
if it's gonna be embedded in your memory for all of eternity.

413
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,692
But I have to say I kind of feel like we're cheating.

414
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,450
We're not even really talking about all the big issues.

415
00:24:35,545 --> 00:24:38,812
I was this close to getting away with it, wasn't I?

416
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,677
I don't want to ruin our evening.

417
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:44,622
I just don't want to miss an opportunity to actually work things out.

418
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,861
How do you know a fun night together isn't exactly what we need to work things out?

419
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:52,416
Or maybe a few fun nights all in a row. No trouble in between.

420
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:55,817
- Yeah, um --
- I know. It's not your nature.

421
00:24:55,934 --> 00:25:00,843
It's not really, and I'm sorry. I can't help it. I have so many questions.

422
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,662
Okay. Why did you call Chris?

423
00:25:08,755 --> 00:25:10,834
I told you. I asked Chris to come back

424
00:25:10,922 --> 00:25:13,177
and help you with your music because you love it.

425
00:25:13,273 --> 00:25:14,893
It's a huge part of who you are.

426
00:25:14,983 --> 00:25:17,399
I know, but, Nathan -- Chris?

427
00:25:17,494 --> 00:25:19,399
There were a million people you could've called.

428
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:21,371
Why open that door again?

429
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:29,512
Look, I called Chris because I screwed up and I wanted to try and fix it.

430
00:25:30,015 --> 00:25:33,102
Going to High Flyers made me realize how wrong I was

431
00:25:33,175 --> 00:25:34,831
to make you choose between me and the tour.

432
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,554
I mean, what is this -- the 1950s?

433
00:25:37,658 --> 00:25:39,580
It didn't have to be either/or.

434
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:41,359
But it was, wasn't it?

435
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,250
Because I didn't ask you to come with me.

436
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:48,596
Nathan...

437
00:25:50,535 --> 00:25:54,086
when I look back on the tour, I'm not proud of it

438
00:25:54,175 --> 00:25:56,464
'cause I know that you weren't proud of me.

439
00:25:58,643 --> 00:26:01,833
Is that what you think -- that I wasn't proud of you?

440
00:26:03,972 --> 00:26:06,195
Let me show you something. It's in my car.

441
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:08,241
Nathan, it's crazy out there.

442
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:22,374
Nathan, what are you doing?

443
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,173
I was hurt, Haley, but I was still proud of you.

444
00:26:42,356 --> 00:26:43,620
Every day.

445
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:49,510
Wait, wait. It's all getting ruined.

446
00:26:49,596 --> 00:26:52,700
No, you don't need all that stuff. You've got me.

447
00:27:27,477 --> 00:27:29,255
This is crazy!

448
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:31,423
This is alive.

449
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:39,348
You really surprised me, Mouth.

450
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:42,195
That speech was pretty impressive.

451
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:43,887
I was just being honest.

452
00:27:44,342 --> 00:27:46,642
The last part would've worked better as an exit line,

453
00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:49,670
but I watched Hurricane Coverage on CNN to know

454
00:27:49,764 --> 00:27:52,864
you're supposed to stay put until you get the all-clear.

455
00:27:53,752 --> 00:27:56,446
Then I guess we're stuck with each other,

456
00:27:56,557 --> 00:27:58,762
and I'm pretty much all talked out.

457
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:00,511
You got anything else to say?

458
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:02,264
Not really.

459
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,057
Well, we could kiss.

460
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,321
Stop.

461
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:12,118
I'm serious.

462
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:13,968
It would pass the time.

463
00:28:14,249 --> 00:28:15,490
What do you say?

464
00:28:17,644 --> 00:28:18,900
We could do that.

465
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,664
But I'm not going to.

466
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:28,612
Good. You're learning.

467
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:29,728
Play hard to get.

468
00:28:29,822 --> 00:28:32,015
No, it's not that. It's just...

469
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,968
it's easier in the dark.

470
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:38,781
But pretty soon the lights are gonna come back on and

471
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,293
we'll go back to being who we really are, right?

472
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:49,233
I mean, kissing might be, I don't know, whatever to you,

473
00:28:49,476 --> 00:28:51,288
but to me, it'll mean something,

474
00:28:51,426 --> 00:28:54,100
and I'll wake up tomorrow wanting to do it again...

475
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,148
and again and pretty much all the time.

476
00:28:58,957 --> 00:29:01,524
Somehow, I don't think you'll feel the same.

477
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,384
On the day that changes,

478
00:29:07,242 --> 00:29:10,820
on the day you wake up and have to call me...

479
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,412
then I'll kiss you.

480
00:29:18,314 --> 00:29:19,754
I guess that's my cue.

481
00:29:20,747 --> 00:29:21,705
Mouth, wait --

482
00:29:21,804 --> 00:29:24,198
It's cool. I'll see you later.

483
00:29:36,162 --> 00:29:41,106
Uh, you know, that lemon meringue was tomorrow's featured dessert.

484
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,167
Well, not anymore.

485
00:29:52,842 --> 00:29:54,350
I love you, Keith.

486
00:30:12,824 --> 00:30:13,810
Gotcha.

487
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,647
So, if you catch a cold, you can tell your father it's all on me.

488
00:30:24,772 --> 00:30:27,134
It'd be worth it. Tonight was amazing.

489
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:28,680
Thank you.

490
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:36,512
You okay?

491
00:30:36,653 --> 00:30:38,435
Yeah. Yeah.

492
00:30:39,499 --> 00:30:40,965
This is nice.

493
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:45,049
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

494
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:51,217
You know, um, I was thinking about the stuff you said about living life

495
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:55,798
and jumping at opportunity, not being afraid.

496
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:58,432
Yeah?

497
00:30:59,794 --> 00:31:08,329
And there was this guy. There is this guy I loved,

498
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:13,869
and I let him go, and now I'm starting to think that was a big mistake.

499
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:16,708
But it's too late.

500
00:31:17,132 --> 00:31:21,599
No, it's never too late, Peyton.

501
00:31:22,184 --> 00:31:25,202
That's one thing I learned from meeting you.

502
00:31:30,297 --> 00:31:33,641
I'm so sorry I missed those 17 years,

503
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:39,220
but I wouldn't give back these three weeks for the world.

504
00:31:39,436 --> 00:31:41,074
Yeah, me, either.

505
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:46,808
The Peyton that I've come to know deserves to get whatever she wants.

506
00:31:47,098 --> 00:31:50,661
She deserves to be happy as an artist,

507
00:31:50,983 --> 00:31:52,661
as a friend...

508
00:31:54,527 --> 00:31:55,914
as a daughter.

509
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:01,258
As my daughter.

510
00:32:03,116 --> 00:32:04,583
I heard that.

511
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:15,559
Stop it.

512
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:17,473
What?

513
00:32:17,658 --> 00:32:20,434
Whatever you're worried about, just stop.

514
00:32:21,843 --> 00:32:25,361
How do you know I'm worried? You didn't even open your eyes.

515
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:28,829
You think I need to see you with my eyes to know what's going on with you?

516
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,853
What's on your mind?

517
00:32:34,414 --> 00:32:38,705
I was just... wondering if maybe I should go home.

518
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:41,350
Why would you do that?

519
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:44,953
Because I don't want to wake up and have you not be here again.

520
00:32:46,588 --> 00:32:48,128
I'll be here.

521
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:51,431
I'm not going anywhere.

522
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:53,399
Come here.

523
00:33:08,845 --> 00:33:11,674
Every great song ends sometime, right?

524
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:15,974
Call me when you get the CD.

525
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:17,837
I'll come see you.

526
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:20,041
We can listen to it together.

527
00:33:20,228 --> 00:33:21,339
Sure.

528
00:33:22,232 --> 00:33:25,584
You know, I came back here to make sure you had a good life.

529
00:33:27,194 --> 00:33:30,006
And you made sure I had a great one.

530
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:38,099
I don't want you to go.

531
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,382
Oh, sweetie, those words are gonna break my heart.

532
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,962
We will see each other again someday.

533
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:01,303
I promise.

534
00:34:23,997 --> 00:34:24,555
Nathan --

535
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:28,536
Haley, I told you the tour was a really big part of your life.

536
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,268
You deserve to have something to remember it by...

537
00:34:34,868 --> 00:34:36,998
besides all the bad memories.

538
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:41,849
Thank you.

539
00:34:45,236 --> 00:34:47,252
What are we gonna do about college?

540
00:34:48,272 --> 00:34:49,770
We'll apply to both,

541
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,862
and we'll just wait and see.

542
00:34:59,907 --> 00:35:01,131
Hey, you.

543
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:02,951
I haven't seen you in a couple days.

544
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:05,874
I know. It's been crazy. How have you been?

545
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,305
I just want to make sure everything's cool,

546
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:11,184
you know, after what happened at my house.

547
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:13,644
Listen, girls are always trying to kiss me --

548
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:15,674
sometimes cheerleaders, mostly models.

549
00:35:15,762 --> 00:35:18,453
It happens. It's no big deal. I don't blame you.

550
00:35:18,678 --> 00:35:22,290
In fact, I got an hour to kill later on, so if you want...

551
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:23,956
Stop it.

552
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:27,161
You know, I've been thinking about what you said

553
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:31,062
about being mean to girls, and I want you to know

554
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,075
those sweatpants really make your butt look big.

555
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:34,826
Mouth! 

556
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,826
I'm sorry. I thought I'd give it a shot, but who am I kidding?

557
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:41,309
Your butt looks great. I mean, not that I noticed.

558
00:35:41,418 --> 00:35:42,507
Sorry.

559
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:45,586
Hey, rule number one -- never apologize.

560
00:35:45,692 --> 00:35:47,014
I thought we talked about that.

561
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,767
You're right. Sorry.

562
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:11,055
Ellie?

563
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:16,623
Hey, I got the CDs.

564
00:38:17,404 --> 00:38:18,705
They look awesome.

565
00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:24,060
Ellie?

566
00:39:53,122 --> 00:39:55,207
This is kind of personal. Do you mind?

567
00:39:55,324 --> 00:39:58,105
Oh, um, of course. My apologies.

568
00:39:58,227 --> 00:40:00,189
Just let me know when you're finished, Mr. Mayor.

569
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:27,111
Say hi to my mom... mom.

570
00:41:37,317 --> 00:41:40,592
