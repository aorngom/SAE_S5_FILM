1
00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:02,852
<i>My name is Lucas Scott.</i>

2
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:07,224
<i>Four years ago, I graduated from
high school with my friends.</i>

3
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:10,729
<i>Brooke Davis moved to New York
City and found success...</i>

4
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:13,755
<i>Peyton Sawyer to Los Angeles.</i>

5
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:17,389
<i>I wrote a novel and fell
for my editor, Lindsey.</i>

6
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:20,947
<i>- Recently, we've come home.</i>
- I missed you, P. Sawyer.

7
00:00:21,697 --> 00:00:25,009
<i>Now Brooke's opening a local
boutique for her fashion line.</i>

8
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:29,152
<i>Peyton Sawyer is starting
her own record label.</i>

9
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:31,768
<i>My best friend Haley
started teaching...</i>

10
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:34,140
That is some fine ass.

11
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:38,266
- Who said that?
<i>- ...But it hasn't been easy.</i>

12
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:39,585
Hey, man.

13
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:43,427
<i>Nor has it been easy for her husband,
Nathan, who in a moment of anger,</i>

14
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:46,371
<i>watched his dreams of playing
professional basketball vanish.</i>

15
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:49,841
You have a beautiful
son who is here!

16
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,022
I am here!

17
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:54,431
One more night
like this, Nathan,

18
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:58,122
and I promise you,
you will have nothing!

19
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:02,950
<i>A lot has changed
since high school...</i>

20
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:07,770
I still love you.

21
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:10,503
I love you, too, Lucas Scott.

22
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:14,091
<i>...But in many ways,
our journey is just beginning.</i>

23
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:43,412
Wow. Did you write all night?

24
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:49,060
Yeah. I guess I did.

25
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:54,033
The question is, how much of it
survived the dreaded "delete" button?

26
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,930
Almost all of it.

27
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:58,193
You must be ready to pass out.

28
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:04,380
Actually, I'm not tired.
I'm really energized.

29
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:07,800
The words came to me.
I haven't felt this inspired since...

30
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:13,232
...since my last book.

31
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:15,500
I'm glad.

32
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:18,713
And it's a good thing
you're energized.

33
00:02:22,546 --> 00:02:25,702
Because you have practice
in like eight minutes.

34
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,643
- Off you go, coach.
- That was just mean.

35
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:32,302
You're a mean person.

36
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:34,741
You know that, yeah.

37
00:02:57,668 --> 00:03:00,950
Haley, come look at this.
Haley!

38
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:05,162
Sorry, Haley's not here.
She's at school.

39
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:07,842
- I'm Carrie, the new--
- The new nanny.

40
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:09,531
I know. She told me.

41
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:13,622
Okay, well, I'm gonna make breakfast.
Do you want me to bring you some?

42
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:15,620
No. I'm good. Thanks.

43
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:26,151
Hi. Guess where I am?

44
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:28,240
<i>You're feeling warm and
fuzzy in your new office,</i>

45
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:31,911
<i>while I'm stuck in incompetent
construction worker hell?</i>

46
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,751
I mean,
it's like they're in slow motion.

47
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:36,290
Complain all you want,
but I think you're having fun.

48
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:37,553
Admit it.

49
00:03:38,027 --> 00:03:40,932
I'll admit that I'm enjoying
doing something on my own...

50
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:48,042
...on my own for once. I can't wait to
see Victoria's face when she sees--

51
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,530
Speak of the devil.
She's on the other line. Of course.

52
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,583
Well, good thing you're
already in hell.

53
00:03:57,688 --> 00:03:59,981
- Call me later.
- Okay.

54
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:05,373
I was just about to call you.

55
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:07,040
No, you weren't.

56
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:09,741
Why haven't I received
your flight itinerary?

57
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:12,403
Because I've decided to stay
in Tree Hill a few extra days.

58
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:14,421
We're opening a new store.

59
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:18,043
I didn't approve a
Tree Hill location.

60
00:04:18,147 --> 00:04:20,123
<i>That doesn't even make sense.</i>

61
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,830
Brooke Davis,
you are jeopardizing this company.

62
00:04:22,938 --> 00:04:27,270
You're the face of the brand, and your
absence can cause irreparable harm.

63
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:29,420
Now, what the hell
has gotten into you?!

64
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:32,521
- Home.
- Are you doing drugs?

65
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:36,662
Because if you are, it's okay.
I can spin this in a good way.

66
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,000
I have to go.

67
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:40,402
Brooke. Brooke!

68
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:43,790
Excuse me.
We're gonna keep this.

69
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:46,210
This belongs here.

70
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,121
Did you just walk
down the stairs?

71
00:04:56,225 --> 00:04:58,353
If by "walking,"
you mean "falling."

72
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:02,330
You didn't have to come down.
I told you I'd bring you some breakfast.

73
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,743
What is that?

74
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,650
Bacon and eggs.

75
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,893
Yes, it's rearranged into a smiley face.
I do that sometimes.

76
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:12,393
- I'm an optimist.
- Whatever.

77
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:14,892
Listen, I need you to
give me a ride somewhere.

78
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:17,160
- Do nannies do that?
- Sure.

79
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,543
I don't have to pick up
Jamie for a few hours.

80
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:24,221
Just... let me get your crutches.
And no more falling.

81
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:36,932
Hey, pick it up, blue!
Let's go!

82
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,302
Hey, coach, you got a sec?

83
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,813
That depends--
are you gonna be one of those teachers

84
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:42,801
constantly complaining
about my players' grades?

85
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:45,381
If your players are failing,
you bet your ass I will.

86
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:46,631
Fair enough.

87
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:49,122
Grades are the least of
this team's worries.

88
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:52,912
Oh, my God! Can't be serious.

89
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:54,750
How's Quentin?
Is he still disrupting your class?

90
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:57,510
Actually, no.
Quentin has not been in class all week,

91
00:05:57,615 --> 00:05:59,691
and I think it's because he
got kicked off the team.

92
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:01,881
You can't save 'em all, Hales.

93
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:04,973
God!

94
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:07,852
I think your team
looks really good.

95
00:06:07,955 --> 00:06:10,251
The J.V. is the team in white.

96
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:12,271
In the blue--
yeah, those are mine.

97
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:14,532
- We're a work in progress.
- Awkward.

98
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:17,250
I'm gonna go to class now.
I'll see you later.

99
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:19,501
Haley, how's my
little brother doing?

100
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:22,810
He's a work in progress.

101
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:27,481
Finish!

102
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:31,931
Excuse me.
I found my demo in the trash.

103
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:34,683
Perhaps you should
have left it there.

104
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:37,371
I don't think so.

105
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:41,672
Excuse me?
What did you just say?

106
00:06:41,778 --> 00:06:44,360
Look, maybe I'm not
right for the job, okay?

107
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:47,243
But my audition demo
doesn't belong in the trash.

108
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:49,503
I worked really hard on it.

109
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:54,330
You're right.
That was a mistake...

110
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:56,812
and I'm sorry.

111
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,130
I meant to put it in
the recycling bin.

112
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:07,352
Yo, Mouth!
It's early lunch thursday!

113
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:12,240
Friends at work--
half a strike at least.

114
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:14,861
Thanks. Nice timing,
by the way.

115
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:28,362
Hello, Nathan.

116
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:40,823
It's good to see you, Nathan.

117
00:07:40,957 --> 00:07:42,451
Been a long time.

118
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:47,601
- 4 years.
- 4 years, 15 weeks, 2 days.

119
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:52,052
Counting the days is kind of
a popular hobby around here--

120
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:53,802
that and ceramics.

121
00:07:57,358 --> 00:07:59,322
Tell me about the accident.

122
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:03,710
It was a moment of anger.

123
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:07,473
I had a chance to walk away,
and I didn't do it.

124
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:10,501
And now my punishment is...

125
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:13,773
I get to regret it every
day for the rest of my life.

126
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:15,321
Join the club.

127
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:19,541
My biggest regret's not being able
to watch my grandson grow up,

128
00:08:20,117 --> 00:08:22,012
losing my family--

129
00:08:22,738 --> 00:08:24,982
those are things
you still have.

130
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:28,891
How is my grandson?

131
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:32,180
He must be getting big by now.
You got a picture of him?

132
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:34,312
I'm not here to
talk about Jamie.

133
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:37,153
I understand.

134
00:08:38,446 --> 00:08:41,110
I just always wondered
if he knows who I am.

135
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:44,662
He found a picture of you once.

136
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:48,883
We told him that you
were his grandfather.

137
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:52,141
He asked where you were.

138
00:08:52,895 --> 00:08:54,291
What'd you tell him?

139
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:57,383
We told him you were dead.

140
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,400
Can I help you with something?

141
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,593
Hi. Sorry.

142
00:09:08,697 --> 00:09:12,580
No, I just thought I would lounge
here while I'm on my break.

143
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:15,340
You know, they do have a
teacher's lounge for that, right?

144
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:17,006
Oh, Luke,
it's so creepy in there.

145
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:19,525
They're all acting like
they're still my teachers.

146
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,297
I feel like I'm being graded.

147
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,941
- You too, huh?
- Yeah.

148
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:27,272
So, I hear you rented out your
office space at Tric to Peyton.

149
00:09:27,377 --> 00:09:28,812
Lindsey okay with that?

150
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,372
Yeah, why not?

151
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,211
I don't know. Maybe because Peyton's
not just another ex-girlfriend

152
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:35,893
and everybody knows that.

153
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:39,090
Haley, I'm just helping out an
old friend, okay? That's all.

154
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:41,921
Besides, you know,
Lindsey's not really the jealous type.

155
00:09:42,988 --> 00:09:44,230
Good answer,

156
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:47,060
because I'm having lunch
with her in a few minutes.

157
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:52,761
So, this was just a sneak attack?
You're just gathering information?

158
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:54,071
Yeah, pretty much.

159
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,002
How did I not see this coming?

160
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,520
Because you're a guy,
Luke, and guys are...

161
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:01,361
...so predictable.

162
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,241
Girls are so predictable.

163
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:06,293
She's not a girl--
she's a woman.

164
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:07,772
She is a cougar.

165
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:10,713
Whatever she is, she hates me,
and it's getting worse every day.

166
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,652
That's called "sexual
tension," dog.

167
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:14,110
You need to stay
off the internet.

168
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:17,162
No, I'm serious. Look, last year,
I had this professor, right?

169
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:21,362
She kept on riding me all semester,
dog, and not in a good way.

170
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:24,303
But one day,
she started bitching at me after class.

171
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:26,623
I planted one on her.

172
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,262
You did not.
There's no way you did that.

173
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:32,153
That's not all I did.
I'm telling you, hook it up.

174
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:34,390
You have finally lost
touch with reality.

175
00:10:34,495 --> 00:10:36,892
Oh, and by the way,
next time you decide to stop by my work,

176
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:39,531
try not to yell out
"early lunch thursday!"

177
00:10:39,636 --> 00:10:40,761
Okay.

178
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:45,240
I'm telling you, I think you're gonna
miss out on some hot cougar love.

179
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:52,282
Remember the first time you
invited me to lunch here?

180
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:53,340
Oh, thank you.

181
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:55,400
Said you wanted to
get to know me better,

182
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:57,863
but I knew right away,
you were sizing me up.

183
00:10:57,966 --> 00:11:00,230
Oh, I was not.

184
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:04,610
Haley, you asked me to bring
photocopy of my driver's license.

185
00:11:04,716 --> 00:11:08,532
I was just checking to make sure you
were good enough for my best friend.

186
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:11,292
Lucas had been through a lot lately,
you know?

187
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,921
- Lucas tell you he wrote all night?
- No, I thought he's been blocked.

188
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:19,273
- Guess he got inspired.
- Oh, that's good.

189
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:21,263
Isn't it?

190
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:25,690
Yeah. Yeah, as his editor,
I'm thrilled, obviously,

191
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:30,922
but as his girlfriend,
I can't help but notice the timing.

192
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:33,223
Oh, you're talking about
Peyton coming back?

193
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,913
I sound like a
jealous girlfriend.

194
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:37,643
No, you don't.

195
00:11:38,315 --> 00:11:39,812
Thank you.

196
00:11:40,126 --> 00:11:42,661
Look, I know Lucas
better than anyone does.

197
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:45,311
I'm telling you,
he's very much in love with you.

198
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:48,803
Thanks, Haley.

199
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:55,320
Okay, now I need you to tell
me that I'm not totally insane

200
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:57,241
for hiring a hot nanny.

201
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,690
Wow. I'm pretty sure you have more
toys than any other kid on the planet.

202
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:05,873
You can play with them.
I don't mind.

203
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,332
Thanks.

204
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:15,372
Daddy doesn't like it
when I play basketball.

205
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:18,350
- Why not?
- Can you keep a secret?

206
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:21,411
I'm the best at
keeping secrets.

207
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:27,751
- Okay, but no telling.
- Okay.

208
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:57,912
Hey, yeah.

209
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:00,713
It's good to see everybody
working on their dunks,

210
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:03,421
considering most of you
can't even make a free throw.

211
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:07,833
You guys lost 8 games last
year by 3 points or less-- 8.

212
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:11,581
Now, does anyone know how many
games you won by 3 points or less?

213
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:16,211
- I do. Zero.
- Oh, that's right-- none.

214
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,380
Now, maybe, if you guys
could've hit a few free throws,

215
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:23,273
maybe you could've
made the Playoffs.

216
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:27,422
So, this is how we're gonna
start-- fundamentals.

217
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:30,631
See this spot?

218
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:35,133
We're gonna start practice every
day from this line right here.

219
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:38,693
And any player who can't knock down
three straight free throws in a row

220
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:41,910
is gonna run... all day.

221
00:13:45,337 --> 00:13:47,423
Who wants to prove me wrong?

222
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,260
Go ahead and start
running, superstar.

223
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,401
Hey, and don't be
high-fiving nobody, either.

224
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:03,903
Who's next?

225
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:09,470
You're late.

226
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:11,621
It's 1:00.

227
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:16,460
No, it was 1:00 30 seconds ago,
which makes you late--

228
00:14:16,568 --> 00:14:18,191
another strike.

229
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,342
Why do you hate me so much?

230
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:24,993
Why?

231
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:28,832
You know, we gave you a
fantastic opportunity here,

232
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:33,610
but it's so obvious to me that
you think you are above the work.

233
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:37,413
You don't want to pay your dues.
You come in late.

234
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:41,793
You pass around your
worthless audition demo.

235
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:44,302
Somehow, I'm a bitch
because I've decided

236
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,742
that you haven't earned it yet.

237
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:51,721
You know what? Why don't you just
face the reality of the situation?

238
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:57,392
You are wasting your time here.
You are irrelevant,

239
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,412
you are annoying--

240
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,682
And now you're fired.

241
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:23,330
I know it wasn't easy for you,
coming here. It means a lot to me.

242
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:25,220
I didn't come here for you.

243
00:15:26,646 --> 00:15:28,563
You know,
as long as I can remember,

244
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:32,062
you taught me that basketball was the
most important thing in the world.

245
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,832
So when I lost it,
I thought my life was over.

246
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:37,280
Only trying to give you the
tools you need to succeed.

247
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:41,161
Yeah, and those tools ended up
preventing me from succeeding.

248
00:15:41,268 --> 00:15:42,851
"Don't ever back down."

249
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:45,283
"Second place is the first
loser." Do you remember that?

250
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:48,703
Don't expect me to apologize for teaching
you to play a game that you love,

251
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:49,940
that you chose.

252
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:52,521
A game that nearly
destroyed my family.

253
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:57,001
It's not worth it,
and my family's all I have now.

254
00:15:57,105 --> 00:15:59,401
That's why I'll never
let my son play.

255
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:01,991
Basketball's taken enough.

256
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:07,622
You're not on those crutches 'cause I
handed you a basketball when you were 3.

257
00:16:09,557 --> 00:16:11,600
And trust me--
you not letting your son play

258
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,762
is just as bad as
you making him play.

259
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:16,883
And that's why you're here--
to blame me for what happened to you.

260
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:20,250
No. I've been sitting at home
for four months blaming you,

261
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,123
and now I'm done.

262
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:24,991
It's time to move on.
I'm letting go of the anger,

263
00:16:25,098 --> 00:16:27,120
and I'm letting go of you.

264
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:31,352
I just had to look you in
the eye when I told you that.

265
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,102
I won't be back.

266
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:37,422
Don't you see, Nathan?

267
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:41,462
The strength you need to let go of it,
to leave your old man behind--

268
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:43,211
that's what I taught you.

269
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:45,213
Lesson learned.

270
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:55,400
I love you, son.

271
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:02,251
Wow.

272
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:06,773
This is officially the coolest
office I've ever been in.

273
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:09,523
Yeah. Now I just need
to sign a couple bands

274
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:12,110
and prove to myself it
wasn't all a big mistake.

275
00:17:12,218 --> 00:17:15,812
From what I've heard about you,
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

276
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:17,922
I hope you're right.

277
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:19,842
Oh, this is for you.

278
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:22,000
It's supposed to
bring good luck.

279
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,281
It's a lucky bamboo.
They don't need much sunlight.

280
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:29,683
Just make sure you
water it every day.

281
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:32,802
I will. Thank you.

282
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:35,883
Well, I hope it all works out.

283
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:40,272
I know we just met, but I just
wanted you to know that I'm here.

284
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:43,441
Good to know.

285
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,721
Bye, Peyton.

286
00:17:58,116 --> 00:18:01,852
Are you telling me not one of
them made their free throws?

287
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,581
Let's just put it this way --

288
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:06,611
we could have built a new
gym with all them bricks.

289
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:10,560
You know they're counting on us
to turn this thing around, right?

290
00:18:10,626 --> 00:18:12,141
This season.

291
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:15,483
- They'll get better.
- Yeah?

292
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:19,301
If they don't,
maybe we can start a track team.

293
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:24,021
Come on! Keep going!
Run, run, run! Pick it up!

294
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,881
Hey, how'd you get home?

295
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:37,922
Took a cab.

296
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:41,711
You took an hour-long cab ride?
That must have cost a fortune.

297
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:43,353
I would have picked you up.

298
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,873
No, don't worry about it.
I get the handicap discount.

299
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:50,740
You'd think, in this town, they'd
have a state championship discount.

300
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:53,642
I went to Pontiac.
You beat us in the championship game.

301
00:18:53,747 --> 00:18:57,142
- I cried for a week.
- Sorry.

302
00:18:57,366 --> 00:19:00,812
So, how does it feel
to be a hometown hero?

303
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:02,723
I'm not that guy anymore,
all right?

304
00:19:02,827 --> 00:19:04,970
Trust me-- I'm nobody's hero.

305
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:07,360
You sure about that?

306
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:24,682
Looks like you're
somebody's hero.

307
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:00,071
I promised my mom
I'd send her a photo

308
00:20:00,175 --> 00:20:02,022
once you got finished
destroying her café.

309
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:05,052
Okay, that's not fair.
I hated doing it.

310
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,732
But I kept the sign.

311
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:12,781
I'll make sure
I mention it in my e-mail.

312
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:17,251
So, what made you want to open
up a shop here in Tree Hill?

313
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:19,672
Same reason you're
coaching the Ravens.

314
00:20:19,778 --> 00:20:22,982
It's home.
And it's good to be home.

315
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:27,022
- What do you think?
- I got to be honest --

316
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:30,302
I think it's the perfect way to
continue the legacy of Karen's Café.

317
00:20:32,338 --> 00:20:34,482
I'm just amazed at how quickly
you got this place together.

318
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:36,063
You're very impressive,
Brooke Davis.

319
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,211
Yeah, that's what they tell me.

320
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:41,342
So, is it everything
you imagined?

321
00:20:42,277 --> 00:20:44,260
Having your own fashion line?

322
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:47,470
Today it is.

323
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:49,720
Ask me again tomorrow.

324
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:58,012
Hey, so this is it, huh?
You're doing it.

325
00:20:58,118 --> 00:21:00,200
Yeah, hopefully,
it's just the beginning.

326
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:03,040
Wow, I can say I was
here when it all started.

327
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:05,843
Maybe I should steal something
to commemorate the occasion.

328
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:08,871
Well, if there's
no stopping you...

329
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:13,413
- Bamboo.
- Lucky bamboo.

330
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:15,161
It was from Lindsey.

331
00:21:15,265 --> 00:21:18,780
- Lucas' Lindsey?
- Is that her nickname or something?

332
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:20,851
This is actually
really nice of her.

333
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:24,362
- Suspiciously nice.
- Oh, stop it. Keep this.

334
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:27,930
It really did just feel like she was
coming over here to mark her territory.

335
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:32,411
And then she said,
"I just wanted you to know I'm here."

336
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:35,473
So she was letting you know that,
if you need anything,

337
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:37,261
she's here to help.

338
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:40,311
She was letting me know
she's not going anywhere.

339
00:21:42,697 --> 00:21:45,492
I got to be honest with you.
That just really doesn't sound like her,

340
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:49,450
but, I mean,
even if she is doing that

341
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:51,333
and marking her territory,
what difference does it make?

342
00:21:51,365 --> 00:21:54,931
It's not like you came back
to town for Lucas, right?

343
00:21:55,785 --> 00:22:00,063
No. I did not come back here for
Lucas-- I came back here for me.

344
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:02,461
Good. That's what I thought.

345
00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:07,340
So, who's this band?

346
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:11,402
Great sound check.

347
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:13,701
Yeah, really great.

348
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:15,693
They're local...

349
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:17,982
and they're unsigned.

350
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,470
You can tell that just
by looking at them?

351
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:23,123
Well, four years in L.A.
at least gave me that.

352
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:05,293
Well, what do you think?

353
00:23:05,396 --> 00:23:08,590
I love the house,
especially the furniture.

354
00:23:08,698 --> 00:23:10,480
I love the coffee table.

355
00:23:10,585 --> 00:23:13,600
We found that in Greece
two summers ago.

356
00:23:14,078 --> 00:23:15,573
I want it.

357
00:23:15,948 --> 00:23:18,982
You... want the coffee table?

358
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:20,580
I want everything --

359
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:23,931
the house, the furture,
and if you can be gone in an hour,

360
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,300
I'll throw in an extra $30,000.

361
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:35,963
Enjoy your new house!

362
00:23:41,306 --> 00:23:44,820
You didn't want Beasley,
did you?

363
00:23:44,928 --> 00:23:48,100
No. You can keep Beasley.

364
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,671
There's a roast in the oven.

365
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:53,633
I love roast.

366
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,230
Bye.

367
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:09,003
You must be lost.

368
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:14,140
No, actually, I've spent more time
on this court than you ever will.

369
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:17,681
I want you to come
back to school.

370
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:22,333
Ain't nothing left
for me up there.

371
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:24,063
"Isn't anything left."

372
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:27,612
And there's more to life
than basketball, Quentin.

373
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,230
I mean, you --
you got to graduate.

374
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:33,212
What's it matter to you?

375
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:38,360
Listen to me. Half the kids that
drop out of high school have no job,

376
00:24:38,468 --> 00:24:41,963
and the ones that do earn a job earn 25%
less than the kids that stayed in school

377
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:44,841
and 63% less than the ones
that graduated college.

378
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:48,351
So, for me, it doesn't matter,

379
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:51,730
but for you, Quentin,
it matters a lot.

380
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,770
I'm not kidding.

381
00:24:56,978 --> 00:24:59,530
Or maybe you're just hot for me,
Mrs. James-Scott.

382
00:25:02,786 --> 00:25:04,911
All right, I tried.

383
00:25:16,596 --> 00:25:19,103
Thank you for meeting with me.

384
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:20,620
What is this about?

385
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:24,490
Well, I think you guys
are really great.

386
00:25:24,596 --> 00:25:28,032
Look, I'm kind of tired,
so if this is just some fan-club crap...

387
00:25:28,138 --> 00:25:31,633
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
Please, sit down.

388
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:37,663
I own my own record label, and I
would really love to sign you guys.

389
00:25:37,765 --> 00:25:39,541
Why should we sign with you?

390
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:45,050
Well, I was in L.A. for the last
four years working at a major label,

391
00:25:45,158 --> 00:25:48,510
but I decided to leave because I
thought I could do better on my own.

392
00:25:48,618 --> 00:25:52,160
And when I hear bands like yours,
I know I can.

393
00:25:52,266 --> 00:25:56,931
The majors are a mess right now,
and so, if you sign with me,

394
00:25:57,036 --> 00:25:59,092
I'm gonna do everything
I can to make sure

395
00:25:59,197 --> 00:26:01,273
you guys get to be
where you want to be.

396
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:03,071
So, what other
bands do you have?

397
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:07,743
As of right now?
I mean, there's nobody yet.

398
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:10,821
I wanted you guys
to be my first.

399
00:26:13,436 --> 00:26:16,562
Look, my ex-girlfriend told
me the same thing prom night.

400
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:20,252
She was a lying bitch.
We're gonna pass, but thanks.

401
00:26:30,428 --> 00:26:32,220
Lucky bamboo.

402
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:43,301
Peyton. Hi.
You just missed Lucas.

403
00:26:43,406 --> 00:26:45,092
Actually, I came by to see you.

404
00:26:45,196 --> 00:26:46,733
Great. What's up?

405
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:49,183
Why did you bring me
that lucky bamboo?

406
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:51,373
- Well, I just wa--
- No, I'll tell you why.

407
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:54,363
You were marking your territory,
and that's okay. I get it.

408
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:58,492
But for the record,
I am not after Lucas, okay?

409
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:01,220
- I didn't think you were.
- Then, what do you want?

410
00:27:01,326 --> 00:27:04,010
'Cause, seriously,
people are just not that nice.

411
00:27:04,696 --> 00:27:08,500
Peyton, my whole life,
I wanted to be an editor,

412
00:27:08,606 --> 00:27:13,501
so when I made it, a friend of mine
gave me a lucky bamboo for my office.

413
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:15,960
Now, I'm not naive enough to
think that I found my way

414
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:18,102
because of some
plant on my desk,

415
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:22,092
but that plant was a symbol
that I had finally made it.

416
00:27:22,196 --> 00:27:24,332
That's all I was
trying to give you --

417
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:28,710
a reminder of the first day
you started living your dream.

418
00:27:30,206 --> 00:27:33,031
It's good to know
you're not after Lucas.

419
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:38,480
Good luck.

420
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:53,440
Man, you ain't
gonna believe this.

421
00:27:55,295 --> 00:27:57,420
I guess they got
tired of running.

422
00:27:57,725 --> 00:28:00,270
Or they just got
tired of losing.

423
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:04,773
Nice work, coach.

424
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,740
You too, coach.

425
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:19,732
How's the physical
therapy going?

426
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:21,420
It hurts.

427
00:28:21,528 --> 00:28:24,710
Good. No pain, no gain.

428
00:28:24,887 --> 00:28:26,711
You sound like my dad.

429
00:28:26,815 --> 00:28:29,231
Sorry. I used to be
a personal trainer.

430
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:32,273
I am full of motivational
catch phrases.

431
00:28:35,106 --> 00:28:38,313
That's who you were visiting
yesterday at the prison --

432
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,311
it was your dad, right?

433
00:28:41,306 --> 00:28:43,382
I'd rather not talk about it.

434
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:48,191
Does Haley know you
went to see him?

435
00:28:48,805 --> 00:28:53,123
No, she doesn't.
And I'd like to keep it that way.

436
00:28:53,548 --> 00:28:55,202
I'm not here to meddle.

437
00:28:55,308 --> 00:28:58,070
Unless I'm invited in,
I mind my own business.

438
00:28:58,178 --> 00:29:02,040
But if she asks me,
I won't lie.

439
00:29:03,196 --> 00:29:04,800
That's fair.

440
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:12,993
And listen,
it's good that you're here.

441
00:29:13,207 --> 00:29:15,921
I've pretty much been a jackass
for the past few months,

442
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:17,970
and Haley deserves better.

443
00:29:18,608 --> 00:29:20,320
I know it's been
really hard on her.

444
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,860
You know, if you want to do
something nice for Haley,

445
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:25,652
you might want to try
investing in a razor.

446
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:40,631
So, maybe I don't
have any other bands.

447
00:29:41,456 --> 00:29:45,243
There's something my label has
that the others don't-- me.

448
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:47,492
And I have a lot of experience,

449
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:49,153
more than you'd think.

450
00:29:49,257 --> 00:29:52,383
And the other thing that I have
that none of the other labels have

451
00:29:52,485 --> 00:29:54,412
is an interest in you guys.

452
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:57,223
I can have you in a
recording studio tomorrow.

453
00:29:57,327 --> 00:30:00,033
So if it is really
about the music,

454
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,401
you might want to reconsider.

455
00:30:02,897 --> 00:30:04,450
Have a good show.

456
00:30:24,847 --> 00:30:26,883
Before I go,
I need to say something.

457
00:30:26,986 --> 00:30:28,253
Of course you do.

458
00:30:28,355 --> 00:30:31,393
You're like a bug that
can't be squashed.

459
00:30:32,107 --> 00:30:34,193
You never gave me a chance.

460
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:37,712
You hated me from the start
because of how I look.

461
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:40,312
It's always about
how people look.

462
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:43,312
I mean, take you.

463
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:47,611
You dress all uptight, hiding your
hot body behind your cold personality.

464
00:30:47,718 --> 00:30:49,941
But at the end of the day,
you know you got it.

465
00:30:50,047 --> 00:30:52,761
You know, go hire your hot anchor
and hang out with your hot friends

466
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:54,951
and be hot, but you'll never
know what you're missing,

467
00:30:55,057 --> 00:30:56,621
'cause I'm good at what I do,

468
00:30:56,728 --> 00:30:58,940
and I'm gonna prove you wrong.

469
00:31:19,535 --> 00:31:21,922
- That was kind of hot.
- Yeah.

470
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:56,393
- Tough day?
- Yeah.

471
00:31:56,495 --> 00:31:58,793
I can't remember the
last one that wasn't.

472
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:04,090
I just think I'm realizing
that I can't help everybody,

473
00:32:04,195 --> 00:32:06,722
and I still somehow
feel responsible.

474
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:09,350
I don't know why I keep trying.

475
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:14,051
Maybe I'm avoiding this --
you know, coming home.

476
00:32:14,156 --> 00:32:16,623
That's such a terrible thing to say,
I know.

477
00:32:17,905 --> 00:32:19,662
It hasn't been easy.

478
00:32:20,828 --> 00:32:22,951
Well, you should go inside.

479
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:24,950
There's someone
waiting to see you.

480
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:27,700
Jamie --
he's such a good boy, isn't he?

481
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:30,770
- Bye.
- Bye. Thank you.

482
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:37,471
Jamie.

483
00:32:39,747 --> 00:32:41,601
Where'd you go, Jimjams?

484
00:32:55,227 --> 00:32:56,941
What is this?

485
00:32:58,026 --> 00:32:59,661
It's the beginning.

486
00:32:59,926 --> 00:33:01,530
Of what?

487
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:04,430
Of the way it's
gonna be from now on.

488
00:33:07,338 --> 00:33:10,783
I know that it's gonna take
a lot more than dinner...

489
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:17,110
...but I figured
it's a start, right?

490
00:33:25,648 --> 00:33:27,610
I've missed you.

491
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:42,570
So, how was your day?

492
00:33:42,735 --> 00:33:45,640
Oh, enough about me.
How was your day?

493
00:33:47,116 --> 00:33:49,642
Yeah, how was your day, mama?

494
00:33:51,705 --> 00:33:55,251
Oh, my day just
got a lot better.

495
00:34:02,155 --> 00:34:04,042
Well, I'm starving. Let's eat.

496
00:34:04,145 --> 00:34:06,143
Lets' eat. Give me that plate.

497
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:12,460
Well, I can't vouch for any of this,
because Jamie made it all.

498
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,311
Oh, no.

499
00:34:21,656 --> 00:34:24,842
Brooke, this place looks great.

500
00:34:25,005 --> 00:34:28,453
Think, if I can't sign any bands soon,
maybe I can get a job here?

501
00:34:28,558 --> 00:34:32,010
I'm sorry, darling, you're not nearly
bitchy enough to work in one of my stores.

502
00:34:32,118 --> 00:34:34,750
Oh, I don't know about that.
I have references.

503
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:37,642
- Just ask Lindsey.
- Lucas' Lindsey?

504
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:40,872
- Does everyone call her that?
- Were you mean to her?

505
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:45,362
No, she was marking her territory,
and I just called her on it.

506
00:34:46,246 --> 00:34:48,943
- She thinks I'm after Lucas.
- She said that?

507
00:34:49,048 --> 00:34:50,802
She didn't have to--
it was obvious.

508
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:54,410
She showed up with this,
like, bad-luck bamboo thing

509
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:58,043
and a story about how it was,
like, a symbol of my dream,

510
00:34:58,145 --> 00:35:00,363
but I'm pretty sure it
was just to guilt-trip me.

511
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,303
- Peyton--
- And then-- get this--

512
00:35:02,408 --> 00:35:07,211
she says to me,
"I just want you to know, I'm here."

513
00:35:07,597 --> 00:35:10,941
What is that?! I mean,
you're opening up your own store,

514
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:14,230
and does she bring
you a lucky bamboo?

515
00:35:17,668 --> 00:35:21,410
- I'm such a bitch.
- Look on the bright side --

516
00:35:21,515 --> 00:35:23,871
now I'd hire you to work in
one of my stores in a second.

517
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:27,383
- No, really, I suck.
- Yeah, you do.

518
00:35:27,535 --> 00:35:30,803
Matter of fact, it's a wonder
that you have any friends at all,

519
00:35:30,905 --> 00:35:33,171
but you do. Come with me.

520
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:36,632
So, the entire class stands up,
and I said,

521
00:35:36,736 --> 00:35:39,660
"any student that walks out
that door fails this quarter."

522
00:35:39,768 --> 00:35:41,963
- You didn't say that.
- I totally did.

523
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:46,123
You're, like --
you're, like, the mean teacher.

524
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,000
That's kind of hot.

525
00:35:49,678 --> 00:35:52,720
Well, well, don't you think it's a
little past your bedtime, mister?

526
00:35:52,827 --> 00:35:54,443
I think so.

527
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:57,402
Hey, I'll tell you what --
since it's a special occasion,

528
00:35:57,508 --> 00:36:00,462
I think we should stay up a little
later tonight, unless you're too tired.

529
00:36:00,556 --> 00:36:03,892
- No, I'm not tired!
- Okay. Come here.

530
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:06,213
I was thinking maybe
we could go outside

531
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:09,203
and shoot around
with this thing.

532
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,371
Is that something you'd
like to do with me?

533
00:36:12,476 --> 00:36:14,761
I don't know.

534
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:18,572
- Yeah. I don't really know, either.
- No, no, no! Play!

535
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:23,070
All right, well, let's see if you're
ready. Show me your jump shot.

536
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:29,320
Nice! Nice arc.
Use that follow-through.

537
00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:30,890
There you go.

538
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:35,210
Surprise.

539
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:37,830
You rented a house?

540
00:36:37,937 --> 00:36:40,573
Well, not exactly.

541
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:44,193
Brooke, you did not
just buy this house.

542
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,490
- What are you thinking?!
- What-- you don't like it?

543
00:36:47,598 --> 00:36:49,860
No, it's incredible!

544
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:52,833
Good, 'cause that's your room.

545
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:55,923
Oh, my God!

546
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:03,830
Your son left this
for you earlier.

547
00:37:18,928 --> 00:37:20,331
Try one more time.

548
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:26,012
Beautiful. That was awesome.

549
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:28,900
You'll be doing that on
10-foot baskets someday.

550
00:37:37,107 --> 00:37:38,880
All right, let's see some more.

551
00:37:39,915 --> 00:37:41,121
Nice!

552
00:37:50,866 --> 00:37:52,662
So, we're gonna
give you a chance.

553
00:37:52,815 --> 00:37:54,440
Don't let us down.

554
00:37:55,385 --> 00:37:57,130
I won't.

555
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:34,691
I've been putting on a brave
face for a few weeks now.

556
00:38:35,805 --> 00:38:38,922
You have these two gorgeous
ex-girlfriends back in town,

557
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:42,232
and I'm trying so hard
to be okay with it,

558
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:46,102
but I have to ask you a question,
and I promise, I'll never ask it again.

559
00:38:49,348 --> 00:38:51,680
Should I be worried about us?

560
00:38:57,125 --> 00:39:01,381
Lindsey... I love you.

561
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:04,940
That is never gonna change.

562
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:09,151
You have nothing
to worry about.

563
00:39:23,837 --> 00:39:25,183
Hey, you know what?

564
00:39:25,938 --> 00:39:27,780
I just thought of something.

565
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:31,511
What if Lucas' Lindsey
gave you a lucky bamboo

566
00:39:31,617 --> 00:39:35,081
because she was marking her
territory with you, too?

567
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,551
Let it go.

568
00:39:37,848 --> 00:39:41,430
I'm calling her "Lucas'
Lindsey" now. God.

569
00:39:43,376 --> 00:39:45,020
Look at the view.

570
00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:49,801
Look, this place is
beautiful, but...

571
00:39:50,575 --> 00:39:51,950
But?

572
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:55,493
I just worry I'm keeping
you from your life.

573
00:39:55,596 --> 00:39:57,750
I know you came
down here for me.

574
00:39:57,858 --> 00:40:00,802
You know, in New York,
I had everything I thought I wanted--

575
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:03,850
money, celebrity, success.

576
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:07,881
But you know what
I didn't have?

577
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:11,092
Sunrise with my best friend.

578
00:40:15,077 --> 00:40:17,030
Well, isn't that sweet?

579
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:20,462
What are you doing here?

580
00:40:20,568 --> 00:40:23,521
When you stupidly charge
a house to the company,

581
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:25,802
we have to confirm the address.

582
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:30,993
Vacation's over.
It's time to get back to work.

583
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:33,411
Forget it. I'm staying here.

584
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,653
Stop being a spoiled brat.

585
00:40:35,757 --> 00:40:39,150
There's a flight in a few hours. I will be
on it, and you will be sitting next to me.

586
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,480
- No, I'm not going back.
- Brooke.

587
00:40:41,586 --> 00:40:43,160
Mother.

588
00:40:52,957 --> 00:40:56,293
I'll see you on the plane,
my dutiful daughter.

589
00:40:56,675 --> 00:40:58,392
Goodbye, Peyton.

590
00:41:00,607 --> 00:41:02,813
Goodbye, Mrs. Davis.

591
00:41:07,837 --> 00:41:11,062
Well, your mom's still a bitch.

592
00:41:12,975 --> 00:41:14,762
What are you gonna do?
