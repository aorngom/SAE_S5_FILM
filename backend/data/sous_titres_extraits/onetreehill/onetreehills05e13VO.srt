1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,550
<i>On "one tree hill"...</i>

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,750
You...are fired.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,350
Brooke:
i want to have a baby,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,650
And i realize that what
i actually want
is to have a family.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,350
Carrie!
What are you doing?!
This is not okay!

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,450
You have to get out of here!

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,050
It's okay, nathan.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,050
Haley,
this isn't this, okay?

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,050
<i>I want you to get the hell
out of my house right now!</i>

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,450
No, you stay away from us!
This marriage is over!

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,550
Haley!

12
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,950
I want a divorce.

13
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,450
I still love you, lucas.

14
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,050
Peyton, i...

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,250
I'm sorry, lucas.
I can't marry you.

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,950
Jamie!

17
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,650
Nanny carrie!

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,550
Jamie!

19
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,350
Won't mama be mad?

20
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,850
Carrie: no. Besides...

21
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,950
I'm gonna be your mama now.

22
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,350
If you decide to go anywhere
near my family ever again...

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,450
I'd have no problem
killing you.

24
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,350
Mama!

25
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,550
Oh, baby!
Come here!

26
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,650
Sweetie, what happened to you?
Are you okay?

27
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,650
I'm fine.
Grandpa dan saved me.

Hey, dan.

32
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,750
Grandpa!

33
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,750
Jamie!

34
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,850
Jamie!

35
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,950
Hey, buddy.

36
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,650
Jamie.

37
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,250
I got to go now.

38
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,550
You go back
to your mom, okay? Go on.

39
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,150
Go on.

40
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,850
Grandpa.

41
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,950
Thank you.

42
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,050
I guess i still find it hard
to let jamie
out of my sight.Its just...

43
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,050
It's only been a month
since he was abducted.

44
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,250
Is it so crazy
that i would still hear
echoes from that day,

45
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,350
That i would still be
a little overprotective?

46
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,650
Protective
or overprotective?

47
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,950
You said
overprotective.

48
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,950
Okay.

49
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,350
You said it yourself.

50
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,550
Identification is the first step
to recovery, right?

51
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,150
How have things been going
since nathan moved home?

52
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,350
Better.

53
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,750
We've spent
the past four sessions
discussing you and nathan
as a couple,

54
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,350
As parents to jamie.
Let's talk about you
as individuals.

55
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,950
Who are you, haley?

56
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,250
You mean, like,
what do i do for a living,
or what are
my hobbies, or...

57
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,550
No, i mean who are you?

58
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,550
Well, my name
is brooke davis,

59
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,350
And i own a fashion line
called clothes over bro's,

60
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,550
Which, before you read
too much into it,

61
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,550
Is very boy-Friendly,
just clothes-Friendlier.

62
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,350
Anyway, i attended
the orientation,

63
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,950
So i took the liberty
of drawing up a statement
of my financial worth.

64
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,250
I think
you'll be very pleased.

65
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,750
How old are you,
brooke?

66
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,050
Um, 22.

67
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,550
But i lead a rather
accelerated lifestyle

68
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,050
With the fashion line
and the magazine. And...

69
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,250
I did read somewhere
that 25 is the average age
for women to --

70
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,650
Do you own
your own home?

71
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,950
Mm-Hmm.

72
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,850
Are you sexually active?

73
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,850
Lately, no, but not
for a lack of trying.

74
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,450
Sorry. No.

75
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,150
Anyway, as i said,

76
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,150
I have
my financial statements
and a copy
of my medical history,

77
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,550
A copy
of my birth certificate --

78
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,950
And do you drink?

79
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:49,850
Sorry?

80
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,350
I noticed the bar.

81
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,050
Oh, um, some.

82
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,950
Not really.

83
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,950
The bar is
more for my roommate.

84
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,950
And that would be
peyton sawyer, correct?

85
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:03,650
Mm-Hmm.

86
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,550
You should see her
knock 'em back. She's a champ.

87
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,650
I mean...

88
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,150
The boy that she loves

89
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,150
Recently almost married
someone else
and kind of went awol,

90
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,650
So, unlike me,
who is perfectly stable
and normal,

91
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,650
She's struggling a bit.

92
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,050
I guess that's what happens
when you fall in love.

93
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,750
She can move out
if it's a problem.

94
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,850
Peyton:
my mom used to sing to me.

95
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,650
I don't think i've ever really
told anybody that before.

96
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,750
It was -- It was
like our little secret. But...

97
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,050
Every night, she'd come in,
and she'd tuck me in,

98
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,250
And she'd sing me
something like...

99
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,750
Lullabies or...

100
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,850
Album rock stuff.

101
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,850
And then,

102
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,350
After she was gone,
i remember...

103
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,350
Lying in bed
for the first time
and just feeling silence,
you know...

104
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,550
And then realizing
that for the rest of my life,
it was gone.

105
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,050
All her songs were gone,

106
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,150
And her voice,
and the way
it used to soothe me.

107
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,250
Just all of it.

108
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,550
So i guess i tried to find
new songs to fill that quiet.

109
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,350
But none of them
ever really have, you know?

110
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,250
Now she's gone

111
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,950
And mia's gone...

112
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,150
And luke is gone.

113
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,450
It's just silence.

114
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,450
It's just silence

115
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,050
Andy: you hear that?

116
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,150
Do i hear what?

117
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,750
Nothing. Silence.

118
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,550
It's nice, huh?

119
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,850
Yeah, i guess so.

120
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,050
Luke, you got to get her
out of your head.

121
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,250
It's been a month, man.
You got to let it go.

122
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,350
Let it go?

123
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,250
A month ago, i had my whole life
ahead of me --

124
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,250
A second novel,
basketball team,

125
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,250
And a girl i was gonna spend
the rest of my life with.

126
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,950
Well, you still have
all those things yet.

127
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,950
If i did,
do you really think
i would have spent the last
four weeks at sea with you?

128
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,450
Which brings me to this um...

129
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,850
What are you doing
out here?

130
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,150
What do you mean?

131
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,650
Well, i mean, it's not like
we haven't loved having you, but...

132
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,150
It's time for you
to get back to your life.

133
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,550
And that all starts
with a simple question.

134
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,550
What do you want?

135
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,050
I want my family back.

136
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,650
And i want haley
to trust me again.

137
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,050
I want her to look at me
the way she used to

138
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,650
And see a better man
than maybe i'll ever be.

139
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,950
And then
i want to be that man.

140
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,850
And i will be,

141
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,350
For her and for jamie.

142
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,450
I want to believe
in nathan again.

143
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,850
And i want to believe
in the goodness of people.

144
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,450
And i want my son
to be safe,

145
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,150
And i want him to be great,

146
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,750
And i want that greatness
to be seen
and appreciated.

147
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,150
That's what i want.

148
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,550
I want to have a family.

149
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,950
I want to use my success
to help a child

150
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,450
Who maybe never
really had a chance at all.

151
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,250
I want to be a mom.

152
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,550
And i'm ready to be one.
I believe that.

153
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,650
I want to believe
in it all again --

154
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,250
Music and art,
fate and love.

155
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,350
And i want to believe
that i've made the right choices

156
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,750
And that i'm
on the right path

157
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,450
And there's still time
to fix the mistakes i've made.

158
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,050
And i guess i want hope.

159
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,550
And i want lucas.

160
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,050
I want lindsey.

161
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,750
I want her to be my wife,
and...

162
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,450
I just want to go back,
you know?

163
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,750
I want to go back to a month
ago, when...

164
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,550
We were happy and life had meaning
and purpose and direction.

165
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,750
That's what i want.

166
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,450
Good

167
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,850
Cause i have a way
you can get all that.

168
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,800
Brooke:
what did you write?

169
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,300
Something good, i hope.

170
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,900
Sorry.

171
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,200
It's just that i kind of feel
like i'm being judged, so...

172
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,800
You're not being judged,
brooke.

173
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,300
You're being evaluated.

174
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,000
It's to help clarify your reason of wanting to adopt

175
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,100
And to explore
your capabilities, maturity,
and emotional readiness.

176
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,400
And does it take very long,

177
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,200
The whole
decision-Ming process?

178
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,800
No. The home study
is the last of it.

179
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,100
So i'll know if i'm
gonna be a mom by the
end of this meeting.

180
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,300
Essentially, yes.

181
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,700
Wow.

182
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,500
Well, how am i doing?

183
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,400
Let's talk about your past.

184
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,500
Nathan: my problems with
my past are of my own doing.

185
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,200
I'm stubborn,
and i have a temper,

186
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,400
And i don't always make
the best decisions.

187
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,300
It must have been
very difficult for you,

188
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,300
Coming so close
to the nba.

189
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,400
Do you think
about that much?

190
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,800
Sometimes.

191
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,500
Yeah.

192
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,200
I mean, sometimes, i wake up
in the middle of the night,

193
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,800
And i walk through town,

194
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,600
Past the school,
past the gym.

195
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,500
I can still
hear the echoes, you know?

196
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,600
You never told me that.

197
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,900
It's not something
i'm all that proud of.

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's like --

199
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,500
Look, i'm not -- I'm not good
with being vulnerable.

200
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,600
In fact, this is probably
the closest i've come to it...

201
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,900
Well, the second closest.

202
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,500
What was the first?

203
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,000
When i was a junior
in high school,

204
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,600
I took some...stuff
to help me with my game --

205
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,000
Drugs -- And it was
a stupid thing to do.

206
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,800
I ended up collapsing
on the court,

207
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,300
And my father was all about,

208
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,400
You know, covering it up
for the scouts.

209
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,700
Anyway,
when i left the hospital,

210
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
I went to see haley,

211
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,600
Because i needed to know
if she could forgive me.

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,500
I wanted to see
if i still had the chance
to be great in her eyes.

213
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,100
And when she did --

214
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,300
She forgave me --

215
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,900
That was the moment that
everything changed for me.

216
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,200
That was the moment
i fell in love with her,

217
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,800
This girl who could see past
all the mistakes i've made.

218
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,600
I don't know.

219
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,500
I guess
maybe sometimes i screw up

220
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,400
Because i want
to feel that again.

221
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,100
I suppose that sounds
pretty broken.

222
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,400
You're not broken, luke.

223
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,200
You might think
that you are, but --

224
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,500
Hey, you remember when i left
your mom the first time

225
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,500
To go back to new zealand?

226
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
It was one of the hardest things
i've ever had to do,

227
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,800
Because i still loved
your mom, but...

228
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,800
I knew there was
a place in her heart
that i would never occupy,

229
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,800
A place reserved
for someone else.

230
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Somehow, i just
couldn't get past it.

231
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,000
Is this sounding
familiar at all?

232
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah. Yeah, she said my heart
was conflicted.

233
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,700
Well,
here comes the good news.

234
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,100
There wasn't a day
while we were apart

235
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
That i wasn't completely
in love with your mom.

236
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,400
And all it would have taken
was for her to simply say,

237
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,100
"I love you, i miss you,
and i need to be with you."

238
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,200
I don't think
it's that easy, andy.

239
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,000
Lucas, it is that easy.

240
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,200
Lindsey needs to be convinced
that you love her.

241
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,600
And did i mention
that i have a private jet

242
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,300
And new york's
not too far from here?

243
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,600
No.

244
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,400
I tried calling her, andy,

245
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,100
And she didn't want
to talk to me.

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,300
All right,
well, tell me this much.

247
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,600
Has a day gone by
since the wedding

248
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,000
Where you haven't thought
about her or wanted to see her,

249
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Wanted her back?

250
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,100
No.

251
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,100
Then you owe it to yourself
to tell her that.

252
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,800
You owe it
to lindsey, too.

253
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,400
Just trust me.

254
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,000
Over time, not knowing is
way worse than to know.

255
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,400
Haley: i think not knowing
is the hardest part --

256
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,500
Just not knowing what
our marriage means to nathan,

257
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,600
If he still wants the same
things out of our relationship that i want,

258
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,700
If he still finds me sexy,
or if he still wants me.

259
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,600
How could you
not know that?

260
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,900
The name carrie
comes to mind.

261
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,500
Why didn't you just tell me
about the flirting?

262
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,300
I don't know.

263
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,500
Did you like it?

264
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Maybe.

265
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,600
Maybe i just needed it.

266
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,000
Why, because i don't
flirt with you after a long day
of wrestling with
high-School students
and parenting our son?

267
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,700
No, because you don't look at me
like that anymore.

268
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,400
And i get it, yoknow.

269
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,800
I haven't been worthy of that
look from you in a long time.

270
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,600
But, god, haley, i just --
I miss that.

271
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,600
Olivia:
when was the first time you felt
a sense of accomplishment,
nathan?

272
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,900
It was when i started
playing basketball.

273
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,000
And the support
of your father?

274
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,700
When i started
playing basketball.

275
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,100
And this year,
all that stopped --

276
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,100
All the praise
and adoration --

277
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,800
At least until your nanny
started swimming naked.

278
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,900
It's not the craziest case
of transference i've ever heard.

279
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,800
So, what,
i need to start swimming naked
for my husband's ego?

280
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,300
No, you don't --
Haley,

281
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,200
This is not your fault.

282
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,800
It's not.

283
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,500
Why not swim naked?

284
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
You could try it together.
It might be fun.

285
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,400
After all, you are 22.

286
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,500
Tell me something.

287
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,400
When was the last time
the two of you
did something really

288
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,600
Young
and foolish together?

289
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,800
With all due respect,

290
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,100
We have been married
nearly 6 years.
We have a son
who's almost 5.

291
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,000
We don't get
to be young.

292
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,100
Everyone gets to be young...

293
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,400
Especially when you are.

294
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,550
Max: hey, i'm here
about the car for sale.

295
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,550
It runs great,
even though it's kind of...old.

296
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,250
My parents said i could
finally get one.

297
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,050
Hi, max.

298
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,250
Hi, buddy.

299
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,550
Okay, for the first
six months,

300
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,150
You're not to leave the state
without notifying my office.

301
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,850
You must have a job or show
an attempt at gainful employment

302
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,050
At least twice a week.

303
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,250
Any legitimate employment
is normally acceptable.

304
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,550
So, running for mayor again
doesn't count?

305
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,250
You may obtain help
with problems

306
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:58,750
Concerning employment,
residence,
finances, or other issues
that often trouble a person

307
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,750
Trying to adjust to life
upon release from prison.

308
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,450
Take a look at that.

309
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,550
It's a good-Looking boy,
huh?

310
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,550
That's jamie.
That's my grandson.

311
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,050
You have kids?

312
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,450
I'm your case manager.
This isn't "the view."

313
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:17,550
I know. I just thought
you might appreciate
a little small talk,
get to know each
other, you know?

314
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,250
There's no small talk.

315
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,850
It's just i haven't spoken
to too many people
in a long time --

316
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,250
At least none that i haven't
paid to listen.

317
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,350
This is the balance
of what the state owes you

318
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,750
For your work detail in prison
and to help you get situated.

319
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,550
Count it, sign for it,
and you can go.

320
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,450
$3,437.

321
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,150
750 bucks a year, huh?

322
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,950
And they say
crime doesn't pay.

323
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,550
How'd you like to make 3 grand
for a little small talk?

324
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,450
So, anyway, like i was saying,

325
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,650
He's a great kid.

326
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,150
Smart -- He's got his whole life
ahead of him.

327
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,550
The other day, he looks up
at me, and he says...

328
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,450
They won't let me
outside the fence.

329
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,250
Yeah, trust me,
i know the feeling.

330
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,250
Can you really go to jail
for not cleaning your room?

331
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,950
No, but the guy next to me
got 10 years
for not eating his peas.

332
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,650
I don't believe you.

333
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:13,750
Good man.

334
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:15,950
How's my favorite guy?

335
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,750
Okay, except uncle lucas
is gone.

336
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,550
Well, i get a feeling
he'll be coming back soon.

337
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,550
Your parents -- They good?

338
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,450
Daddy came back home.

339
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,950
But he mostly sleeps
on the couch again like before.

340
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,650
Yeah.

341
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:34,950
You know,
i miss you, jamie.

342
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,150
I know.
I miss you, too.

343
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,450
Okay.

344
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,450
Well, i better get going
before i start looking pervy.

345
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,750
What's pervy?

346
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,650
Nothing you need
to worry about.

347
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,650
Go ahead and play.
I'll see you again.

348
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,350
Okay.
Bye, grandpa.

349
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,850
Bye, buddy -- Hey...

350
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,250
Remember, our secret.

351
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:58,850
Hey, kid.

352
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,450
You see that little boy?

353
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,950
You mess with him,
you answer to me. You hear me?

354
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,350
All right,
pass it around.

355
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,050
Olivia: let's talk a little more
about basketball, nathan.

356
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,850
I find it interesting that
when you describe yourselves,

357
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,550
You describe being parents
and spouses
and siblings and friends.

358
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,750
But, nathan, you never once
described yourself
as a basketball player.

359
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,450
That's because
i'm not anymore.

360
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,250
Why not?

361
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,350
That's what happens
when your spine gets crushed.

362
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,850
And the doctors definitively
said you couldn't play?

363
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,050
There's no such thing
as definitively, but...

364
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,650
Nobody's ever come back
from something like this before.

365
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,450
But you're nathan scott.

366
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,450
<i>I'm not that nathan scott.</i>

367
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,350
And, haley, you never refer
to yourself as a musician.

368
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,850
Uh, yeah. Well, i haven't
recorded in a really long time.

369
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,850
Why not?

370
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,850
I had a son to raise,
and nathan's accident.

371
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,550
And now?

372
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,050
And now i still have
a son to raise

373
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,150
Because i haven't found
a really unattractive nanny yet.

374
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,350
Look, i'm only as intelligent
as the diplomas on my wall,

375
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,650
But here's a thought.

376
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,450
Maybe you aren't the people
you fell in love with

377
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,150
Because neither of you is
trying to be
the people
you fell in love with.

378
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,750
Do you think you're ready
to be a mother, brooke?

379
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,450
Yes, i do.

380
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,550
Why?

381
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,450
Because...

382
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,150
Sometimes all a child
needs to succeed is love --

383
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,450
Love from a parent
who can provide

384
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,450
A stable and caring environment,
and i can do that.

385
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,750
And was your home life
safe and caring?

386
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,450
No.

387
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,250
Do you think
you'll ever get married?

388
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,450
I don't know.

389
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,550
If i met the right person,
i suppose i would.

390
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,650
But you haven't met
the right person yet.

391
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,850
Owen the bartender?

392
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,850
Bar manager.

393
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,650
Chase adams,
or lucas scott?

394
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,150
Why'd you close
the store?

395
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,450
How long you been home?

396
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,050
A few months.

397
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,050
And have you heard
any new music?

398
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,050
Yeah, a lot.

399
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,550
Didn't get it
at my store, did you?

400
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,150
Oh, oh. Okay, i see.
It's my fault.

401
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,050
No, it's no one's fault.

402
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,350
I buy
all my music online, too.

403
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,350
That's just the way it is.

404
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,550
Yeah, but the store really
was a lot more than that.

405
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,850
I hope so.

406
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,450
I'd like to think
it had something to do
with this cool
new record label.

407
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,350
This place is really awesome.
It's like the batcave in here.

408
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,650
Tell me you fight crime
at night,
like, secretly,
in a leather cat suit.

409
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,450
Oh, my god!

410
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,250
Max, you are the guy
that lives at home, huh?

411
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,350
You think about him much?

412
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,250
Lucas?

413
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,950
Every day.

414
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,150
Brooke: i don't understand
what lucas scott
has to do
with my decision to adopt.

415
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,650
You said peyton was a mess

416
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,450
Because the boy she loves
recently almost married
someone else.

417
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,750
You also had a relationship
with him.

418
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,850
Oh, we dated in high school.
So what?

419
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,150
So, lucas scott falls in love
with someone else,

420
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,650
Peyton hits the bar,

421
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,950
And you decide
to find love elsewhere.

422
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,650
By adopting?

423
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,650
Look, i want to say this
as politely as possible,

424
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,250
But that logic is
awfully cynical,

425
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,250
Not to mention
completely wrong.

426
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,350
It's just the timing
seems a little questionable.

427
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,350
Well, i've been thinking
about having a child
since before i moved
back to tree hill.

428
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,150
And i know that i'm young.

429
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,650
But i explained to you
i have an accelerated life.

430
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,450
And on average, most women
have their first child
at the age of 25.

431
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,050
I looked it up.

432
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,150
Okay.

433
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,350
Let's move on.

434
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,050
Any drug use?

435
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,150
I don't use drugs.

436
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,050
But in high school,
didn't you run a campaign
based on partying
and promiscuity?

437
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,350
I think this
was around the time
you were arrested
for shoplifting.

438
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,250
I am not
who i was in high school.

439
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,950
And you recently housed a drug
addict named rachel gatina.

440
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,650
I would never
let my child do drugs.

441
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,550
And i can't say that i know
where you're getting
all this information,

442
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,650
But i don't know how it affects
my ability to be a good --

443
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,250
You spoke to my mother.

444
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,750
Have you spoken
with peyton?

445
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,950
Not since the wedding?

446
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,050
No.

447
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,050
Jamie went missing.

448
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,650
Then i had to deal with dan,and...

449
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,850
Then we left.

450
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,050
And the book,
this whole comet business

451
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,950
That lindsey was going on about
at the altar?

452
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,050
So peyton drives a frickin'
comet. What the hell?

453
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,850
I mean,
thank god the guy in the book
didn't see a white bronco.

454
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,350
They'd all say
i'm in love with o.J.

455
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,950
Man.

456
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,650
What kind of car
does lindsey drive?

457
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,750
Oh, that's not fair.

458
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,550
It is not fair that you spoke
with my mother.

459
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,050
We always speak
with applicants' families.

460
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,850
I understand that,
but did mine tell you

461
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,550
That she was just let go
from my company?

462
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,850
Yes, she did.

463
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,550
Sour grapes,
don't you think?

464
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,750
I think it's got to be
pretty busy for you
in the absence
of your c.E.O.

465
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,450
I'm really not that busy.

466
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,150
That's 17, by the way.

467
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,350
That's 17 phone calls
this afternoon.

468
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,950
A lot of them
are e-Mails.

469
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,350
Brooke, we ask
our adoptive families
to take
at least six months off

470
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,650
To smooth the transition
for the new children.

471
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,350
It's much easier
in a two-Parent household.

472
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,950
Were you
from a two-Parent household?

473
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,550
My parents were divorced
when i was 12.

474
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,150
I'm sorry to hear that.

475
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,650
But some of the best people
that i know

476
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,750
Are from single-Parent
households.

477
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,750
Are you
from a two-Parent household?

478
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,750
Something tells me you already
know the answer to that.

479
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,450
I'd like to hear it
from you.

480
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,950
I'm from
a no-Parent household.

481
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,950
My father cared a lot more
about his golf score
than he ever did about me,

482
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,650
And my mom went heavy
on the scotch and prada.

483
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,750
The good news is
that thanks to them,
i know exactly

484
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,850
What kind
of parent i won't be.

485
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,550
I won't be
an absentee parent.

486
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,050
If i have to sacrifice
some things, then so be it.

487
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,650
Olivia:
that's noble, haley.

488
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,650
But it also might be
part of the problem.

489
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,150
You both have
individual passions,

490
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,450
Individual gifts,
individual dreams.

491
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,850
And you should,
especially at your age.

492
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,950
Maybe if you spent
a little more time

493
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,750
Being selfish 22-Year-Olds,

494
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,550
You might love yourself
a bit more

495
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,450
And resent each other
a bit less.

496
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,350
I don't resent
haley or jamie.

497
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,850
I mean, they're the two best
things that ever happened to me.

498
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,350
Yeah.
I agree with that.

499
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,450
We're the best things
that ever happened to him.

500
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:17,450
No, i agree
that nathan and jamie
are the best and most important
things that i have.

501
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,850
What about music?

502
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,950
I asked nathan this before.

503
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,350
What was it like,

504
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,550
Hearing the cheers
of enthusiastic, sold-Out crowds
every night?

505
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,450
Incredible.

506
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,050
It was
humbling and wonderful.

507
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,250
But it took you
away from nathan.

508
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,050
Yeah,
we really struggled then.

509
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,750
I mean,
i'm not avoiding music now

510
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,850
Because i'm afraid that
that's gonna happen again.

511
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,450
Good.

512
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,650
Leaving jamie out of all this,

513
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,050
Would you say those
were your best days,

514
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,850
Where you were happiest
with yourself?

515
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,750
I wasn't proud of myself,

516
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,850
Because i knew
nathan was hurting.

517
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,650
But personally,
i guess i loved it, yeah.

518
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,650
What about you, nathan?

519
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,850
Best days ever --

520
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,950
Playing basketball
in front of thousands?

521
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,350
The road trips sucked
because i was away
from haley and jamie,

522
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,150
But for me...yeah.

523
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,150
If you could have
those days back,

524
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,950
Do you think you might
do things differently --

525
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,250
Maybe treat each other
a bit differently
in the face
of those dreams?

526
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,250
Yeah.
Definitely.

527
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,950
Maybe you can.

528
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:27,950
Maybe you will.

529
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,250
I wish i could change
some of the things

530
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,450
About how i've acted
in the last couple months.

531
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,050
I guess i'm just disappointed
in myself.

532
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:51,350
You know, i told lucas
that if he loved his fiancée,

533
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,550
Then i would learn
to be okay with that

534
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,850
Because i wanted him
to be happy. But...

535
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,750
Really, i just wanted
us to be happy --

536
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,250
Me and him.

537
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,450
Oh, and then
when he didn't marry her,

538
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,950
I mean,
i felt terrible for her

539
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,450
And for him, you know?
His heart is...

540
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,750
Breaking
right now, and...

541
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,950
I come in here,

542
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,850
And i sit in silence and...

543
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,950
Hear the echoes
of who we used to be.

544
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,350
And so i wish
for patience...

545
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,650
And grace...

546
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,550
And the strength
to just let him be happy.

547
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,050
And mostly, i pray
for the strength

548
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,550
To not make his life worse
'cause of what i want.

549
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,450
That's the toughest part --

550
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,950
Letting go, you know?

551
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,550
And that's the part of grace
that really sucks.

552
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,850
Today for show and tell,
i brought my bunny, chester.

553
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,250
Chester's my best friend ever.

554
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,450
My nanny carrie
used to be my best friend,

555
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,950
But she tried to put stuff
in my hair and take me away.

556
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,150
Now i guess it's a tie

557
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,750
Between my uncle skills,
my aunt brooke, and chester --

558
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,050
Oh, and my grandpa dan.

559
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,450
He brought me home.

560
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,350
You know
how i got this scar, sam?

561
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,550
I was helping
my son nathan.

562
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,150
You see, family is
important to me.

563
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,650
And didn't you go to prison
for killing your brother?

564
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,150
I've changed.

565
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,350
Come on,
people don't change.

566
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,650
Take it from me --
Most of the people who
walk through that door

567
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,350
Walk right back into prison
within a year's time.

568
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,550
That's not gonna happen
to me.

569
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,750
Well,
we'll see about that.

570
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,150
Scott.

571
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,550
I can't keep this.

572
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,350
My debt to society
is square.

573
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,150
Donate it to charity --

574
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,950
Evil for good, right?

575
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,550
Nice talk, sammy.

576
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,250
This wasn't a good talk,
was it?

577
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,750
I mean,
i didn't pass, did i?
You're not
gonna recommend me?

578
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:32,650
No, i am not going to recommend
you for adoption, brooke.

579
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,150
I'm sorry.

580
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,250
But the truth is, is you are
very young

581
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,050
And you're single.

582
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,850
And i can't remember
another case

583
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,850
Where an applicant's mother said

584
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,850
She'd make
a terrible candidate.

585
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,250
Well, it's too bad
nobody interviewed her
before she had a kid,
right?

586
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,450
I'm sorry
we can't help you.

587
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,450
You're not sorry.

588
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,650
But you should be.

589
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,950
Do you know
what my mother said to me
when i told her i wanted
to start a company?

590
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,550
She said, "your chances
are one in a million."

591
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,750
And i said,
"maybe i'm that one."

592
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,850
And she said, "you're not."

593
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,550
And she was wrong.

594
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,450
And whatever she thought
she saw in me was wrong...

595
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,350
Because i am
one in a million.

596
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,250
And there is a child
out there
who has something

597
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,650
So special inside of them

598
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,450
But whose life is miserable

599
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,750
Because they think
that nobody wants them.

600
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:41,350
And i could be a great mother
to that child,

601
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,550
No matter their age
or race or sex.

602
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,750
I could help them find
what makes them special.

603
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,650
And if you can't see that,
then you're wrong...

604
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,750
Just like my mother.

605
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,350
Why don't you go ahead
and write that down?

606
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,950
Where's mama?

607
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,750
Hey, sleepyhead.
She'll be back soon.

608
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,650
How'd you sleep?

609
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,050
I had a dream
about daddy.

610
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:27,850
Oh, yeah?

611
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,950
Mm-Hmm.
And you were there.

612
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,450
And you were sad.

613
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,950
But daddy said
everything's gonna be okay.

614
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,150
It's all gonna be okay.
I know that.

615
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,050
It's just some days
are kind of messy, you know?

616
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,750
Well, it's only life,

617
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,750
At least according
to mia catalano.

618
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,150
You ever wonder
where she'd be
if you didn't decide
to start this label?

619
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,250
She would be fine.
Maybe not.

620
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,050
You changed her life, peyton.

621
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,950
So maybe that's
why you came home --

622
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,350
In order to change the life
of the next artist
or the one after that...

623
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,450
Maybe change your own life
at the same time.

624
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,850
I think you're good here.

625
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,980
You just need
a little patience.

626
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,980
Patience.

627
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,180
Time heals
old wounds, huh?

628
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,580
Time, music.

629
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,780
Let me
ask you something.

630
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,580
When's the last time you got
in that cool car of yours,

631
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,080
Turned up the stereo,
and just drove?

632
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,980
You might
try that sometime --

633
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,080
Maybe find something there
to heal
that broken heart of yours.

634
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,480
Then again, i am --
36 and still
living at home? Yeah.

635
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,680
So what the hell
do i know, right?

636
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,480
Thanks.

637
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,280
Now, we're nearly out of time,
so let's end this session
as we have every week.

638
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,980
Haley, tell me some things
you love about nathan.

639
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,080
I love that he's here with me
every week without fail.

640
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,080
And i love that he holds himself
accountable for his mistakes.

641
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,980
And i love that he's
so protective over me and jamie.

642
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,480
And i love that shirt
that he's wearing...

643
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,380
And maybe
the way he wears it.

644
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,280
Olivia: nathan?

645
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,580
It's okay, really.

646
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,380
I'm not that great
at taking a compliment.

647
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,580
Oh, well, we'll be working
on that next week, then.

648
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,580
You two are going to be okay.
I really think so.

649
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,480
Thanks.

650
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,980
Can you pick up
line one for me, please?

651
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,080
Hi.

652
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,080
Well, i've been traveling
with my mom since...

653
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,280
Yeah, i talked to haley.

654
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,780
I'm glad jamie's okay.

655
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,780
Yeah.

656
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,780
Look, i know
i owe you this,

657
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,780
But i'm not
gonna publish it.

658
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,130
Luke.

659
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,730
Look, i know you
promised your boss
a second book out of me, but...

660
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:27,530
I can't.

661
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,730
You have to.
They'll void your deal.

662
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,830
They'll make you
pay back your advance.

663
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,030
And on top of that,
it's too good not to publish.

664
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,330
I miss you.

665
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,530
I do.
Lindsey, i love you.

666
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,230
Every day i wake up, and i have
this ache in my chest.

667
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:48,430
And sometimes
i just sleep in
because i know when
i wake up,

668
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,630
You're not gonna be there.

669
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,630
I love you, too, luke.
You know that.

670
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,930
But i can't be with you.

671
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,630
It's okay.

672
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,930
I'll publish the book
if you edit it.

673
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,630
Luke.

674
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,730
That's it.
That's my offer.

675
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,530
There'll be long nights,
heated arguments.
It'll be
like we're married.

676
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,230
I'll edit the book
because i believe in it.

677
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,930
And i believe in you.

678
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,230
But we can't
be together.

679
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,130
We will be.

680
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,130
One of these days,
you're gonna wake up,

681
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,630
And you'll feel that same need
in your heart,
and you're gonna realize
how much i love you.

682
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,130
And whenever that day is,

683
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,030
I'll still be waiting
for you.

684
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,130
And you'll come home
to me.

685
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,930
Hi!

686
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,730
Hi, buddy.

687
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,430
Quiet around here
without jamie.

688
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,130
Yeah.
He's with brooke.

689
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,430
Baby steps.
Yeah.

690
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,330
How you sleeping
these days?

691
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,430
So-So.

692
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,530
Jamie tosses around
like a tasmanian devil.

693
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,830
He should probably get back
to his own bed soon --

694
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,730
Separation thing.

695
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,830
Or he can sleep
in the spare bedroom with me.

696
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,730
You know, sometimes i find
your goodness staggering.

697
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,030
I didn't get a chance
to tell you in the session, but...

698
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,530
Your kindness
is overwhelming, haley.

699
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,830
I mean,
you saved my life.

700
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,830
If i haven't said it lately,

701
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,930
You're also sexy
as hell.

702
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,730
Hey.

703
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,430
I was thinking, um...

704
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,030
Not sleeping in this bed

705
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:59,430
Might not be
so bad tonight
if you wanted
to try it with me.

706
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,130
You got any more
of that sexy talk?

707
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,830
What, the kindness stuff
or the sexy stuff?

708
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,130
You have a serious ass,
haley james.

709
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,730
<i>Peyton: make a wish
and place it in your heart.</i>

710
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,030
<i>Anything you want --</i>

711
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,930
<i>Everything you want.</i>

712
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,130
<i>Lucas: do you have it?</i>

713
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:55,730
<i>Good.</i>

714
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,130
<i>Now believe it can come true.</i>

715
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,130
<i>You never know
where the next miracle
is gonna come from,
the next smile,</i>

716
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,330
<i>The next wish come true.</i>

717
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,030
<i>Peyton: but if you believe
that it's
right around the corner...</i>

718
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,030
<i>And you open your heart
and mind
to the possibility of it,</i>

719
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,930
<i>To the certainty of it...</i>

720
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,530
<i>Brooke: you just might get
the thing you're wishing for.</i>

721
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,930
<i>Nathan:
the world is full of magic.</i>

722
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,530
<i>You just have to believe in it.</i>

723
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,830
<i>So make your wish.</i>

724
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,130
<i>Do you have it?</i>

725
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,130
<i>Haley: good.</i>

726
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,430
<i>Now believe in it...</i>

727
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,430
<i>...with all your heart.</i>

728
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:27,530
