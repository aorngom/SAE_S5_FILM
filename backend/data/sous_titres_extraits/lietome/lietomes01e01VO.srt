1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,120
<i>The following *****</i>

2
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,630
I've instructed my
client to remain silent.

3
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,660
He's not gonna talk.

4
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,520
That's okay. That's okay. I don't
have much faith in words myself.

5
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:43,180
Statistically speaking, the average person
tells three lies per ten minutes' conversation.

6
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,330
And granted, it's just regular people.

7
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,390
We haven't studied people who are
planning to firebomb a black church.

8
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,220
Could skew differently.

9
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,130
We don't have time for this
scientist to talk to the guy.

10
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,090
We went at him for
four hours, got nothing.

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,300
Now,the FBI knows you
want mass casualties.

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:05,960
So right now ATF is searching every inch of
the two largest black churches in the state.

13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,020
The FBI got it wrong.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,680
Well,there's a shocker.

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,030
It's not one of those two churches.

16
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,310
Maybe you want one of
the smaller churches.

17
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,310
- One of the black suburbs.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,620
Don't respond!

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,020
What do you say ATF
starts with Southbridge?

20
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,680
No,I'm only kidding.
We'll skip that one.

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,250
We're gonna focus on Lorton.

22
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,100
You feel good about that?

23
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,710
That's it! Lorton! Going
after a church in Lorton.

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,750
That accusation has no basis.

25
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,860
What do you mean? He just told me.

26
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,480
The ATF found a pipe bomb in a church
basement in Lorton an hour later.

27
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,150
DOD friend of mine said
this guy's a total nutjob.

28
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,510
Heard he spent, like,three years in the African jungle
with some primitive tribe studying their eyebrows.

29
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,240
Watch his reaction to my statement.

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,760
Right now,ATF is searching every inch of
the two largest black churches in the state.

31
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,800
Now what you just saw there was a brief
expression of happiness on his face

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,690
which he was trying his best to conceal.

33
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,480
It lasted for less than
a fifth of a second.

34
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,960
It's what we call a "microexpression."

35
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,270
Now,look at his mouth.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,520
The suspect is secretly happy about
the locations we are searching,

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,240
which tells me we have
the wrong locations.

38
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,980
Now I tell him of our new plan,and...

39
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,730
You don't know what
you're talking about.

40
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,920
Classic one-sided shrug.

41
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,600
Translation: "I've absolutely no
confidence of what I just said."

42
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,690
The body contradts the
words. He's lying. Yeah?

43
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,720
When you accuse the suspect,
and he acts surprised,

44
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,790
is there a way to tell if it's real or
if he's just trying to look innocent?

45
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,320
Now that's real surprise.

46
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,260
Lasts for less than a second
when it comes across your face,

47
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:57,310
but if your suspect is surprised for more
than a second, he's faking it. He's lying.

48
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,530
Now I call out his
target is actually Lorton,

49
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,910
and watch it again.

50
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,110
Concealed scorn.

51
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,520
One personal tip.You see this
microexpression in your spouse's face,

52
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,320
your marriage is coming
to an end. Trust me.

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,730
Yeah?

54
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,590
Don't these microexpressions
vary depending on the person?

55
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,720
Let's leave this up.

56
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,450
And we'll go to the Kato Kaelin
footage from the OJ trial.

57
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,100
Mr. Kaelin,you got a lot of money for your
appearance onCurrent Affair, didn't you?

58
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,290
Um,yeah.

59
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,290
Scorn. Scorn. Huge scorn.

60
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,630
Shame,shame,and shame.

61
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,520
Contempt. These
expressions are universal.

62
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,690
Emotion looks the same whether you're a
suburban housewife or a suicide bomber.

63
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,720
The truth is written on all our faces.

64
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,760
<i>THE LIGHTMAN GROUP</i>

65
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,610
Just the man I was looking
for. Today's the day. Say it.

66
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,880
You're the shrink. I'm not
big on self-affirmation.

67
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,880
I'm telling you we cannot wait
another day to hire someone.

68
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,550
- I found the one. This is the one.
- I...

69
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,220
Use your words.

70
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,390
Why do we need to hire someone?

71
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,320
We got a new request this morning
from the DEA and Homeland Security.

72
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,550
Someone from the Prime Minister's
office in Uzbekistan called.

73
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,410
They want us to give a
talk to their senior police.

74
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,350
Tell him to call back when
they got a constitution.

75
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,260
A real one. Here's the analysis
from the blinking experiment.

76
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,260
You just getting in,Loker?

77
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,150
Yeah,I got piss-drunk last
night with my roommate,

78
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,400
and I was just lying in bed this morning
thinking about how nasty hot Nancy Grace is,

79
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,710
and just trying to decide
if I was gonna come in at all

80
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,100
'cause it's not like there's
anyone here to fantasize about.

81
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,650
No offense taken.

82
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,060
I don't go for married women.

83
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,220
Cal,Cal...

84
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,810
Dr. Lightman,I have
the mayor on 2 for you.

85
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,800
All right.

86
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,990
Mr. Mayor.

87
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,260
I see. Of course.

88
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,650
Any time.

89
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,500
What is it?

90
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,020
Some blowup at the Justice Department about a
high school teacher that was killed in Northwest.

91
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,470
He wants us in on it right
away since... What is that?

92
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,200
Chocolate pudding.

93
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,900
Who eats pudding at
10:00 in the morning?

94
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,620
People who like pudding.

95
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,400
The mayor thanks you and Dr.
Foster for coming on short notice.

96
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,610
This case is a land mine.

97
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,080
We got a juvenile offender, family
of devout Jehovah's Witnesses.

98
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,800
We gotta be real careful here.

99
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,320
Three day ago,James Cole,
16-year-old student at Jackson High,

100
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,010
murdered his teacher,Susan McCartney.

101
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,490
After Mr. Cole got into Mrs. McCartney's house,
he smashed her head into a glass coffee table.

102
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,080
He then was caught fleeing
the house by two patrolmen.

103
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,830
Been in custody here ever since.

104
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,470
So what exactly does the mayor want
to find out about the McCartney murder?

105
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,560
Assistant US Attorneys
Hutchinson and Estin.

106
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,580
The kid was at the scene of the crime; he
had motive,means; and he resisted arrest.

107
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,770
- And he failed a polygraph test.
- It's murder one.

108
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,970
Well,I guess we're all here
then: someone who wants the truth;

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,790
somebody who wants to be right;
and us,the idiots in the middle.

110
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,840
The US Attorney's office
wants to try Cole as an adult.

111
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,660
But if the mayor is gonna support sending a
16-year-old to prison for the rest of his life,

112
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,540
he wants to be certain we're talking
about a premeditated, cold-blooded murder.

113
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,100
He wants you to provide an
independent assessment of intent.

114
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,670
We'll need the crime scene
photos and the autopsy report.

115
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,600
I thought you could tell somebody
was lying just by looking at them.

116
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,680
The question is never simply
ifsomeone is lying; it's why.

117
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,760
Look,I already told the
police everything,okay?

118
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,790
Tell us why you think you're here,James.

119
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,510
I was out for a run, and the police
thought I was running from them.

120
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,100
So they arrested me.

121
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,770
I heard you made your
school's track team.

122
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,100
I didn'tmakeit.

123
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,820
They don't have tryouts.

124
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,880
What was your best race this year?

125
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,310
I don't know. Um,probably
against Jefferson last week. Why?

126
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,970
I ran hurdles myself. 110 meters.

127
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,310
How'd your quads feel during the race?

128
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,370
good,I guess.

129
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,810
And what about on your run
the night you were arrested?

130
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,030
I felt fine.

131
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,640
Your teacher Ms. McCartney
was found dead in her home.

132
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,900
Have you ever been to her house before?

133
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,390
No,I've never been to her house before.

134
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,030
Ms.McCartney thought that
you should be held back a year

135
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,970
because she felt you were having
some problems with your classmates.

136
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,600
What? I didn't want to get held back.

137
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,360
How'd you feel when you
found out she was dead?

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,120
I prayed for her soul.

139
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,660
I can't know God's plan,
but I didn't kill her.

140
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,550
Hurdles?

141
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,620
- Could have run hurdles.
- Please.

142
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,060
So you got a sense of his intent?

143
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,820
When I asked James about his best race, he broke eye
contact in order to remember and answer truthfully.

144
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,120
And when I asked him about his run the night
of the murder, he never broke eye contact.

145
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,630
He wasn't recalling a
memory. He was lying.

146
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,090
But I thought most people avoid
eye contact when they're lying.

147
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,930
No,it's a myth.

148
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,560
And quite often, they
make more eye contact.

149
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,420
They need to watch,see
if you believe their lies.

150
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,120
The content analysis would suggest that James
has been to Ms. McCartney's house before.

151
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,820
Question: "Have you
ever been to her house?"

152
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,450
Answer: "No,I have
never been to her house."

153
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,450
Rigid repetion like
that is typical of a lie.

154
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,410
Okay,so you'll tell the mayor's
office the murder was premeditated?

155
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
Looks that way.

156
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,750
But when I asked him about his
teacher's death, what we saw was this:

157
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,150
- oblique eyebrows.
- Sadness.

158
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,040
Why would he be hiding sadness for her?

159
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,380
Looks like guilt to me.

160
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,640
It's possible he didn't
mean to kill his teacher.

161
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,760
Excuse me?

162
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,680
- Could have been an accident.
- Okay.

163
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,560
Okay,I indulged the mayor's office
in letting you talk to the kid,

164
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,720
but now you're just making wild guesses
that have no basis in hard evidence.

165
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,460
This was no accident.

166
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,350
And personally,I think
what you do is a joke.

167
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,090
It's a friggin' carnival act.

168
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,630
Oh,yeah,yeah, I get that a lot.

169
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,880
You know,a moment ago, I saw
you smile at your colleague,

170
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,280
flash her a glance,
then shift your gaze.

171
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,080
She responded by raising her chin
boss, revealing deep embarrassment.

172
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,030
Cal...?

173
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,870
I'll take another wild
guess: you two had a fling.

174
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,780
She doesn't want a repeat performance
because,you know, what with your wife and all.

175
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,740
But you won't move on.

176
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,190
Oh,no,no. Keep your
fingers off your nose.

177
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,350
Men have erectile tissue there.

178
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,050
Itches when they're hiding something.

<font color=#00FFFF>Lie to
Me Season01 Episode01</font>

182
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,860
I've been principal here
for over three years.

183
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,980
We've never faced anything like this.

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,410
To lose a teacher and then to find out
that a student might have been responsible.

185
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,500
I understand James
was new to the school.

186
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,630
Yes. His parents chose to
home-school him until this year

187
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,260
because they're devout
Jehovah's Witnesses.

188
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,660
He was prepared academically, but
he had real difficulties socially.

189
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,480
Did he ever express emotion of
any kind towards Mrs. McCartney?

190
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,520
He was sent to my office a number of times,
but he never mentioned her specifically.

191
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,110
But I can tell you the boy's father had some
strong objections to Ms. McCartney's teaching.

192
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,450
He was outraged that she had assigned
the book The Color Purple to her students.

193
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,610
Thought it was pornographic.

194
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,290
All right,they're ready for you.

195
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,300
But can I just say,uh...

196
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,710
as much as we all mourn this loss no
teacher that I've spoken to believes

197
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,860
that this boy should
go to prison for life.

198
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,920
He was in the photography club for
like five minutes before he quit.

199
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,200
It seemed like he didn't talk ever.

200
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,200
He took really good photos, though.

201
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,780
I never saw him hang out with
anybody. He's kind of intense.

202
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,660
Like the way he'd stare at you.

203
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,090
He talked a bunch of
crap about Ms. McCartney.

204
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,560
Really? What did he say?

205
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,370
Kid's a freak. I mean,I
can't remember exactly,but...

206
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,870
I'm sure I heard him say
something psycho about her.

207
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:07,540
You wouldn't just be saying that because you
got suspended for hitting him in the face?

208
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,410
I was in bio lab with him.

209
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,210
You know,I don't see how he could
have done what they're saying he did.

210
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,020
It's just... well,I don't believe it.

211
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,200
I mean,I've never even
seen him get angry.

212
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,060
Why would he want to kill her anyway?

213
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,680
Are you feeling emotional in
any way right now,Jacquelin?

214
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,610
no.

215
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,150
It's okay if you are.

216
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,530
I feel fine.

217
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,550
Deputy Bonds.

218
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,590
And what did you learn in school today?

219
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,810
57 classmates and not one credible account
of antecedent aggression from James.

220
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,900
I need to see the case file and look at
the other suspects Homicide questioned.

221
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,400
But you don't think
James Cole is guilty?

222
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,340
I don't know, but if the prosecutor
wants to send a kid my daughter's age

223
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,400
to a cell block with pedophiles and serial
killers, I wouldn't mind knowing for sure.

224
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,270
Whatever you need.

225
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,940
All right.

226
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,880
Forget it. We'll find another one.

227
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,690
No. Maybe he didn't see
me. Why don't you get out.

228
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,750
Just drive.

229
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,540
You didn't see me
waiting for that space?

230
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,780
- Didn't see you.
- Really?

231
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,670
No,I did not see you.
I-I was waiting,too.

232
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,280
You must not have seen me.

233
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,590
That's fantastic. Classic gestural slip.

234
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,400
Got the slightest head nod "yes"
before you shook your head "no."

235
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,850
Look,I'm in the space.

236
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,430
And I'm not going anywhere.

237
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,040
That's true.

238
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,980
You can't block me in like that! Sir?

239
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,500
Congratulations.

240
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,890
One liar down, six and
a half billion to go.

241
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,430
The US attorney's office scheduled
the transfer hearing. We have two days.

242
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,500
I told the mayor's office we need to
examine James' antecedent behaviors,

243
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,710
so we're set to meet with his
parents and his church group.

244
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,000
How you doing today,sir?

245
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,010
I'm great.

246
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,950
Could you step out of the line,please?

247
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,650
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

248
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,710
Any reason you might be
anxious this morning,sir?

249
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,660
Only that I'll miss my flight.

250
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,970
I need you to open
your briefcase for me.

251
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,460
You know what? I'm going to check it.

252
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,340
- It's the liquids,right? -
Stop. T-3B. backup, backup T-3B.

253
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,060
Open your briefcase.

254
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,910
You're going to need to come with us.

255
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,750
Actually,you need to come with us.

256
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,780
When you leaned out of line, I could
tell you were jacked up about something.

257
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,790
That's 'cause I flashed you
a partial fear expression.

258
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,080
Whatever. Why were
you trying to play me?

259
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,670
Six years ago,Dr. Lightman left the deception
detection program he founded for the Defense Department.

260
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,550
Together we started a private firm
that works with police,corporations,

261
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,250
and almost every federal agency.

262
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,270
We'd like you to come
work for us,Ms. Torres.

263
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,270
Why?

264
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,190
You've made seven times more
arrests than the average TSA agent,

265
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:51,030
and you scored 97% on the TSA deception
diagnostic which Dr. Lightman created.

266
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,350
Have you ever had any
specialized deception training?

267
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,930
I've dated a lot of men.

268
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,370
You're one of the naturals.

269
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,060
There's in infinitesimal percentage
of the population, less than .001,

270
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,010
that tests nearly perfect
without any advanced traing.

271
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,960
We've already cleared your leaving
with the TSA field director.

272
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,460
Our office will call you later.

273
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,070
Oh,and,uh,don't forget your briefcase.

274
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,050
That's your signing bonus.

275
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,140
I just had a long conversation
with the school guidance counselor.

276
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,720
The girl whose breathing you said was
fast and shallow-- Jacquelin Mathis--

277
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,990
has had three appointments with the
school nurse in the past two weeks.

278
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,920
Guidance counselor said typically
that could be about drugs or an STD.

279
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,790
You know,gonorrhea, clap,crabs,uh...

280
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,870
Find out if Jacquelin had any connection
to James Cole outside of school.

281
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,050
- And follow up with the nurse.
- Okay.

282
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,590
Did the school principal
seem tense to you?

283
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,390
Wouldn't you be if this
happened at your school?

284
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,930
He had his left hand in his pants pocket
pressed against his leg the whole time.

285
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,000
We're not all hiding something.

286
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,270
Okay.

287
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,310
You think I'm naive just because I don't
share your twisted view of the world.

288
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,760
That and you read romance novels.

289
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,170
Yes,I do. Because they make me happy.

290
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,500
A pursuit I highly recommend to you.

291
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,040
Truth or happiness, never both.

292
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,620
What is that now?

293
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,730
Orange slushy.

294
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,910
How old are you?

295
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,110
Chairman Baldridge from the Democratic
National Committee's on the phone.

296
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,990
Some sort of crisis.

297
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,800
Politician. That's all you.

298
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,910
Charge him by the lie.
You can retire tomorrow.

299
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,390
Why isn't Dr. Lightman here?

300
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,220
Cal really wanted to make it.

301
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,410
He's a better liar than you are.

302
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,640
He's a better liar than all of us.

303
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,450
I need your help,Gillian.

304
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,750
Congressman Zeb Weil, whose career
I've spent 20 years building,

305
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,360
is about to be accused
of paying for sex.

306
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,480
A friend at thePost gave me the tip, but I
need to know the truth before the story breaks.

307
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,740
You think it could be a smear job?

308
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:59,310
I do, but allegedly,Congressman Weil frequents
some sort of high-priced escort service

309
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,960
at an underground club in Georgetown.

310
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,050
Now if that's true, it's
going to be a PR nightmare

311
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,940
because he's the new Chairman
of the House Ethics Committee.

312
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,300
That's delightful.

313
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,160
But we don't go through
people's dirty laundry.

314
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,270
So Dr. Lightman just assumes you're
a liar if you're a politician.

315
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,990
He assumes you're a liar
if you're a homo sapiens.

316
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:24,340
If these allegations are false, are you going to
stand by while an innocent man is destroyed by lies?

317
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,670
- Thanks for coming in right away.
- You're the boss.

318
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,450
I would like to sleep with you.

319
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,460
Eli Loker, Ria Torres. He's harmless.

320
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,100
Just always speaks the truth about what's
on his mind. What do you call it again?

321
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,370
Radical honesty.

322
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,840
That's it. Well,he'll get you started
on learning our facial coding system.

323
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,000
I have no chance with you. No.

324
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,260
Uh,do I have any chance with you?

325
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,950
You always tell the truth?

326
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,990
Always.

327
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,010
- How good are you in bed?
- Fair.

328
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,760
Fair is better than most.

329
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,790
I don't see why you need
to look at James' bedroom.

330
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,770
Mr. Cole,anything that gives us a
better sense of your son is helpful.

331
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,280
James took these?

332
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,600
Yes,he did.

333
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,760
We let him convert that bathroom
to a darkroom for his photography.

334
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,820
Was that a problem?

335
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,590
Well,it was taking too much time from his
responsibilities as a Witness doing God's work.

336
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,100
What did James tell
you about Ms. McCartney?

337
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,580
He thought she was a good teacher.

338
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,350
And did you?

339
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,290
James did not kill that woman.

340
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,010
He would not take part in
wrestling practice, gym class,

341
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,220
because he knows the Lord
condemns violence, even in sport.

342
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,880
If you value something, you build
a fence around it to protect it.

343
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,200
And that's what we did with James.

344
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,820
We home-schooled him as long as we could to
shield him from drugs and sex and corruption.

345
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,300
Is that why you were angry about
the material she was teaching him?

346
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,100
We are in the world,
but not of the world.

347
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,600
And we need to protect our
children from nonbelievers.

348
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,980
Is there anything you wouldn't do to
protect your son from a nonbeliever?

349
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,900
Watch yourself. I'm a man of God.

350
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:27,000
Well,I like horse racing,
Manhattans, briefs,not boxers,

351
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:32,060
all of which makes us equally
likely to lie, so I'll ask you again.

352
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,140
Get out of this house.

353
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,450
I've been doing some
research into James' family.

354
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,970
I spoke to an overseer of their church

355
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,270
who said Mr. Cole has had fights with other
churchgoers over they unholy lifestyles.

356
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,420
Some of them said he was an extremist.

357
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,710
Something going on in that family.

358
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,620
The police saw James running away from the front
door of Ms. McCartney's house after the murder.

359
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,690
Maybe he was trying to stop
his father from killing her.

360
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,630
What's your content
analysis of the mother?

361
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,460
She was definitely concealing something.

362
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,820
When I asked her about Ms.McCartney,

363
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,300
she stopped using contractions and
started referring to her as "that woman."

364
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,830
As in "I did not have sexual relations
with that woman,Ms. Lewinsky."

365
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,450
Distancing language.

366
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,350
She knew something about
her. She didn't want to say.

367
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,140
We need to look at the
polygraph test James failed.

368
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,110
I want to see what
questions he spiked on.

369
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,840
Have I mentioned that your office looks
like it belongs to a serial killer?

370
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,720
Several times.

371
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,620
PD is running background
checks on both the parents

372
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,290
and trying to confirm their
whereabouts the night of the murder.

373
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,210
As for the girl that was so
anxious-- Jacquelin Mathis,

374
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,150
no connection to James
Cole outside of school.

375
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,470
But I do know why she
might have been anxious.

376
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,560
School nurse insinuated
that Jacquelin is pregnant.

377
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,020
Pregnant.

378
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,490
Not what a father in
my shoes wants to hear.

379
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,010
I got to go.

380
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,170
I have Emily, and her
boyfriend's coming over.

381
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,450
You worry too much. You do.
You worry. You're a worrier.

382
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,190
You don't even know if they
talked about having sex.

383
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,740
He's taking her to a fancy restaurant.

384
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,630
Emily's a smart girl.
You have to trust her.

385
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,780
Her mother's a smart girl
too, and I trusted her.

386
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,360
Well,I think Roger's a loser, but
if Mom wants to be with a loser...

387
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,650
You don't have to say that for me.

388
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,620
I'm saying it 'cause he's a loser.

389
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,420
I have the utmost respect for anyone
your mother cares for, and so should you.

390
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,610
Admit it. You're thinking "what a
loser." I saw your eyes do the thing.

391
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,770
Uh,Dan's early.

392
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,670
Yeah,and about that-- I know your mother's out
of town,you've got the keys, and Dan has a car.

393
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,590
No,we're not doing this.

394
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,860
You just go let Dan in
while I finish getting ready,

395
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,540
and you better not do some covert
scientific technique to find out

396
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,390
what we're doing or not doing tonight.

397
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,290
Promise.

398
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,600
No covert science,I promise.

399
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,540
- Hi,Dan.
- Hi,Dr. Lightman.

400
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,170
Are you going to try and have
sex with my daughter tonight?

401
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,330
We appreciate your time.

402
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,880
Congressman Weil,have you ever
been to a club called Centurion?

403
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,680
Marshall,what is this really about?

404
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,550
I'm a five-term US congressman.
I'd appreciate if...

405
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,350
Answer the question,Zeb.

406
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,900
I've never heard of it. Why?

407
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,600
It's been alleged that you go
to this club on Friday nights.

408
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,320
Tell me how you spent
last Friday evening.

409
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,420
I went for a swim at
the congressional gym.

410
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,860
Then I went home to catch
up on some committee reading.

411
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,040
Go on.

412
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,590
I had dinner alone before leaving
for an event at the Smithsonian.

413
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,760
Got it. Now just tell
it to me backwards.

414
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,770
What?

415
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,130
Start at the end of the
night and work backwards.

416
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,270
Before the event at
the Smithsonian, I,uh...

417
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,400
well,as I told you, I did some reading.

418
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,260
And,uh...

419
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,440
before that,I,uh...

420
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,340
That guy's lying his ass off.

421
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,090
Yes,he is.

422
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,050
When you're lying,it's hard
to tell a story backwards,

423
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,750
because there's no real
memory of what happened.

424
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,410
Liars rehearse their stories in order.

425
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,320
They don't think to
rehearse them backwards.

426
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,340
Have you ever engaged the
services of a prostitute?

427
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,920
I am certainly not going to
dignify that with an answer.

428
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,430
And that is an expression of deep shame.

429
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,510
This guy religious?

430
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,450
That's what I don't understand.
Not religious, not married,no kids.

431
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,480
But he shows deeper shame than politicians
who've been caught cheating on their wives?

432
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,640
Yeah,being the Ethics Chairman takes a lot
of the fun out of having sex with hookers.

433
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,530
But seriously,what if he's into
something a lot more shameful--

434
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,780
smacking them around or underage girls?

435
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,170
I need to restore the expression I
had from James's polygraph up here.

436
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,630
Did you attack Susan McCartney?

437
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,870
No.

438
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,710
The same shame expression.

439
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,690
Now punch in on his eye.
I want to see his pupil.

440
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,260
They're fully dilated.

441
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,790
And it's not fear or anger.

442
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,070
You know what else makes pupils dilate.

443
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,380
Sexual arousal.

444
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,760
You think there was a sexual relationship
between James and Ms. McCartney?

445
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,820
Maybe that's what the
parents were hiding.

446
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,580
My son did not engage in
sexual activity of any kind.

447
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,250
As I told you, we're here because
we believe your son is innocent.

448
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,540
There were no signs of rape or
sexual assault in this crime.

449
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:33,730
But on his polygraph, James exhibited
intense sexual feelings for Ms. McCartney.

450
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,070
- Gerald...
- Be quiet.

451
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,330
We saw you try to conceal
your scorn for Ms. McCartney.

452
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,510
That's not just about the
books she was teaching,is it?

453
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,020
What can you tell us
about your son and her?

454
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,160
I've already told you everything.

455
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,180
Both of you and your son are lying.

456
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,780
Now,let me tell you something.

457
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,560
The only way three people can keep
a secret is if two of them are dead,

458
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,120
so why don't you wake the hell up.

459
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,100
Everything you're doing
makes perfect sense.

460
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,340
You're afraid for your son, Mrs. Cole.

461
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,650
And when we experience fear, we try
to exercise whatever control we can,

462
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,620
even if it makes things worse.

463
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,460
That's why you lied to us before.

464
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:14,050
It may help you feel better,
but it's not helping your son.

465
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,210
Because right now, the only people who
believe James is innocent are in this room.

466
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:28,910
I know that you have the courage to move
past your fear and tell us the truth.

467
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,320
Wait here.

468
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:49,090
We found these hidden in James's room

469
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,370
before the police came
and searched his things.

470
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,230
I-I know how this must look, but our
son couldn't possibly have done this.

471
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,090
Did you know James had been spying on
Ms. McCartney before you found these?

472
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,990
No.

473
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,900
You ever talk to James about sex?

474
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:20,380
I talked with him about the
urges that young men feel.

475
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,970
We-we read from Colossians together.

476
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,350
"Fornication,uncleanness,
sexual appetite is idolatry."

477
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,610
He-he knows there's no greater sin.

478
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,610
I need to see the crime scene photos.

479
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,850
You can't show these
photographs to anyone,please.

480
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,380
We need to show them to your son.

481
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,230
You took these,James.

482
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:04,650
And... I understand why.

483
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,670
Ms. McCartney didn't
make you feel anger.

484
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,980
She made you feel temptation.

485
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:18,780
She was a beautiful woman, and for the
first time in your life,you felt desire.

486
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:24,180
You took these pictures so
you could fantasize about her.

487
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:31,440
You spied on her, for
weeks,at school, at her home.

488
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,140
You took these, hiding right here behind
these trees, looking through the bay window.

489
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,700
And on the night of the murder, you
went back to her house to spy on her.

490
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,890
And this is what you saw.

491
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,640
There she was.

492
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,510
You became aroused.

493
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,690
You gave in to temptation.

494
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,900
I didn't know she was dead.

495
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,220
And... I started to have thoughts.

496
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,470
Unclean thoughts.

497
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,630
And I touched myself.

498
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,110
I swear to God I did
not know that she was...

499
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,380
that she was dead.

500
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,820
It wasn't until afterwards.

501
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,390
I was walking away, and...

502
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,110
I saw the blood.

503
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,870
And I ran around to the front.

504
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:00,260
And I was gonna call 911,
but the police came and...

505
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,160
I ran. I just ran.

506
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,830
What was I supposed to do?

507
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,020
the truth! I didn't kill her!

508
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,210
I told what I did!

509
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,110
What was that?

510
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,990
You spoon-fed him a good defense,and
he's not stupid. He went with it.

511
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,860
But there's, uh,still a
preponderance of evidence against him.

512
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,450
More than enough for a grand jury.

513
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,850
James was telling the truth.

514
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,530
Oh,he lied when he said he'd never
been to Ms.McCartney's house before,

515
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,370
and these photographs go a long
way toward proving premeditation.

516
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,700
You aren't gonna
reconsider other suspects?

517
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,870
He was stalking the
victim; he fled the scene;

518
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,730
and he failed a polygraph
the night of the murder.

519
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,410
All for the same reason: sexual guilt.

520
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,680
The polygraph only tells you
if someone is feeling guilty.

521
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,570
It doesn't tell you what
they're feeling guilty about.

522
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,000
The guilt James felt had
nothing to do with the murder.

523
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,940
Look,you want to ignore
the evidence,fine.

524
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,320
Look,I heard how things ended
for you over at the Pentagon.

525
00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:00,940
And unless you want the entire Justice Department
picking apart every case you work for us,too,

526
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,770
you'll leave this one alone.

527
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,870
There she is.

528
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,950
Hey,honey.

529
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,520
Hey,Cal. Sorry I'm late.

530
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,290
Had a bunch of work I had
to finish before leaving.

531
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,150
Why don't you come to dinner with
us, clear your head for an hour.

532
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,360
It's gonna be a late night.

533
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,120
Nah,I'm good. You go ahead.

534
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,710
Night.

535
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,210
Her husband just lied to her.

536
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,990
He was lying when he said
he got held up with work.

537
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,500
Don't you have work to do?

538
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,760
You're not gonna tell her he's lying?

539
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,380
How we doing on the congressman
and the sex club thing?

540
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,750
Okay.

541
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,000
Well,Congressman Weil still
won't admit to anything,

542
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,160
so I'm gonna go to the club tonight and see if I can
find out what he did there that he's so ashamed of.

543
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,800
Girl Weil's been seeing goes by Melissa,
and he sees her Friday night without fail.

544
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,250
Classy,huh?

545
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,810
Well,we all pay for
sex one way or another.

546
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,510
At least hookers are
honest about the price.

547
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,020
Bet your boyfriend's pretty happy
this is his birthday present.

548
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,390
So,uh,how do you like
this place,Melissa?

549
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,820
It's great. Always a party.

550
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,010
You really hate it,huh?

551
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,550
Just for now. You know...

552
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,820
it sucks being broke, and I can make a lot
more money doing this than I did dancing.

553
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,930
So are most of your clients,
uh,regulars or one-offs?

554
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,270
Mostly,um,regulars,actually.

555
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,350
Maybe Julian and I could,um...
That's my boyfriend.

556
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,710
Maybe we'll become one of your regulars.

557
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,170
Are you free next Friday night?

558
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:58,960
No Fridays. I,uh,I have,um,
a regular on Fridays.

559
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,540
I don't think the congressman
was doing anything nasty to her.

560
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:07,720
She had this little smile about
her Friday nights with him,

561
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,490
like,like she has real
feelings for the guy.

562
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,930
Was there wrinkling around
her eyes when she smiled?

563
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,180
Yeah,there was.

564
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,990
Then it was real. In a fake
smile, there's no eye wrinkling.

565
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,860
Excuse me. Turn on the news.

566
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,560
There's much to be learned still,

567
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:31,100
but House Ethics Chairman Zeb Weil
reportedly spent more than $82,000

568
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,990
on a single escort
over a matter of months.

569
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,780
He exited his congressional
offices moments ago.

570
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,870
Is it true that...

571
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,830
Congressman Weil,how long
has this been going on?

572
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,270
Look at his disgust.

573
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,350
Yeah,but he's not
disgusted with himself.

574
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,660
It's like he's disgusted with
the idea of having sex with her.

575
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,550
Well,maybe they weren't having sex.

576
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,420
Why would a guy spend $82,000 on
an escort he's not having sex with?

577
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,910
Yes,of course. No,I understand.

578
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,120
Defense attorney says James has
had an acute psychological collapse.

579
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,240
He won't eat,sleep, or talk to anyone.

580
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,600
He's on suicide watch.

581
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,990
Take a look at these.

582
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,050
Her clothes are identical
to the crime scene photos.

583
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,200
James took those the day of the
murder, and you can tell it's late,

584
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,130
probably just a couple of
hours before she was killed.

585
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,430
- Look at that hand.
- What?

586
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,400
It's tensed.

587
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,850
Turned upwards at her side like this.

588
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,140
Is that a gestural emblem?

589
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,690
Yeah. When we make it
consciously... the meaning's clear.

590
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,730
Stop. She was having an argument.

591
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,400
Yeah. Had to be pretty
disturbing to produce that emblem.

592
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:53,600
So whoever was in that car had a fight
with her just hours before she was murdered.

593
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:57,870
Body language tells the
truth even from the grave.

594
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,450
Principal Castle.
Thank you for seeing us.

595
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,760
Please. Anything to help.

596
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:12,070
Do you know who at school might have had an
argument with Ms. McCartney the day she was murdered?

597
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,390
I have no idea. What? Do you
think anotherstudent was involved?

598
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,480
Possibly. We need to
know who drives this car.

599
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,240
Sure. I can try to see if it's
registered for school parking.

600
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,490
- Is thatyourcar?
- No,it's not.

601
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,340
Were you romantically
involved with Susan McCartney?

602
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,960
Of course not. What are you suggesting?

603
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,280
Oh,I'm... I'm... I'm
sorry. I really am. I...

604
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:43,050
we have toconsider everything,and
I'm sorry if I've offended you.

605
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,120
Really,I'm... I'm
very sorry. Very sorry.

606
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,630
If I... if I offended
you... I-I'm sorry.

607
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,490
Ihaveoffended you, and
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

608
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,240
It's not a good
thing,really. I apologize.

609
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,340
What's with the Rainman routine?

610
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,990
You want to know how scared he was after
you showed him the photo of the car?

611
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,950
How scared?

612
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,440
In skin temperature, about ten degrees
scared, which is to say, very scared.

613
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,980
His hand was colder the
second time you shook it.

614
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,180
Yeah,he recognized that
car. Intense fear kicked in.

615
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,290
It's a classic physiological
flight response.

616
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,050
Blood flows from the extremities
to the legs so you're ready to run.

617
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,930
Your hands get cold first.

618
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,940
The car in question does not
belongto the principal or his wife.

619
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,100
Are you sure?

620
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,950
Yeah. Deputy bonds had records
runboth of their registrations.

621
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,550
So principal castlerecognized
the car, but it's not his.

622
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,240
Well, find out whose it is.

623
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,140
Have them run the registration of
every student and teacherat the school.

624
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,180
The dnc chairman's going ahead with
the press conferencethis afternoon,

625
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,340
but I think I knowwhat congressman weil was
doing at the sex cluband why he was so ashamed.

626
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,600
Take a look. He filed
this onlinetwo years ago.

627
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,510
Call me the secondyou hear
about the car. Come on.

628
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,180
Thank you.

629
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,830
You haven't done
enoughmuckraking for one day?

630
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:10,160
Sir, we don't think you weredoing
anything sexual at that club

631
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,890
because I believethis escort,
melissa, who you paidfor time with...

632
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
what about her?

633
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,450
She's your daughter.

634
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,800
I've already admittedwhat I did.

635
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,720
I'm tenderingmy resignation today.

636
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:29,540
This is the profileyou registered
in may of '06 at adopt connect,

637
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,600
a registry forbirth parents
trying to reconnectwith an adoptee.

638
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:36,560
The adopted name you listedwas
brenda melissa johnson.

639
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,050
The date of birth would
makeher melissa's age now.

640
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,400
I was a niorin college at ua

641
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:57,710
and I was seeing a young womanwho was a
freshman at the woman's collegein marion.

642
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,780
She gotpregnant.

643
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,230
We agreed to aclosed adoption.

644
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,680
We both moved on.

645
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:09,140
But I never stoppedthinking about it.

646
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,060
A couple of years ago,I
registered to be found.

647
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,590
Nothing came of it.

648
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,020
So I hireda private investigator.

649
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,760
Does melissa... brenda...
know you're her father?

650
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,400
No.

651
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:31,240
I didn't want to force herto confront
an answer she clearly wasn't looki for,

652
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:37,200
but when I found outshe was working at that
club, I had to do something,so I went...

653
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,750
started getting to know
her. Gave her money.

654
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,950
Tried to get her to quit.

655
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,990
We can tell the chairmanand the press.

656
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,880
Please. No.

657
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,430
No?

658
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:51,160
I am close to getting
brendato make a change.

659
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,990
If the press finds outwho she really is,

660
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:01,150
she will spendthe rest of her life being
known as the congressman's whore daughter.

661
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,260
I've already betrayed her once.

662
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,340
I won't do it again.

663
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,710
The car belongsto jacquelin mathis, the
girl the school nursethought was pregnant.

664
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,380
Deputy bond had homicide bring her in.

665
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,370
Second district stationright now.

666
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,400
Why would I know what
happened to miss mccartney?

667
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,680
- No, you tell me.
- Why would I know?

668
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,980
Why would I know?

669
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:46,360
Eyebrows go up,like yours, the person knows
the answerto the question they're asking.

670
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:50,240
But I don'T. I don'T...
I don't feel well.

671
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,020
Morning sickness.

672
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:55,530
You argued withms. Mccartney e
afternoon thatshe was murdered.

673
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,660
No, I didn'T. You don't know
whatyou're talking about.

674
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,000
I know when you're lying.

675
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,430
- I'm not lying.
- I know why youfought with her.

676
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,560
I didn'T.

677
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,880
Is this your car?

678
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,720
I didn't kill miss mccartney.

679
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,200
Now, that's e trH.

680
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,750
I know you didn'T. But you know who did.

681
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,330
So tell meabout the argument.

682
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,130
I don't have anything to say.

683
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:28,170
You know, james coleis innocent.

684
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,210
He's going to go to prisonfor
the rest of his life.

685
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,830
Are you really gonnalet that happen?

686
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,830
I mean, maybe youcouldn't stop
the murder, but you can stop this.

687
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,490
You have to stop this.

688
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,560
I can'T.

689
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,480
Jacquelin.

690
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,940
I guess it doesn't matteranymore.

691
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:13,770
You're gonna haveto live with this because
james cole just hangedhimself in his jl cell.

692
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,270
I didn't think that
anythingwould happen to james.

693
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,720
Because he's a minor.

694
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,920
I didn't knowth he was
gonna... oh, my god.

695
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:40,400
Why did principal
castle recognize your car

696
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,150
when I showed himthe photograph?

697
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,290
You're involvedwith him, aren't you?

698
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,450
Castle took advantage of you.

699
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:56,050
He didn't take advantage of me.

700
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,000
We're in love. He loves me.

701
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,290
You're pregnant withhis
baby, aren't you?

702
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:10,370
He was going to leave his
wifeto be with me. He told me.

703
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:17,750
When miss mccartney saw us, parked
in my car,that was at school,

704
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,280
we didn't, we didn't
know,but she saw us.

705
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,860
Then later that day she came upto me
in the parking lot freaking out, like,

706
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,170
'cause shehad to be all
worried about me when...

707
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,650
I mean, I was the onewho went after him.

708
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,980
And then you arguedabout turning him in.

709
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,880
I begged her not to. He
hadn't done anything wrong.

710
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:39,190
She didn't listen.

711
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,390
She said she was gonnaturn him in. So...

712
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,470
I told him.

713
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:49,340
You know, you know, he saidthat everything
would be okay, that he would talk to her.

714
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:54,590
God... I didn't knowhe
was gonna kill her.

715
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,710
I didn't know.

716
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:05,370
you get the e-mail fromthe
us attorney's office?

717
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,750
No.

718
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,620
Principal castle confessedin
exchange for 30 years.

719
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,000
I thought the truthwould set you free.

720
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:17,030
Speaking of which, do you still
have that notethat I brought you?

721
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,320
I want it for my office.

722
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:21,980
You really are a pack rat.

723
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,940
<i>BRING THIS TO ME ******</i>

724
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,970
You could have just
told mewhat this was for.

725
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,510
No, you're a terrible liar.

726
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:34,240
Normal people thinkthat's a good thing.

727
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,200
You saying I'm not normal?

728
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,660
Good night. Go home.

729
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,000
Dsc chairman's on the phone. What
are we gonna sayabout the congressman?

730
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,810
Nothing.

731
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,740
So we're just gonna let
himthrow away his career?

732
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,380
We're basically gonna lie?

733
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,900
Not basically.

734
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:03,490
So you lie to your partnerabout her husband
and you lie to the peoplewho hired us.

735
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,460
What am I supposedto believe about you?

736
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,090
You believe whatever you
want. Everyone else does.

737
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,890
I'm glad your spending
theholidays with your family.

738
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,300
Your folks are great.

739
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,690
I'm saying I didn't
evenwant this promotion.

740
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,510
I feel terrible they fired him.

741
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:34,920
I love you. I'm gonna leave
my wife. I just need more time.
