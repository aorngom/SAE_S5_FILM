2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
THE FOLLOWING STORY IS FICTIONAL AND DOES
NOT DEPICT ANY ACTUAL PERSON OR EVENT.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Looks like
 <i>National Geographic</i>

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,900
exploded on your desk.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,900
What expression do you see?

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,000
- Quick. Quick. Quick. Quick.
- Uh, uh, disgust.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,800
Yep.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,400
Expression looks
the same on a...

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,100
Papua elder or...

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,800
or a Hollywood starlet.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,800
Look at you in New Guinea.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
You reliving your
dissertation glory days?

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,100
What's this?

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,600
That's a koteka.

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,000
That's hand-carved, very rare.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,600
What do they use it for, soup?

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,800
Genital presentation.

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,100
If the man was trying
to impress a woman

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,200
he'd serve himself up on that,

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,300
so to speak.

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,700
Dr. Lightman,

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,700
Special Agent
Dardis is here

23
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,000
from the FBI.

24
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,700
- And I have your daughter on line two.
- Thanks, Heidi.

25
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,500
Hello, love.

26
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,100
How's it going at your mum's?

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,700
Okay, I guess.
I mean, you know how Mom is.

28
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,400
She needs to know everything
I'm doing every second.

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
Bloody intrusive, isn't it.

30
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,300
What are you doing
this very second?

31
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,400
Dad.

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,500
Well, you still need
a lift later?

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,200
Uh, no, um, actually
I've got a big

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,700
chem test on Friday.

35
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,000
I... I'm gonna sleep over
at Katie's house.

36
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,300
You sure about that?

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,500
Yeah.

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,400
All right, love you.

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,500
Love you, too.

40
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,700
You heard that, right?

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,400
Word repetition
and her vocal pitch went up

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,100
when she was talking
about staying Katie's.

43
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,300
I'm sure it was nothing.

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,600
Well, what did you hear then?

45
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,000
I heard a typical
teenager in the process

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,900
of forming her self-identity.

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,600
That's psychobabble, that is.

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,700
She was lying.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,100
Emily needs to have
her own secrets.

50
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,700
That's not the same thing
as lying.

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,200
Danielle Stark,
17 years old,

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,100
senior at Strivers
Magnet School.

53
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,700
She went missing a week ago.

54
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,900
Her body was found a day later

55
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,900
dumped in Rock
Creek Park.

56
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,800
She died from a
blow to the head.

57
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
Well, you're not here
because of the girl, right?

58
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,600
No, her mother

59
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,200
is a federal judge
on the DC circuit court.

60
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,300
Judge Stark's
been short-listed

61
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,600
as a possible
Supreme Court nominee.
JUDGE'S DAUGHTER MURDERED

62
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,000
But we're treating this
case just like any other.

63
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, is there any,
uh, physical evidence?

64
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,500
Unfortunately, it
rained that night.

65
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,700
Best we can do is
determine that the blow came from the front,

66
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,900
no defensive wounds, indicating
Danielle likely knew her killer.

67
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,600
The problem is with the mother.

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,800
She says that

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,300
she was alone in her chambers,
and no one can verify it.

70
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,900
So you've got a suspect, right?

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,300
I mean,

72
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,000
that's great, right,
since you're treating

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,800
this case just like any other.

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
As you can imagine,
we have to proceed

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,100
carefully before we start
pointing fingers

76
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,700
at a presidential appointee.

77
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,000
But if she's
lying,

78
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,400
we need to know.

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,800
And if she's not?

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,700
Then we need to know who is.

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Nice place.

82
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,900
Bit of a mausoleum.

83
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,600
Dr. Lightman, Ria Torres,

84
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,100
this is Danielle's mother,
Judge Kathleen Stark.

85
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,600
Agent Dardis tells me

86
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,300
that you may be able to help
catch the person who did this.

87
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
YEAH.

88
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,900
What is that for?

89
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
We just don't want to miss
anything that could help.

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,900
Mmm.

91
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,500
So, what can you tell
us about Danielle?

92
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,100
Well,

93
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,200
I've already told the FBI
everything.

94
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,700
So what more do you want
to know?

95
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,300
Um, tell us
about, uh,

96
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,300
your happiest
moment together.

97
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,400
A family trip,
a birthday party?

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,800
I don't understand
the purpose of this.

99
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,200
Okay, um,

100
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,500
how did you feel when you
found out she was dead?

101
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,600
I, uh...

102
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,100
I really can't talk about it.

103
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,400
It was the worst day of my life.

104
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Do you have children,
Dr. Lightman?

105
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,100
Yeah, I have a... a daughter.

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,300
She's a little younger
than Danielle was.

107
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,300
Then it shouldn't be hard
for you to imagine how I felt.

108
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,000
Was Danielle having
any trouble at home?

109
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,100
Of course not.

110
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,200
She was everything

111
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,100
you could hope for
in a daughter.

112
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,900
She was a straight-A
student,

113
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,000
top of her class.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,900
She was so special.

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,400
Please find out
who did this to her.

116
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
<i>It's pretty strange the way</i>
 <i>she talked about her daughter.</i>

117
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,400
"Straight-A student.

118
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
Top of her class."

119
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,200
Who cares about that
after they lose their child?

120
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,900
Someone who's obsessed
with image.

121
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,200
Perfect house, perfect kid.

122
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,500
Perfect kids don't
usually get murdered

123
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,600
by someone
they know.

124
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,200
Yeah, well, Danielle
wasn't so perfect.

125
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,900
Well, it's not Danielle
I'm concerned with.

126
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,000
She was always talking

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,200
about how important
her friends were to her.

128
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,500
You know, she was an only child

129
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,900
and, uh...

130
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,200
I think she used them
to substitute.

131
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,800
I've listened
to a lot

132
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,900
of grieving mothers,
and if she's faking it,

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,700
she's one of the
best I've seen.

134
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,400
She's one of the best
you've ever heard.

135
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,000
Now, this was
recorded

136
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,900
in 1994, day after Susan Smith's

137
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,700
two children
disappeared.

138
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,100
I love 'em.

139
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,000
I-I...

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,700
I just can't express enough.

141
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,800
I-I have been to the Lord
in prayers every day.

142
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,300
SOUNDS GRIEF STRICKEN, RIGHT?

143
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,000
It just seems so unfair

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,600
that somebody could take such
two beautiful children...

145
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,700
Right.

146
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,500
She told police
that she'd been carjacked.

147
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,300
But later, she admitted
to the police that

148
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,900
she'd strapped her two children

149
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,900
into their car seats

150
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,500
and rolled them into the lake.

151
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,100
Yeah, now watch it
with the sound off.

152
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:26,600
Well,

153
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,300
her face doesn't match the grief
of her words.

154
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,600
Right, there's no involvement

155
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,400
in the forehead,
nothing around the eyes.

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,200
She could be reading
from a grocery list.

157
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,900
Now watch
the judge again.

158
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,300
They look exactly
the same.

159
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
The judge is showing nothing.

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,900
No, the judge is showing
everything.

175
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,700
Judge Stark has asked
for a brief mourning period,

176
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,100
but she'll be available after
tomorrow's memorial service.

177
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,200
Yeah, we need
to be there.

178

We won't be able
to talk to her.

to watch.

181
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,700
- You coming to the funeral?
- I can't.

182
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,600
I'm meeting with
the Deputy Chief of NASA.

183
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,200
One of their experimental
jets crashed

184
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,400
and they think the pilot's lying about
what happened.

185
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Oh, that's not surprising

186
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,200
since the whole space
program is based on lies.

187
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,000
Some of their
top scientists

188
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,200
were Nazis recruited
after the war.

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,500
They gave the world Tang.

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,500
Uh, Dr. Lightman?

191
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
It's Emily.

192
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,400
Uh, apparently they tried
to bring her to your house

193
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,500
first, but...

194
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,200
Hey, Dad.

195
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:10,800
 <i>It wasn't</i>

196
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,200
even a party really.

197
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,800
It was just a couple
of friends.

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,500
Cops said there were
more than a hundred kids

199
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,200
at your mum's house
while she was away.

200
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,100
So you lied to me about
staying over at Katie's.

201
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,800
I already said
I was sorry.

202
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,400
- How many more times can I say it?
- As many times AS YOU WANT.

203
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,900
Obviously I can't trust you to be on your own 
when your mum's away,

204
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,600
so you're coming here every day
after school till she gets back.

205
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
No! What am I going to do?

206
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,300
You're going to
organize this room.

207
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,200
It...

208
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,100
- By myself?
- Nope.

209
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
Loker's going
to babysit.

210
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,800
Hey, Emily.

211
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,400
Long time no see.

212
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,600
Hey, you look
terrible.

213
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,500
Awful.

214
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,800
Like Gene Simmons when
it's really, really humid.

215
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,900
All right.

216
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,300
You got any gum?

217
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,200
- What?
- Gum.

218
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,000
Chewing gum.
Got any gum?

219
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,600
Uh, yeah, yeah.

220
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,500
- Thank you...
- You get anything off her?

221
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, her tears are real.

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,300
I still didn't see
any sadness on her forehead.

223
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,300
Okay, that was
disgusting.

224
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,200
Just keep your eye
on the judge.

225
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,900
- Oh, that was interesting.
- Okay,

226
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,400
you want to tell me
what that was about?

227
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Still no action in the forehead,

228
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,300
or around the eyes,
even though she's startled.

229
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
Okay.

230
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,100
Most definitely
hiding something.

231
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,300
Her age.

232
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,700
She's using Botox.

233
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,600
No wonder I couldn't
pick anything up.

234
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,700
It paralyzes
the facial muscles.

235
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,900
Tears were real,

236
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,500
and her forehead would show
sadness if it could.

237
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,200
Yeah, but she
still doesn't

238
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
have an alibi for the night
of the murder.

239
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,300
Chances are,
any mother

240
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,500
who killed her daughter
would display shame

241
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,600
unless she was
a sociopath.

242
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,800
If the mother's not lying,
where does that leave us?

243
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,600
Looking for someone else.

244
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,900
FBI says they think that
Danielle knew her killer.

245
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,000
It's possible
that person's here.

246
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,800
It's pretty risky to show up
at the victim's memorial.

247
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,400
It'd be suspicious not to,

248
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,400
especially if they were close.

249
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,400
You're looking at the X-48,
or what's left of it.

250
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,800
I didn't realize NASA
still did test flights.

251
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
Shuttle program's
coming to a close.

252
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,300
We're looking
for the next generation.

253
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,900
This was supposed to be it.

254
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,700
Now it's $250 million
worth of scrap metal.

255
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,400
Tell me about the pilot.

256
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,800
Commander David Markov.

257
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,200
He's had
an exemplary career.

258
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,700
Navy pilot,
flight instructor.

259
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,000
There's nothing on his record
to suggest he would have

260
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,700
crashed the plane
intentionally.

261
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,000
Then what makes you
think he did?

262
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,800
Flight telemetry indicated
no systems malfunction.

263
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,400
All of a sudden, Markov went
full throttle, flaps down.

264
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,300
He ejected just before
he dove the plane

265
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,700
straight into the ground.

266
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,800
I don't believe
he was just

267
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
disoriented like he's claiming.

268
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,700
Did he have some sort
of issue with NASA?

269
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,400
No.

270
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
But we have to consider
Markov's father.

271
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
He was a rocket engineer

272
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,500
with the old Soviet
space agency, defected in '72.

273
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,800
The Russians are developing
their own scramjet technology.

274
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,400
Russian spies?

275
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,700
Oh, what's next?

276
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,100
Duran Duran and
parachute pants?

277
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,800
'Cause I dug the '80's.

278
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,300
It's what we've got.

279
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
Commander Markov
won't admit anything.

280
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,100
He's suspended
pending the outcome

281
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,300
of your investigation.

282
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,300
 <i>I was at Angels Ten,</i>
 <i>Zone Five afterburners,</i>

283
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,000
CAVU, and...

284
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,200
I just lost the bubble.

285
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,200
Oh, wow, that is so cool.

286
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,200
But I have no idea
what you just said.

287
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,300
Sorry, um...

288
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,300
I was at a cruising altitude
of 10,000 feet--

289
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,900
actually 10,500--

290
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,600
going top speed.

291
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,400
I don't know
what happened.

292
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,800
I had good weather,
unlimited visibility.

293
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,100
After that it just
all went fuzzy.

294
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,600
- You blacked out?
- No, ma'am,

295
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,500
I was fully conscious, but...

296
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,300
I got disoriented,
lost track of time.

297
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,100
Next thing I knew,

298
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,200
the aircraft was
pointed at the ground.

299
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,600
I managed to get to the
ejection handles and punch out.

300
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,900
That's how I ended up
with this.

301
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,700
Commander Markov, your father
came to this country in 1972?

302
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,000
He defected from the USSR.

303
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,700
You think I crashed
the X-48 on purpose?

304
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Did you?

305
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
I love this country, Dr. Foster.

306
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,000
I'd give my life for it.

307
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,100
That's a nice deflection.

308
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,600
That was a non-answer.

309
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,800
You want to try it again?

310
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
I wanted to be

311
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,300
an astronaut
since I was eight years old.

312
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,300
And I trained for the
space program every day

313
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,300
knowing that I only had a one
in 400 chance of getting in.

314
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,500
I did not intentionally crash
the X-48.

315
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,800
Danielle was

316
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,100
my best friend in the world.

317
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,300
I'm gonna miss her so much.

318
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,300
I'll never forget her laugh.

319
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,700
She had the greatest laugh.

320
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,800
She was one of my best friends.

321
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Danielle loved high school,

322
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,500
but she was also excited
about the future.

323
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,300
We were even gonna apply
to Princeton together.

324
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,700
Now I'm not even sure
if I want to go.

325
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,900
But I owe it to Danielle

326
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,800
to follow my dreams.

327
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,400
Well, she sure had
a lot of best friends.

328
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,200
Yeah.

329
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,100
Foster did a study once--

330
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,700
popularity and
lies in schools.

331
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,600
You know what she found?

332
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,000
There's a connection?

333
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,200
Yeah, the more popular the
kid, the better the liar.

334
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,200
Which makes me wonder
why the queen bee

335
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,300
showed asymmetrical
sadness when she was

336
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,900
talking about
her dead friend.

337
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,700
Uh, "When a person's
facial expression

338
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,600
"is not symmetrical
on both sides of the face,

339
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,200
"it is likely
that they are

340
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,700
pretending to
feel the emotion."

341
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,400
From your article in the <i>Journal</i>
 <i>for Behavioral Science,</i> 2001.

342
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,900
Sucking up is really not
your strong suit, is it?

343
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,700
That was a good speech.

344
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,400
Um, thanks.

345
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
But you didn't mean
a word of it, did you?

346
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,800
What? Who are you?

347
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
I'm Dr. Lightman.

348
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,900
We're helping the FBI
with their investigation.

349
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,600
What kind of doctor are you?

350
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,500
I study people's lies,
like the one you told in there

351
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,700
about being
Danielle's best friend.

352
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,100
We were best friends.

353
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,600
Then why were you faking
being sad then?

354
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,400
I wasn't. I was just shocked,
like everybody else.

355
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,800
You pluck your eyebrows?

356
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,600
- What?
- Did you pluck your eyebrows

357
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
before you came here so they'd
be perfect just like that?

358
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,800
Because signs of lying
become particularly

359
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,200
visible in the brows
when they've been thinned.

360
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,700
You weren't shocked at all about
Danielle's death, were you?

361
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,900
Look, Danielle was into
some pretty bad stuff.

362
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,500
W-Was she using?

363
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,300
What was she on?

364
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,300
I don't know.

365
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,600
Um, I heard
she was scoring

366
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,700
from some burnout
on the school paper.

367
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,000
This loser
basically just...

368
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,300
Riley?

369
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,000
You ready to go?

370
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
Yeah.

371
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,700
Okay, please don't tell my dad
that I talked to you guys, okay?

372
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,300
He's on the board of
trustees at my school,

373
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,600
and he'll freak.

374
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,100
You never told me about
the eyebrow plucking thing.

375
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,400
Where have you
written about that?

376
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,700
- Nowhere.
- Why not?

377
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,300
'Cause it's complete crap.

378
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,100
I can assure you
we have no drug problem

379
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,000
at Strivers Magnet School.

380
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,500
We have a strict honor code.

381
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,700
One infraction and you're out.

382
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,900
And family money can't
buy you back in?

383
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,600
Well, this is a
public school.

384
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,600
??? yadmissions policy,

385
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,400
a wait list.

386
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,300
These students,
they want to be here,

387
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,800
and they know
that we don't tolerate

388
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,300
violations of the code.

389
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,400
One of your students
was murdered.

390
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,500
Another one sold drugs to her.

391
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,700
You don't think
there's a connection?

392
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,300
What can we do to help?

393
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,400
I want you to announce
a mandatory locker search 

394
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,100
for all the students that were
in Danielle's journalism class.

395
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,200
Okay.

396
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,500
Well, that may take some time

397
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,200
to coordinate
with our school security.

398
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,800
No, no, no, I don't want you
to actually search them.

399
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,300
I just want you to announce it.

400
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,200
In an effort to cooperate

401
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,500
with the FBI's investigation,

402
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,100
we will be searching the lockers
of every student

403
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,200
in Ms. Fife's journalism class.

404
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,300
I don't mean to
speak out of turn,

405
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,500
but the Fourth Amendment
protects these kids

406
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,600
against unreasonable
search and seizure.

407
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,300
That's true.

408
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,100
Absolutely true.

409
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,000
Uh, truth is,

410
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,200
I only want to talk
to one of you.

411
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,700
Just one of you.

412
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,900
The one everyone's
afraid to look at.

413
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,700
I was at a cruising
altitude of 10,000 feet--

414
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,700
actually 10,500.

415
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
So, Captain Markov
admitted a lack of memory

416
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,000
about certain details.

417
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
He also used
spontaneous corrections:

418
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,100
10,500 instead of 10,000 feet.

419
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
So, he's lying?

420
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,000
No, those
are all signs

421
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,300
of telling the truth.

422
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,800
Well, our doctors examined
him after the crash.

423
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,400
Medically, he
checks out fine.

424
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,500
There's another possibility.

425
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,700
It's called
a hysterical blackout.

426
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,300
It sometimes happens

427
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,500
just before someone tries
to take their own life.

428
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,900
You think he could have been
trying to commit suicide?

429
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,400
And what, changed his mind at
the last second and ejected?

430
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,500
It's a possibility,

431
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,300
but I'll need to assess
his psychological state

432
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,600
prior to the crash.

433
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,600
Do you have any
old videotape of him?

434
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,800
We're the federal government.

435
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,700
We record everything.

436
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,100
Hey, have you seen these?

437
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,600
Oh, those are...

438
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah, those were probably
taken in the '80s.

439
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,700
Your dad was doing
research in Morocco

440
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,400
proving his theory
on the universality of emotion.

441
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,700
Research?
Are you kidding?

442
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,000
He's baked.

443
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,400
Oh, yeah,
he's completely baked.

444
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,900
Ugh, he's such a hypocrite.

445
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,600
Like getting mad at me
for throwing a party.

446
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,500
I mean, look at him.

447
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,000
Well, I think he's, um,
I think he's just scared.

448
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,300
Uh, no...

449
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,000
no, I'm thinking wasted.

450
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,200
No, I mean,
he's scared right now.

451
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,300
About you.

452
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,300
Why would he be scared about me?

453
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Well, you're a
15-year-old girl.

454
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,200
Statistically speaking,
you're at the prime age

455
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,500
for abusing alcohol,

456
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,900
experimenting with drugs,

457
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,300
contracting a sexually
transmitted disease.

458
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,600
Wow.

459
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,100
You really know how to take
all the fun out of rebelling.

460
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,100
Look on the bright side.

461
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,000
You're way more likely
to die in a car crash

462
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,100
with one of your friends
than any of those things.

463
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,500
Control, this is Zulu 7.

464
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,200
We are level and steady.

465
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,500
We have ignition.

466
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,100
Execute roll program.

467
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,700
Going through Mach 1...

468
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,000
Mach 2...

469
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,700
Is there something wrong
with these speakers?

470
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,200
I can barely hear him.

471
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,700
No, it's not the equipment.

472
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,200
It's the man.

473
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,400
Slow, soft speech points to
extreme sadness and anxiety.

474
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,300
He doesn't sound like the
same person we interviewed.

475
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,000
You still thinking suicide?

476
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,500
I was but then I saw this

477
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,500
from four weeks ago.

478
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,300
Commencing scramjet simulation.

479
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,000
Let her fly, boys!

480
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,200
Kick the tires
and light the fires!

481
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
We have ignition.

482
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,400
Oh, yeah!

483
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,000
On all the tapes

484
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,900
from before a month ago,
Markov's mood is depressed.

485
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,900
But on all the tapes in the last
few weeks, he's like this.

486
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,400
He appears
confident, relaxed,

487
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,500
happy.

488
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,900
Something changed for him.

489
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,200
Go ahead, call
my parents.

490
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,400
I don't have to
tell you anything,

491
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,100
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

492
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,100
Really?

493
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,400
My dad's a lawyer.

494
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,600
I know my rights.

495
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,400
Well, you're telling
the truth about that.

496
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,200
I think dad
probably is a lawyer.

497
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,300
Though I don't think
he's the kind

498
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,400
that's gonna help you out
with a criminal case.

499
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,500
I'm thinking...

500
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,700
bankruptcy?

501
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,900
Real estate?

502
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,100
Tax law?

503
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,700
Oh, there it is.

504
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,800
Tax law.

505
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
You don't know anything.

506
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,800
We know the FBI's
going to charge this

507
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,600
as a federal drug crime.

508
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,500
Five year minimum.

509
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,300
Unless we try to help you out.

510
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,800
Did you sell drugs
to Danielle Stark?

511
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,300
Yeah, but I-I didn't kill her.

512
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,700
I mean, I didn't even sell her
any hard stuff.

513
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,400
All she wanted was MPH.

514
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
MPH?

515
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,700
That's used to treat
attention deficit disorder.

516
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,500
Uh, how do you get high
off that?

517
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,600
You don't.

518
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,000
It helps you focus,

519
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,200
cram for tests,
pull all-nighters.

520
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,000
Half the kids
on honor roll are taking it.

521
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
They're taking ADD drugs
to help them study?

522
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,300
- Well, I mean...
- Dr. Lightman?

523
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,100
Can I have a word, please?

524
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,300
I'm afraid this is
highly inappropriate.

525
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,400
Well, you're definitely afraid.

526
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,300
No one wants to find the person
who did this more than we do.

527
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,900
The Board has offered
a sizeable reward

528
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,700
for any information
leading to an arrest.

529
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,000
You've got kids here taking
drugs to compete academically.

530
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,200
Don't you think
that may have had something

531
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,400
to do with Danielle's death?

532
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
No, I don't.

533
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,800
Of course not.

534
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,300
You know...
you're probably right.

535
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,100
I think we're finished here.
Thanks.

536
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,600
Whoa. Whoa. That's it?
We're leaving?

537
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,400
Well, you can't
get the right answers

538
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,100
if you haven't got
the right questions.

539
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,900
Headmistress-- definitely
hiding something.

540
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,600
I thought she didn't know
about the drugs.

541
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah. Well, you brought
up academic competition,

542
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,100
she started caressing
her own hand.

543
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,100
"A self-comforting
gesture.

544
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,700
"Trying to reassure yourself

545
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,200
when you don't really believe
what you're saying."

546
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,300
That one's real.

547
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,000
Thanks for the tip.

548
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,800
Ms. Torres, I thought we were
clear about your involvement.

549
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,100
I'm not here to talk
to any of your students.

550
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,000
- Uh, I came to congratulate you.
- For what?

551
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,100
Well, I was looking at
your academic rankings

552
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,900
for Strivers over
the past decade.

553
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,900
After you became
headmistress three years ago,

554
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,400
test scores shot up,

555
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,800
your national ranking
went through the roof.

556
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,800
I'm wondering how
you pulled that off.

557
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,200
Well, it wasn't hard.

558
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,700
All I did was give our students
the proper motivation.

559
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
What does that mean?

560
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Well, I restricted the number
of Ivy League recommendations

561
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,800
to the top kids
in each graduating class.

562
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,400
So you've created
a reward system

563
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
that feeds into their fears.

564
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,300
If they're not on track

565
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,200
by the time they're 17,
it's too late?

566
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Well, we give our best students
the best chance at success.

567
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,700
Uh-huh.

568
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,500
I need to see Danielle's
academic records

569
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,600
and transcripts for all
of the honor roll students.

570
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,800
You don't really think this had
anything to do with her murder?

571
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,800
Why not?

572
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,600
You do.

573
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
David would never
endanger himself

574
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,000
or anyone else
in the space program.

575
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,700
I used to tease him that
I was his second wife.

576
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,600
His first love is NASA.
Always has been.

577
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,800
I know these are difficult
questions, Mrs. Markov...

578
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,700
Hilary, please.

579
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,900
Hilary.

580
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,200
Have you noticed any changes
in your husband's behavior?

581
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
What do you mean?

582
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,700
Well, has his-his mood changed
in the last few weeks?

583
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,300
Y... No.

584
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,800
No, David's just David.

585
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,100
I mean, he's been under a lot
of pressure lately, but I...

586
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,800
He's handled it just fine.

587
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,300
What pressure?

588
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,400
Competition for the X-48
pilot slot was really intense.

589
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,000
It was hard on our whole family,

590
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,900
but we got through it,
and now things are great.

591
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,600
We've never been better.

592
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,600
Did you catch
the false start?

593
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,700
Well, has his-his mood changed

594
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,800
in the last few weeks?

595
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,400
Y... No.

596
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,300
No, David's just David.

597
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,800
She started to say yes,
but she said no.

598
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,900
Yeah, and the
slip of the tongue

599
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,100
when she was talking
about the pressure.

600
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,200
I mean, he's been under a lot
of pressure lately, but I...

601
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,900
He's handled it just fine.

602
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,600
So, <i>she's</i> been handling it.

603
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,100
But he hasn't.

604
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,800
What's she hiding
about him?

605
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,700
Oh, sex, drugs or money--

606
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,000
the holy trinity.

607
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,100
Drugs could explain
the change in demeanor.

608
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,500
Aren't pilots drug-tested
by NASA every couple of months?

609
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,300
For illegal narcotics, but
drug tests are exclusive.

610
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,900
You have to choose what
you want to screen for.

611
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,000
Maybe he went

612
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,200
on some kind of anti-anxiety
medication a few weeks ago.

613
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,600
And if he stopped taking it
right before the test flight,

614
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
withdrawal symptoms can include
suicidal impulses.

615
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,800
Exactly.

616
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,100
I'll call NASA,
have them run a new tox panel.

617
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,100
Oh, good job.

618
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,000
You got a future
as a housekeeper.

619
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,100
Yeah. Not bad, right?

620
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,400
And you've got stuff in here
going back to the Dark Ages.

621
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,200
Okay.

622
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,600
I'm sorry I lied.

623
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,800
I totally deserve
the punishment.

624
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,800
Yeah, apology accepted.

625
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,100
But can you remember this

626
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,700
next time you decide
to have a party behind my back?

627
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,600
Oh, I'm not sorry about that.

628
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,500
Just that I lied
to you about it.

629
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,700
You should check out
my Networker page.

630
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,300
I had 200 new friend requests,
all because of that party.

631
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,400
Hey, since when do you care
about being so popular?

632
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,500
I mean, you know
the kind of trouble

633
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,800
you can get into,
a girl your age.

634
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,500
Okay. Where is
that coming from?

635
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,000
Some case you're
working on?

636
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,100
You know, what do you care?

637
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,400
What do you care
about new friends

638
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,900
if all they're looking for is
a place to drink or to get high?

639
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,700
Well, you're one to talk.

640
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,400
What do you...
What do you call this?

641
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,900
- Research.
- Oh, please!

642
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,100
Those are Berber nomads,

643
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,500
completely cut off
from Western civilization.

644
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,200
I had to gain their trust.

645
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Come on! Talk about
joining the tribe.

646
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,400
It's not the same thing
at all, and you know it.

647
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,000
Hey. Uh, you were right
about Judge Stark.

648
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,500
Her alibi finally checked out.

649
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,200
FBI found surveillance footage
of the courthouse

650
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,500
where they can make her out.

651
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,400
So she didn't kill her daughter,
then, eh?

652
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
No, but there's
something you should see.

653
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,000
Danielle's academic transcripts.

654
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,100
I'll be right there.

655
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,100
Conversation's not over.

656
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,400
<i>Danielle's GPA was excellent.</i>

657
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
But her SAT scores
were barely average.

658
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,700
She took the test twice, scoring
around the 65th percentile.

659
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,300
So?

660
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,900
Well, she knew she wasn't going
to make the top of her class,

661
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,600
so she signed up to take
the SAT a third time.

662
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,000
Score just got
posted this week.

663
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,900
Oh! 94th percentile?

664
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,100
That's quite an improvement.

665
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,200
I wonder what
she did differently.

666
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,100
I can tell you one thing.

667
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,300
She got murdered the day
before she took that test.

668
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,800
Why would someone else
take the SAT for Danielle Stark

669
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,600
the day <i>after</i> she was murdered?

670
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,600
Uh, DC Homicide kept the case
quiet for 24 hours

671
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,100
because of who the family is.

672
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
I got it.

673
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,600
Whoa. Danielle's name,
but look at the photo.

674
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,900
Look familiar?

675
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
I don't know what this is.

676
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,600
It must be some kind of prank
by one of my students.

677
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,300
Danielle's ID
wasn't stolen.

678
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,900
I think she gave it to you.

679
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,100
Why would she do that?

680
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,000
Well, so you could
take the test for her.

681
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,200
I...

682
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,400
I do not have to listen to this!

683
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Ooh!

684
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,700
Well, you might want to
try that move again, love.

685
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,700
Really.

686
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,500
It was awful gestural timing.

687
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,700
What does that mean?

688
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,500
Well, she voiced outrage,

689
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,600
and then she slammed
her hand down.

690
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,100
If she was
truly outraged,

691
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,900
it all would have happened
at the same time.

692
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,800
Look, we have the essay
section of Danielle's test.

693
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,900
If you took the test for her,

694
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,800
we'll just match
the handwriting to yours.

695
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,500
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

696
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,800
to get by
on a teacher's salary?

697
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,100
How am I ever

698
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,800
gonna pay off a hundred grand
in student loans?

699
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah, well,
you've got a point there.

700
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,800
- That sounds like motive to me.
- No, no.

701
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,300
This is insane.

702
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,800
I didn't know she was dead

703
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,000
when I took the test.
Why would I have

704
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,300
taken it if I killed her?

705
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,100
Maybe she threatened
to expose you,

706
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,000
things got out of hand.

707
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,700
- So you decided to build yourself
an alibi.
- No.

708
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,900
Nothing got out of hand.

709
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,100
We just... We had an argument.

710
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,200
About what?

711
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,300
Danielle contacted me
through e-mail,

712
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,200
but she didn't tell me

713
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,600
what score she wanted
on the test.

714
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,500
I can hit
any percentile I want.

715
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,900
It avoids raising
too much suspicion.

716
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,900
But when I asked her,

717
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,500
she looked at me like

718
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,400
she didn't know
what I was talking about.

719
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,900
I mean,

720
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,900
she hired me.

721
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,800
And where exactly were you
when you had this argument?

722
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,700
I'm ready to arrest the teacher.

723
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,300
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

724
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,300
She had opportunity
and motive, and

725
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,900
she admits
to arguing with Danielle

726
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,900
the day before the murder.

727
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,500
Yeah, but I saw no signs that
she was lying, and typically,

728
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,800
only an innocent person's
gonna admit to an argument.

729
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,200
A guilty person won't admit
to anything

730
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,500
that would seem incriminating.

731
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,900
You're saying it wasn't her?

732
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,700
Don't know, but

733
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,100
I'd like to see
how she reacted

734
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,600
when she was confronted
by her teacher.

735
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
I want to see the tape

736
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,800
from that video camera the
day that she was confronted.

737
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,900
There's still no audio.

738
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,500
You won't be able
to hear what Danielle said.

739
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,700
I don't need to hear
what she said.

740
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,300
I just want
to see her face.

741
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,700
Emily, let me help you.

742
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,000
Oh, yeah.

743
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,300
Thanks, Gillian.

744
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,300
You okay?

745
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,200
Yeah. Just my
dad being...

746
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,300
Yeah, he can do that.

747
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,200
He never lets me
do anything fun.

748
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh, you mean like
having a hundred friends over

749
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,700
and getting pulled
in by the cops?

750
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,300
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
like that.

751
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,800
He knew something was going on
when you called, you know.

752
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,200
He did?

753
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,700
Well, why didn't
he say anything?

754
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,500
If he said something
every time you lied to him,

755
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,700
oh, he knows he'd lose you.

756
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,300
Tox results are in.

757
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,700
Buck Rogers

758
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,700
tested positive for a little
drug we call venlafaxine.

759
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,200
For treating
depression and anxiety.

760
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,900
He was self-medicating
and lying about it to NASA.

761
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,800
Yeah, but the tox screen showed
he was still taking the drug

762
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,300
at the time of the crash.

763
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,300
He didn't have a suicidal
impulse from withdrawal.

764
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,800
Well, then why did he crash
the plane?

765
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,200
DRUG'S SIDE EFFECT INCLUDE TIME LOST, 

766
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,300
disorientation, and dizziness.

767
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,800
You add intense speed
and g-force

768
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,400
from the new jet technology,

769
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,700
you've got a very pricey pile
of scrap metal.

770
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,800
I didn't take any medication.

771
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,900
I've never even heard of...
what's it called?

772
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,300
Venlafaxine.

773
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,200
The tox screen
doesn't lie, Commander.

774
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Well, maybe
it's a mistake.

775
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
I mean, labs have been known
to make mistakes.

776
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,900
Commander
Markov,

777
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,700
I'm turning your case over

778
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,600
to the Justice Department,
effective immediately.

779
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,400
I wasn't taking anything.

780
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,400
You have to believe me.

781
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,400
Can I have a second?

782
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,800
I think the commander
is telling the truth.

783
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,600
The tox screen
came back positive.

784
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,700
What he's saying isn't true.

785
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,200
You can say something
that's untrue

786
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
and still not be lying.

787
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
How?

788
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,300
If you don't know it's a lie.

789
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,500
I don't understand.

790
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,900
You're saying that my wife
was dosing me?

791
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,400
Either she did it

792
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
or you did.

793
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,300
Tell them, Hil.

794
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,600
This is the craziest thing I'VE EVER HEARD.

795
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,300
Hilary.

796
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,900
David, let me explain.

797
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,700
You did this?

798
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,000
- You drugged me?
- I was trying

799
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
- to help you.
- What did you do?

800
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,200
Did you slip it in my coffee?

801
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,000
I don't understand.

802
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,700
I researched
all the drugs.

803
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,800
Those side effects
are incredibly rare.

804
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,900
I didn't know they could

805
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,300
make you crash.

806
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,800
I'm going to lose my job.

807
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,400
We are going to lose everything.

808
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,000
We were already
losing everything.

809
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,700
You were so anxious
all the time.

810
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,300
I was scared.

811
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,800
The kids were scared.

812
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,700
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but think about it.

813
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,400
How have you
been feeling lately?

814
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,600
About me.

815
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,100
About the kids.

816
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,100
How have you

817
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,600
been feeling, David?

818
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,400
Better.

819
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,600
Okay, there's the teacher.

820
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,900
There's Danielle.

821
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,000
Can you zoom in
on her face?

822
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,300
No, you can't see her face.

823
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,000
It's on her back
when they start talking.

824
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,200
Try a trophy cabinet.

825
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,800
Oh, there she is.

826
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,300
Can you blow up her eyebrows?

827
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,700
And do that thing.

828
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,400
Okay... what
do you see?

829
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,900
True surprise.

830
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,700
Lasts less than
one second, right?

831
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
She hasn't got a clue what
her teacher is talking about.

832
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,600
But if Danielle didn't hire Fife
to cheat for her, then who did?

833
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,400
Someone who
wanted her

834
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,700
to succeed more than she did.

835
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,300
I did it for Danielle.

836
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,400
Well, why didn't you tell us?

837
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,300
Well, what
did that

838
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,600
have to do with anything?

839
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,300
I just wanted
what was best for her.

840
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,700
Best for her or for you?

841
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
I knew that if she could
just get into a good college,

842
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,300
she would shine,
but she wasn't going to get in.

843
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,800
Not with
her scores.

844
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,300
So, you hired the teacher?

845
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,700
To tutor her.

846
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,000
They worked together for weeks,

847
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,200
but Danielle's second SAT
was just as bad as the first.

848
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,800
She... was...

849
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,600
desperate.

850
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,400
No, <i>you</i> were desperate, right?

851
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,800
I created an e-mail account
in Danielle's name,

852
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,800
and I contacted Ms. Fife again.

853
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,000
I'd heard
rumors that she

854
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,600
had done this for
other students,

855
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,500
and, well, Danielle
didn't even have to know.

856
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,300
But she found out, right?

857
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,500
Mm-hmm.

858
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,900
She came home
that night furious.

859
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,300
I had never seen
her so angry.

860
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,900
She said
that I didn't trust her.

861
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,900
Now, if Danielle threatened
to expose the cheating,

862
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,400
that would put her at risk.

863
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,400
If I had
contributed

864
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,800
to her death in any way...

865
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,000
Do you know
any of the other kids

866
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,400
that were involved
in this?

867
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,000
We need to get back
to the student IDs,

868
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,500
find out who else
this teacher

869
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,900
was cheating for.

870
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
I've never cheated before
in my life.

871
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,900
I've always done my own work.

872
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,000
So, what was
Ms. Fife's photo doing

873
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,500
in <i>your</i> student ID?

874
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,600
I don't know.

875
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,300
I swear.

876
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,900
Your last SAT score
went up 320 points.

877
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,100
How do you
explain that?

878
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,900
I studied really hard.

879
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,200
You know, your daughter
is a really good liar.

880
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,700
I don't know what you mean.

881
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,800
Well, studies show

882
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,000
that popular kids
are the most facile.

883
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,700
They adapt quickly to hide
their true feelings.

884
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,700
???

885
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,400
Let's talk about
Danielle's murder.

886
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,200
Where were you
that night?

887
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,600
What?

888
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,900
You can't be serious.

889
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,300
Oh, my God,
she was my best friend.

890
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,600
Sure, she was.

891
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,100
Right up until she
threatened to expose

892
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,900
the cheating scandal
and ruin your college career.

893
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,600
What kind of person
do you think I am?

894
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,300
You tell me.

895
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,300
I would never hurt Danielle,
not in a million years.

896
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,400
That's enough, please.

897
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,800
I can't do this.

898
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,900
Do you know
what your daughter did, sir?

899
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,200
Did she tell you?

900
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,800
No.

901
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,700
You sure?

902
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,900
SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

903
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,700
It was me.

904
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,500
I overheard Danielle
arguing with Riley

905
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,000
and threatening
to expose her.

906
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,000
I couldn't... I couldn't let her
ruin my daughter's life.

907
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,800
So, I...

908
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,700
followed her
into the park and...

909
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,500
I-I did it.

910
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,400
I killed her.

911
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,000
You're under arrest for
the murder of Danielle Stark.

912
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,400
There's just...

913
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,300
there's one problem.

914
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,400
I DON'T THINK HE DID IT.

915
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,300
Hey.

916
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,200
How you doing?

917
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,100
I've got, uh...

918
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,800
I've got nothing more to say.

919
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,700
I'm not FBI.

920
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,900
I told them to wait
outside, so...

921
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,100
Why?

922
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,700
I told them what I did.

923
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,800
I killed her.

924
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,400
Yeah.

925
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,300
I just want
to show you

926
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,600
a few photographs.

927
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,600
Okay.

928
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,400
What do you see?

929
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,000
What is this?

930
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,600
It's the Stratton-Meyerhoff
personality test.

931
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
So, please, what do you see?

932
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,900
It's a clown.

933
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,700
I know it's a clown.

934
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,700
What emotion
does he make you feel?

935
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,600
What does this have to do
with anything?

936
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,800
It's a simple question,
it's a simple question.

937
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,900
What do you see?

938
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,800
Uh...

939
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,900
sadness.

940
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,300
I guess.

941
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,800
Okay, well, that's good.

942
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,800
And this one?

943
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,100
Happiness, joy.

944
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,300
I don't know.

945
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,700
And... this one?

946
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,600
What are you
trying to do?

947
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm trying to prove that you
didn't kill Danielle Stark.

948
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,900
But I told you that I did.

949
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,200
Now, Mr. Berenson, there is
no Stratton-Meyerhoff test.

950
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,400
I just made that up.

951
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,300
I wanted to
get a...

952
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,400
an honest reaction
to this photograph,

953
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,200
and what I got was...

954
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,300
horror...

955
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,700
and surprise.

956
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,900
Now, the real killer,

957
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,900
if confronted with his victim,
would show

958
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,500
disgust, contempt,

959
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,100
even fear.

960
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,400
But not surprise.

961
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,900
Never surprise.

962
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,600
Now, Mr. Berenson,
I know you're

963
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,900
trying to protect your daughter.

964
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,600
You probably even think that
you're doing the right thing

965
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,200
by taking the blame for her.

966
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,000
You can't protect her

967
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,300
from this.

968
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,100
I can't.

969
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,100
I can't let my daughter
go to prison 

970
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,700
She didn't mean to kill her.

971
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,600
She was just...

972
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
just trying to stop...

973
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,800
I wish she
had never told me.

974
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,400
I wish I didn't know.

975
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,400
* You said the moon 

976
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,200
* Was ours 

977
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,400
* Yeah 

978
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,300
* You said moon was ours 

979
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,800
* To hell with today 

980
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,300
* The sunlight is always gonna 

981
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,000
* Take love away 

982
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,300
* Brings up suspicions and 

983
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
* And alibis 

984
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,900
* But I can see blue 

985
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,800
* Tear-blinded eyes 

986
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,300
* Lies, lies, lies 

987
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,000
* Oh, lies... 

988
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,000
You ready?

989
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,200
I'll send you the bill.

990
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,900
What?

991
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,200
Nothing.

992
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,400
Good work.

993
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,900
* I got a storm 

994
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,100
* Where my... 

995
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,500
I know what you were
saying before

996
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
about girls my age.

997
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,200
Good.

998
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,300
And considering...
I guess you do

999
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,600
a pretty good job
of restraining yourself.

1000
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,500
From what?

1001
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,400
From calling me a liar when you
know I'm up to something.

1002
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
Well, I'm sorry I always know.

1003
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,100
You don't always know.

1004
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:01,600
* Lies, lies... 

1005
