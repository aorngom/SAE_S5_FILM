1
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,140
Stop it there.

2
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,580
Now,that was the assassination of the mayor of Cali,Colombia,

3
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,470
by a drug cartel a few years back.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,680
Let's have a look at the gunman's face.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,550
The brows drawn down and together,

6
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,230
the raising of the upper lid, the tightness under the eyes.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,690
If someone is about to commit a premeditated act of violence,

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,590
this is the expression you're going to see.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,890
All right, here it is again on the face of a 16-year-old girl

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,610
about to shoot her homeroom teacher in Nevada

11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,760
and again on the face of a Basque separatist

12
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,060
getting on a bus with 20 pounds

13
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,920
of explosives strapped to his chest.

14
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,790
If you see this expression,

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,590
it's likely this person is about to attack someone.

16
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,820
I saw that look on a girl I dated once.

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,670
To the D.C. police I haven't met,

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,990
I'm Agent Paul Aronson with the Secret Service.

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,330
Now,we are responsible for the security of Ambassador Park Jung-Soo

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,090
<i>from the republic of South Korea today.</i>

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,950
<i>Two weeks ago, the ambassador announced his candidacy for president.</i>

22
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,080
Last night,intelligence sources picked up chatter

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,850
that there may be an attempt on the ambassador's life here today at his son's wedding.

24
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,630
<i>Dr. Lightman is on hand with his staff</i>

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,580
to identify suspects by scanning

26
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,210
for microexpressions and dangerous demeanor.

27
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,680
<i>MAN: Well,Koreans don't like to show emotion.</i>

28
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,890
It's undignified.

29
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,330
Who's to say a Korean shooter makes that expression?

30
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,490
Well, you're talking about display rules.

31
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,400
In Western culture, the rule is to look someone in the eye when you talk to them.

32
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,820
In Korea,that's considered rude,so people choose not to.

33
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,620
But this expression isn't made by choice.

34
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,660
It's involuntary.

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,080
You can't control it.

36
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,440
Nationality is irrelevant.

37
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,910
If you see this expression on someone's face and you don't stop it,

38
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,160
this is what could happen.

39
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,580
Any questions?

43
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,450
Your people are going to cover the wedding ceremony itself,right?

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,580
Yeah,we're okay there.

45
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,840
Everyone's seated, movement's easy to spot.

46
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,110
Where we'll need help is at the reception.

47
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,980
There'll be a couple hundred guests walking around.

48
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,930
You know,it's going to be pretty hard to spot yourguy.

49
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,470
At most weddings,champagne and resentment flow together.

50
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:37,920
Right?

51
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,300
Not a wedding fan,huh?

52
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,300
No,don't trust 'em.

53
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,650
Lead to marriage.

54
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,470
Hey.

55
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,610
Hey yourself.

56
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,060
Aronson,this is my husband Alec Foster.

57
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,160
Are you with the Group?

58
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,140
I didn't see you at the briefing.

59
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,500
No,no,we don't work together.

60
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,740
I'm on the Far East desk at State.

61
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,000
Half my office is here today.

62
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:54,850
Excuse me.

63
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,500
Turns out I have to leave right after the ceremony.

64
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,370
Tolliver wants me to cover a meeting in Reston.

65
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,820
I'm working anyways.

66
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,090
You have a minute to say hi to the deputy secretary?

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,580
Sure.

68
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,520
Hey,uh,until the ceremony,

69
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,430
let's post you two at the metal detectors.

70
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,310
Look for any hot spots--

71
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,820
uh,any concealed anger, anxiety,resentment.

72
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,400
Her husband's not going to Reston.

73
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,810
Well,that's none of your business.

74
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,300
You saw that he lied to her,right?

75
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,750
Does she really not see it?

76
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,610
Hey,that's none of your business.

77
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,140
Now,go help Loker.

78
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,640
Dr. Lightman.

79
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,940
I'm Han Yong-Dae, the ambassador's assistant.

80
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,640
Could you and Dr. Foster come with me?

81
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,130
He'd like to speak with you.

82
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,720
Ambassador.

83
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,943
Dr. Lightman, Dr. Foster.

84
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,500
Thank you for coming.

85
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,890
Are you confident that you can identify the people

86
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,890
that want to harm me?

87
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,190
Well,I think the problem is going to be spotting your guy.

88
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,270
You know?

89
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,620
I mean,it's a big room with a lot of people in it.

90
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,770
I suppose some element of risk cannot be avoided.

91
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,830
Sure it can. You could cancel the wedding.

92
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,630
Not that we're suggesting that.

93
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,110
If you want to eliminate the risk.

94
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,280
It's been discussed.

95
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,700
I said no.

96
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,160
I cannot give these people the satisfaction.

97
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,160
And it would only punish my son and his fiance,

98
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:30,800
not me.

99
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,420
I see you brought your own security.

100
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,760
That's a...

101
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,100
HK .45 you're carrying.

102
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,530
Right?

103
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,200
Pricey.

104
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,160
As you can tell,Yong-Dae's principal responsibility is protection,

105
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,190
which he carries out very well.

106
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,780
But it's not me that I'm concerned about.

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,910
My wife and my son are the only family that I have in this world.

108
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,900
They are the ones that I need protected.

109
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,360
Please keep them safe.

110
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,410
Is something the matter,sir?

111
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,650
Why,there a problem?

112
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,420
Would you mind emptying your pockets?

113
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,910
I told you nothing's the matter.

114
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,350
Well,your eyebrows said different.

115
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,300
What?

116
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,640
They were raised and pulled together.

117
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,280
That's fear, worry, apprehension.

118
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,860
Just empty your pockets,sir.

119
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,080
Who are you people?

120
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,900
You're not Secret Service.

121
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,690
I am.

122
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,570
Enjoy the wedding,sir.

123
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,820
Good call.

124
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,160
Didn't need your help.

125
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,740
Absolutely not.

126
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,620
Ooh,he's into you.

127
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,280
Yeah,right.

128
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,310
What,you didn't see the microexpression he flashed?

129
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,210
No,what was it?

130
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,090
Well,the full expression looks like this.

131
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,690
You are so lucky I don't have a gun.

132
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,600
<i> Only you would tell somebody to cancel a wedding</i>

133
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,370
ten minutes before it starts.

134
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,230
Well,it was just a suggestion.

135
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,000
Do you realize how much today means to the families?

136
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,980
No,fortunately.

137
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,020
Did you catch the ambassador's smile?

138
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,610
It could have been a cultural gesture.

139
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,120
Maybe he looked down to show us respect.

140
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,560
It read embarrassment to me.

141
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,750
I could dive into that cake fully clothed.

142
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,930
There's an image.

143
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,720
I love weddings.

144
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,600
They're such a beautiful celebration of love and hope.

145
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,800
Plus there's cake.

146
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,010
Bride's pretending she's a virgin,

147
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,920
the groom's pretending he's found "the one,"

148
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,130
and the in-laws are pretending they like each other.

149
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,510
It's Christmas for liars.

150
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,840
And yet lovely.

151
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,860
You really are idiotically happy,aren't you?

152
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,110
No fatalities so far.

153
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,030
When's the wedding party coming in?

154
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,780
Any minute.

155
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,230
My father always used to say there are four rules for getting married.

156
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,820
You need a woman who loves you unconditionally,

157
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,660
a woman who will always challenge you,

158
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,830
a woman who you'll always want to make love to,

159
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,120
and most important of all,

160
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,010
you have to make sure that none of those women ever meet.

161
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,980
Wasn't really a joke when my father said it either.

162
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,460
It's more like autobiography.

163
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,980
See anything?

164
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,920
Yeah,two people in the corner trying to hide their anger,

165
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,540
but I think they're just unhappy with their table.

166
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,520
Keep an eye on them.

167
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:25,900
That's odd.

168
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,140
What?

169
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,590
The bodyguard's bow was off.

170
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,280
See something?

171
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,250
No.

172
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,480
...and thank you for being here today

173
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,470
to help us celebrate the wedding of Won-Hee

174
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,230
and his beautiful bride Phoebe.

175
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:55,230
...who have come so far to be with us today,again...

176
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,140
To our colleagues and friends all around the world,

177
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,790
who share this day with us...

178
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:11,490
Won-Hee's mother and I feel very fortunate.

179
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,170
Ever since we met her over a year ago,

180
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,220
we were graced by her charm,

181
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,160
her good spirits.

182
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:24,280
...who have traveled so very far to be with us here today.(SHE IS A GIFT TO US)

183
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,800
Again...(JUST SIT DOWN.)

184
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,610
Won-Hee's...

185
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,050
No,it's just anger.

186
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,130
It's not the same thing at all.

187
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,560
Not the guy, back down.

188
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,500
Not the target.

189
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,020
AMBASSADOR: ...good sense to marry her.

190
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,210
Won-Hee has something he would like to say.

191
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,190
Uh,I'd just like to thank my parents for this wonderful wedding.

192
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,980
Thank you,Mom. Thank you,Dad.

193
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,140
And now,just to,uh, embarrass Phoebe and me,

194
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,540
uh,we have this little video of,well,of us.

195
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,530
So,enjoy.

196
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,180
Aronson,this one!

197
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,580
Take him down!

198
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,130
Take him! Take him!(TABLE SEVEN .TABLE SEVEN.)

199
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:33,650
This one!(MOVE IT)

200
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,120
Target is on the move.

201
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,310
Get him,take him,take him!

202
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,370
**

203
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,940
Drop him! Drop him now!

204
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,890
Everybody down!

205
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,680
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

206
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,000
Doctor!

207
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,170
Doctor!

208
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,520
Get everyone inside.

209
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,400
Nobody leaves.

210
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,270
YES SIR.

211
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,200
DC Police are here.

212
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,150
They want to know when you're handing over jurisdiction.

213
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,270
Tell them to wait. I want all the guests to stay inside the building.******

214
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:33,313
- 未翻译字幕 -

215
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:34,430
"This was to send a message.

216
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,470
South Korea must never join with the North."

217
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,890
Tell him he's being transferred to DC Police custody.

218
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,780
They'll take him to be arraigned.

219
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,870
Aronson,hang on.

220
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,150
I don't think this is the guy.

221
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,850
I don't have time for jokes,Lightman.

222
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,790
He have a gun on him?

223
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,090
He says he threw it away.

224
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,090
We're still looking for it.

225
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,460
He's lying,ain't ya? Eh?

226
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,780
I don't think he fired the shots.

227
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,490
I think he's just taking credit for them.

228
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,400
You don't speak Korean.

229
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,520
Oh,I don't have to.

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,850
I can see it in your face, don't I? Eh?

231
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,820
What did you see?

232
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,610
"Duping delight."

233
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,020
The pleasure a liar feels when he sees his lies believed.

234
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,200
You've had the training.

235
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,420
Watch.

236
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,470
Accuse him again.

237
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,200
Well,maybe he's happy he shot the guy.

238
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,060
Then he wouldn't have tried to hide the smile.

239
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,350
You picked this guy out. Yeah,well,

240
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,260
he was going to do something violent,

241
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,900
but he didn't shoot the ambassador's son.

242
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,470
Well,then what was he going to do?

243
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,850
Is this what was in his pockets?

244
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,150
Yes.

245
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,750
There's a lighter,but did you find any cigarettes?

246
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:40,990
No.

247
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,150
Did you find anything else?

248
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,140
On him,no.

249
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,670
We did find a bottle of water he dropped while he was running.

250
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,540
Why would he try to hold on to a bottle of water while he was running?

251
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:01,950
Petrol.

252
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,430
Gasoline?

253
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,660
He was here to make a political protest.

254
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,090
Could have been planning to immolate himself.

255
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,980
Set himself on fire?

256
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,370
That would explain the lighter, no cigarettes.

257
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,990
Well,if he was here to attack the ambassador,

258
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,970
why kill himself?

259
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,920
There've been almost 1,000 self-immolations in Asia over the past 40 years.

260
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,870
They're most common in Vietnam,India, and South Korea.

261
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,270
The guy that actually fired the shots,

262
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,340
you haven't got him; he's still here.

263
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,380
That's great.

264
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,950
Okay,we keep the building sealed.

265
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,960
I want all the guests moved into holding rooms.

266
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,750
Tell D.C. police we're keeping jurisdiction.

267
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,410
We need to talk.

268
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,480
YES,SIR. LET'S GO.

269
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,120
The shooter is in the building.

270
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,930
Now,we don't know whether he's armed or not,

271
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,120
but I've got 250 wedding guests as suspects.

272
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,530
Actually,that's not true.

273
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,370
Men commit 90% of gun homicides.

274
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,430
Most of them are between 17 and 49.

275
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,600
Odds are you got a male under 50.

276
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,970
Narrows it down to, what,150 people?

277
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,870
All right,whatever it is, I need your help.

278
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,130
Now,I've got 12 agents.

279
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,380
With all the VIPs here,

280
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,600
it's gonna be hard to keep this building shut down for more than an hour or two.

281
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,660
Do you still think that somebody was trying to kill the ambassador?

282
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,660
Well,if this is somebody

283
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,450
slick enough to smuggle a gun in here, assume he hit his target.

284
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,290
Now,this is somebody who wanted to kill the groom.

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,670
Getting in here took planning.

286
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,860
If the motive is personal,

287
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,450
it's probably a long-standing grievance.

288
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,830
Lots of suppressed anger.

289
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,370
The person you're looking for,

290
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,510
had to hide his feelings until the groom arrived.

291
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,390
Some of that emotion must've leaked out.

292
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,700
Get the tape from the videographers and,uh,

293
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,340
isolate any,uh,suppressed anger,fear,contempt.

294
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,640
Did the family mention a threat to the groom?

295
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,490
Not a word. Uh,somebody's lying.

296
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,550
Talk to people who knew the groom.

297
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,180
Look for signs of concealment.

298
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,080
Somebody who seems to be holding something back.

299
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,370
You going to talk to the parents?

300
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,150
If you're looking for lies, you start at the top.

301
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,090
Hey.

302
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,690
Aronson told me to give you any help that you need.

303
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,210
I'm Karl.

304
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:46,650
Karl Dupree.

305
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,200
Aronson sent you?

306
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,340
That's right.

307
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,950
No,it isn't.

308
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,420
You asked him if you could work with me,right?

309
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,220
Not much gets past you,does it?

310
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,370
You have no idea.

311
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,160
Let's go.

312
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:10,860
Mrs. Park?

313
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,000
Hi,I'm Gillian Foster.

314
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,120
This is Cal Lightman.

315
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,150
How do you do?

316
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,810
We're working with the Secret Service to try and figure out what happened.

317
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,440
How's Won-Hee doing?

318
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,090
Uh,we don't know.

319
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,970
He just got out of surgery.

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,460
They're moving him to the ICU.

321
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,710
We thought someone was going to try to hurt the ambassador.

322
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,470
But it looks like whoever shot your husband was trying to hurt him.

323
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,600
Do you know why somebody would want to do that?

324
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,730
I don't understand.

325
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,040
I thought this was a political issue about his father.

326
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,730
It doesn't look like that anymore.

327
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,400
Did he ever mention anyone threatening him?

328
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,280
Threatening him?

329
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,820
Uh,no.

330
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,380
No,are you sure about this?

331
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,380
What were you just thinking?

332
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,670
Excuse me?

333
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,510
Something just went through your mind,what was it?

334
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,920
I-I don't know.

335
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,950
Ma'am,I can take you

336
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,930
to your husband now.

337
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,560
I have to go.

338
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,380
Dr. Seagal,

339
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,470
Dr. David Seagal to O.R. Six,please.

340
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,120
Additional cognitive processing.

341
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,940
The eye flutter.

342
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,630
There's something she's not telling us.

343
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,100
Or she's freaked out because she just heard her husband was targeted

344
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,850
for assassination on their wedding day.

345
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,570
Could be.

346
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,790
We're professional videographers.

347
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,130
You're not part of the families,

348
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,710
we,uh,we cannot give you the tapes.

349
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,940
Uh,we're trying to figure out who shot the groom.

350
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,530
Which I'm pretty sure the families support.

351
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,890
Sorry,we have--

352
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,550
There's a contract that strictly forbids releasing the footage.

353
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,820
Nothing I can do.

354
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,750
Yeah,see,those hesitations and repetitions,

355
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,650
you're having trouble processing what you're saying

356
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,360
which typically means you're lying.

357
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,330
I'll bet your contract doesn't say anything.

358
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,760
You want to take a look at the footage,

359
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,310
because you want to see if the shooting is on there.

360
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,730
Because if it is,you're gonna sell it to the tabloid that writes the fattest check.

361
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,620
Right?

362
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,670
You're trying to get the guy who did this?

363
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,900
That's right.

364
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,750
Don't be an idiot,man.

365
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,660
Give him the tapes.

366
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,110
Let's go.

367
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,780
Any of this footage shows up on the net,

368
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,020
I'm gonna rip your head off and stuff it down your throat.

369
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
No hesitation.

370
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,860
Now you're telling the truth.

371
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,120
Who would want to kill my son?

372
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,440
We're trying to find that out.

373
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,630
You're mistaken.

374
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,580
If there was a second assassin in the room,

375
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,260
well,then,two were sent after me.

376
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,550
This had nothing to do with my family.

377
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,540
You sure about that?

378
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,380
Politics was behind this,

379
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,740
People who want to silence me.

380
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,420
That is who you should be looking for.

381
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,580
A finger tells you so much,doesn't it?

382
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,140
Yeah,it pointed one way while his eyes were pointed another.

383
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,400
That happens when you're lying.

384
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,360
Your mind's working so hard to make stuff up,

385
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,040
that your body can't keep in sync.

386
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,500
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

387
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,640
<i>These tapes are from the videographers at the wedding.</i>

388
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Most of the footage is for the hour before the shooting,

389
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,600
so,you're not likely to see any overt anger or fear.

390
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,220
We're looking for someone trying to hide those feelings.

391
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,320
Since it's a wedding, and pretty much

392
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,310
everyone is pretending they're having a good time,

393
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,490
you're gonna see a lot of people hiding their feelings.

394
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,520
And that means masking smiles.

395
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,580
We're looking for these.

396
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,720
The fear smile,

397
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,140
Anger.

398
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,190
And contempt.

399
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,030
Find anyone displaying one of these,

400
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,340
flag it and bring it to me right away.

401
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,240
We have exactly no time to do this.

402
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,230
Uh,we need to know if the groom mentioned anyone...

403
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,960
...mentioned anyone threatening him.

404
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,250
Or speaking to a man...

405
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,290
The name of the bride and the groom,anybody threatening,

406
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,400
anyone,anything causing him any trouble?

407
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,010
Even something minor?

408
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,260
I can't think of anything.

409
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,340
He was happy.

410
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,300
Crazy in love with Phoebe.

411
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,890
That's all he talked about.

412
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,500
He say anything different to you?

413
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,400
No.

414
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,290
Didn't mention anything.

415
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,350
You're the best man,right?

416
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,680
What's your name?

417
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,970
Garrett. Garrett Craywood.

418
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,780
Who are you calling?

419
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,280
CIA,see what they got on the ambassador.

420
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,350
Well,you know that's going to be classified.

421
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,790
Who's your contact? Laura.

422
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,450
Laura who?

423
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,720
Laura of the CIA.

424
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,750
Hey.

425
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,050
Hey,what are you doing here?

426
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,290
I thought you were leaving right after the ceremony.

427
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,380
I didn't get out in time.

428
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,650
Oh,I'm sorry, but I have to...

429
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,710
I have to make this meeting at Reston.

430
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,780
I told Tolliver I'd cover.

431
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,900
It's important I don't let him down.

432
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,090
Just walk me out,okay?

433
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,330
What... what do you mean?

434
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,010
Tell the Secret Service guy I can go.

435
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,480
I can't do that.

436
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,180
Sure,you can.

437
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,060
You're in charge,right?

438
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,170
Jill,it's important.

439
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,730
One person gets walked out,

440
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,560
and everybody's going to try.

441
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,250
We're not going to be able to keep the place sealed.

442
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,780
Never mind.

443
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,650
I'll call the office.

444
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,290
Come find me when you're done.

445
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,520
What did Laura of the CIA have to say?

446
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,210
She'll get back to me.

447
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:10,770
Hey.

448
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,310
You wanted somebody concealing something?

449
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,290
The best man lied when I asked about the groom.

450
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,640
Um,first,I wanted to say that Won-Hee and I

451
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,430
met our freshman year at Columbia.

452
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,250
This is from the rehearsal dinner last night.

453
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,070
Uh,he was into Mozart and poetry,

454
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,670
and he liked to volunteer at the homeless shelter.

455
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,210
I,on the other hand, was into...

456
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,550
You talked to Craywood earlier.

457
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,380
Notice anything different from the way he sounded then?

458
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,250
I think his voice is higher pitched here.

459
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,290
He's definitely talking faster.

460
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,130
That means his emotions are heightened.

461
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,440
Maybe he's trying to control his anger.

462
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,860
He's,uh... he's the most generous guy...

463
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,770
Oh,stop it there.

464
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,470
Move in on his right hand.

465
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,050
Here's a question you don't usually hear at a wedding.

466
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,170
Why is the best man giving the groom the finger?

467
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,860
Are you sure that's what he's doing?

468
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,980
Who are you?

469
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Oh,sorry,this is Karl Dupree from Secret Service-- he's working with me.

470
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,740
I'm just saying,the guy is scratching his eye.

471
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,770
--Maybe his eye itches.
--No,no.

472
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,730
That's a gestural emblem.

473
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,250
It's an unconscious gesture with a specific meaning.

474
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,790
Uh,Loker,pull up the politician videos with the same gestural emblem.

475
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,510
Now,Senator McCain has served this country honorably.

476
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:31,870
He has...

477
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,690
What letter grade would you give yourself as secretary of defense?

478
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,820
Oh,I'll let history worry about that.

479
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,990
That's hostility.

480
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,210
Now,I know why those two felt that way.

481
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,500
The question is...

482
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,110
Why does the best man?

483
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

484
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,340
Yeah,you do. I didn't have a fight

485
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,150
with Won-Hee-- I don't know why you're saying I did.

486
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,340
'Cause I've seen you.

487
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,910
You've shown us three different ways already.

488
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,300
I get it.

489
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,950
You were mad at Won-Hee, and he got hurt.

490
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:18,880
And now you feel guilty.

491
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,960
You wonder if,in some way, you're to blame.

492
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,460
But you know that's not true.

493
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,070
And the best way to help him now is to help us find the person who did hurt him.

494
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,570
He owes me $5,000.

495
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,770
That doesn't explain what you're feeling.

496
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,110
It's not about the money.

497
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,770
He has a gambling problem.

498
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,720
Not many people know.

499
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,840
He keeps it quiet.

500
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,080
He's terrified his mother's family is going to find out.

501
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,770
They're old-school Korean-- they'd cut him off

502
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,850
if they knew what he was doing.

503
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,680
A few weeks ago,he asked me to loan the five to get a bookie off his back.

504
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,050
I gave it to him.

505
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,100
Then,I found out he didn't pay the debt,he put the money on another game.

506
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,770
That's when I got mad.

507
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,080
I... I don't know how much he owes altogether now,

508
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,240
but someone talked about hurting him.

509
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,510
I know that.

510
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,100
There you go.

511
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,820
Feel better now?

512
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,110
All right,we ran the groom's banking records.

513
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,840
Backs up what the kid told you.

514
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,670
Busted credit,large cash deposits at erratic intervals.

515
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,120
Sounds like gambling addiction.

516
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,820
We need to talk to the ambassador.

517
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,990
Well,go ahead,he's up in the residence.

518
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,020
He just got there.

519
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,040
I got to put down the riot that's brewing here.

520
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,780
We don't have much time left.

521
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,810
Hey,you want me to keep talking to people or what?

522
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,630
No,go help Loker with the tapes.

523
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,930
I need you to stay in holding.

524
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,050
Don't give me that.

525
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,080
I want to leave now!

526
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,570
Sir,sir, there is nothing that I can do for you.

527
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,990
I am special counsel at the White House.

528
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,070
I could have your job.

529
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,360
Now,are you going to let me out of here or not? Sir...

530
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,260
Excuse me... hi.

531
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,190
Uh,we're going to need to check that out.

532
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,380
What's your number at the office?

533
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,330
What?

534
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,330
Or we could just talk to your secretary.

535
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,250
What's her name?

536
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,350
Well,I don't...

537
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,390
Yeah,see,that's...

538
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,660
that's the problem with telling a lie.

539
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,060
There are so many other lies you have to come up with.

540
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,650
Go wait in the room,please.

541
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,400
I didn't need your help.

542
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,410
No.

543
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,030
Absolutely not.

544
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,570
When we asked you about threats,

545
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,850
why didn't you tell us about your husband's gambling?

546
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,800
Is that what you're trying to hide?

547
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:37,620
No.

548
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,700
The family treats it like it's a big secret,

549
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,820
but it hasn't been a problem lately.

550
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,990
Won-Hee hasn't placed a bet in six months.

551
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,310
Did he?

552
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,060
Is that what this was about?

553
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,130
Somebody shot him over a bet?

554
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,340
We don't know.

555
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,940
You're making a mistake.

556
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,250
He has no debts.

557
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,080
I paid them.

558
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,176
You what? 

559
00:26:02,176 --> 00:26:05,207
I wanted him to start his married life unencumbered.

560
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:06,890
I paid everything off.

561
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,330
A wedding gift.

562
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,680
When did he start gambling again?

563
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,920
My son is in no way responsible for what happened.

564
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,210
Why didn't anybody tell me what was going on?

565
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,540
Please leave my son out of this.

566
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,150
He's done nothing wrong.

567
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,010
You're right-- what was I thinking?

568
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,450
Your son has got nothing to do with this.

569
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,730
Yeah,he's a...

570
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,180
he's a great son.

571
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,560
He's spectacular.

572
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,550
Really the best son I've seen.

573
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,540
Ever.

574
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,850
Why so much love for the ambassador's son?

575
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:50,090
Did you catch the bodyguard's expression when the groom's name came up?

576
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,110
It's contempt.

577
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,580
He really doesn't like the groom.

578
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,810
Question is,why?

579
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,250
His bow.

580
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,700
<i>Yeah,at the reception, you said.</i>

581
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,830
When the wedding party came in,

582
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,590
the bodyguard gave the groom a shallow bow.

583
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,690
It was a sign of disrespect.

584
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,920
In Korea,the depth of a bow is a measure

585
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,350
of the relationship between two people,

586
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,070
so the bodyguard should have bowed to his toes,right?

587
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,390
Why would he bow to the groom like an equal?

588
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,490
Get the ambassador and the bodyguard.

589
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,770
I'll meet you there in a minute.

590
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,540
Where are you going?

591
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,360
Got to see Aronson.

592
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,380
I'm trying,yes.

593
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,210
I'll call you as soon as I get out of here.

594
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:34,950
You,too.

595
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,330
Hey.

596
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,880
Any idea how much longer we're going to be here?

597
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,780
I'm starting to feel like a hostage.

598
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,520
Hard to say,really-- I've got to find a man with a gun,you know.

599
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,810
I need to get out of here, seriously.

600
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,480
Can you help me?

601
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,610
No.

602
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,850
Sorry,it's impossible.

603
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,490
We both know that's not true.

604
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,920
You can get anybody out you want to.

605
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,080
Cal,my job's on the line.

606
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,060
The deputy director just chewed my ear off

607
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,590
because I didn't make a meeting I was supposed to be at.

608
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,290
We both know that's not true, don't we? Eh?

609
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,850
What are you implying?

610
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,740
Well,it wasn't a work call, was it?

611
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,830
Get back!

612
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,130
Sit down!

613
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,190
We can't allow anyone to leave at this time!

614
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,540
Everybody!

615
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,070
Get back!

616
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,380
Sit down!

617
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,690
We'll get you out of here as soon as we can.

618
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,380
How we doing?

619
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,700
This is getting out of control.

620
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:29,800
Where's Aronson?

621
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,860
I need to talk to him right away.

622
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,340
He's dealing with the crowd on the second floor.

623
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,550
And you are?

624
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,420
Dupree.

625
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,980
We met a half hour ago.

626
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,370
Fantastic.

627
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,660
Could you find Aronson for me?

628
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,060
For what?

629
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,710
I need a favor.

630
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,500
What are we waiting for?

631
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,770
Sir,I am so sorry.

632
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,210
He should be here any moment.

633
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,560
You tell Dr. Lightman that my son has been shot

634
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,440
and he's being loaded into a...

635
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,620
Sorry about that.

636
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,530
Took a little longer than I thought.

637
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,140
What did? Getting this.

638
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,540
sorry everyone

639
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,290
It's only blanks.

640
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,900
Courtesy of the Secret Service.

641
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,060
I will be in contact

642
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,590
with the Treasury and the State Department and my own government.

643
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,200
That's nice.

644
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,360
You know what animals do when they're startled?

645
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,820
Excuse me? They shut down.

646
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,400
Their eyes close, their lips stretch.

647
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,340
Everything just shuts down.

648
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,017
But if you watch closely, you can see the first thing

649
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:36,830
that goes through their mind when their senses return.

650
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,960
Why are you telling me this?

651
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,820
Because,after I fired the gun,

652
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,100
<i>you moved in front of him.</i>

653
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,440
Why would an official protect his bodyguard?

654
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,560
And why would that bodyguard treat his son as an equal?

655
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:04,810
Are they brothers?

656
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,780
Ridiculous.

657
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,320
Mistakes happen.

658
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,100
Is he your son?

659
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,140
You lie, and I'll know it.

660
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,740
You were hired to protect my family,

661
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,850
not look into our private life.

662
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,610
So,he is your son.

663
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,800
I didn't say that. Yeah,you did.

664
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,420
This is none of your business.

665
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,890
Just admit it for once.

666
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,400
What does any of this have to do with what happened today?

667
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,410
You tell me-- you seem to think he's involved.

668
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,790
Why would you say that?

669
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,430
Before the shooting, every time

670
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,240
you talked about your bodyguard,

671
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,170
you showed embarrassment.

672
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,370
And since the shooting, every time you've been with him,

673
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,810
you've shown anger.

674
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,840
You're showing it now,right?

675
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,270
Why is that?

676
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,420
Why are you so angry?

677
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,760
You think he tried to kill his brother?

678
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,760
Tell him he's wrong.

679
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,580
Tell him he's wrong!

680
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,610
You have always hated Won-Hee.

681
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,820
Treated him with disrespect.

682
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,340
Because you won't tell anyone who I am.

683
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,700
Did you shoot him?

684
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,100
How can you ask me that?

685
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,520
You had a gun.

686
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,270
You were standing near him.

687
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,610
Did you shoot him?

688
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,640
No.

689
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,740
I didn't.

690
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,000
You know, if you're interested,

691
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,580
I see no sign that he's lying.

692
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,440
It doesn't matter how I feel.

693
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,870
I do my job.

694
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,840
I protect you.

695
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,090
I protect Won-Hee.

696
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,470
I protect Phoebe.

697
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,620
Oh,that's good.

698
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,810
That's interesting.

699
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,300
Why are you disgusted?

700
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,248
What? 

701
00:31:48,248 --> 00:31:51,751
Why does mentioning Phoebe make you feel that way?

702
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:52,990
It's nothing.

703
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,290
Oh,no.

704
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,290
Nothing is nothing.

705
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,780
What was that,eh?

706
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,020
People think Phoebe's so nice.

707
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,480
You don't?

708
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,950
A few weeks ago,she said she had to meet some man.

709
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,070
Asked if I would go along.

710
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,900
She wouldn't say why, just wanted me there.

711
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,910
Then she changed her mind.

712
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,300
Said she'd go alone.

713
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,550
But she made me swear not to tell anyone.

714
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,410
You tell me what that means.

715
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,820
So,anyway,what I really wanted to say is that,

716
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,860
I've been working on my Korean.

717
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,910
Sorry,Won-Hee,but,um,

718
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,370
I just want to try out a couple of words here today.

719
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,630
PHOEBE: Which means I love you with all my heart...

720
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,660
What are you looking for?

721
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,280
Somebody was in contact with the bride.

722
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,820
Somebody she didn't tell us about.

723
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,870
Dupree,can you bring her down here?

724
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,710
I need to talk to her.

725
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,720
Sure.

726
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,840
I don't see anything.

727
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,260
--Do you?  --NO

728
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,770
Do you have any other footage,Loker?

729
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,770
Um,the wedding.

730
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,130
Here it is.

731
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,570
For richer or for poorer.

732
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,290
In sickness and in health.

733
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,780
In sickness and in health.

734
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,270
To love and to cherish.

735
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,580
To love and to cherish.

736
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,740
For all the days of our lives.

737
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,620
For all the days of our lives.

738
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,880
I,Phoebe Hedlin...

739
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,670
I,Phoebe Hedlin...

740
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,500
Take you...

741
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,020
Oh. Oh. Can you play that back again? Roll that back again,

742
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,190
but slowly this time.

743
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,220
I,Phoebe Hedlin...

744
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,530
Take you...

745
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,170
You see the shoulder shrug?

746
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,340
She's lying about her name?

747
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,000
Ah,it seems that way.

748
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,090
Why would she do that? I don't know.

749
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:50,010
Do you think this has anything to do with the man she was going to go meet?

750
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,090
I DON'T KNOW

751
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,380
You know,we talked to a lot of people,

752
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,530
and it seems like nobody here has known Phoebe more than three or four years.

753
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,430
What about her parents?

754
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,020
TORRES: Dead. Bridesmaids,

755
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,170
friends-- they're all from work.

756
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,250
There's nobody here from where she grew up.

757
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,180
No family or old friends at all.

758
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,190
Where's she from?

759
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,260
Uh,maid of honor said Michigan?

760
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,700
What if she left a life back there?

761
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,620
Uh,different name and everything, and never told anyone?

762
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,440
At the hospital-- the eye flutter.

763
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,660
Did he ever mention anyone threatening him?

764
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,710
Threatening him?

765
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,440
No.

766
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,680
We thought she was trying to cover up a threat someone made to her husband.

767
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,950
What if it was a threat someone made to her?

768
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,880
Yeah. Guy she went to meet?

769
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,820
TORRES: Why would an old boyfriend shoot the groom?

770
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,270
Isn't he mad at her? No.

771
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,740
No. He's in love with her, but the groom is in the way.

772
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,520
Lightman,we got to open the doors and let everybody go.

773
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,850
Oh,we need more time.

774
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,260
I just got off the phone with the Secretary of the Treasury.

775
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,730
He's furious,so we're gonna release

776
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,330
all the guests and turn the investigation over to D.C. police.

777
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,330
We got another problem.

778
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,050
Phoebe's gone.

779
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,540
She told the agent at the door she was going back to the hospital,

780
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,330
but she's not there.

781
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,690
Nobody knows where she is.

782
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,890
I got to open the doors.

783
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,750
Just give me 15 minutes, all right?

784
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,180
No.

785
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:02,560
No.

786
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:03,890
No.

787
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,730
No. No.

788
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,090
No.

789
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,600
Well,that's it for that batch.

790
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,580
Put the next lot up.

791
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,570
That's all I've got.

792
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,150
Every microexpression and emblem we could find that displays anger,

793
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,070
contempt,hostility, latent violence or anything like them.

794
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,650
All right,we've had the secret service and the wedding planner

795
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,860
go over the guest list with the video.

796
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,160
As-As far as we can tell, we have seen every guest.

797
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,620
If someone was concealing homicidal intent,

798
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,570
he wasn't on camera.

799
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,280
Oh,Loker's right.

800
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,160
So,then, where was he?

801
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,990
Tell Aronson to let the guests go.

802
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,310
I know who we need to talk to.

803
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,400
Well,thanks for letting us look through your stuff.

804
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,290
It was great.

805
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,850
Very thorough.

806
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,930
In fact,the only person we didn't see on the footage was you,

807
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,570
the cameramen, which makes sense.

808
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,620
I mean,cameraman's not supposed to be on camera,right?

809
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:09,210
Now,I talked earlier about an expression that's displayed

810
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,670
when you're about to commit an act of violence.

811
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:16,810
There's also an expression that's triggered by the motive behind that violence.

812
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,260
For example,when you went to see your ex-wife,

813
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,690
and she told you she was going to get remarried to some rich guy,

814
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,910
and she didn't care how you felt,because,

815
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,300
as far as she was concerned, you were nothing.

816
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,790
You've been replaced.

817
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,360
Now when you think back to that moment,

818
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,760
and the anger

819
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,700
that you felt...

820
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,470
...your face...

821
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,350
It shows in your face.

822
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,490
We were married.

823
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,940
That's supposed to be for life.

824
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,670
Isn't that what getting married means?

825
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,760
For better or worse?

826
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,940
Richer or poorer?

827
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,380
Sickness and health?

828
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,110
Right?

829
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,540
He's former military.

830
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,970
He and Phoebe were married four years ago.

831
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,620
Her name was Carla DiMeo then.

832
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:44,850
They divorced.

833
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,980
She changed her name, moved to D.C.

834
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,660
He tracked her down a couple months ago.

835
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,940
How did he get through security?

836
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,420
Well,he probably spent months planning this.

837
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,580
He was obsessed.

838
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,250
He remachined his pistol to break apart in smaller pieces.

839
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,110
It looked like camera equipment inside his bag.

840
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,220
That's romantic.

841
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,270
Aronson?

842
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:01,780
Excuse me.

843
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,010
Dr. Lightman. Dr. Foster.

844
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,270
Thank you so much.

845
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,340
I saw them take Howard away.

846
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,880
Did he hurt somebody else?

847
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:22,870
No.

848
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,470
I had no idea he was here during the wedding.

849
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,720
I would have said something if I had.

850
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,900
I never meant to lie to anybody.

851
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,860
It didn't even feel like lying,really.

852
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,880
It's just...

853
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,480
I was so unhappy when I left Michigan,

854
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,950
and changing my name,and pretending

855
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,800
like none of it happened-- it was just such a relief.

856
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,910
Tell Won-Hee...

857
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,250
Won-Hee is awake.

858
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,520
He's asking for you.

859
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,610
We should go see him.

860
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,950
Okay.

861
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:50,980
Hey.

862
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,050
Full day,huh?

863
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,940
Want to get a drink,celebrate?

864
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,450
I don't think that's a good idea.

865
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,790
Didn't we get past the tough talk?

866
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,500
Yeah,we did.

867
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,490
Still don't think it's a good idea.

868
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:16,200
You know,we were briefed on your team before you guys came in,

869
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,630
and,uh,I know what you can do,and

870
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,450
it doesn't scare me.

871
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,730
I got nothing to hide.

872
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,210
So,come on. It's just a drink.

873
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,730
The problem is...

874
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,780
I like you.

875
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,410
And that's a problem because?

876
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,960
Because it'll be more than just a drink.

877
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,940
And then it'll get complicated.

878
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,680
I'll know every lie you tell, which means,

879
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,930
I'll know everything about you.

880
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,370
You sure you're up for that?

881
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,070
I'm in.

882
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,600
Okay then.

883
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,960
Uh,yeah,yeah. Maybe 20 minutes.

884
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,640
No,I made a reservation.

885
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,870
Okay. I'll see you there.

886
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,470
Date night?

887
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,820
Sort of.

888
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,530
More of an apology date,really.

889
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,890
What are you apologizing for?

890
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,730
Oh,he asked for my help getting out of the embassy,

891
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,630
and I turned him down.

892
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,750
Now,you're not supposed to do that when you're married.

893
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:15,390
You remember?

894
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,180
You did the right thing.

895
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,820
Oh,you're not my husband.

896
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,950
Alec's trying to move up at State,which means doing

897
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,460
favors for your bosses and getting to the right meetings,

898
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,820
which I could have helped him with.

899
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:30,140
