1
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,914
Logan, what are you doing here?

2
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:37,709
I want you to find my mother.

3
00:00:40,202 --> 00:00:42,619
Relax, I'm not asking you to drag the lake.

4
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:45,906
My mother didn't really kill herself.

5
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:47,605
Come inside, okay?

6
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:54,942
Veronica, she's not dead.

7
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,448
What makes you think she's still alive?

8
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:01,558
Why does everyone assume that she's not?

9
00:01:02,172 --> 00:01:03,468
I mean, there's no body.

10
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:08,173
What about the woman who saw her jump? It's been on every channel.

11
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,090
If she's on the tv, she must be telling the truth.

12
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,200
But her credit cards were missing.

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,130
Doesn't that seem like... I don't know, a clue?

14
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:20,621
You don't jump off a bridge with your platinum card.

15
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:22,591
- Logan, I-- 
- I know my mother!

16
00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:24,383
Okay...

17
00:01:26,318 --> 00:01:28,106
I heard she left a note.

18
00:01:28,316 --> 00:01:30,621
Well, yeah, she wants people to think she's dead.

19
00:01:31,797 --> 00:01:35,929
But if she was going to really do the deed, it would be chardonnay and sleeping pills.

20
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:40,722
You know, she wouldn't risk being found bug-eyed and bloated in some shrimp net.

21
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:43,538
I'll see what I can find out.

22
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:45,929
You know what...

23
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:51,341
I just need to know she's okay.

24
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:58,505
Scholars! Thinkers!

25
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,706
Learned charges!

26
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:03,685
You asked for it.

27
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:04,909
You got it.

28
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,133
World history review, roundup and death match.

29
00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:11,662
Who will reign supreme?

30
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:16,766
Will it be the age of enlightenment rock stars?!

31
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:23,454
Or will it be the children of the industrial revolution?!

32
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:28,051
Blood is in the air.

33
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:31,175
Blood! Round one!

34
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:33,541
Let's take a look at the board!

35
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:41,308
The question is: what are five leading causes of the fall of the roman empire?

36
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,297
Team captain Corazon Soliman, your answer?

37
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,658
The huns kicked their ass.

38
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:51,620
The correct answer was invading germanic hordes.

39
00:02:52,612 --> 00:02:53,652
Judges?

40
00:02:54,723 --> 00:02:58,204
Judges award the point! Children of the industrial revolution,

41
00:02:58,286 --> 00:03:00,430
you control the board!

42
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:03,795
You know the rules.

43
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:06,984
I can call on any team member.

44
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:11,638
Who will be the weakest link?

45
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:16,836
Wallace Fennel, show me what you got.

46
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:18,473
All right, Mr. Rooks.

47
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:21,039
They relied too much on slave labor.

48
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:23,871
Can I see "slave labor"?!

49
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:28,991
Two more answers.

50
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:36,784
Uh-oh. I see someone hiding back there, trying to disappear completely.

51
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:39,092
Carrie bishop...

52
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:41,545
sock it to me, baby!

53
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:45,150
The answer is, I'm not pregnant.

54
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:49,072
So you can quit dodging my calls, and you can keep your money to "take care of it."

55
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:52,226
And while we're at it, here's your key back.

56
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:54,059
I won't be needing it anymore.

57
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,538
Are you okay?

58
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:34,118
Oh, been better.

59
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:40,457
She's making it up, you know.

60
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:46,360
I never touched that girl. I've never seen her outside of class.

61
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:47,353
I know.

62
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:49,570
Yeah, but it's not going to matter.

63
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:54,797
Class has been out less than a minute and I would guess that...

64
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:57,721
everyone in this school has heard by now.

65
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,182
That's probably a good guess.

66
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:03,517
This is all I ever wanted to do.

67
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:09,467
- And it's over. 
- Not if I can help it.

68
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:24,525
Young teacher, the subject of schoolgirl fantasy.

69
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:30,976
She wants him so badly knows what she wants to be.

70
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:34,437
Temptation, frustration,

71
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:38,010
so bad it makes him cry.

72
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,216
Her bus stop, she's waiting;

73
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:44,204
his car is warm and dry...

74
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:45,839
That's rough, man.

75
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:48,865
Don't look to me for sympathy.

76
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:54,460
Carrie has had a long and storied reign as the gossip queen of Neptune High.

77
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:56,080
You get a crown with that?

78
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:58,870
Do something for me?

79
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:00,488
Let me guess:

80
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:02,659
borrow her permanent file?

81
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:05,623
I remember when you were new and eager to please.

82
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,932
Good times.

83
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:09,141
Hey!

84
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:13,424
Can I ask you kind of a weird favor?

85
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:14,901
Depends how weird.

86
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:19,401
Our family physician just retired to Death Valley... literally.

87
00:06:19,472 --> 00:06:21,419
I know it sounds like a metaphor, but it's not.

88
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,521
Anyway, we need a new general practitioner.

89
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:28,740
- Can I get the name of yours? 
- Sure. Dr. Al Levine. He's in the book.

90
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,342
- Thanks. 
- Yeah, no problem.

91
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,549
He's kind of expensive, though.

92
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:33,885
We've got insurance.

93
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,671
Al Levine -- got it.

94
00:06:39,814 --> 00:06:43,236
It's time to find out what this mystery illness is you're suffering from.

95
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,281
Carrie's file.

96
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:55,446
If you are caught with this, I will disavow any knowledge of you or your mission.

97
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:56,869
You'll be on your own.

98
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:57,741
Don't worry.

99
00:06:57,971 --> 00:07:00,377
I've got a cyanide capsule in a false tooth.

100
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:02,685
If  I'm caught, I'll do the honorable thing.

101
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,531
It's been a privilege knowing you, Mars.

102
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,417
Well, well, well, Carrie. I'm not sure this is the--

103
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:18,429
It's a good read?

104
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:22,464
Any news?

105
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:26,181
I put notices on your mom's credit cards and on her ATM card.

106
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:26,964
Meaning what?

107
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:29,883
Meaning a friend of my father's who works at your family bank

108
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:32,592
will text-message me if any of the cards are used.

109
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:36,064
And you know that eyewitness that's been clogging up the airwaves?

110
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,015
Yeah.  Opportunistic hag.

111
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:39,263
That's the one.

112
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,413
Well, she's giving a statement at the Sheriff's Department tomorrow.

113
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:44,737
I'll drop by, see if she's up for a chat.

114
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:45,812
Well, I'll go with you.

115
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:51,117
Actually, despite popular opinion, you really can't *beat* the truth out of someone.

116
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,755
Listen, I'm going.

117
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:56,902
You're not.

118
00:07:58,419 --> 00:07:59,846
What are you going to stop me with?

119
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:04,096
Force of will, strength of character, tenacity, karate chop...

120
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:07,598
I will know if she's lying, okay. You won't.

121
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:10,967
Fine. I've got a plan.

122
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,478
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

123
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:14,829
Hey, Carrie, wait up!

124
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,334
Why? Did you want the chance to tell me how much you admired me for my brave stand?

125
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:21,457
I want to give you a chance to recant before I prove you're lying.

126
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:22,948
Why do you even care?

127
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,001
There aren't many great teachers. Mr. Rooks is one of them.

128
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:29,503
Yeah, if you can get past the part where he seduces his students.

129
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,246
Hey, Carrie, this is me: Veronica. I know you.

130
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,051
You're so naive.

131
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:37,986
Yeah, that's me... naive.

132
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:41,991
Mr. Rooks called your parents in for a parent-teacher conference last September.

133
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:45,575
Hardly seems like something an illicit boyfriend would do.

134
00:08:45,749 --> 00:08:46,834
Believe what you want.

135
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:50,147
Never cared what you thought of me before, no reason to start now.

136
00:08:58,897 --> 00:08:59,716
Hey, sweetie.

137
00:09:00,043 --> 00:09:00,672
Hey.

138
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:03,899
Hey, you know a teacher named Chuck Rooks? Teaches history?

139
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:05,409
Yeah, I'm in his class.

140
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:08,994
Oh, good, good. I want you to find out whatever you can about him.

141
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:09,772
Why?

142
00:09:09,941 --> 00:09:13,590
Well, the parents of a girl named Carrie Bishop just hired us to investigate.

143
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:17,160
Apparently, Carrie filed a sexual-harassment claim against him this afternoon.

144
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,290
They want him fired.

145
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,340
What's wrong?

146
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,150
Calm down. What are you so upset about?

147
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:35,730
Mr. Rooks is an amazing teacher; one of the few good teachers at Neptune High.

148
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:38,383
And you're just going to join the witch-hunt to get him fired?

149
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,602
I'm just running a background check. I'm not organizing a stoning in the town square.

150
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:46,370
For the record, I can't help you. I've already volunteered to work with him.

151
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:49,367
You know how I dread going to that school every day?

152
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:52,304
His class is one of the few things that I look forward to.

153
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,423
Well, I'm sorry. This is my business, honey.

154
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,679
It's what I do. Besides, the girl deserves to be heard.

155
00:09:57,741 --> 00:09:59,195
No, actually, she doesn't.

156
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:01,602
She's a liar and a gossip and a manipulator.

157
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,737
- What makes you think that? 
- I just do.

158
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:07,710
Well, I can't drop a case based on a feeling you have. I'm sorry.

159
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:09,751
Fine.

160
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:12,107
You can answer your own phone.

161
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:18,549
- I'm surprised I lasted as long as I did. 
- I know.

162
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:22,465
I mean, of all of the girls in the school Duncan could have gone out with... Veronica Mars?

163
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,052
I mean, how insane is that?

164
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:27,508
- He's out of his mind. 
- That's for sure.

165
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:30,187
She really got her claws into him.

166
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,067
You know, I actually sort of feel sorry for the guy.

167
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,386
You know all she's after is his money.

168
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:37,345
No, I mean, he's literally crazy. Like looney-bin crazy.

169
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:38,460
What are you talking about?

170
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:41,416
You know how Brian's brother is a resident at the hospital?

171
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:45,839
Brian told Ashley that last week, Duncan was brought in kicking and screaming,

172
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:48,461
foaming at the mouth, calling out Veronica's name.

173
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,954
It took like three orderlies to get him in a straight jacket.

174
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,071
Come on!

175
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:53,397
That's what I heard.

176
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:03,749
Carrie Bishop and Susan Knight. Go figure.

177
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:13,482
We should do this more often.

178
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:16,785
Thank you, detective.

179
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:20,573
That's her.

180
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:25,591
Down, boy. Relax, I've got it covered.

181
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:28,356
White trash walking.

182
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,462
I know, gadgets and all.

183
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,566
Ms. Stanton. Cliff McCormack from "Weekly World News."

184
00:11:38,617 --> 00:11:41,090
My boss is very interested in your story.

185
00:11:41,162 --> 00:11:44,265
Are we talking an exclusive, or what? 'Cause I'm getting lots of offers.

186
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:45,866
Definitely an exclusive.

187
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:47,091
Well, what's the offer?

188
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:52,810
It depends on what you've got. Did she look intoxicated, drugged up, bruised?

189
00:11:52,957 --> 00:11:54,683
If you'd like, sure.

190
00:11:54,836 --> 00:11:59,173
So, what?! You couldn't get on "Springer" this week, so you make lies up about my mom?

191
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:02,748
You know, I am sure the trailer payments must be high.

192
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,884
- And what with the high price of spam these days-- 
- Okay, enough.

193
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:11,211
Thanks, Cliff. You're the best.

194
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:14,365
If by "best" you mean "willing." You owe me one, kid.

195
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:19,920
Hey.

196
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:21,815
Hi.

197
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:28,266
I have to take care of something. I'll be like two seconds. Stay calm.

198
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:31,435
Finding out what that woman is about is good news.

199
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:37,416
Deputy...

200
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:39,360
What  do you want, Veronica?

201
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:40,662
A chance to explain.

202
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,842
What's to explain? You used me. I get it.

203
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,080
Lilly Kane was my best friend.

204
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:48,248
Listen, I know all about your dad and the murder investigation--

205
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:51,387
No, you don't. You know the story that everyone else knows.

206
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:53,062
A guy confessed. He said he did it.

207
00:12:54,947 --> 00:12:58,592
Did you know that the head of security at Kane Software was the one

208
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:00,824
that made the tip call that got Abel Koontz arrested?

209
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,299
Did you know that your own crime-scene photos make it impossible for Abel

210
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:09,324
to have left the Kane house with a pair of Lilly's shoes that they found on his houseboat?

211
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:13,332
Did you know there's a traffic ticket that proves that Lilly's time of death is three hours off?

212
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:14,660
How do you know all this?

213
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:19,307
I know all of this because I have done everything I could to get to the truth...

214
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:23,619
including using you. And I'm really sorry about that.

215
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:27,022
But I used you, then fell for you, not the other way around.

216
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:29,113
You fell for me?

217
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:43,536
Hello?

218
00:13:50,274 --> 00:13:51,948
Hey, Veronica...

219
00:13:53,494 --> 00:13:56,741
Uh, come on in. Meet my daughter, Olivia.

220
00:14:04,238 --> 00:14:05,470
Hi, Olivia.

221
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:08,874
I'm one of your dad's students, Veronica.

222
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:11,358
She must be going through a shy phase.

223
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:13,811
No, not really. She's usually pretty gregarious.

224
00:14:13,913 --> 00:14:15,925
She must really dislike you.

225
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,799
There's a club she can join.

226
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:22,915
Sweetie, why don't you go finish your coloring. I'll come in and join you, okay?

227
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:28,700
There you go.

228
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:33,108
She's adorable.

229
00:14:33,257 --> 00:14:36,774
Well, if you get past her megalomania and reactionary politics...

230
00:14:37,634 --> 00:14:41,008
I get her on the weekends. My ex-wife has her during the week.

231
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:43,303
I'm sorry to intrude on your weekend.

232
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:45,134
Oh, no problem. What's on your mind?

233
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:50,065
A few months ago, you called a parent-teacher conference with Carrie's parents?

234
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:52,774
- How would you know that? 
- I can't reveal my sources.

235
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:58,324
Uh... Veronica, I appreciate your offer of help. It's very generous.

236
00:14:58,396 --> 00:15:00,690
But I really think this is an adult matter.

237
00:15:00,782 --> 00:15:04,837
Right now, Carrie's parents have a private investigator running a background check on you.

238
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,177
There's going to be a hearing.

239
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:09,921
If the school board believes Carrie's allegations, you'll never teach again.

240
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:13,976
Her parents came to see me about her grades. I gave her a "C" on her midterm paper.

241
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:19,183
She thought it was unfair that the black mark on her transcript would keep her out of Cornell.

242
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:22,660
Do you suppose that's why she's after you -- spoiling her Ivy League dreams?

243
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,945
Honestly, I couldn't tell you.

244
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:26,398
Do you have anyone representing you at the school board hearing?

245
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:28,015
Mmm, faculty union rep.

246
00:15:28,152 --> 00:15:29,029
Who's that?

247
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:31,082
You're looking at him.

248
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:39,423
Any messages?

249
00:15:46,157 --> 00:15:49,304
Veronica... I know you admire this guy,

250
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,724
and I encourage you to stand up for your convictions when you think you're right.

251
00:15:53,124 --> 00:15:56,806
But Rooks is a bad egg and I don't want you getting hurt when the whole story comes out.

252
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:58,392
I'm sorry. I believe him.

253
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:01,317
Carrie kept a very detailed diary of her affair with him.

254
00:16:01,398 --> 00:16:03,145
It's full of times and dates.

255
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:07,866
She recorded the very date of a weekend she spent in a hotel with him when her parents were out of town.

256
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:11,997
She writes about him taking her to a fancy restaurant in San Diego

257
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:15,806
after she won the District Extemporaneous Speaking Competition.

258
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:18,259
So? That doesn't prove anything.

259
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:22,278
I could write down that I met Kid Rock every weekend at the Hedonism Lodge

260
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:25,473
for sensual massage and smoothies, but that doesn't make it true!

261
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:28,723
I did a cross check of Rooks' credit card history.

262
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:32,912
The charges match Carrie's diary.

263
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:34,977
She could have followed him.

264
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,763
Sweetie, it's very specific.

265
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:40,654
And I don't want you seeing Kid Rock.

266
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,501
Dr. Levine's office.

267
00:16:49,691 --> 00:16:54,329
Hi, this is Veronica Mars. I was wondering if I could get in to see the doctor sometime this week?

268
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:56,537
End of the day would be best.

269
00:16:56,706 --> 00:16:58,862
I have band practice after school.

270
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:02,523
- How's 5:00? 
- 5:00 is great. Thanks.

271
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:09,066
I'm no doctor,but I'm pretty sure Penicillin will clear that problem right up.

272
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:10,806
Can't say I was expecting you.

273
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,623
Yeah. Yeah, I usually avoid buildings with stained glass.

274
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:18,506
That's why you haven't come to visit.

275
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:25,265
There's a woman who saw my mom get out of her car and get in a van with a mysterious stranger.

276
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:30,585
There's also a jungle tribe that worships Donald Trump's hair. It's a tabloid.

277
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:33,524
So the girl with the pig arm can't really bowl?

278
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:36,612
I just don't want you to get your hopes up.

279
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:38,792
I'm not paying you to worry about my hopes.

280
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:40,892
I'm paying you to follow leads.

281
00:17:41,002 --> 00:17:42,538
I wasn't aware you were paying me.

282
00:17:42,618 --> 00:17:46,666
This isn't a favor, it's a job, you know. I mean, we're not exchanging friendship bracelets.

283
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:47,870
I'll stop braiding.

284
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:52,426
The woman said my mom was laughing and having fun.

285
00:17:53,901 --> 00:17:56,421
And so do whatever it is you do and track her down.

286
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:59,134
Sondra Bolan of Sunset Springs.

287
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:01,440
How am I going to find her?

288
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:09,870
In Sunset Springs. Sondra Bolan.

289
00:18:10,582 --> 00:18:11,959
I'll put it on your bill.

290
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,956
Hi, Sondra. This is Veronica of "The National Instigator."

291
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:20,444
I had a few follow-up questions on your Lynn Echolls story.

292
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:23,987
Actually, in person is a lot better.

293
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:28,732
No, Tuesday night's no good -- newspaper work night.

294
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:29,691
What are you doing?

295
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:32,072
Any chance you're available right now?

296
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:38,201
So I'm not sure how much you were paid for the last interview, but--

297
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:41,917
Oh, I wasn't paid. I thought people should know the truth

298
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,506
with that woman lying on every talk show.

299
00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:48,159
So is there anything else you remember?

300
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:52,254
The  model of the van? Maybe a piece of the license plate?

301
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:55,264
Honestly, I was just so excited to see Lynn.

302
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:57,728
I thought they were filming a movie or something.

303
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,891
Have you ever seen Lynn Echolls before?

304
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:05,218
Once. The premiere of "Delta Blue Bombers."

305
00:19:05,368 --> 00:19:07,482
She was on the red carpet with Aaron.

306
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:10,046
I must have seen that movie a hundred times.

307
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:11,486
A hundred times?

308
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:12,663
I can check if you want.

309
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:21,194
So the van... in the interview, you said the van was blue?

310
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:25,519
It was the van from "The Pursuit of Happiness." The exact van.

311
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:26,821
You mean the exact model?

312
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:29,729
No, the actual van from the movie.

313
00:19:30,242 --> 00:19:33,555
Lynn and Aaron met on the set of "The Pursuit of Happiness," you know.

314
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:35,570
They were so young then.

315
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:40,434
I don't know why anyone could ever think she'd kill herself.

316
00:19:40,874 --> 00:19:43,203
She is the luckiest woman in the world.

317
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:44,151
Excuse me.

318
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:52,215
I would have done the same thing.

319
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:53,224
Done what?

320
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:57,581
If it was my mother, I would have let myself believe that story.

321
00:20:01,244 --> 00:20:02,937
Hey, manners, Opie!

322
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:05,584
What, did he lose a puka shell?

323
00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:06,792
No...

324
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:12,025
just the last ounce of hope that his mother was still alive.

325
00:20:20,632 --> 00:20:22,915
Is that lasagna I smell?

326
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,805
Keith Mars' secret recipe.

327
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:27,805
You double the cheese. Your secret is out.

328
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:30,739
You're making salad?

329
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:34,405
I know pity cooking when I see it.

330
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:36,867
There must be more bad news.

331
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:40,862
Maybe we should wait 'til after dinner, huh?

332
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:44,461
Spill it. I promise I won't let it ruin my appetite.

333
00:20:45,594 --> 00:20:49,129
Rooks was fired from his last job at a private school.

334
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:54,604
His file is sealed, but the complaint came from the parents of two girls.

335
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,504
- I want to see Carrie's journal. 
- You know I can't let you.

336
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:06,902
There better be dessert.

337
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:13,502
If I'm going to save Mr. Rooks' job, I have to get my hands on this supposed diary.

338
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:24,080
Unfortunately, dad's changed the combination.

339
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,631
It's the rare individual who chooses meaningless numbers as a combination.

340
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:29,784
He taught me that.

341
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:35,701
Nine times out of ten, an individual will select numbers that mean something --

342
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,302
birthdays, anniversaries, addresses.

343
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,691
Of course, dad is smarter than that.

344
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:47,796
You wouldn't believe the number of people who keep the combination written down on a post-it,

345
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:53,434
or tacked to a bulletin board, or scribbled on a birthday page of their page-a-day calendar.

346
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:56,239
Somehow, I doubt dad's that careless.

347
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:03,525
Then again, he'll be glad to know how much I've soaked up listening to him.

348
00:22:10,753 --> 00:22:12,587
And what do we have here?

349
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:32,720
I suspect there's also a lesson to be learned here.

350
00:22:39,504 --> 00:22:41,940
Hey, honey. What have you been up to?

351
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:46,180
Tell me where to put your "Father of the Year" trophy.

352
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:48,065
'Cause there's some place I'd like to put it.

353
00:22:48,187 --> 00:22:50,793
Wow. Good thing I didn't go with a bear trap.

354
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:53,870
This is not funny.

355
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:57,102
I need to see that diary. She's lying. I know it.

356
00:22:57,173 --> 00:22:59,616
I can feel it with every fiber of my being.

357
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:01,618
Honey, you don't have to get all blue in the face.

358
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,857
You're patronizing me?

359
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:05,089
To be fair, I am your patron.

360
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:08,477
The Bishops are going to use your credit card research and that diary

361
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:10,505
to prove the two of them were together.

362
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:14,028
Just give me the dates and times -- I don't have to read the diary.

363
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:16,640
Do you want to be responsible for taking a good man down?

364
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:18,676
Destroying his reputation?

365
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:20,767
Can you possibly relate?

366
00:23:22,641 --> 00:23:24,585
Dates and times -- that's it.

367
00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:38,496
If you're looking for my trophy, it's back by auto shop.

368
00:23:38,978 --> 00:23:42,270
Lube job? Or can you medal in stealing hubcaps?

369
00:23:42,382 --> 00:23:45,148
Is this 1970? Rims, baby.

370
00:23:45,231 --> 00:23:46,867
So you got a trophy for a rim job?

371
00:23:47,682 --> 00:23:50,344
Forget it. I got some information for you.

372
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,611
Finally, a Deep Throat to call my own.

373
00:23:53,718 --> 00:23:57,502
I'm not going to touch that one. Uh, I hear this freshman kid's been shooting his mouth off

374
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:01,040
that he's got proof that Lynn Echolls jumped and he's gonna make millions.

375
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:01,931
Who's the kid?

376
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,345
Do you want me to find out?

377
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:04,793
Do you even have to ask?

378
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:09,498
- Can I ask you something? 
- Shoot.

379
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,611
Why were you fired from your last job?

380
00:24:13,358 --> 00:24:15,653
- How on earth do you know-- 
- I just do.

381
00:24:15,832 --> 00:24:20,387
Wow. Maybe I should give more credence to the teacher's lounge gossip.

382
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,261
Colleagues said you were...

383
00:24:24,144 --> 00:24:25,651
unique...

384
00:24:27,106 --> 00:24:28,023
gifted...

385
00:24:31,004 --> 00:24:31,844
unsettling.

386
00:24:31,952 --> 00:24:35,009
I was hoping for delightful, but what can you do.

387
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:38,032
So...

388
00:24:39,108 --> 00:24:40,869
My firing... yeah.

389
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:44,995
It was an all-girls school on the conservative side.

390
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:51,308
I had the temerity to suggest U.S. Imperialism wasn't necessarily a good thing.

391
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:57,688
They thought I was trying to turn their daughters into little berét-wearing, clove-smoking Bolsheviks.

392
00:24:57,847 --> 00:24:59,465
- Were you? 
- Nyet!

393
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:01,109
That's it?

394
00:25:01,272 --> 00:25:07,039
Well, that, and I was driving an '89 Harley. Didn't really endear me to the administration.

395
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,796
Thanks, Mr. Rooks.

396
00:25:11,615 --> 00:25:13,791
Do svidaniya, Veronica.

397
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:21,359
I'm giving you another chance. Drop the complaint against Mr. Rooks.

398
00:25:21,463 --> 00:25:24,092
Yeah. I remember when I was in love with him, too.

399
00:25:24,595 --> 00:25:27,708
Did you ever consider that I just really dislike you?

400
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,805
Wow, does that mean you won't be signing my yearbook?

401
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:33,900
You're still in Mr. Rooks' class. You must not be too shook up.

402
00:25:34,044 --> 00:25:36,371
I need his class to graduate.

403
00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:38,772
And he'll be the one leaving... soon.

404
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:42,224
All this because he gave you a "C" on your paper? You'd destroy him?

405
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:43,130
Destroy him?

406
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:47,906
From where I stand, he's become more popular than ever. I'm the bitch that everyone hates.

407
00:25:48,074 --> 00:25:50,246
Are you interested in details, Veronica?

408
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:52,345
Can I help enrich your fantasy life?

409
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,777
He says "baby" a lot when he touches you.

410
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:56,891
His sheets are black, silk.

411
00:25:56,959 --> 00:26:00,178
His mood music is side two of the Rolling Stones' "Tattoo You."

412
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:03,727
He'll tear up as he tells you the story of his ex-wife leaving him.

413
00:26:03,988 --> 00:26:05,626
You'll turn to jelly.

414
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:09,052
Yeah, I have that same "Sweet Valley High" book.

415
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:12,908
You said you spent the night in a hotel with Mr. Rooks on April 23,

416
00:26:12,964 --> 00:26:14,847
but there's a problem with that story, isn't there?

417
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:17,459
Why don't you tell me? It's obvious you're dying to.

418
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:24,892
All right. The problem with that story is that you were at an overnight track meet in Sacramento that weekend.

419
00:26:25,215 --> 00:26:28,119
You were part of the winning 1,600-meter relay.

420
00:26:29,945 --> 00:26:31,755
People say you're fast.

421
00:26:41,154 --> 00:26:44,677
Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm always busy at the end of the day.

422
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:49,025
Those sniffles -- probably just light allergies, not uncommon.

423
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:50,546
So I can put my shirt back on?

424
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,363
Uh, sure. Yes, of course.

425
00:26:56,816 --> 00:27:01,384
One problem with doctors, besides their fetish for making you wait half-naked in cold rooms,

426
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:05,609
is they won't just let you ransack their files, even if you ask real nice.

427
00:27:06,273 --> 00:27:11,752
So someone like me has to resort to methods the insurance companies would probably not support.

428
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:15,224
- Good night, Nancy. 
- Good night.

429
00:27:52,715 --> 00:27:56,655
Okay, yes, I am petite, and it does come in handy every now and then.

430
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:30,831
I'm generally pretty cool with coincidence, but when Abel Koontz turns out to share a doctor with the Kanes,

431
00:28:30,887 --> 00:28:34,876
that's too much for me to ignore, even if it means getting caught.

432
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:36,427
Wha--?

433
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:41,041
Is the doctor here? 'Cause I've been sitting for like an hour.

434
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:45,899
This experience has ruined me.

435
00:28:47,763 --> 00:28:49,391
I mean, the stories in the newspaper.

436
00:28:49,581 --> 00:28:55,714
My peers in the faculty lounge stop talking when I enter.

437
00:28:55,863 --> 00:29:00,936
Mr. Rooks, do you have any guess why Miss Bishop would file this grievance?

438
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:07,860
Carrie is a solid "B" student in my class.

439
00:29:08,504 --> 00:29:10,902
She made it very clear she needed an "A"...

440
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:17,756
but the work just didn't merit it.

441
00:29:18,888 --> 00:29:20,910
My dad left my mom last year,

442
00:29:21,196 --> 00:29:24,285
and I was pretty lost.

443
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:29,010
Mr. Rooks started giving me rides home from our mock U.N. Meetings,

444
00:29:29,656 --> 00:29:32,313
and we'd just talk. He said that we had a lot in common,

445
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:36,578
that we'd both been abandoned by people we thought loved us because of his wife.

446
00:29:38,346 --> 00:29:40,689
At first we just kissed,

447
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:44,569
but... it went beyond that.

448
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:48,246
When I told him I thought I might be pregnant, he just blew me off.

449
00:29:48,614 --> 00:29:51,795
When I saw him flirting with other girls, I just decided,

450
00:29:52,603 --> 00:29:54,267
"I guess this is what he does."

451
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:57,263
And I couldn't let him get away with it again.

452
00:29:57,425 --> 00:29:59,690
These are very serious charges, Carrie.

453
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:03,868
Is there any proof you can offer beyond your testimony?

454
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:09,816
He sent me text messages all the time.

455
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:14,435
April 9th: "Let's meet for tutoring. Clothing optional."

456
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:19,018
April 14th: "I miss your scent. Call me."

457
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,983
April 29th: "come to school without your underwear. You'll be rewarded."

458
00:30:34,127 --> 00:30:35,878
They're addressed to "S.K."

459
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:39,544
He used to call me "Sweet Knees."

460
00:30:39,758 --> 00:30:41,806
He always wanted me to wear knee socks.

461
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:46,666
I'm not sure we have proof that Mr. Rooks actually sent you these messages.

462
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:48,243
Hit the call-back button there.

463
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:04,848
Mr. Clemmons, can I borrow your cell for a minute?

464
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:07,228
My car broke down in the parking lot.

465
00:31:19,568 --> 00:31:25,446
Mr. Clemmons, what can you tell us about your interaction with Mr. Rooks that might be relevant?

466
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,067
Well, he's a very popular teacher.

467
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:32,244
The student body has voted him "best teacher" three of the four years he's been with us.

468
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:33,392
Thank you, Mr. Clemmons.

469
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:37,780
Um, Mrs. Fuller, if I may?

470
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:48,025
Could I ask you to get out your own cell phone and, uh, check the messages?

471
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,259
Now check and see if you have messages.

472
00:31:58,353 --> 00:32:00,288
I have three new messages.

473
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:01,971
Can you read them out loud?

474
00:32:02,366 --> 00:32:06,323
The first one says, "true pirates share their booty."

475
00:32:07,522 --> 00:32:10,573
The second, "I'll be your little spoon."

476
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:16,097
And finally, "vice principals make the best lovers."

477
00:32:17,987 --> 00:32:19,753
Mind hitting redial?

478
00:32:28,688 --> 00:32:33,194
I think we have to conclude that either the two of you are having an affair...

479
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:40,474
or that it's extremely easy to create false text messages on someone's cellphone.

480
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:56,434
In a situation like we have here today, the burden of proof is on the accuser.

481
00:32:56,787 --> 00:33:03,044
We find no conclusive evidence to substantiate the claim that these alleged encounters ever happened.

482
00:33:04,385 --> 00:33:08,558
Mr. Rooks will continue on as a teacher at this school.

483
00:33:17,768 --> 00:33:19,734
You didn't have to come all the way over here.

484
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:22,822
I know, but I felt really stupid getting out of there with your phone.

485
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:24,224
Sorry.

486
00:33:24,318 --> 00:33:27,446
Well, I appreciate you hooking me up with password protection.

487
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,109
That's what I do.

488
00:33:29,203 --> 00:33:32,203
Hey, you want some pizza? It just got delivered.

489
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:35,106
They had a two-for-one deal. I'm swimming in it.

490
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:39,995
Um... one slice. I have this newspaper work night thing.

491
00:33:43,906 --> 00:33:46,862
Nice. You must have a gay friend.

492
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:51,987
No, I literally duplicated a page from the "Z Gallery" catalog.

493
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:52,981
Something to drink?

494
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,577
Whatever you're having.

495
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:56,348
Diet anything is good.

496
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:58,791
- Can I use your bathroom? 
- Sure, down the hall.

497
00:34:14,406 --> 00:34:15,875
Is that Mick Jagger?

498
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:25,962
I have to get back to the journalism room. Rain check on the pizza?

499
00:34:26,049 --> 00:34:26,966
Absolutely.

500
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:28,281
See you tomorrow.

501
00:34:29,554 --> 00:34:35,188
Best way to stop wondering if your favorite teacher was trying to lure you between his black silk sheets?

502
00:34:35,254 --> 00:34:38,230
Research the mystery condition that's causing your ex-boyfriend

503
00:34:38,318 --> 00:34:41,564
and possible half brother to take Oxcarbazepine.

504
00:34:42,086 --> 00:34:46,177
Hmm... it's a drug used to treat type 4 epilepsy.

505
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:50,651
Symptoms include hysterical, violent, emotional fits that can't be controlled

506
00:34:50,718 --> 00:34:54,528
and are often are accompanied by complete blackouts and loss of memory.

507
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:55,464
Whatcha doing?

508
00:34:56,693 --> 00:34:58,316
Google-ing myself.

509
00:34:59,602 --> 00:35:01,065
Like I'm the first.

510
00:35:01,982 --> 00:35:03,973
Find out anything interesting?

511
00:35:04,374 --> 00:35:08,084
There's a Veronica Mars in Vermont who sells pinecone porcupines.

512
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:17,455
Do you know where we keep last year's newspapers?

513
00:35:17,553 --> 00:35:19,733
In the supply cabinet. Why?

514
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:24,044
I want to see who won last year's District Extemporaneous Speaking Competition.

515
00:35:25,575 --> 00:35:26,769
Okay...

516
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:29,329
Why?

517
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:32,135
I want to know if the winner had sweet knees.

518
00:35:35,477 --> 00:35:36,452
I give up.

519
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:47,888
- What city? 
- Neptune.

520
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,321
I need a listing for the Knight family.

521
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:52,296
- Ninth street? 
- Is there more than one?

522
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:53,433
No.

523
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:55,195
Then that would be it.

524
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,552
Please hold for your number.

525
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:11,138
Veronica Mars?

526
00:36:11,525 --> 00:36:15,546
Carrie's story is true, isn't it? It just didn't happen to her.

527
00:36:16,418 --> 00:36:20,735
She copied your diary, and it was your cellphone she showed in court.

528
00:36:21,406 --> 00:36:25,604
You got together with Rooks the night you won the Extemporaneous Speaking Competition?

529
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,949
S.K. was you, Susan Knight.

530
00:36:30,836 --> 00:36:32,274
My parents disowned me.

531
00:36:34,011 --> 00:36:35,860
I wouldn't tell them who the father is

532
00:36:36,632 --> 00:36:41,768
because I knew if I did, they would press charges for statutory rape, and I don't want that.

533
00:36:41,843 --> 00:36:45,008
There's something I'm not getting. Why would Carrie tell your story?

534
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:47,042
Because she thought what he did was wrong.

535
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:49,550
Do you know when I told Mr. Rooks I was pregnant,

536
00:36:49,611 --> 00:36:52,734
he gave me $500 and told me I should go take care of it?

537
00:36:52,807 --> 00:36:55,295
It made her crazy there were no consequences for what he did.

538
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:57,732
Meanwhile, I had to run out of town in shame?

539
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,225
Look, it made me crazy too, but...

540
00:37:02,207 --> 00:37:03,716
I can't come forward.

541
00:37:05,915 --> 00:37:07,583
I'm just not that brave.

542
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:13,389
You have no idea. People have put her through hell, and she just took it.

543
00:37:13,527 --> 00:37:15,443
She said most people were supportive of her.

544
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:16,596
They weren't.

545
00:37:17,732 --> 00:37:19,712
We weren't.

546
00:37:22,288 --> 00:37:24,443
Carrie just went to the mat for you.

547
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,730
One phone call, and you can make it all worth it.

548
00:37:29,184 --> 00:37:33,377
I just happen to have the school board president's cellphone number.

549
00:37:44,314 --> 00:37:45,880
I went to see Susan.

550
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:48,722
I'm sorry.

551
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,170
A lot of good that does me now.

552
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,050
Yo, V. You might want to talk to this freshman.

553
00:37:55,153 --> 00:37:58,123
He's the one who's been shooting his mouth off about Logan's mom.

554
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:01,133
Hope you don't mind telling that story one more time.

555
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:04,538
Hey... you paged?

556
00:38:06,141 --> 00:38:09,157
It seems Hart here has something to show us.

557
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,229
Spill.

558
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:15,219
Me and my friends were filming out by the bay.

559
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,201
We were making this war movie, "Storm on the Beach."

560
00:38:17,283 --> 00:38:18,906
It's just on high def, but it's pretty cool.

561
00:38:19,027 --> 00:38:21,276
- It's these two brothers who get sent to war and-- 
- Don't care.

562
00:38:21,363 --> 00:38:22,207
Point?

563
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,375
We were editing it together, and we noticed something.

564
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,433
Over there! Over there!

565
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:35,300
I see him!

566
00:38:39,798 --> 00:38:42,622
- Did you see it? 
- Yeah, it sucks, and...?

567
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,570
Rewind it. Play it frame by frame.

568
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:51,151
There! Check out the right side of the bridge.

569
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:54,690
Holy...

570
00:38:56,865 --> 00:39:00,911
The video's time-stamped 4:37 P.M. Exactly the time when...

571
00:39:01,754 --> 00:39:03,731
she supposedly jumped.

572
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:09,086
This footage better never make it out into public consumption.

573
00:39:09,153 --> 00:39:10,853
Don't worry about my boy, Hart.

574
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:14,309
He knows if that happens his last movie will be a snuff film.

575
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,418
And he'll star in it, right?

576
00:39:17,902 --> 00:39:18,794
Come on.

577
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:26,054
I'm sorry.

578
00:39:28,124 --> 00:39:29,182
So am I.

579
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:46,678
Logan!

580
00:39:47,482 --> 00:39:48,229
Logan.

581
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:54,722
Logan, your mom's missing credit card was just used.

582
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:01,879
Quiet down.

583
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,402
Quiet down, please. I have an announcement to make.

584
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,562
I regret to inform you that Mr. Rooks tendered his resignation this morning.

585
00:40:11,335 --> 00:40:13,926
I will be taking over the teaching duties in this class

586
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:17,926
until a replacement can be found by the administrat--

587
00:40:56,234 --> 00:40:57,882
Mr. Rooks resigned today.

588
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:02,429
Honey, if I were in trouble, I'd want you on my side.

589
00:41:02,598 --> 00:41:03,934
Well, that's where I'd be.

590
00:41:04,886 --> 00:41:07,457
I'll be home for dinner. Your messages are on your desk.

591
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:30,400
So... what would you like to know now, Veronica Mars, intrepid girl reporter?

592
00:41:30,748 --> 00:41:31,682
Nothing.

593
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,250
This time I just want you to know what I know.

594
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:38,893
You're dying, Abel.

595
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:42,164
You knew you were dying when you confessed.

596
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:44,260
You didn't kill Lilly Kane.

597
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:47,792
You're just somebody's patsy.

598
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:51,709
Guard?

599
00:41:57,244 --> 00:42:00,331
