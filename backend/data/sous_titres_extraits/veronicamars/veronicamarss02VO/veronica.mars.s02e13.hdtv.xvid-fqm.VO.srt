1
00:00:00,456 --> 00:00:02,183
Previously on "Veronica Mars"...

2
00:00:02,184 --> 00:00:03,240
It's Terrence Cook and...

3
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:05,316
Miss Dumass,
the journalism teacher.

4
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:06,584
Who died in the bus crash.

5
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:09,081
He also has some gambling issues.

6
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:11,977
Hi, everybody.
Say "repressed homosexuality".

7
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,534
I have information about that
mexican kid who got killed.

8
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:17,610
I'm the one who made
the anonymous call from the bridge.

9
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:19,445
It's not the guy from the bridge.

10
00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:21,155
You said the whole night was a blur.

11
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:21,812
I lied.

12
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,343
I'm not like you, Weevil.

13
00:00:23,383 --> 00:00:24,677
I don't make good speeches.

14
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:27,554
So I'm just gonna say adios.
I hope that covers it

15
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:31,650
Balboa County Sheriff Don Lamb questions
baseball legend Terrence Cook in

16
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:33,912
connection with
the Neptune High bus crash.

17
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:46,672
J.B., You need to relax
with the Elmer's.

18
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:49,581
Do I look like I enjoy
being covered in white goo?

19
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:51,899
Miss Hauser?

20
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:53,879
Enough.

21
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,447
This is a free study period,

22
00:00:55,543 --> 00:00:56,840
not a free-for-all.

23
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,271
What is it, Veronica?

24
00:00:59,272 --> 00:01:02,519
Mr. Pope said you have some
decorations for the F.B.L.A. booth?

25
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:04,052
J.B.?

26
00:01:04,577 --> 00:01:05,825
Could you go get the hills?

27
00:01:05,946 --> 00:01:07,965
Who, me? Help her?

28
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:09,462
She's my Nemesis.

29
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,047
His Nemesis?

30
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:16,981
Um, did we break up?

31
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,105
Now, that is amazing.

32
00:01:25,013 --> 00:01:26,546
Dude, check it man!

33
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:34,695
Do I need to remind you that next
week's exam is worth 30% of your grade?

34
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,866
One of these days my ship
is going to come in,

35
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,984
and I will not have to
deal with this nonsense.

36
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:42,810
So, what?

37
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:46,289
Only the kids playing with
the scissors and the glue can talk?

38
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,466
Your student council
is working very hard

39
00:01:48,518 --> 00:01:50,027
to raise money for your senior trip.

40
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:51,401
Their senior trip.

41
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:53,577
The rest of us want to go
to Magic Mountain.

42
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:56,156
It's Catalina,
and you're crazy.

43
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:58,818
I am not spending my senior trip
watching you

44
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,581
hurl hot dog and orange drink

45
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:02,225
off "batman the ride."

46
00:02:04,894 --> 00:02:06,128
Better watch your back,
veronica.

47
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:10,103
Because you're going to crush me
with hideous fake hills?

48
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:11,968
Uh, no,
the Kane scholarship.

49
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:14,779
I'm 3100 of points behind you.

50
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,953
What wonderful mountains,
Madison.

51
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:20,799
Thank you, mrs. Hauser.

52
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:25,891
Oh, Madison,
you have a little...

53
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:29,214
What, brown?
Because I'm a brown-noser?

54
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:31,411
No... glitter.

55
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:33,720
Because you're a fairy princess.

56
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:45,567
How lucky am I that I got Terrence
Cook to sign that ball for me

57
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:47,434
before he blew up my classmates?

58
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:48,831
It's gonna be worth so much more

59
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:51,627
than that napkin O.J. signed for me
at the claim jumper.

60
00:02:51,662 --> 00:02:53,638
Jackie.
Jackie, hey, wait up.

61
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,044
Sorry.

62
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:58,309
I was distracted by
the pitchforks and torches.

63
00:02:58,557 --> 00:02:59,698
So how are you?

64
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:03,036
I'm wondering if this counts
as my 15 minutes of fame.

65
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:04,222
And if so,

66
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:07,810
what does the child of an alleged
murderer wear to winter carnival?

67
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:09,430
No one expects you to go,
Jackie.

68
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:11,532
French club does.
We volunteered, remember?

69
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:13,268
<i>Je saute, vous sautez!</i>

70
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:16,007
You're not really going.

71
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:17,818
Even you're not that tacky.

72
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:19,327
School carnival?

73
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:21,997
Me, you,
in the shake shack,

74
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:23,804
doing a little
"you're the one that I want"?

75
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:25,573
I am so there.

76
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:27,744
It's not a freak show.

77
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,135
You being there will ruin everything.

78
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:34,478
That's my plan...
ruin everything.

79
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:38,419
He said he's in such pain
he can't get out of bed.

80
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,542
Three times my kid said
he saw him at the speed zone,

81
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,831
at the go-kart track.

82
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:45,910
Have you ever tried climbing
into one of those little cars?

83
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:48,820
I'm not paying this guy a dime.

84
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:51,921
I'm still waiting on the facts
from the insurance company.

85
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:05,835
I don't have an appointment.

86
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,956
I was hoping you'd have time
for a consultation.

87
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:09,779
I will,
if you don't mind waiting.

88
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,461
I can wait.

89
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:22,451
Who wants some pie?

90
00:04:24,777 --> 00:04:26,130
Two by two.

91
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,279
Apparently you can only enter
the carnival as if it were the ark.

92
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,726
Slushies!

93
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,361
Get your ice-cold frozen sugar water.

94
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,453
You had me at "ice-cold."

95
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:40,327
What's your poison?

96
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:42,640
Oh, emotionally unavailable women.

97
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:49,053
Let's see. Uh, I want something
that suits my mood.

98
00:04:49,268 --> 00:04:50,705
Ooh, I'm sorry.

99
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:52,143
We're all out of liquid evil.

100
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:54,753
I'll take two of whatever
will turn my tongue blue.

101
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:56,012
Hot date?

102
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:56,911
Rain  check?

103
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,261
A night with the fellas.
You know how it is.

104
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:01,940
Pies! Pep squad pies!

105
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:05,104
Boy, people really love pep squad pie.

106
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:06,757
It's genius.

107
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:11,901
Madison's dad gives her 40 bucks
to buy a pie from some chichi bakery,

108
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:13,241
and  then drops three bills

109
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:15,697
to buy it back in front of
a live studio audience.

110
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:18,422
He loves her.

111
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,649
Oh, the rich.

112
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,088
How they mock you.

113
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,710
There's a $50 bill?

114
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,170
Yeah,
I had it made special.

115
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,974
Oh, the Hoi Polloi.

116
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:43,444
They don't know what
they want until they have it.

117
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,439
Hi.

118
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,797
Okay, you want 50 balloons
or some popcorn and ice cream?

119
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:51,551
Balloons.

120
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:53,271
You say that now.

121
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:57,619
Then it's, "oh, uncle Eli,
I'm so hungry."

122
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,457
Thanks.

123
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:01,189
There you go.

124
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,905
Sorry. I thought that was your head.

125
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:11,233
I am so good at this game, bro.

126
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,199
Shooting in a clown's mouth.

127
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:14,924
Your future's bright,
Dick.

128
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,792
Dude, am I drunk?

129
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:22,910
No, dude,
you're just special.

130
00:06:24,137 --> 00:06:26,975
Well, why is the Beav all snuggly
with that chick from "Ghost World"?

131
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:32,921
This school genuinely sucks.

132
00:06:33,124 --> 00:06:34,156
True that.

133
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:35,772
Oh Madison.

134
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,878
Oh hi.

135
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:44,305
Thank you, Madison.

136
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:50,169
Sorry.
I got a little slammed.

137
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:52,996
Can I have the keys for your class?

138
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:55,119
The, uh, sign for
the bounce house is falling down.

139
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,623
I should grab the staple gun.

140
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:59,840
Thank you, J.B.

141
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:03,222
He's so reliable.

142
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,860
It's a little sticky...

143
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:16,307
Good job.

144
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,442
Here, hold on to this.

145
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,143
It's not a carnival until
somebody shows butt cheek.

146
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:28,587
I'm out here with
my special lady friend,

147
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:30,188
and I got to see that.

148
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:32,681
Not a big fan of the
Tritons' annual tuck and run?

149
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:35,580
May I have the cash box,
please?

150
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:37,591
If this day gets any crazier...

151
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:51,541
yeah, so, it's gone.

152
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:52,794
What are you talking about?

153
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:54,284
I just gave it to you.

154
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,224
And I put it in there,

155
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:57,086
and now it's gone.

156
00:07:57,154 --> 00:07:58,295
In less than three minutes,

157
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:01,695
Veronica Mars has lost
all the senior trip money.

158
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:04,160
Is that a record?

159
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,936
<i>A long time ago,</i>

160
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,390
<i>We used to be friends but I</i>

161
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:17,489
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

162
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:21,037
<i>Come on, now, sugar!</i>

163
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,490
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

164
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:26,773
<i>Just remember me when</i>

165
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:29,197
<i>We used to be friends</i>

166
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:31,446
<i>A long time ago</i>

167
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:33,428
<i>We used to be friends</i>

168
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,733
<i>Veronica Mars 2x13
"Ain't No Magic Mountain High Enough"</i>

169
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:45,609
A senior tradition,
30 years in the making.

170
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:49,154
You, young lady, owe
Neptune High school $12,000.

171
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:51,226
There was $12,000 in there?

172
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:52,894
Why are we standing here chatting?

173
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,990
She should be searched.

174
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:56,096
It's a metal box, this big.

175
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:58,535
Where exactly do you think I hid it?

176
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:01,196
The box was locked.

177
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:03,852
If you make everyone exit
through the metal detectors,

178
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:05,248
no one will be able to leave with it.

179
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:06,745
And if they find a way to open it?

180
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:08,669
You should make sure
the shops are locked,

181
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:11,379
any classroom with tools,
the janitor's closet.

182
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:13,253
It was locked up before
the carnival started.

183
00:09:14,183 --> 00:09:15,260
It's not my first day.

184
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:16,409
Yes sir?

185
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:18,664
I want the metal detectors
to be moved to the exit.

186
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:20,544
And we're going to have
to start searching the lockers...

187
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:21,706
Immediately.

188
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:23,714
You want to save yourself some time?

189
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:24,945
Start with hers.

190
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,802
We all saw her,
lurking around.

191
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,972
Lurking? Uh, you mean
standing while black?

192
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,694
She told me earlier today
she had a plan to ruin everything.

193
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:38,692
You know,

194
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,707
there are plenty of people
with notorious parents

195
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,204
who turn out to be decent people.

196
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:44,548
Don't think you have an excuse.

197
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:55,610
So,  I'm not actually
leaping frogs myself?

198
00:09:57,434 --> 00:09:58,719
I'll try anything once.

199
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:01,420
Except that.

200
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:02,974
Ooh, you cheeky...

201
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,605
uh, you don't take physics,
do you?

202
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:13,292
I have a tattoo of Newton's
second law right on my heart.

203
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:15,550
You  want to see?

204
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:17,066
Right here.

205
00:10:17,348 --> 00:10:18,645
You get three tries.

206
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,048
Oh, you're so accommodating.

207
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,863
How about a little support,
ladies?

208
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:36,251
What? And I suppose
you're fantastic at this.

209
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:42,010
Excuse me.

210
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,968
Ladies, a little support?

211
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:52,226
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry!

212
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:55,658
Oh, I can't believe you fell for that.

213
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:59,494
I think I should get a prize
just for being so entertaining.

214
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:02,055
Yeah, well, I wasn't 
all that entertained.

215
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:04,292
If you want a prize,

216
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:05,825
frog on a lily pad.

217
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:13,267
I'd like the pink bunny,
please.

218
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:17,636
What's your name?

219
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:18,773
Hannah.

220
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,160
Well, I'm naming my
bunny after you, Hannah.

221
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,501
Actually, name it Logan.

222
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:27,843
It will break my heart.

223
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,969
Hey. Who's your date?

224
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:39,311
This is Ophelia, my niece.

225
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,235
This is Veronica.

226
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:43,792
Nice backpack. You like
the Powerpuff Girls, huh?

227
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:44,975
Which one is this?

228
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:47,881
She's the one that's not shaped
like a metal cash box.

229
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,382
They start moving metal
detectors around, Veronica,

230
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:53,006
you think the word's not gonna spread?

231
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:56,630
Why don't you just open it up already?

232
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:12,847
You know, your case must really suck
if your prime suspect is a 6-year-old.

233
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,973
The sheriff is using me as a scapegoat.

234
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:21,598
And if there's anyone fit to take
on the sheriff's department, it's you.

235
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,134
I read your book, mr. Mars.

236
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:24,382
I couldn't put it down.

237
00:12:24,383 --> 00:12:26,157
Yeah, well,
if you read it carefully,

238
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:29,179
you might remember the famous guy
went to jail in the end of that one?

239
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,227
Look, the sheriff sees me
as Woody's ally.

240
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,315
I spent the last three months
speaking to the minority population

241
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,332
on behalf of his incorporation plan.

242
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:39,098
Now, if that goes through,

243
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,537
sheriff Ensley gets turned into the
hayseed who hands out speeding tickets

244
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:43,810
on the way into town.

245
00:12:43,904 --> 00:12:46,284
So Lamb made his point.
He leaned on you. Big deal.

246
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:51,227
He's never gonna file charges unless
he's got some kind of hard evidence.

247
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,035
Well, I had gone out to the park
to talk to Woody

248
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:56,534
about my doing the color commentary
on the short broadcast this year.

249
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:59,345
There was a group from Neptune High.

250
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:02,951
And I signed a bunch
of baseballs, jerseys.

251
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:03,798
So?

252
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,459
Lamb's forensic specialists found

253
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,755
cellphone and baseball fragments
embedded in the driver's body.

254
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:11,602
He thinks I planted a bomb in the bag,

255
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:13,857
that I detonated
by calling the cellphone.

256
00:13:14,213 --> 00:13:16,480
And I need you to prove
that I didn't make that call,

257
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:18,842
that I had nothing
to do with that crash.

258
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:25,463
What you doing back there,
Mackie?

259
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:27,145
Keeping Beaver company.

260
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:29,979
That sounds fun.

261
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,206
That's 'cause it is.

262
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:33,269
The f'ing machine's broken.

263
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:36,265
The  ice is jammed.
Just break it up with the screwdriver.

264
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,073
Great.

265
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:38,463
I just lent it to Jackie.

266
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:40,890
Jackie asked to borrow a screwdriver?

267
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:41,904
Do you know where she went?

268
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,426
No. She was just here.

269
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,087
There she is.

270
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:16,648
Jackie?

271
00:14:17,431 --> 00:14:18,231
What are you doing?

272
00:14:19,264 --> 00:14:20,753
Changing into my bathing suit.

273
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,201
That doesn't usually
require a screwdriver.

274
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,187
No, it usually doesn't.

275
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:42,159
Like putting on a bikini
isn't stressful enough.

276
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,573
It really looked like...

277
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:46,937
I know what it looked like.

278
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:49,023
Why are you wearing a bathing suit?

279
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:50,762
Didn't you hear?

280
00:14:51,163 --> 00:14:52,227
I won.

281
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:58,044
Before I was the demonized
offspring of a mass murderer,

282
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:00,289
I signed up for the dunk tank.

283
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:02,024
You know, you get a jar,

284
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:04,204
and whoever gets
the most money gets dunked.

285
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:08,233
I went from a week of having
the $3 I put in for myself

286
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:10,492
to having almost $400.

287
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:13,532
Go figure.

288
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:15,916
Jackie.

289
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:20,085
Really, you're wasting your time trying
to prove something to these people.

290
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:20,904
Yeah.

291
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,314
And when people thought
the worst of your dad,

292
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,905
you just took it lying down, right?

293
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:33,476
Hey, are you sure you want to do this?

294
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:35,093
"Want" might be stretching it.

295
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:37,132
Hey, it's my senior trip, too.

296
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:38,493
Time to take one for the team.

297
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,971
One of my friends was on that bus.

298
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:05,872
Hey, Jackie.

299
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,523
What do you think your dad
would think of my curve ball?

300
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:09,901
He'd say it's weak.

301
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:20,339
In the spirit of a full
client-investigator disclosure,

302
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:25,375
I'm not offering you this beer
out of the goodness of my heart.

303
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:27,197
You're not?

304
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:28,578
Nope.

305
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:31,736
I'm fulfilling a long-time fantasy

306
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:35,091
of sharing a cold one
with my favorite ballplayers.

307
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:37,339
And after we're done,

308
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:40,049
we're gonna play catch
in the parking lot.

309
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:41,791
"Favorite," huh?

310
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,244
I saw you pitch three times in
triple-a, back when you were 19.

311
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:49,533
I mean, there wasn't much to do
in fresno as a 22-year-old deputy.

312
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:51,950
I never saw you give up a run.

313
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:54,284
After that, I followed everything
you did in the bigs,

314
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:55,886
your whole career.

315
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:57,932
Well, in that case,

316
00:16:58,007 --> 00:17:00,358
here's to hoping I've still got
a career when this is all through.

317
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,251
Now that I've come clean,

318
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:15,166
maybe you want
to tell me about your relationship

319
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:17,239
with the journalism teacher.

320
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:20,770
Miss Dumass,
I believe her name is.

321
00:17:22,386 --> 00:17:26,390
Right. Here's a picture of
you two looking rather intimate.

322
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:31,981
I'm sorry about your loss,
mr. Cook.

323
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:35,190
But you're gonna need to be
a lot more up-front with me

324
00:17:35,244 --> 00:17:36,742
if you want me to work for you.

325
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:50,928
Here's the windup.

326
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,043
Okay that was weird.

327
00:17:59,406 --> 00:18:00,247
Check out this one.

328
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:04,871
Here it comes, Jackie.

329
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:08,918
Just a bit outside.

330
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:10,709
Man, I suck at this.

331
00:18:13,112 --> 00:18:14,849
All right, that's enough.
Next!

332
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:17,214
Sorry, Wallace.

333
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:18,836
Y'all are cool, man.

334
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:20,293
Real cool.

335
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:25,563
Thanks

336
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:28,367
-Here you go.
-Thank you!

337
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:31,879
So,  are we winning?

338
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,037
What?

339
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:35,580
I feel like we're in a contest
with all the other couples...

340
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:36,810
who can hold hands the longest?

341
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:39,441
I just don't want to lose you
in the crowd.

342
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:42,233
Hey, aren't you gonna introduce us?

343
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:44,697
Wow, you guys are cute.

344
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,090
Aren't they?

345
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,672
Like gerbils in love.

346
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:48,642
Dick, don't.

347
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:49,652
Chill, Beav.

348
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,123
I get to give the
big brother speech here.

349
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,570
Just looking out for you.

350
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:54,409
You don't have to worry.
He's fine.

351
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,067
Yeah? In good hands?

352
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,319
Because you've got
to take it easy on my bro.

353
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,864
If you're gonna pop his cherry,

354
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:00,975
hold back a little.

355
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:01,821
You are such an ass.

356
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,500
Don't go busting out any tricks.

357
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:05,019
Gentle and sweet.

358
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,489
You don't want to spook him.

359
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,013
Like right now, I know his hands
are just dripping with sweat,

360
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:11,903
and you are so completely grossed out.

361
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:14,294
But you're hanging in,
and I dig that.

362
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:16,061
Oop, see how it just slipped right out?

363
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:17,806
Got to work on that, bro.

364
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:25,757
-There you go.
-Thank you!

365
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:26,676
Hey!

366
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,544
Hey.

367
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:29,850
I'm sorry.
Did you want that?

368
00:19:29,883 --> 00:19:31,130
No, I bought it for you.

369
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,282
Oh, you are sweet.

370
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:37,688
So, I couldn't help but notice
that you are separated from the herd.

371
00:19:38,285 --> 00:19:40,474
And I'm concerned... you know,
predators and all that.

372
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,962
I can take care of myself.

373
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:42,979
Well, that's a shame.

374
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:45,981
Dude.

375
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:48,697
Okay.

376
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,154
Boy, that sounds
so unnatural coming from you.

377
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:52,813
I say "dude" all the time.

378
00:19:52,815 --> 00:19:54,376
Nope, I don't buy it.

379
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:55,544
You know, you're, like,

380
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:57,832
I don't know,
like the hot daughter of a king

381
00:19:57,884 --> 00:20:00,224
that he marries off to get
like, Denmark or something.

382
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:01,422
You mean a princess.

383
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:03,345
I'm only ever gonna call
you princess now.

384
00:20:03,346 --> 00:20:04,126
No, you're not.

385
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,034
Princess.
I am.

386
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:11,299
My friend Dick's working
the slushie booth.

387
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:12,716
We should go pay him a visit.

388
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:14,601
He's all about the royals.

389
00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:16,517
I can't.
I'm here with my friends.

390
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:19,652
So? Go tell them you want
to play with me for a little while.

391
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:21,376
What makes you think I want to?

392
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:23,946
What makes you think
it's a good idea to pretend you don't?

393
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:37,516
Cool.

394
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:40,830
Hey!

395
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:53,524
Wow.

396
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,491
You're almost turning blue.

397
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:05,941
Next time I tell you
to stay home, listen.

398
00:21:18,965 --> 00:21:21,537
Well, I don't see no sign
saying this is just for kids.

399
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,251
You see any signs?

400
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:25,761
I want that snake.

401
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:28,200
You gonna let me in there or what?

402
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,720
We have to empty the ball pit.

403
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:33,612
What?

404
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:34,847
It's the perfect place,

405
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:36,025
right in the middle of everything.

406
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,459
Whoever stole the cash box
could have just dumped it there.

407
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,210
We have to empty it.

408
00:21:40,187 --> 00:21:41,158
And if you're wrong?

409
00:21:42,213 --> 00:21:43,396
And that's the last of it.

410
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:49,493
Why would you even
consider listening to her?

411
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:50,705
Principal...

412
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:53,033
and you're taking directions
from a teenage girl.

413
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,130
Sorry.

414
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:56,653
I'm really sorry about this.

415
00:21:57,618 --> 00:21:58,630
We're gonna fill it back up.

416
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:00,875
Veronica Mars,
you are just trouble,

417
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:03,696
all caps, underlined,
written in bold...

418
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:07,316
Tanya Flynn has been filming
tonight for the video yearbook.

419
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:11,793
Apparently she has footage that
should prove to be interesting.

420
00:22:17,313 --> 00:22:21,374
One of your classmates was filming
tonight for the video yearbook.

421
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:26,597
Those of you we've asked to join us
were in the vicinity of the cash box,

422
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:31,729
right before the unfortunate
streaking incident.

423
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:36,728
Your lockers are being
searched as we speak.

424
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:41,289
Even if you found money,

425
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:44,283
there's really no way of proving
that it's the stolen money.

426
00:22:44,284 --> 00:22:46,406
Not a lot of people carry
12 grand on them.

427
00:22:46,524 --> 00:22:49,259
Uh, I never leave the house
without at least 13.

428
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:51,389
Yeah, me either.

429
00:22:51,642 --> 00:22:55,844
Actually, I got a $50 bill
when I was working the slushie booth.

430
00:22:55,923 --> 00:22:57,845
It had the name "Nancy"

431
00:22:57,957 --> 00:22:59,839
in black marker across the back,

432
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,140
along with a phone number.

433
00:23:01,602 --> 00:23:04,491
That's one way to know
if it's the cash-box money.

434
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:08,030
So are we gonna get to see the video?

435
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,708
Look at Jackie. See?

436
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:34,327
She's hiding something in her jacket.

437
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:36,971
That was my gym bag with
my bathing suit and towel.

438
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:39,933
You're not getting away
with anything, Missy.

439
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,421
I don't care what your zip code is.

440
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:42,398
Trash is trash.

441
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:44,084
Mark my words.

442
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:51,257
Look, just so you know,
I take all my dates here.

443
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,396
I don't want you to think
you're special or anything.

444
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:56,259
Uh, this isn't a date.

445
00:23:57,073 --> 00:23:58,599
Um, I bought you a drink.

446
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:00,874
And I won you a stuffed animal.

447
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:03,209
Check your dictionary,
princess.

448
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,341
I haven't had a date yet.

449
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:08,345
I'm kind of holding out
for something special.

450
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,780
Wow, you are a princess.

451
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:15,405
Oh, look at him.

452
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:17,174
Have I taught him nothing?

453
00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:21,296
He's like some neutered
eunuch nerd drone.

454
00:24:26,503 --> 00:24:29,743
"Bambi gasm." Of the Boston gasms?

455
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:31,707
One would hope.

456
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:35,995
It was supposed to be the final fling.

457
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:38,814
The next thing I know,
I'm living "Fatal Attraction".

458
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,742
She didn't even tell me
that she was applying

459
00:24:40,794 --> 00:24:43,260
for the teaching job at Neptune
until she got it and moved here.

460
00:24:43,828 --> 00:24:45,540
Then she started threatening me.

461
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:49,640
She said if I didn't end things
with my fiancée,

462
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:51,382
that she would.

463
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,646
Well, she did.

464
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:54,805
She told your fiancée?

465
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:56,254
And the wedding was off.

466
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:02,521
A secret tumultuous relationship
with a teacher who died in the crash?

467
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,481
It seems like more of a motive
than supporting Woody's plans

468
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:07,253
for incorporation, don't you think?

469
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:28,065
Whoa, sorry,

470
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:29,421
but I can't let you frisk me.

471
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,823
She's at an impressionable age.

472
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:33,583
Remember when you
and your buddy, Logan,

473
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:35,460
spindled our teacher's car?

474
00:25:35,477 --> 00:25:37,005
How did that work?

475
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:38,400
I'm not big on power tools, but

476
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:42,053
I'm thinking that might
involve some type of saw?

477
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,690
I don't know why you bother fishing
here. You got a question, ask it.

478
00:25:44,747 --> 00:25:48,231
You seem to know a way
to get into auto shop after hours.

479
00:25:48,365 --> 00:25:49,918
It's suspicious.

480
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,897
Well, then you're suspicious
of a lot of people.

481
00:25:52,098 --> 00:25:54,906
All the guys who take shop
make copies of mr. Dalton's keys.

482
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:14,901
This is not how I thought
I'd be spending my evening.

483
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:42,303
It's the $50 bill with "Nancy"
written on it.

484
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,627
But there's only about...

485
00:26:45,843 --> 00:26:47,143
$3,000 here.

486
00:26:47,247 --> 00:26:47,766
What?

487
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,656
Well, they probably hid the rest of it
somewhere else, right?

488
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:02,358
Or spent it already.

489
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:04,696
Let me see that class list.

490
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:09,666
Locker 19.

491
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:13,317
Eduardo Verozco.

492
00:27:14,498 --> 00:27:15,375
Is he a freshman?

493
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:16,519
Senior.

494
00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:19,444
He goes by the name of Thumper.

495
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,804
I don't even want to know
what he uses this for.

496
00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:32,530
Can I see that for a second?

497
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,695
If only they'd put that kind
of effort into their schoolwork.

498
00:27:40,027 --> 00:27:40,891
I'll take that.

499
00:28:06,364 --> 00:28:07,441
What?

500
00:28:10,784 --> 00:28:12,939
It was a bummer when
Clemmons took my keys.

501
00:28:13,044 --> 00:28:15,173
Of course, it made
the 20 bucks I dropped

502
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:17,728
having them copied,
a sound investment.

503
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:23,870
Mrs. Hauser may have seen
an ill-conceived cutting board.

504
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:26,298
I saw tagging.
I saw code.

505
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,199
License plates.

506
00:28:52,012 --> 00:28:53,075
Great news.

507
00:28:53,573 --> 00:28:55,285
You didn't steal the senior trip money.

508
00:28:55,524 --> 00:28:56,256
Uh, good to know.

509
00:28:56,432 --> 00:28:57,465
Hey.

510
00:28:57,886 --> 00:29:01,388
I'm about to watch mrs. Hauser
squirm in her own personal hell.

511
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:02,714
If you're not doing anything...

512
00:29:06,876 --> 00:29:07,926
Great.

513
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,205
What kind of senior trip
can we have with $3,000?

514
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:13,399
Look who I found.

515
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:15,333
Ms. Trashy trash.

516
00:29:15,864 --> 00:29:17,649
We marked your words before.

517
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,185
And I don't know if you know this,

518
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:24,105
but they formed this,
like, totally false accusation.

519
00:29:24,785 --> 00:29:30,356
I know... "yikes." I figured you might
welcome the opportunity to apologize.

520
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:38,365
You didn't steal the money.
I'm sorry.

521
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,219
Totally worth it.

522
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:42,902
Oh, I found this in a copy machine.

523
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:53,269
Where did you get this?
This is my exam.

524
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,735
In...the...copy machine.

525
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,708
Am I still speaking english?

526
00:29:57,709 --> 00:29:59,734
What were you doing
at the copy machine?

527
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:00,718
Making coffee.

528
00:30:01,423 --> 00:30:04,573
This exam is locked up
in my filing cabinet.

529
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:05,779
Not anymore.

530
00:30:05,878 --> 00:30:08,082
The only question now is,
who had access?

531
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,478
Who knows your code
to the copy machine?

532
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:12,581
Just my student aide.

533
00:30:15,903 --> 00:30:18,208
Perhaps when he borrowed your keys?

534
00:30:18,874 --> 00:30:20,366
She's trying to sabotage me.

535
00:30:20,933 --> 00:30:24,137
I am, like, this close to beating her
out for the Kane scholarship.

536
00:30:24,138 --> 00:30:26,409
This is just like
the stuff that she does.

537
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:27,843
She planted it.

538
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:29,168
And for my next trick,

539
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:31,542
I will take J.B.
into the hallway,

540
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:34,815
whisper a few magic words,
and, when we return,

541
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:35,911
he'll confess.

542
00:30:35,912 --> 00:30:37,330
Yeah.
Yeah, that will happen.

543
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,312
Don't oversell it, J.B.
people will think you're a mark.

544
00:30:41,949 --> 00:30:43,250
Step right this way.

545
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:46,390
Pretty bold move,

546
00:30:46,517 --> 00:30:49,936
making a copy of mrs. Hauser's test
right under her nose.

547
00:30:50,384 --> 00:30:52,233
Oh, wow.
Yeah, I confess.

548
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,634
But you knew she'd be
distracted, didn't you?

549
00:30:55,967 --> 00:31:00,171
You knew there would be streakers
at precisely 4:00 P.M., didn't you?

550
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,046
Did you forget that I took pictures
of last year's Triton initiation?

551
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:14,364
I made a promise to a certain
Triton that his secret was safe.

552
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,554
But he's long gone.

553
00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:19,345
Uh, that still doesn't prove...

554
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:22,177
I'll bet if we check
the copy machine log,

555
00:31:22,178 --> 00:31:25,927
it will tell us that copies were
made with mrs. Hauser's code,

556
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:29,329
say, 4:03, 4:04 P.M.

557
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:30,755
Should I call them over?

558
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:31,834
You're bluffing.

559
00:31:31,878 --> 00:31:33,541
The copy machine can't do that.

560
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:35,065
Well, here's your choice.

561
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,327
You can call my bluff,

562
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,686
and we'll all find out exactly
what the copy machine can do.

563
00:31:39,687 --> 00:31:42,642
Of course,
if you choose that option,

564
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:45,829
I'm posting this Tritons photo
on your home page.

565
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:49,217
I've heard what happens to Tritons
who reveal their secrets.

566
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:50,263
I don't have a home page.

567
00:31:50,315 --> 00:31:51,376
You will.

568
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,192
Then there's option two...

569
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,969
confession. Reveal your secret powers.

570
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:07,067
I stole the test.

571
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,067
Ta-da!

572
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:10,449
Did she threaten you, J.B.?

573
00:32:11,484 --> 00:32:12,759
Don't let her scare you.

574
00:32:12,951 --> 00:32:14,174
If you didn't steal that test,

575
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:14,804
then you shouldn't...

576
00:32:14,805 --> 00:32:17,606
No. No. I stole it.

577
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:21,381
What are you doing?

578
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:23,296
Get down from there!

579
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:25,843
Miss Mars.

580
00:32:32,171 --> 00:32:33,419
This isn't a sweater.

581
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,617
All right, cash!

582
00:32:37,618 --> 00:32:38,729
How did you know?

583
00:32:38,858 --> 00:32:40,329
How did you know to look up there?

584
00:32:40,673 --> 00:32:42,054
I have to say...

585
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:47,303
I grossly underestimated
the usefulness of glitter.

586
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:48,957
Look at that.

587
00:32:49,642 --> 00:32:51,568
Practically a perfect footprint.

588
00:32:51,611 --> 00:32:52,572
It shouldn't be too hard to find.

589
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:55,510
There are not that many people
who wear heels to a carnival.

590
00:33:00,655 --> 00:33:04,222
Would you mind lifting up
your foot, mrs. Hauser?

591
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,660
You know, I've been walking
in that glitter all day.

592
00:33:19,724 --> 00:33:21,949
You can see it's everywhere
around my desk.

593
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:23,783
So your shoes were very fancy

594
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:25,843
when you were skimming off
the top of the cash box.

595
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,126
My guess is mrs. Hauser
helped herself to a few bills

596
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,146
long before she ever
gave me the money.

597
00:33:32,925 --> 00:33:35,116
Maybe we should take
this into my office.

598
00:33:37,555 --> 00:33:42,398
This would be a prime example of
why I consider the advice of...

599
00:33:43,262 --> 00:33:44,899
some of my students.

600
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,595
Buck up, Maddie.

601
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:52,373
Senior trip is back on, sister.
6 grand.

602
00:33:52,518 --> 00:33:54,477
We're Magic Mountain-bound.

603
00:33:54,828 --> 00:33:55,469
Oh.

604
00:33:55,606 --> 00:33:57,964
You know there's a ride
called "The Viper", right?

605
00:33:58,064 --> 00:34:00,017
Isn't that, like,
your mother ship?

606
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:04,988
Mrs. Hauser, Thumper, J.B.

607
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:08,061
Is there anyone here that
isn't a thief or a cheat?

608
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:14,708
Madison!

609
00:34:15,865 --> 00:34:16,932
What you up to, girl?

610
00:34:17,203 --> 00:34:19,182
You feel like heading to
my car for a quickie?

611
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,185
I've moved on to older men, Dick.

612
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:24,806
Fewer quickies,
more longies.

613
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:38,987
The bad thing about thigh-highs.

614
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:42,210
Yeah. There's nothing bad
about thigh-highs.

615
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:44,352
I'm waiting to pick up my daughter.

616
00:34:44,508 --> 00:34:46,250
You mean your sister.

617
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,608
I mean my stepdaughter.

618
00:34:47,806 --> 00:34:49,601
I tend to marry older men.

619
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:51,948
Then I mess around
with the younger ones.

620
00:34:52,678 --> 00:34:53,795
Nice.

621
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:57,456
You know, I have about
another half-hour to kill.

622
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:02,720
I get the feeling that you're
fantastic at killing time.

623
00:35:02,963 --> 00:35:03,984
Oh, yeah.

624
00:35:11,973 --> 00:35:14,117
Would you stop trying to hold my hand?

625
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,283
Save it for the date,
will you?

626
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:21,111
My ride is picking me up here.

627
00:35:27,236 --> 00:35:28,951
So I guess I'll see you saturday.

628
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,229
Mm-hmm.

629
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:32,500
I'll call you.

630
00:35:32,573 --> 00:35:33,262
Okay.

631
00:35:40,757 --> 00:35:42,796
Just in case you don't kiss
on the first date.

632
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:57,063
Hey, daddy.

633
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,257
What the hell was that?

634
00:36:11,907 --> 00:36:13,069
What is that?!

635
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:14,620
What do you call yours?

636
00:36:22,335 --> 00:36:25,412
You hit me, and you'll suffer worse.
I promise you.

637
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:27,456
You remember Sally?

638
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:38,021
Would that you could spit out
the memories.

639
00:36:39,148 --> 00:36:41,129
You knocked the hell out of that ball.

640
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,265
I'm in the stands.
I'm climbing over people.

641
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:46,549
I'm under the seats.
And by the time I got it,

642
00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:53,509
I was covered in old beer and
mustard and bruised and battered.

643
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,889
It is not easy being a fan.

644
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,465
Three career home runs,
and you got one of them.

645
00:36:59,466 --> 00:37:01,039
Unbelievable.

646
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:05,799
Oh, I think I need to call a cab.

647
00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:08,818
I'll come pick up my car tomorrow.

648
00:37:14,105 --> 00:37:16,966
Uh, I just want to be sure.
Are you, uh,

649
00:37:17,385 --> 00:37:18,921
you taking my case?

650
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,263
That depends.

651
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:21,866
Is there anything else
you need to tell me?

652
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,119
I can't think of anything.

653
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:25,819
Well, I'm afraid I can't.

654
00:37:26,422 --> 00:37:27,221
Why is that?

655
00:37:27,293 --> 00:37:29,179
Because you're not
coming clean with me.

656
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:31,329
What?
I've told you everything.

657
00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:40,214
<i>I never bet on baseball.</i>

658
00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:43,705
<i>I got a guy in
a holding cell back there.</i>

659
00:37:45,674 --> 00:37:51,114
<i>He says you did favors for gentlemen
who bet extensively on baseball.</i>

660
00:37:51,473 --> 00:37:53,007
Is there anything you don't know?

661
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:56,965
Leslie was at my place
when two goons broke in...

662
00:37:57,419 --> 00:37:58,864
Fitzpatricks,
you know them?

663
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:00,270
I do.

664
00:38:00,677 --> 00:38:02,918
Well, they were trying
to collect some money,

665
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:07,121
and Leslie overheard something
that would ruin me.

666
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:10,696
No endorsements,
no hall of fame.

667
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:15,505
She said if I ever left her,
she'd sell her story to a magazine.

668
00:38:15,621 --> 00:38:17,624
What could possibly be that bad?

669
00:38:19,524 --> 00:38:21,796
Well, I guess there's nothing else
to say but good night.

670
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:23,050
I have a gambling problem.

671
00:38:23,102 --> 00:38:23,843
I'm aware of that.

672
00:38:23,947 --> 00:38:24,976
I got in pretty deep.

673
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:32,346
I had to do some things
that I'm not proud of.

674
00:38:32,398 --> 00:38:34,635
Terrence, we can dance around
this all night.

675
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,628
I threw a game.

676
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,898
It was game 4 of the A.L.C.S.

677
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:42,835
A 3-run homer baylor hit off me.

678
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:45,664
70-mile-per-hour curveball.

679
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,924
Didn't break.

680
00:38:47,957 --> 00:38:49,186
Pure meat.

681
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:54,267
Leslie heard all about it.

682
00:38:55,728 --> 00:38:57,024
And that pitch,

683
00:38:57,737 --> 00:38:59,421
it erased millions in debt.

684
00:38:59,461 --> 00:39:01,774
That was when baseball players,
they didn't make what they make today.

685
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:05,867
I was almost at that game.

686
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,691
But Veronica gets the chicken pox.

687
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:13,697
I was glued to the tv,

688
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,499
with my jersey and my foam finger,

689
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,554
a grown man.

690
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:21,867
Pretty silly, huh?

691
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:24,735
You know what's even more silly?

692
00:39:25,755 --> 00:39:27,298
The superstitious fan in me,

693
00:39:28,128 --> 00:39:30,209
I thought we lost that game
because I wasn't there.

694
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:36,988
I even felt a little guilty,
like I let you guys down.

695
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:40,475
Then I thought,
there's always next year.

696
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:43,464
You guys never made it back.

697
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:49,641
I'm $50 an hour plus expenses.

698
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:54,545
You'll take my case?

699
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,040
Why?

700
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:58,369
You're Terrence Cook.

701
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:02,585
You wouldn't kill a bus full of kids.

702
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,591
I still believe that.

703
00:40:26,665 --> 00:40:28,227
I've got a funny story for you.

704
00:40:28,795 --> 00:40:32,099
I call it "how Weevil got his new car."

705
00:40:33,113 --> 00:40:35,650
Well, are there pictures?
Because I'm a little slow.

706
00:40:36,536 --> 00:40:40,928
Remember that whole thing with
Nancy's number on the $50 bill?

707
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,210
Yeah, I made it up.

708
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:46,774
You got some skill, girl.

709
00:40:47,106 --> 00:40:48,856
The sheriff let your buddy,
Thumper, go.

710
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:51,880
The bag of pills you planted...
ephedrine.

711
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:55,708
There is one thing I can't figure out,

712
00:40:55,775 --> 00:40:57,272
and it's pretty much driving me insane.

713
00:40:58,365 --> 00:41:00,224
I know you broke Thumper's lock,

714
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:03,003
just took off your own and
put it on Thumper's locker.

715
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,302
But I don't know how you did it.

716
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,763
Where did you hide the cash box?

717
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:09,624
The two places you looked for it.

718
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:12,560
The cash box was
in my niece's backpack.

719
00:41:14,115 --> 00:41:16,280
Then she went into the ball pit,
stashed the box.

720
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:19,874
We got the third degree from you,
like I didn't know that was coming.

721
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:21,651
Then she went back in and got the box.

722
00:41:22,512 --> 00:41:24,782
While I was having
the ball pit drained,

723
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:28,170
you were planting cash and
ephedrine in Thumper's locker.

724
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:32,886
Well, I had to go back later and
add the incriminating $50 bill.

725
00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:37,967
So when you rented "The Thomas Crown
Affair," McQueen or Brosnan?

726
00:41:40,376 --> 00:41:44,071
Is it your undying love for me
or just good old-fashioned lust?

727
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,656
Qué?

728
00:41:45,657 --> 00:41:47,092
That kept you from turning me in?

729
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:53,480
Love...of roller coasters.

730
00:41:54,192 --> 00:41:58,865
And hatred of anything that requires me
to tie a sweater over my shoulders

731
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,968
and be at sea
with my classmates.

732
00:42:01,731 --> 00:42:03,232
Nothing to do with you.

733
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:09,111
