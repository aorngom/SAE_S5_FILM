1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,002
"when life gives you lemons,
make lemonade."

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,504
I wish she was still alive,

3
00:00:03,764 --> 00:00:06,089
because I'd really like 
to ask what she suggests

4
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:07,925
for when life gives you
chlamydia.

5
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,760
Please, get a room...

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,178
in Australia.

7
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,804
Hey, we're practicing for the prom.

8
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:16,308
What debutante bit you and 
turned you into a prom zombie?

9
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,021
We just gave in...
The Whole Nine Yards...

10
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,231
the ridiculous dress,

11
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,982
the tux, lobster dinner, limo.

12
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,483
I mean, it happens once.
Why not go all out?

13
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:30,447
'Cause no one sold you as
an indentured servant to Butters.

14
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,449
Mac, I didn't think he'd actually...

15
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,201
he's picking me up
in a hummer limousine,

16
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,286
we're having dinner
on a replica pirate ship,

17
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,664
and I suspect he's hired
a zeppelin for the ride home.

18
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,457
I'm gonna fill my pockets with rocks,

19
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,625
get a good grip on your ankle,

20
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,626
and I'm gonna jump off the top of...

21
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,836
<i>Attention, students.</i>

22
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,464
<i>Due to a significant number of</i>
<i>alcohol violations on the senior trip,</i>

23
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,758
<i>this year's prom has been canceled.</i>

24
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,093
<i>That is all.</i>

25
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,514
Yes! Prayer works!

26
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,266
Hello?

27
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,810
Woody,
to what do I owe...

28
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,896
What... right now?

29
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,692
What room number?

30
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,203
I swear it's not what it looks like.

31
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,253
Okay, it is what it looks like.

32
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,129
And that is?

33
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,089
Do... do I have to spell it out?

34
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,341
She's with the incorporation campaign.

35
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,010
We had a few cocktails.

36
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:36,555
She must have mixed with pills
or something, because she just...

37
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,229
This is not a proud moment for me.

38
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,356
I need help to take care of this.

39
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,443
I'm on retainer to help Terrence Cook,
not take care of things.

40
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,278
"Mayor brings mistress to E.R.

41
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,531
Booze, pills, underwear.
Film at 11:00."

42
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,074
Please, Keith.

43
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,995
I'll get her to the hospital,

44
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,747
and I'll be discreet.

45
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,457
Okay.

46
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,168
But don't get the wrong idea.
This is not the sort of thing I do.

47
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,212
Okay. Thank you.

48
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,731
I owe you big-time,
Keith.

49
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,739
Hey.

50
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,200
Have you ever been stalked?

51
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:39,952
As a matter of fact...

52
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,578
because someone's stalking me.

53
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,872
I was hoping you might have
some tips or something.

54
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:48,126
Dancing around in your underwear
with the curtains open is always good,

55
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,463
and if you're in chat rooms
and they suggest meeting face-to-face,

56
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,217
do it in an abandoned railroad car
down by the riverside.

57
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,886
No, no, no.
I mean for catching the guy.

58
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,264
I keep seeing this car
following me around.

59
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,517
Can you describe it?

60
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,602
It's totally nondescript.

61
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,729
I mean,
that's what's so unique about it.

62
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,898
Um, okay.

63
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,860
Any reason anyone would want
to follow you around?

64
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,320
Well, last week at karaoke,

65
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,655
I did "can't get you out of my head",

66
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,032
and I dedicated it to
this table of cute guys,

67
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,201
but then I realized they weren't cute.

68
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,621
They were dweeby pan high guys,
and not the nice nerd kind,

69
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,039
but the weird, creepy...

70
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,166
potential stalker kind?

71
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,672
Is there any way that
you could do some P.I. thing?

72
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:35,507
For you?

73
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,926
The  daughter of
the most powerful man in town?

74
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,511
That's a marker I want.

75
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,305
Come to my house after school.

76
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,863
Something I can help you with?

77
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,115
You should really
keep your office locked.

78
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,913
I want my hard drive back.

79
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,040
Come on.

80
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,958
My friend saw you take it
from my apartment.

81
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,920
Your friend Liam, the drug dealer
who tried to shoot me.

82
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,713
There was an intruder in my house.

83
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,300
-He feared for his life.
-Out of curiosity,

84
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,844
did your husband know
that you kept your own place?

85
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,015
Did he know about your jail time
or that you're not even really you?

86
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,144
If the hard drive reappears by friday,
I won't press charges.

87
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,021
I  filled out the form.

88
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,691
Me sending it to me...
no paper trail.

89
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,571
Mrs. C,
I trust you're well.

90
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,782
Oh, well, if it isn't little
miss teen getaway.

91
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,326
Your dad and I were just 
dealing with a little trouble.

92
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,580
Like, trouble with a capital "T", that
rhymes with "C", that stands for...

93
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,374
-Veronica!
-I was gonna say "cute."

94
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,001
Ms. Casablancas was just leaving.

95
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,715
So, what did the doctor say?

96
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,175
Well, you got your money's worth.

97
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,218
What does that mean?

98
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,845
It means...

99
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,848
the stethoscope was freezing.

100
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,183
But I'm fine. Tip-top.

101
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,852
Can I borrow the remote
cameras tonight?

102
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,103
What  for?

103
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,522
For a school project?

104
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,441
I don't believe you.

105
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,361
Okay,  this girl I know suspects that 

106
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,739
one of several creepy weirdos
she sang a kylie minogue song to

107
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,117
at karaoke night
might be following her around.

108
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,910
We're  trying to narrow down
which one it is.

109
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,829
I like your first answer better.

110
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,372
You can earn it.

111
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,751
send a copy to everyone
on our business contact sheet,

112
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,795
see if anyone can find him.

113
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,589
Hey who is this charming fellow?

114
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,050
The charming fellow who hired
the escort to steal Cliff's briefcase.

115
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,887
-And his heart. Poor cliff.
-Yeah.

116
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,555
She must have been something,

117
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,473
'cause he won't shut up about it.

118
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,894
Cameras are on the roof,
so if this guy followed you here,

119
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,145
we should be able to spot him.

120
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,480
Wow!
How "Mission Impossible".

121
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,815
I feel like, at any moment,

122
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,318
Tom Cruise is gonna dangle
from the ceiling on cables.

123
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,863
Great.
Now I won't be able to sleep.

124
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,865
I hope he doesn't try to marry me.

125
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,286
There.
That's the car.

126
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,538
Isn't it totally nondescript?

127
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,416
That's a 2002 silver galant.

128
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,379
We should order him pizza.
He would totally freak.

129
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,131
Why stop at pizza, Gia?

130
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,301
Bet you a hot-oil rubdown
would really show him.

131
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,684
And you can just look him up
right there on your computer?

132
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,019
That's awesome.

133
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,021
Actually, I'm updating
my netflix queue.

134
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,400
No, wait.
I think we got him.

135
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,194
Leonardo d'Amato?

136
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,030
God, what kind of a loser is that?

137
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,032
Greek italian.

138
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,743
I used to go out with him.

139
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,205
<i>A long time ago,</i>

140
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,041
<i>We used to be friends but I</i>

141
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,586
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

142
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,965
<i>Come on, now, sugar!</i>

143
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,384
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

144
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,132
<i>Just remember me when</i>

145
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,433
<i>We used to be friends</i>

146
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,687
<i>A long time ago</i>

147
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,270
<i>We used to be friends</i>

148
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:21,024
<i>Veronica Mars 2x20</i>
<i>"Look Who's Stalking"</i>

149
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,694
Hey, how's it going?

150
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,071
Oh, this is gonna be good.

151
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,030
What?

152
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,450
You have that "I'd-rather-be-making-
out-with-a-broken-bottle" look,

153
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,662
which, if history serves, means 
you're about to say something awkward.

154
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,999
This? This is my 
"I'd-rather-be-spelunking" look.

155
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,375
It's like you don't know me at all.

156
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,377
All right.
So, let's have it.

157
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:41,920
So...

158
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:43,922
you remember Duncan.

159
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,924
-Right, blue eyes.
-Right.

160
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:46,842
Yes.

161
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,094
You wouldn't happen to know
if he was with...

162
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,722
and by "with," I mean "with"...

163
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,974
uh, someone other than Meg?

164
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,601
Well, there was this one girl.

165
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,103
She was, uh, blonde, petite.

166
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,148
Smelled of marshmallows
and Promises.

167
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,526
Promises?
That's the name of my perfume.

168
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,571
You know,
generally speaking,

169
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,740
I've kind of grown immune
to your left-field questions,

170
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,909
but I'm gonna bite on this one.

171
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,370
What do you care who Duncan did
when Duncan did do dudettes?

172
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:20,125
Would you believe it's
for a college application?

173
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,418
Weird, huh?

174
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,380
You and Meg...
that's all I know about.

175
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,551
Duncan didn't talk about
his sex life much, though.

176
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:35,057
But he'd blush and shower a lot. That's
how you'd know he was getting some.

177
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,267
Well, I'm gonna miss these moments.

178
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:38,810
You going somewhere?

179
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,187
Oh, you see this?

180
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,105
Uh, this is high school.

181
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,399
We're here for four years,
and then we move on,

182
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,736
and all these people you see every day
vanish from your life,

183
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,655
and you never
have to think about them again.

184
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,574
So we should savor
our remaining moments.

185
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,451
You should come to alterna-prom.

186
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,245
I don't know what that is.

187
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:00,541
Wow.

188
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,293
You and your drunk 09er buddies
get the prom canceled 

189
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,004
and then use your inherited wealth
to throw a private prom.

190
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,840
When you say it like that,
it sounds unjust.

191
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,258
How does it sound when you say it?

192
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,509
Glamorous.

193
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,679
So, are you coming?

194
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,934
What?
You'd rather be spelunking?

195
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,144
No,  I'd rather be...

196
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,731
...strapped down on an anthill.

197
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,775
Man,  you've really lost it.

198
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,820
I was going to console
Jackie and Wallace that night.

199
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,532
You got their prom canceled,
remember?

200
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,783
Well, bring them along.

201
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:36,910
And bring whoever.

202
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,829
We, with our inherited wealth,
don't mind...

203
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,332
as  long as you bathe
and keep your hands off the silver.

204
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:44,751
I'll consider it.

205
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,131
Where does any disgraced
former lawman go?

206
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,049
Private security, baby.

207
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,343
Ooh, it sounds exotic.

208
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,889
Nah, it's boring...
big firm, tons of B.S.

209
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,599
Same old Leo.

210
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,435
I got to admit I was surprised
to hear from you, Veronica.

211
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,937
I figured after the eased-out-
of-the-department episode,

212
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,314
I kind of fell off your radar.

213
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,524
Are you kidding?
My radar is vast.

214
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,443
So, how's your love life?

215
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,237
Terrible.

216
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,822
How's yours?

217
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,449
Also terrible.

218
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:22,456
So, is that, maybe, why you've been
stalking miss Goodman here?

219
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,499
Hi. It's Gia.

220
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,335
Same old Veronica.

221
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,088
It's not stalking.
It's personal security.

222
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,007
Miss Goodman is a job.

223
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,217
I'm a job?

224
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,384
Your dad hired the firm.

225
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,470
A couple of us were assigned
to keep an eye on you.

226
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,640
Want to go say "hi" to Earl?
I'm sure he's parked outside.

227
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,308
Why does he want Gia watched?

228
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:42,976
I just punch the clock.

229
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,728
My bosses don't share
that kind of stuff with me.

230
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,106
I assume there's been some sort
of threat, but I don't know.

231
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,236
Is that why you wanted to see me?

232
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,323
That was pretty much it, yeah.

233
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,534
Well, I'm a little disappointed.

234
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,328
It was good seeing you again, Veronica.

235
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:02,913
Miss Goodman.

236
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,084
You went out with him?

237
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,379
He's cute... in a tough,
mumbly kind of way.

238
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:14,049
Why would my dad hire security?

239
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,845
I wonder if it has anything to do
with that thing with your dad.

240
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,179
What thing?

241
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,767
I don't know why they're making
such a big deal of it.

242
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,562
I mean, a girl drinks too much...
that's not your dad's fault.

243
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,981
He's just doing what he was hired to.

244
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,113
Just make sure those vans are
at the Senior Center at 9:00 sharp.

245
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,575
-Yeah.  Thanks. I got to run. Bye.
-Woody?

246
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:41,451
You blame me for this?

247
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,662
-Keith, please, let me explain.
-"When reached for comment,

248
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,415
Goodman's office said "Mars had been
engaged to investigate leaks,

249
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,710
"but mr. Goodman had interceded when
he learned the investigator

250
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,253
had plied the staffer with alcohol."

251
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,504
Look you're right. You're right.

252
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,631
I help you,
and this is what I get?

253
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,639
How could I know
the manager had a camera?

254
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,474
I'm sorry I had to do this,

255
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,977
but there's just so much
riding on this incorporation vote.

256
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,105
I think you may be confused
about something, Woody.

257
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,774
I'm voting against incorporation.

258
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:21,241
So, I dropped by my dad's office
and asked him about the security thing.

259
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,827
He said it was nothing,
just normal election precautions,

260
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,537
and he agreed
to pull the security detail

261
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,456
once I told him
that it was creeping me out.

262
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,167
Okay.
So, that's good, right?

263
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,127
But  then I got home,
and I found this.

264
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,176
That's my brother.

265
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,136
I know.

266
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,971
I met him, remember?

267
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:48,977
What do you think it is?

268
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,773
Something very creepy.

269
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,076
Is a lunch lady who does
body building human interest?

270
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,079
Human, maybe.
Interest, no.

271
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,457
I can't believe I'm expected
to meet newspaper deadline

272
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,417
when I have some creepy dude
stalking me.

273
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,551
Do you know who that is...
the woman with the camera?

274
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,304
That's mrs. Harmon.
You don't think she has...

275
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,806
No, look where she's shooting.

276
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:30,519
Whoever made this, she probably
got him on that video.

277
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,021
Do you think you can get that tape?

278
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:36,024
Look, off the record, Lloyd.

279
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,151
It's not that I never worked for Woody,

280
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,112
but I never investigated any leaks

281
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:43,949
and I never used a bottle of scotch
to question a campaign staffer.

282
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,785
Then you might want to put that
out there on the record.

283
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,329
Woody's pushing
this whole thing on you, Keith.

284
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:53,083
We had him on a conference call...
all off the record, of course...

285
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:58,172
and he more or less implied he caught
you taking advantage of this girl,

286
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,798
Jennifer Stansfield.

287
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:03,302
You don't believe me,
talk to the staffer, Stansfield.

288
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,387
You know,
funny thing about her.

289
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,681
After you dropped her off
at the hospital,

290
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:11,560
she took off before being treated
and now no one can track her down.

291
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,062
Batting cages.

292
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,647
There's one up north.

293
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,482
We could get some flowers,

294
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,401
play a little music,

295
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,153
take out some chinese.

296
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:26,700
The prom is canceled and you want
to take me to a batting cage instead?

297
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:28,785
Yeah.

298
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,581
It's for that so-casual-
it's-super-romantic thing.

299
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:36,502
That's not a thing.
That's male wishful thinking.

300
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,880
But I want to wear my dress.
Think fancy.

301
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,133
Can we do it anyway?

302
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,135
Maybe this afternoon.

303
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,137
No, I'm going to see my dad
in the hospital.

304
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:48,972
How's that going?

305
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,100
Strange, but great.

306
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,187
It's never been worse for him,
but between us...

307
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,688
best it's ever been.

308
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,106
For the first time ever,

309
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,400
it's like one of my parents
actually has time for me.

310
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:02,986
Okay, I have news.

311
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:06,490
The senior memories,
once thought lost forever,

312
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,784
can, in fact,
be generated, after all,

313
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,994
albeit in a slightly degraded form.

314
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,498
The rich kids are throwing
a private replacement prom.

315
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:18,001
Damn, they just privatizing
everything these days.

316
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,672
Alterna-prom?
Hmm...formal attire.

317
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,090
That's what I'm talking about.

318
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:24,883
Please don't give us
the tux speech again.

319
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:25,717
What?

320
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,137
You mean... how
when I put on a tux,

321
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,307
I make James Bond look like Cletus,
the slack-jaw yokel.

322
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,267
Shh!

323
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:40,065
Oh, please tell me Butters
knows nothing about this.

324
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,441
Hey, what's up?

325
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,945
Eehh... did you say, uh,
alterna-something?

326
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,539
Not exactly who I was expecting to see.

327
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,084
They're finally allowing
non-family visitors.

328
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,794
Thought I'd drop by,

329
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:04,256
find out what the hell you were doing
breaking into the Dumas family home.

330
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:07,384
She said she was writing 
a story... a tell-all...

331
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,303
about the gambling,
the debt, about...

332
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,388
how I threw a playoff game.

333
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,391
And when the bus thing hit, I was
worried her parents would find it.

334
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,061
So when you're accused of taking out
a busload of kids to off your lover,

335
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,772
you decide your best move is
to break into her parents' house?

336
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:23,442
Well, their unlocked garage,
actually, but, yeah.

337
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,570
This  whole bus thing...

338
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,280
I'm not their man.

339
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:32,701
But if that story about throwing
the playoff game ever got out,

340
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:33,869
I'm ruined.

341
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,871
Hey, there's my girl.

342
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,332
Good afternoon, mr. Mars.

343
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,042
It's that time of day again...

344
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,960
clubhouse gossip.

345
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,921
My favorite time of day.

346
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,131
Okay, I'll be in touch.

347
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,175
You keep him out of trouble.

348
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,468
I'll try.

349
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,386
So, what have we got?

350
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,723
Well, it seems that Mets manager
Willie Randolph is not happy.

351
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,938
So I told mrs. Harmon 
that my friend's boyfriend

352
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,814
might have been
at the game with another girl.

353
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,107
Clever.

354
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,150
Not bad.

355
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,529
You  just might have a future
in this racket.

356
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:18,455
Look.

357
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,962
That's a Neptune letterman jacket.

358
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,928
He's gone.

359
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,725
But the letterman jacket's
got to be something, right?

360
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,900
There. Look. You see?
The red truck.

361
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,241
It's gone,
and so is he.

362
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:55,742
It must be his.

363
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,077
Snap.

364
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,748
So now we just need to find a varsity
letterman who drives a red pickup,

365
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,667
and we've got our stalker.

366
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:22,686
I wanted to see what it was like
getting your news off the ground.

367
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,855
And the stories...

368
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,732
so tawdry.

369
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,110
There was one yesterday
about you getting a girl drunk.

370
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:31,445
I can't believe it.

371
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:35,032
What? You don't think a girl
would have a few drinks with me?

372
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:37,034
I just read otherwise.

373
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,870
Enjoy your headlines.
Got to go vote.

374
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:02,309
So, special ballot measure number 51...

375
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,354
should Neptune consolidate
its wealth and exclusivity 

376
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,856
at the expense of the poor
and the unglamorous?

377
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,609
Answer... no.

378
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,529
Who are you taking to the alterna-prom?

379
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,447
Well, I considered a lot of chicks,

380
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,407
but finally,
I figured I'd just go stag.

381
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:18,909
I mean, it's not the prom.

382
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,160
It's the alterna-prom.

383
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:21,620
Why narrow my options?

384
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:23,622
You shot down, huh?

385
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,541
It's like a conspiracy.

386
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:27,084
Yeah, it's a good thing
we're graduating.

387
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,711
Sounds like you've hit that point
where every girl in school knows you.

388
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,672
Bring on the sorority girls.

389
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,716
Dude! You need me to bring
anything to the big bash?

390
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,469
'Cause if it's one thing I know
how to do right, it's pot luck.

391
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,305
Uh...which big bash is that?

392
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:43,016
Alterna-prom.
I make these killer brownies.

393
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,435
The secret...
it's all in the Butter.

394
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:51,567
The student parking-permit list
doesn't show any red pickups,

395
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,985
but that doesn't mean much here,

396
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,195
as it's not uncommon 
for certain students

397
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,614
to trade up to new rides
whenever they get bored.

398
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:00,993
So either our mystery student
doesn't drive to school,

399
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,870
or I'm barking up the wrong tree.

400
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:06,540
So, the only red pickup
on the list belongs to a girl...

401
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,624
I don't care about that.

402
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,376
Oh, I thought we were...

403
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,337
What I do care about what
your stupid dad thinks he's doing.

404
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:13,881
Gia...

405
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,300
So, now he's saying that it was
my dad in that motel 

406
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:19,136
and he was sleeping with a hooker
he paid in campaign money?

407
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,555
My dad didn't get that woman drunk.
That's all he said.

408
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,974
I just don't get you people.
I just don't.

409
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,730
<i>And there will be</i>
<i>no incorporated town of Neptune,</i>

410
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:33,817
<i>as the special ballot measure goes</i>
<i>down by a three-point margin.</i>

411
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:38,655
<i>Many point to the supervisor's</i>
<i>ongoing scandals as a deciding factor.</i>

412
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,700
<i>No official comment yet</i>
<i>from the supervisor's office, but...</i>

413
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,577
so Neptune has to keep us.

414
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:45,996
What's a yacht without barnacles?

415
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:50,292
So, I'm stuck on something
and hoped you could help me.

416
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:51,460
Absolutely.

417
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:53,670
Unless it's physics or chemistry...

418
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,756
or math or in english.

419
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:58,592
P.E....
I was good at P.E.

420
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,722
So, some guy's been stalking Gia.

421
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,350
I got a tape of him shooting
Gia's brother's soccer game.

422
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,018
Hey, what do you mean,
"him shooting"?

423
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:13,065
She found a DVD
this guy sent to her house...

424
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,775
creepy footage of her.

425
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,527
When did she get this?

426
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:17,694
The other day.

427
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,322
Let me show you something.

428
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:22,824
He got this last month...

429
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:26,703
hired me to look into it, figuring some
antiincorporation guy crossed the line.

430
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:30,165
That's the same thing he told Gia when
she asked about the security detail.

431
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,877
Until I figured out that this was shot
before incorporation was announced.

432
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,295
All of a sudden,
I'm off the case,

433
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,506
and his gardener confessed
out of the blue.

434
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,301
So what does that mean?

435
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,805
Woody's scared of something and 
he's lying about it and it's serious.

436
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,724
I want you to leave that tape with me
and stay away from this case.

437
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,644
This is more than just
some obsessed school kid,

438
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,312
and I don't want you
sticking your nose in.

439
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,065
And I mean that,
you understand?

440
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,446
Miss Mars, 
what do you think you're doing?

441
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,782
Just some clerical business.

442
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,536
This is study hall.
If you wanted clerical hall,

443
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,204
you should have signed up
for clerical hall.

444
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,666
Mr. Echolls,
so glad you could join us...

445
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,293
late.

446
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:20,257
And that is what happens
when you never get laid.

447
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,594
Well, why don't you invite him
to your bitchin' party?

448
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:27,347
Hey, speaking of my bitchin' party,
a funny thing happened.

449
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:31,602
That stoner dude, Corny...
whom I don't recall inviting...

450
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,270
offered to bring dessert.

451
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,815
Exactly how many losers
are now coming to my party?

452
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:38,192
You said invite whoever.

453
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,360
It didn't occur to you
that I might not have meant it?

454
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:43,780
What is that?

455
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,532
Just some work stuff for my dad.

456
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,119
Why?

457
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:51,830
Nothing.

458
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:55,334
It just looks like the guy
my dad shared a cell with.

459
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,714
Now, that's a hell of a dress.

460
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,300
Gucci knock-off...
still pretty slinky, though.

461
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:04,968
I thought you said
your prom was canceled.

462
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:08,847
It was, but some kids
are having kind of a replacement prom.

463
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,682
So Wallace and I
are doing the whole thing...

464
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,059
The dinner and the limo.

465
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,936
Oh, he got his tux,
which, he's warning me,

466
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:18,232
is some kind of insanely 
masculine mesmerizer of women.

467
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,858
You just better be careful, Jackie.

468
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,652
Relax, dad.

469
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,365
I learned the birds and the bees
the hard way, remember?

470
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,660
I mean it sounds like you're really
falling for this Wallace guy.

471
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:34,164
He's a nice young man whom I like, yes.

472
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,669
Wait, are you trying to give me,
like, fatherly advice?

473
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,505
Trying.
How am I doing?

474
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:43,841
Not bad for a novice.

475
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,260
I like Wallace,

476
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:50,305
but I'm leaving for Paris. We both
know it, so there's no illusions...

477
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:52,724
which is actually nice.

478
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,268
Deadline night.

479
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,854
I've been lying in wait
to try to walk out with Gia

480
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,063
to warn her about her dad,

481
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,274
but either she's writing
the greatest story

482
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:02,359
about lunch-lady body building ever

483
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:04,236
or she's determined to avoid me.

484
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:10,200
Hey, Gia, I was heading out 
and thought maybe...

485
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:11,493
I'm really busy right now.

486
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:15,539
So, since strangling her would be
counterproductive,

487
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:17,207
that only leaves giving up.

488
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,209
-Good night, Veronica.
-Good night.

489
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:25,883
-Hey, Veronica.
-Hey, Lucky.

490
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,242
Dad, it's me.

491
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,329
I know you told me to stay away
from this stalker thing, and I did.

492
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,206
But it just popped up
right in front of me.

493
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:59,583
The red truck...
it's the janitor's,

494
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,668
and Gia's in the building with him.

495
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:03,337
Call me.

496
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:11,470
15 minutes, dad... that's all
the longer I can be expected to wait.

497
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,222
Have taser, will travel.

498
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:21,021
That's... Kuwait.

499
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:24,608
And that's Iraq.

500
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:26,568
Wow.

501
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,696
Was that freaky?

502
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,658
Was it freaky?

503
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:36,245
You want to see freaky?

504
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,709
It's a roadside bomb.

505
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:43,752
Boom!

506
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:45,504
That was freaky.

507
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:47,381
Ugh! You know?

508
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:48,924
The insurgency...

509
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,343
always leaving us presents.

510
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:55,305
But, hell, you know,

511
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,099
the whole world...

512
00:25:58,141 --> 00:25:59,601
is freaky.

513
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:03,146
Right?

514
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:06,400
That is so wild.

515
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:07,985
Yeah.

516
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:13,115
I should do, like, a human-interest
thing on you for the navigator.

517
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,495
You should.

518
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:20,581
Hey, let me show you
something else.

519
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:27,504
What do you want?

520
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:32,342
Hey.

521
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:36,722
Veronica Mars...
just in time.

522
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,724
Do you want to see something freaky?

523
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,559
-Um...
-Hold on.

524
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,986
The guy with the red truck.
The varsity jacket.

525
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:54,198
Check it out.

526
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:58,327
I got this off an iraqi corpse.

527
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:02,080
This sucker will do
some serious damage.

528
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,373
Serrated blade.

529
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,209
That's really cool,
but, actually...

530
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,377
We got to go.

531
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,338
Right. I'm sorry.

532
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,300
Guess the human-interest story
will have to wait.

533
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:15,677
That's too bad,

534
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,598
'cause I got some
pretty crazy stuff I could tell you.

535
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:23,977
I know your dad,
you know.

536
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,066
What the hell, man?

537
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:30,859
The sheriff's on his way.
Don't move.

538
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,277
Get off me, man.

539
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:35,030
Why have you been stalking Gia?
The videos and the break-ins... why?

540
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:38,450
Screw you, man. Just screw you.
He deserved it.

541
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:39,660
He deserved it!

542
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,161
Everyone, freeze.

543
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:45,207
Keith, when you call the sheriff,
you don't have to come yourself.

544
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,250
Would you get up off the man?

545
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,002
You said you have evidence
to back up what you said?

546
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,588
And he basically confessed already.
We get him in a room for an hour...

547
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,257
We?
I appreciate the heads-up.

548
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:56,218
This is a law-enforcement matter now, 
mr. Mars. You can go.

549
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:59,096
Go on ahead to your party, honey.

550
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:00,722
Might be a little late tonight.

551
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,445
Madison.

552
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:17,573
Flying solo?

553
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:20,200
Ditto.
Just me and the party pig.

554
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:21,326
Hold it.

555
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:27,499
What's that smell?

556
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:31,295
-Mac, you really do...
-Don't distract me...

557
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,547
I'm plotting how to kill you
and make it look like an accident.

558
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:37,009
Oh, hold it. Sweet.

559
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:40,095
Penthouse, please.
All right.

560
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,816
God... longest elevator ride ever.

561
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,194
Wait for the space elevator.

562
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,199
They're designing it now...

563
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,659
a huge elevator on a 100-mile
carbon-polymer cable

564
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:04,036
that goes all the way to space.

565
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,330
That'll be a long elevator ride.

566
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,417
Still not as long as this one.

567
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,131
Thank god.

568
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:22,262

573
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,737
So, tonight there's only 
one thing I ask of you.

574
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,031
Make senior memories.

575
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:42,991
Uh, that's why I brought the party pig.

576
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,494
Better watch yourself, Danielle.

577
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,705
Here comes me and my hog.
Soo-wee!

578
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:54,795
-Yo man.
-Okay, how'ya doin'?

579
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:55,796
Fine

580
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,424
I need a drink.

581
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,471
Mac just had dinner on a pirate ship.

582
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:15,482
Back at the school, you were
saying Woody deserved it. Why?

583
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:16,984
Did he do something to you?

584
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:18,485
Someone you know?

585
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:36,753
What are you looking at, nutjob?

586
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,589
Cut him some slack, Don.

587
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,758
I wasn't talking to him, Keith.

588
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,560
I don't think he likes you.

589
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:54,396
<i>[unidentified song]</i>

590
00:30:57,858 --> 00:30:59,234
I'm not stupid, you know.

591
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:03,322
I know it's weird to force someone
to go to prom with you.

592
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:04,489
I know.

593
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,909
So why did you do it?

594
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:11,205
Because I wanted to be true to myself.

595
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:13,248
I am weird.

596
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,752
I thought maybe 
you'd understand because...

597
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:18,754
you're a little weird, too.

598
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,131
That's a compliment.

599
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,009
Oh.

600
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:29,348
Well, then you're really, really weird.

605
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:43,362
Senior year's almost over.

606
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:46,073
In a month, we might
never see each other again.

607
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:48,575
Never.
Think about how long that is.

608
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:50,369
It's like forever, but worse.

609
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:52,079
I'm not gonna sleep with you.

610
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:54,414
We could fool around in the bathroom.

611
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:55,999
Old time's sake?

612
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,418
Never...
it's a long time, Madison.

613
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,628
Leave her alone, Dick.

614
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:01,964
You don't want to make her
have to call the law,

615
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:06,051
'cause I hear the law
really comes down hard.

616
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:06,927
Have you heard that?

617
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:10,013
So, I guess you're here alone
since Duncan, like,

618
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,390
ran away or whatever.

619
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:13,725
You mean "took it on the lam"?

620
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,395
'Cause I can't imagine
what that's like. Can you?

621
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,230
Being on the lam.

622
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:21,316
I think you'd just want to close
your eyes and pray for it all to end.

623
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:23,652
You'd have the cops
crawling all over you.

624
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,028
Right?

625
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:26,363
What do you think, Madison?

626
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:28,866
There's Gia.

627
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,495
What does Madison
care about Gia, Ronnie?

628
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:35,706
What do you think the odds are

629
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,457
of you and me hooking up 
by the end of the night?

630
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,962
I happen to have them right here.

631
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:45,340
They are a googolplex to one.

632
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:46,842
Right on.

633
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:49,761
So I'll send over a bartender
and check back in with you later.

634
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:52,931
Hey, Shelly...
speaking of pork...

635
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,391
want to meet my hog?

636
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,475
Ow!

637
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,644
You don't want to drink that.
Trust me.

638
00:32:57,853 --> 00:33:01,523
Hey, thanks for rescuing me
back at school.

639
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:02,566
That was cool.

640
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:05,527
And I'm sorry about
what I said about your dad.

641
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:08,447
He's been called worse.

00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,205

I'm leaving it to you to represent

648
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:23,545
You can't just leave me here.

649
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:26,131
We'd stay,
but I just can't control myself.

00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:51,114
I'm sure you could have
your pick of the bimbos.

You know, I'm surprised, Veronica.

666
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:12,135
And as a keen observer 
of the human condition,

667
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:14,137
I thought you saw through people
better than that.

668
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,099
I mean, bimbos?
That's not me anymore.

669
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:19,476

and we won't see each other at all.

686
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:02,936
And then you'll leave town,
and then...

Come on.
Ruined lives, bloodshed?

693
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,169
You really think a relationship
should be that hard?

694
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:30,881
No one writes songs
about the ones that come easy.

695
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:34,510
<i>I hear the bells</i>
<i>So fascinating and</i>

696
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,387
<i>I’ll slug it out</i>
<i>I’m sick of waiting</i>

697
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:39,181
<i>-and I can </i>
<i>-I can</i>

698
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:44,061
<i>hear the bells are ringing</i>
<i>joyful and triumphant</i>

699
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:46,063
<i>-and I can </i>
<i>-I can</i>

700
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:50,692
<i>hear the bells are ringing</i>
<i>joyful and triumphant</i>

701
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:52,486
<i>-and I can </i>
<i>-I can</i>

702
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:57,324
<i>hear the bells are ringing</i>
<i>joyful and triumphant</i>

703
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:58,242
I have to go.

704
00:35:58,742 --> 00:35:59,952
I have to go.

705
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:04,248
<i>hear the bells are ringing</i>
<i>joyful and triumphant</i>

706
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:05,916
<i>-and I can </i>
<i>-I can</i>

707
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:12,047
<i>[DJ Harry - "All My Life"]</i>
<i>Oh. Come right down to it</i>

708
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:23,517
<i><song playable online!></i>
<i>How do I accept the gift?</i>

709
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:34,278
<i>She don't matter now I exist</i>

710
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:39,408
<i>I've thought lots about it</i>

711
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:44,037
<i>and I am still in limbo</i>

712
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:48,709
<i>I still don't know if it's down there</i>

713
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:52,921
<i>in my soul</i>
<i>if it's down there in my soul</i>

714
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,049
So, mayor Goodman.

715
00:36:57,968 --> 00:36:59,511
Why do you want to scare
that guy so bad?

716
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,640
I mean, I admit, I'm no great fan
of the man's policies, myself.

717
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,058
His policies?

718
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:08,061
You see,
that's the thing.

719
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:12,191
People always talk about him
as this great guy.

720
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:16,320
"He's the mayor."
"He makes good burgers.

721
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,989
 "He's awesome, Woody Goodman."

722
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:23,577
She don't know what he really is.

723
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:25,537
What is he, really?

724
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,748
You want to know?

725
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,549
You might want to apologize to Sacks,

726
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:40,344
who spent the last hour
with his arm down that drain.

727
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:45,682
A couple more minutes.

728
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:49,937
Please, Don.
He's about to open up.

729
00:37:51,063 --> 00:37:53,649
No can do. He's going home now.
He just made bail.

730
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:55,567
Who bailed him out?

731
00:37:58,487 --> 00:37:59,655
Mr. Manning.

732
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:02,491
Mr. Manning?
Meg Manning's father?

733
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,288
Guess he's got a soft spot for weirdos.

734
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:13,544
Hey.

735
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:17,047
Must not have been that wild a party
if you're up this early.

736
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,758
It was... whatever.

737
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:23,053
Ahh... whatever.

738
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:41,989
You can go ahead in now.

739
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:50,372
Good morning.

740
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,195
Hello.

741
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:24,740
First, let me say that I'm sorry
for running out last night like I did.

742
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,994
I was a bit overwhelmed.
I needed to collect my thoughts,

743
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:30,579
think about what you said.

744
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:33,540
-Veronica...
-Let me just get this out.

745
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,752
I don't want to lose you
from my life, either.

746
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:41,757
And I'm not saying I'm ready
to dive back into anything, but...

747
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:46,053
after graduation, let's make it
a point to see each other,

748
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:48,263
see where that takes us.

749
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:52,392
Remember what you said
about our relationship being epic?

750
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:01,902
Oh, god.

751
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:07,366
Last night was kind of a blur.

752
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:09,743
Is that our room service?

753
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,540
No.

754
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:17,626
Just Veronica Mars.

755
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:19,670
What a disappointment.

756
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:22,840
Come on,
let's get you cleaned up.

757
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:25,092
Bye, Veronica.

758
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,390
Look, whatever I said, I...

759
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:33,767
You should know...

760
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:34,893
Stop.

761
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:50,993
