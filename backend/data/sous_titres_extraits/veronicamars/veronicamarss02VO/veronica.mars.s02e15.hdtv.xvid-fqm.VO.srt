He did it.

39
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:29,107
His body washed up on the beach, 
beaten to death.

40

I have a friend in common.

You sure you're not clouded by your
years of being his biggest fan?

48
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:55,647
A secret tumultuous relationship with 
a teacher who died in the crash?

49
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:56,974
It seems like more of a motive

50
00:01:57,026 --> 00:01:59,118
than supporting Woody's
plans for incorporation.

51
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:00,666
That's why you didn't
take the bus home?

52
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,004
Actually,
my dad told me not to.

53
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:05,360

That's an interesting theory, Eli.

65
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:30,129
But before you think about
spreading it around,

kicked Curly's head in?

explosive and detonators.

73
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:56,085
Veronica, are you absolutely sure what
you saw in that hangar were explosives?

74
00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:59,935

a legitimate use for them.

nothing to do with the bus crash,

the call that detonated the bomb?

175
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,048
along with the gorgeous,

176
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:31,894
brilliant, sweetheart
of a man that goes with it.

177
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,181
Aw.

178
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:37,752
I have to say we don't get that many
bachelorette parties at The Hut.

179
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:43,101
This is just the first stop of
the no-holds-barred bacchanalia!

180
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:45,625
Coffee up, ladies.

181
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:48,956
It's a bachelorette scavenger hunt.

182
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:52,484
"One... sing slutty song publicly.

183
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,811
Two... talk a man 
out of his underwear."

184
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:56,709
Done and done.

185
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:03,604
Say "cheez whiz."

186
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:08,513
All righty, then. Well, if you wind up
getting to number 8,

187
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:09,897
be sure and bring mouthwash.

188
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:30,619
Oh, you looky-loos with your 
police-band radios and your free time.

189
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:32,013
What did you find?

190
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:33,026
All right, people,

191
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:34,671
back it on up.

192
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:36,310
There's nothing to see here.

193
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:39,236
Is that C4?

194
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:41,276
Did the bomb squad confirm it?

195
00:08:41,277 --> 00:08:43,661
Sir, this is a police matter.

196
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:46,965
You'll have to wait for the press 
conference like everyone else.

197
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:01,452
V eronica.

198
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,448
Hey, party girl.

199
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:03,453
I need your help.

200
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:04,386
Let me guess,

201
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,394
the "pin the penis on the fireman"
game ended in tears?

202
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:08,125
My sister's missing.

203
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:13,545
<i>A long time ago,</i>

204
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:16,429
<i>We used to be friends, but I</i>

205
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,848
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

206
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:23,807
<i>Come on, now, sugar!</i>

207
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:26,061
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

208
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:29,572
<i>Just remember me when</i>

209
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:31,745
<i>We used to be friends</i>

210
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:34,084
<i>A long time ago</i>

211
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:36,562
<i>We used to be friends</i>

212
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:39,156
<i>Veronica Mars 2x15
The Quick And The Wed</i>

213
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:41,210
<i>See appendixes for songs infos,
available upon french translation.</i>

214
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:45,365
Heidi's friends dropped her off
at 2:00 in the morning.

215
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:47,453
She missed her final 
dress fitting at 10:00.

216
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:49,019
We figured she was hung over,

217
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,303
but we went by her place.

218
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:55,071
Called everyone. No one's seen her.
No one's heard from her.

219
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:57,086
Her cellphone goes right to voice mail.

220
00:09:57,142 --> 00:09:58,735
Did you check the hospitals?

221
00:09:58,736 --> 00:10:00,358
My mom did.

222
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:01,421
Here's the thing.

223
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:02,518
My sister's great,

224
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:03,886
but she's...

225
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:06,376
She's kind of a dingbat sometimes.

226
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:10,132
What?

227
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,329
The last time we all went to the beach,

228
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,553
Heidi almost drowned herself
trying to swim with the dolphins.

229
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:18,479
I'm just afraid she's
having a Heidi moment

230
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,087
and she's gonna mess up her life.

231
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:21,928
We have to find her before the wedding.

232
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:24,144
Paul and his family 
cannot find out she's gone.

233
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:27,291
Aren't they gonna miss her? I mean, 
doesn't she have wedding stuff to do?

234
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:28,303
There's a wedding planner

235
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:30,238
and Paul's parents are pretty much
doing everything else.

236
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:31,793
What about the rehearsal dinner?

237
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:32,664
You thinking a stunt double?

238
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:33,667
There isn't one.

239
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:36,731
It's gonna be a tiny ceremony...
immediate family only...

240
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,783
then 500 at the reception.

241
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:39,940
When's the wedding?

242
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:40,899
Saturday,

243
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:42,895
as in three days from now.

244
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:46,332
At 10:17 this morning,

245
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,809
a warrant for the arrest of 
Terrence Cook was issued,

246
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:51,341
charging him with eight counts 
of murder in the first degree.

247
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:52,906
Sheriff, you picked him up 
for questioning

248
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,094
before without charging him.

249
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:55,510
Is there new evidence?

250
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:58,916
Explosives were found matching 
the type used in the bus crash

251
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:02,940
in hangar space used by mr. Cook 
to house his fleet of automobiles.

252
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,881
Do you have mr. Cook in custody?

253
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:07,043
No, not yet. But if he runs,

254
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:08,651
he's not gonna get far.

255
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:14,669
Hey.

256
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,246
Do you mind helping me out?

257
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:18,925
A friend's sister is missing...
a runaway bride thing.

258
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:20,091
Her name is Heidi Kuhne.

259
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:22,760
Veronica. Aren't you supposed 
to be at school,

260
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,510
doing schooly type stuff?

261
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:27,687
That's why I want you to run
her phone records, pops.

262
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:30,996
You can do this in your sleep. Come on.

263
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:32,547
<i>All right,
just as long as...</i>

264
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:34,068
both cell and home, please,

265
00:11:34,138 --> 00:11:35,516
and you might as well check 
her credit cards

266
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,233
and ATM activity 
while you're at it.

267
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:38,784
Is there anything else,
darling?

268
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:40,594
Hey, I'm sorry about Terrence.

269
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:42,003
Yeah, me too.

270
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,023
So, you want to come over after school?

271
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,352
The words out of your mouth
are "come over",

272
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:57,962
but all I hear you saying 
is "let's have sex".

273
00:11:57,963 --> 00:11:59,455
Excuse me?

274
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:01,194
All I heard you say 
was "let's have sex".

275
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:08,595
Toying with a sweet little girl's heart
just to screw with her dad?

276
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,339
I get it.

277
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,115
San Quentin isn't quite as enticing
as, say, college.

278
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:18,843
But, damn, you've really plumbed
new depths, Logan.

279
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:22,549
You're cute when you're jealous.

280
00:12:26,902 --> 00:12:32,834
Did Heidi say anything about being 
unhappy or having second thoughts?

281
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,929
No, she's more of the "act now,
think later" type of girl.

282
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,330
Her first love, Nick,

283
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:41,872
she had his name tattooed 
on her ass after a week.

284
00:12:41,873 --> 00:12:43,647
It was two weeks,

285
00:12:43,648 --> 00:12:45,106
and she had it removed.

286
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:47,067
When?
She didn't tell me.

287
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:48,993
It took like six weeks.

288
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:51,132
That's why she waited 
so long to sleep with Paul.

289
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,325
She didn't want him to see it.

290
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:55,531
And he thinks he found
himself the last nice girl.

291
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:57,780
Oh, my god, did you guys hear
about Nick's mother?

292
00:12:57,781 --> 00:13:00,972
She fell off her roof putting up
a satellite dish.

293
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:03,264
Okay, let's try to stay on topic.

294
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,696
Did anything out of the ordinary
happen last night?

295
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,099
Packaged meat was pretty extraordinary.

296
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:12,588
I lost my cellular phone.

297
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:13,679
Packaged?

298
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:15,799
The all-male revue we took her to.

299
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,801
There was this guy creeping her out
at the happy horseshoe.

300
00:13:18,802 --> 00:13:20,537
She said she's seen him before,

301
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:21,740
like he was following her.

302
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:23,459
She had the bouncers kick him out.

303
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,400
Did any of you see him?

304
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:28,325
When you were here,
you were taking pictures.

305
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:31,225
Jen got one of those novelty 
disposable cameras,

306
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:35,325
the ones where the prints come out
with penises around the borders.

307
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:36,600
Lovely.

308
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:37,833
Where's the camera?

309
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,206
I gave it to Heidi.

310
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:40,524
I think she took it with her.

311
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:42,483
Thank you, ladies,
for all your help.

312
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:45,051
If I were a novelty camera,
where would I be?

313
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,938
Be it ever so disgusting,

314
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:53,922
there's no place like Heidi's.

315
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:56,896
Okay, her apartment being ransacked?

316
00:13:56,963 --> 00:13:58,044
Not a good sign.

317
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,078
It's okay.
This is how it always looks.

318
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:04,163
It should be easy to find a camera
in this, don't you think?

319
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,745
Two wine glasses...

320
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:12,294
you sure she wasn't expecting company?

321
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:13,347
I'm sure.

322
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,232
She left her cellphone charger.

323
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,218
Might be why she's not returning calls.

324
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:21,589
Can you tell if she packed a bag?

325
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:24,094
You're kidding, right?

326
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:30,870
Hi!

327
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:39,444
So, how are you doing, boss?

328
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:43,522
Me? Well, I'm holding up my end.

329
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:46,495
I got six more properties added to 
the Phoenix Land Trust portfolio,

330
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,843
two of which are beachfront.

331
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:51,065
You would not believe
the deals that I've gotten.

332
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:53,062
That's good.

333
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:55,052
Yeah, but we're out of capital.
That's bad.

334
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:57,103
Maybe it's time 
to think outside the box,

335
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,899
you know,
find new revenue streams.

336
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:03,973
You know that all the investors believe
that your dad is pulling the strings?

337
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:04,912
I know.

338
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:10,375
I did hear the Kane house
is going up for sale.

339
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:12,981
It's the wrong side of town.
The deals are all south.

340
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:14,405
I think we should buy it.

341
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:16,086
What have I told you about thinking?

342
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:19,912
That it makes my breasts smaller?

343
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:25,089
Have you ever considered
that maybe I'm the clever one,

344
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,396
that this delightful packaging

345
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,733
is a means to outwitting my adversary?

346
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:33,957
Consider it?

347
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:36,515
I'm banking on it.

348
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:44,143
But have you considered
that you're my adversary?

349
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,829
My name's on everything, right?

350
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:54,622
Oh, yes, it is.

351
00:15:56,232 --> 00:16:01,094
So, they've set a trial
date 60 days from today.

352
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:03,305
Whatever will I wear?

353
00:16:03,306 --> 00:16:06,687
The D.A. Is offering 
a one-time deal... a plea bargain.

354
00:16:06,837 --> 00:16:07,862
Well, I'm not interested.

355
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:08,800
You should be.

356
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:10,956
They're talking 
involuntary manslaughter.

357
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:14,172
That brings your maximum 
sentence down from 11 years to 4.

358
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,723
With good behavior...
if you could muster some...

359
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:18,206
you'd be out in half that.

360
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:20,050
Two years?

361
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:24,964
Logan, let me remind you 
the prosecution has witnesses,

362
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,242
the good kind...

363
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:27,363
eyewitnesses.

364
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:30,474
Cholo lowlifes and a lying,
cokehead plastic surgeon.

365
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,483
A prominent, 
well-respected cokehead doctor.

366
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:35,510
And how many jurors 
you think we can find in Neptune

367
00:16:35,563 --> 00:16:37,684
who haven't been exposed
to your winning charm

368
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:39,076
in the "Tinseltown Diaries"?

369
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:43,504
Jurors love convicting smug,
rich boys. It's a fact.

370
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:46,719
I've asked around... 
and I hope this isn't news to you...

371
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,157
but no one likes you.

372
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:50,356
Even if I had stabbed Felix,

373
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:53,318
which I didn't,
it would've been self-defense.

374
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,800
I got jumped by a gang.
Argue that.

375
00:16:55,852 --> 00:16:58,419
I plan to, but the doctor
didn't see a gang.

376
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,719
He saw three bikers,

377
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:00,945
one of them bleeding to death,

378
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:02,691
a knife in your hand.

379
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:05,973
He'll testify that you weren't
in peril when you stabbed Felix.

380
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:07,129
No deal.

381
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,414
Well, if it helps you decide
on your wardrobe,

382
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,368
I'll be wearing an 
"I'm with stupid" t-shirt.

383
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:21,046
Yeah, this is where I would come
for cash in the middle of the night.

384
00:17:21,047 --> 00:17:23,231
Dad said all her cards were maxed,

385
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:25,760
so Heidi hit three different
ATMs in an hour.

386
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:28,421
She made the maximum withdraw at each.

387
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:30,362
What are you thinking?

388
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:33,530
Well, either she had some
more g-strings left to stuff at

389
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:37,781
packaged meat or someone forced
her to take that money out.

390
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:40,791
Oh, man,
what am I gonna tell Jane?

391
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:44,126
Let's not freak out until there's
something concrete to freak out about.

392
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,381
You mean like finding her car
abandoned in the middle of nowhere?

393
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,816
Yeah, like that.

394
00:17:57,918 --> 00:17:59,616
That's it? That's all you'll do?

395
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:01,357
<i>Lady, that's all we can do.</i>

396
00:18:03,171 --> 00:18:04,961
So, what did 
the sheriff's department say?

397
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:07,013
Nothing that inspires confidence.

398
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:09,042
The deputy started laughing

399
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:12,314
when he heard that the missing
person was at a bachelorette party.

400
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:16,762
He said they wouldn't start looking
until after 48 hours had passed.

401
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,343
Good news.

402
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:26,287
What?

403
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:40,148
Working hard?

404
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:41,462
Working always.

405
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:43,143
What can I do for you?

406
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,305
You've done some detailing
work for Terrence Cook?

407
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:46,622
You a cop?

408
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:50,240
I'm a private investigator working
on mr. Cook's behalf.

409
00:18:50,241 --> 00:18:53,111
I saw you pull up while 
the hangar was being searched.

410
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:54,541
It's time for his monthly.

411
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:55,896
His what?

412
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:58,890
I have a standing contract
with Terrence.

413
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:01,496
That man loves his cars.

414
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,823
I detail every one of them
once a month.

415
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,429
You know,
he used to have over 40, but, uh,

416
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:09,368
I guess things got tough.

417
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:10,977
He's down to eight.

418
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:14,163
Explosives were found in 
the tall cabinet near the Maserati.

419
00:19:14,164 --> 00:19:15,439
You know the one I'm talking about?

420
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,642
Yeah, sure, that's where
he keeps the babies' blankets.

421
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:18,791
The what?

422
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,982
It's what he calls 
the Calfskin chamois...

423
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:22,086
they're all he'll let me use.

424
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:24,532
If there had been explosives
in that cabinet a month ago...

425
00:19:24,587 --> 00:19:25,585
I would've seen 'em.

426
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:27,859
If you had detailed
his cars yesterday...

427
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,519
Terrence knows you're out there
once a month?

428
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,627
Oh Yeah. Yeah, he knows.

429
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:34,927
I'm a half-hour late,
I get a call.

430
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:42,552
I had the printers forego
the phallic framing.

431
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:45,507
Penises can sometimes be distracting.

432
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:47,190
I don't know how helpful I'm gonna be.

433
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:48,818
I didn't really get 
a good look at the guy.

434
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,130
It was dark and loud and there were
condom balloons hitting my head.

435
00:19:52,131 --> 00:19:54,141
Just take your time.

436
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:57,357
Okay, here's what we know.

437
00:19:57,433 --> 00:20:01,988
Heidi got two phone calls
back to back at 2:55 and 2:57 A.M.

438
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:03,749
They were short,
no messages on her machine,

439
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,452
so we can assume she took them.

440
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:08,532
The first ATM transaction was at 3:20.

441
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:11,163
That tells me whoever called 
had something to do with her leaving.

442
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:12,803
Can't you find out who made the calls?

443
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:15,155
Isn't that like a P.I.'S thing?
Tracing phone numbers.

444
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:18,094
Usually we can, but the number
is no longer in service.

445
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:21,681
And according to my father's
friend at the phone company,

446
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:23,512
it never was.

447
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:24,676
Very odd.

448
00:20:25,563 --> 00:20:27,005
Wait a minute.

449
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:28,802
I think that's him.

450
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:30,736
-Where?
-There.

451
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:32,634
Jane, that's a torso.

452
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:34,637
It's the shirt.
I remember his shirt.

453
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:35,926
Is that a bowling shirt?

454
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:42,498
So, to what do I owe the pleasure?

455
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:44,020
I'm here to tempt you, Aaron.

456
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:45,748
Well, mission accomplished.

457
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:50,660
Or should I say,
"with what?"

458
00:20:50,723 --> 00:20:52,177
Huge tracts of land.

459
00:20:52,178 --> 00:20:54,618
More action than I can handle.

460
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,693
I'm here to offer you a piece.

461
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:59,800
So, I guess big Dick still has
his fingers in a few pies, huh?

462
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,213
My husband's got quite a reach.

463
00:21:02,214 --> 00:21:05,874
Some are saying that
he might be working abroad.

464
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:11,640
Aaron, how would you like
to walk out of here a richer man?

465
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:14,690
You're cash-strapped.

466
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:18,571
No, I get it. I can help. But...

467
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,981
Quid pro quo, mrs. "C"...

468
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,699
Quid pro quo.

469
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:32,131
Impressive Hannibal.

470
00:21:32,796 --> 00:21:36,851
Well, they told me
the glass is bulletproof,

471
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:40,312
but I'm betting 
I could talk you through it.

472
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,100
Something else.

473
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:51,056
Oh.

474
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:54,519
I'm all ears.

475
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:56,306
You know my son, Logan?

476
00:21:56,694 --> 00:21:59,078
He hangs out with 
the Casablancas kid all the time.

477
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:00,742
We've met.

478
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:04,098
Maybe you can find a reason
to drop by his hotel room.

479
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:07,784
I guess, if I really tried.

What?

488
00:22:51,757 --> 00:22:52,754
Nothing.

489
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:54,231
You lie.

You know what 
the punishment is for lying.

00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:05,481
What?

00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:06,730

I guess.

Oh. Sorry. Uh...

are in the kitchen,

do you mind if I use
your computer for a second?

508
00:23:40,526 --> 00:23:42,854
I just want 
to check some fantasy scores.

You don't even know him.

00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:38,945
What kind of mother would prohibit
her daughter from dating a boy who's

523
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:41,174
awaiting trial for manslaughter?

524
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:42,682
Almost all parenting books

525
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,610
eschew the use of sarcasm
with adolescents, so, you know...

526
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:47,323
Fine, here it is,

527
00:24:47,515 --> 00:24:49,367
stripped of the sarcasm.

528
00:24:49,644 --> 00:24:50,974
He's a phony,

529
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:52,195
he's ugly on the inside,

530
00:24:52,196 --> 00:24:53,414
all he wants from you is sex,

531
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:55,411
and he's gonna break your heart.

532
00:24:55,688 --> 00:24:56,686
You're wrong.

533
00:24:56,687 --> 00:24:58,147
You don't know Logan.

534
00:24:58,148 --> 00:25:00,456
Everybody's already decided
that he's this bad guy,

535
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,784
but I know him.

536
00:25:02,785 --> 00:25:04,559
They don't and you don't.

537
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,942
God bless Tracy McGrady.

538
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:10,555
Life is good.

539
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:14,263
That looks heavy.

540
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:16,493
You should let me take it out for you.

541

542
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:35,405
<i>What may I ask</i>

543
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,127
<i>Is memory now</i>

544
00:25:37,232 --> 00:25:39,238
Excuse me.
Do you recognize this shirt?

545
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:43,207
-Right over there.
-Thanks.

546
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,568
The one-eyed ducks,

547
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:50,768
perennial champs, alley 5.

548
00:25:53,947 --> 00:25:55,555
That guy's too big.

549
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:57,688
That guy's too small.

550
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:02,375
That guy is...not a guy,
just in desperate need of a stylist.

551
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:07,033
But that guy looks just right.

552
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,760
Yes! Yes!

553
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:14,173
What did I tell you?!

554
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,320
What did I tell you?!

555
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:22,613
<i>Oh, my, what a wonderful day for...</i>

556
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:24,665
Here you go.

557
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,115
are you sure you don't want one?

558
00:26:26,406 --> 00:26:27,531
$1 draft night.

559
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:31,944
Come on, have a beer.
We'll let you roll a frame.

560
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,815
Vinny, this is not nam.

561
00:26:33,816 --> 00:26:36,143
This is bowling.
There are rules.

562
00:26:36,193 --> 00:26:36,985
What can you tell me...

563
00:26:37,037 --> 00:26:38,139
nothing.

564
00:26:38,194 --> 00:26:40,966
Of course,
your pavlovian response.

565
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,676
Her name was Heidi Kuhne.

566
00:26:43,563 --> 00:26:44,798
Doesn't ring a bell.

567
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,740
Let me jog your memory.

568
00:26:46,946 --> 00:26:49,482
You were thrown out of
the Happy Horseshoe the other night

569
00:26:49,515 --> 00:26:50,454
for stalking her.

570
00:26:50,612 --> 00:26:54,099
If I had a dime for every time I was
thrown out of h-squared for stalking...

571
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,167
what was it... 
a little prenup background check?

572
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:58,256
Well, you already know.

573
00:26:58,257 --> 00:26:59,254
She's missing.

574
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:00,919
Are you suggesting I kidnapped her?

575
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:03,968
Because I believe that's your racket.

576
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,907
Do you know where she is?

577
00:27:06,911 --> 00:27:07,960
Negatory.

578
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:10,629
Who hired you...
the groom, his family?

579
00:27:10,847 --> 00:27:12,774
You fill them in on
her party-girl past?

580
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:14,888
Ah, that, curious georgette,

581
00:27:14,992 --> 00:27:16,728
is P.I.-Client privilege.

582
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:18,300
Now, if you'll excuse me,

583
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:20,214
my ducks need me.

584
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,523
You heard what my mom said,
didn't you?

585
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:30,046
Yeah, I got the gist.

586
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:31,949
Just ignore her.

587
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,888
She's bitter about the divorce.

588
00:27:33,977 --> 00:27:35,472
She thinks all men are evil.

589
00:27:35,473 --> 00:27:36,898
Maybe she's right?

590
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:38,512
What... about men?

591
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,894
About me.

592
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,199
Let's get out of here,

593
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,861
go to your place.

594
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:51,249
Well,

595
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,683
I know the words coming out of your
mouth are "go to your place", but...

596
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,508
all I hear is "let's have sex."

597
00:27:59,506 --> 00:28:00,981
So?

598
00:28:03,776 --> 00:28:05,439
Logan?

599
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:08,084
That sounds good.

600
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,856
Lamb, I've been trying
to get ahold of you.

601
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,466
And I've been ducking your calls.

602
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:29,060
Man, that feels good
to get off my chest.

603
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:32,613
Hey, you think I like
bringing any of this to you?

604
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:33,805
Just hear me out.

605
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,320
Terrence has a guy who details
his fleet of cars every month.

606
00:28:38,321 --> 00:28:40,190
He keeps his chamois 
in the same cabinet

607
00:28:40,244 --> 00:28:41,600
where the explosives were found.

608
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:44,701
Now, why would he keep
that damning evidence at all?

609
00:28:44,702 --> 00:28:46,471
That's the first question,

610
00:28:46,534 --> 00:28:47,358
and the second question...

611
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:49,645
why would he keep them where
they were sure to be found?

612
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,093
Valid questions.

613
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:53,269
I'll be sure and ask him 
when he gets out of surgery.

614
00:28:53,824 --> 00:28:55,036
Surgery? What happened?

615
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,612
-He got shot.
-Who shot him?

616
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:02,085
You know the journalism teacher
who died on the bus, miss Dumass?

617
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:03,082
Her father.

618
00:29:03,084 --> 00:29:06,091
He caught Terrence Cook breaking into
the family home in San Francisco.

619
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:09,294
Strange behavior for an innocent man,
don't you think?

620
00:29:13,286 --> 00:29:14,874
If you read this morning's paper,

621
00:29:14,943 --> 00:29:17,464
then you probably already know
that tracking polls indicate

622
00:29:17,562 --> 00:29:21,617
there's 57% support
for Neptune's incorporation.

623
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:23,821
Question...
what's that gonna do to us here?

624
00:29:23,822 --> 00:29:26,022
Uh, an actual police department.

625
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:27,592
Private beaches.

626
00:29:27,627 --> 00:29:29,143
The rich get richer.

627
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:30,475
All right,
let's stop there.

628
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:33,414
All those are true,

629
00:29:33,635 --> 00:29:37,182
but let's not just focus
on the potential upside.

630
00:29:37,183 --> 00:29:38,471
Sure, we could speculate,

631
00:29:38,472 --> 00:29:42,655
but why do so when we already have
a model we can study?

632
00:29:50,325 --> 00:29:51,823
Aw.

633
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,475
Palo Alto, California,

634
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:56,636
in the heart of silicon valley...

635
00:29:57,412 --> 00:29:59,451
home to Stanford university,

636
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:02,056
Hewlett-Packard,

637
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:06,783
and the epicenter of 
the late-'90s technology boom.

638
00:30:07,393 --> 00:30:10,441
But before the whole
dot-com craze began,

639
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:14,677
Palo Alto was a diverse community
not unlike our Neptune.

640
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:15,784
When they incorporated,

641
00:30:15,785 --> 00:30:19,092
they effectively put up 
a wall between the economic classes.

642
00:30:19,093 --> 00:30:22,277
What resulted after a very short time

643
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,523
was an ultrarich center surrounded by

644
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:27,852
the crime capital of america.

645
00:30:27,853 --> 00:30:30,193
Those who were smart dumped
their unincorporated property

646
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:31,838
to suckers before the bottom fell out.

647
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:36,068
Property values in the city skyrocketed

648
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:39,608
while land outside 
the incorporation became worthless.

649
00:30:40,994 --> 00:30:43,952
Now, let's take a look at your progress
in the stock-market game.

650
00:30:44,986 --> 00:30:46,151
As you can see,

651
00:30:46,152 --> 00:30:49,145
the younger mr. Casablancas
has extended his lead.

652
00:30:49,644 --> 00:30:50,667
This, ladies and gentlemen,

653
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:52,827
is a young man
with true business acumen.

654
00:30:58,496 --> 00:30:59,213
Hey, dad.

655
00:30:59,352 --> 00:31:01,879
Your missing person
is a little less missing.

656
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:04,651
She used her cellphone
twice this morning,

657
00:31:04,652 --> 00:31:06,425
both one-minute calls.

658
00:31:06,426 --> 00:31:07,534
Who'd she call?

659
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,476
Paul Mann.

660
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:12,081
Know who that is?

661
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:14,410
Yeah, her fiancé.

662
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:16,461
What if Heidi's still in town?

663
00:31:16,462 --> 00:31:18,805
What if she's just
hiding from her family?

664
00:31:18,806 --> 00:31:22,172
Maybe she'll pick up her phone if
she doesn't recognize the caller I.D.

665
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:23,429
Cold feet, honey.

666
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,388
It's always cold feet.

667
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,971
Hey, does Heidi have a fax?

668
00:31:39,972 --> 00:31:42,244
Yeah, somewhere.

669
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:50,284
Here it is.

670
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:53,351
-Why?
-When I called the apartment,

671
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:54,656
the fax picked up,

672
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:56,715
which means it's on the same line.

673
00:31:56,716 --> 00:31:59,552
Well, it's been switched 
to fax since she's been gone.

674
00:31:59,553 --> 00:32:01,008
Does that matter?

675
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:03,160
Remember the two calls she got?

676
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:05,667
What if someone was trying to fax her?

677
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:08,826
She would've heard
the fax tone on the first call

678
00:32:08,945 --> 00:32:12,597
and then switched over the machine so
that the second time it went through.

679
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:15,869
Now, if this fax machine
has storage capability...

680
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,253
who'd be faxing her
at 3:00 in the morning?

681
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,861
That's what I'd like to know.

682
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:27,790
It's some flyer from
a band called XLR8.

683
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:29,731
Accelerate.

684
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,722
That's Nick's band...

685
00:32:31,723 --> 00:32:32,766
Heidi's old boyfriend.

686
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,973
The one whose name she had
de-inked from her buttocks?

687
00:32:41,232 --> 00:32:43,114
Apparently Nick needs to see Heidi.

688
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:47,519
<i>[The Lashes - "Sometimes the Sun"]
<song available online, see appendixes></i>

689
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,717
According to Jane,

690
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:51,479
it's been three years since Nick
and Heidi were hot and heavy.

691
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,575
You can laser a guy's
name off your ass,

692
00:32:53,576 --> 00:32:56,586
but I wonder whether you can 
really ever cut him out of your heart.

693
00:32:56,672 --> 00:32:58,581
<i>It's been so long</i>

694
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:00,318

<i>Counting down the days till you're home</i>

697
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,373
I guess if I do find my runaway bride,

698
00:33:08,423 --> 00:33:10,849
we'll have the next 12 hours
to discuss the matter

699
00:33:10,902 --> 00:33:13,605
while waiting for the next train home
from San Luis Obispo.

700
00:33:13,657 --> 00:33:14,968
Yeah?

701
00:33:15,447 --> 00:33:17,015
You got a Heidi Kuhne in there?

702
00:33:22,786 --> 00:33:24,671
I know you.

703
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:28,109
What the hell is going on, Heidi?

704
00:33:35,016 --> 00:33:38,131
My family hired you to track me down?

705
00:33:38,132 --> 00:33:39,738
Actually, Jane did.

706
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:40,917
You're 12.

707
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,009
I'm 18.

708
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,523
You're a barista.

709
00:33:44,244 --> 00:33:45,448
I'm a...

710
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:48,514
fine, I'm a barista.

711
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:52,340
Look, you know you're supposed to
be getting married in 12 hours, right?

712
00:33:52,341 --> 00:33:54,993
Your sister has been 
really worried about you.

713
00:33:54,994 --> 00:33:57,607
She thought you had some
bad pre-wedding jitters,

714
00:33:57,608 --> 00:34:00,157
and then we found your car abandoned.

715
00:34:00,158 --> 00:34:03,817
As in parked like 30 feet 
from the bus station?

716
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:10,115
It was dark and it was after
we went to your apartment

717
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:11,989
and saw two glasses of wine.

718
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:13,030
One was broken.

719
00:34:13,031 --> 00:34:15,724
Which is why I poured the second glass.

720
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:18,497
Maybe you should stick
to making coffee.

721
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:21,413
None of this matters anyway
because the wedding is off.

722
00:34:21,414 --> 00:34:22,123
It is?

723
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,244
You might want to let someone know.

724
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:26,925
Paul can announce it. He's the one
who ran back to his old flame.

725
00:34:27,313 --> 00:34:29,694
And you parked your car
and took a bus to yours.

726
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:34,080
I came to see Nick because his mom
is in bad shape and he needed me.

727
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:35,906
I called Paul to tell him where I was,

728
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,347
but he didn't return my calls.

729
00:34:37,348 --> 00:34:39,969
Then I get these text messages
from my friend Kim

730
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:43,286
telling me she saw him leaving
his ex's place at dawn.

731
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:46,815
And Paul's supposed to be totally cool
with you going on the road with Nick?

732
00:34:46,906 --> 00:34:47,995
Yeah.

733
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:50,815
He sent me the fax.

734
00:34:50,884 --> 00:34:53,318
I just came up here to be a friend.

735
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,849
Nick,

736
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:58,823
how did you manage to send a fax
from an unlisted phone number

737
00:34:58,824 --> 00:35:02,153
when the phone company says
the number never existed?

738
00:35:02,203 --> 00:35:05,849
Yeah,
I didn't send that fax.

739
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:08,870
-You said...
-You said you got my fax.

740
00:35:09,927 --> 00:35:11,391
I just didn't correct you.

741
00:35:11,392 --> 00:35:12,539
It was handwritten.

742
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:14,678
I was just so stoked to see you.

743
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:19,733
Nick didn't send the fax,

744
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:22,030
and Kim didn't text-message you.

745
00:35:23,131 --> 00:35:26,617
She lost her phone the night 
of the bachelorette party.

746
00:35:26,618 --> 00:35:27,729
Well, then, who?

747
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,442
A private detective
named Vinny Vanlowe.

748
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:31,809
But why?

749
00:35:57,848 --> 00:36:01,435
I, uh, I have another wedding at 4:00.

750
00:36:01,436 --> 00:36:03,426
If no one's seen your bride...

751
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,706
Don't worry.

752
00:36:04,707 --> 00:36:06,257
She's just a free spirit,

753
00:36:06,928 --> 00:36:08,351
marching to her own drum.

754
00:36:08,352 --> 00:36:10,726
Coming! Coming!

755
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:13,804
Sorry I'm late.

756
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,717
Let's get married.

757
00:36:21,032 --> 00:36:22,141
Where've you been?

758
00:36:22,142 --> 00:36:25,007
Oh, we have 
a whole lifetime for stories.

759
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:26,740
Let's do this thing.

760
00:36:26,741 --> 00:36:28,129
Lay it on me, preacher man.

761
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,447
I demand to know 
what you've been up to.

762
00:36:30,448 --> 00:36:33,318
I didn't ask you what you were doing
for your bachelor party.

763
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:35,691
And after finding whipped
cream in your underwear,

764
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:36,919
I think I was entitled.

765
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,941
You were entitled... you?

766
00:36:38,942 --> 00:36:42,711
The one who sexed up every wannabe
rock star in southern California?

767
00:36:42,712 --> 00:36:44,264
You know, if I wanted
to marry Tawny Kitaen,

768
00:36:44,265 --> 00:36:45,488
I would've got a nipple pierced.

769
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,647
How could you say that to me?

770
00:36:48,148 --> 00:36:51,195
Like I would ever sex up a drummer.

771
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:56,463
Lead singers? Yes.
Maybe the occasional guitar player.

772
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,985
The important thing
is that we love each other.

773
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:02,180
How can you expect me to love
a used-up groupie like you?

774
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:05,856
Wow. Ouch, honey.
Kind of harsh.

775
00:37:07,164 --> 00:37:08,212
Are you breaking it off?

776
00:37:08,263 --> 00:37:10,048
-You're damn right I...
-No!

777
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:13,236
Fair enough.

778
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:20,634
So, I guess I'll be keeping
this precious family heirloom...

779
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:26,822
'cause those are the rules
in polite society, aren't they?

780
00:37:27,543 --> 00:37:30,093
I mean, if I backed out
or didn't show up,

781
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:32,034
I'd have to give you
the ring back, right?

782
00:37:33,537 --> 00:37:34,855
You know the funny thing?

783
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:37,480
You could've just said it's over,

784
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:39,575
and I would've given you the ring back.

785
00:37:41,322 --> 00:37:44,233
This will be payment 
for the two years I wasted

786
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:46,945
trying to convince you I was worthy.

787
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,162
Enjoy the reception!

788
00:37:52,163 --> 00:37:55,058
By the looks of it,
I'd guess the elder mr. Mann

789
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,779
commissioned the background check,

790
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,567
but it was his son that couldn't
live with the information.

791
00:37:59,626 --> 00:38:00,434
Come on, Jane.

792
00:38:03,977 --> 00:38:06,467
Are pawn shops open on saturdays?

793
00:38:13,343 --> 00:38:18,498
And that is why the Phoenix Land Trust
is where you should put your money.

794
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:23,392
I'm confused. You're talking
and your clothes are on.

795
00:38:23,393 --> 00:38:26,315
I'm starting to think you really
came over here to sell me real estate.

796
00:38:26,316 --> 00:38:28,494
I told you it's my job.

797
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:31,610
And that must be the second sign
of the apocalypse.

798
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,928
Well, I tried.

799
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:35,346
Do you mind if I freshen up
before I go?

800
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:37,144
Freshen up for what?

801
00:38:40,471 --> 00:38:42,100
All right, Logan, you win.

802
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:44,906
I'm serious.
This stops now.

803
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:47,623
Sure. Come on in.

804
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:16,290
I see you have company.

805
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:19,339
I'll let myself out,
but...

806
00:39:20,216 --> 00:39:22,167
think about my offer.

807
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:34,348
Mark my words.

808
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:36,946
Someday that smirk is gonna get
wiped off your face.

809
00:39:36,947 --> 00:39:37,963
Oh, please.

810
00:39:37,964 --> 00:39:41,486
Let the lying, cokehead plastic surgeon
lecture me on karma.

811
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:42,863
Certainly caught up with me.

812
00:39:43,822 --> 00:39:45,037
It ends now.

813
00:39:45,038 --> 00:39:46,823
I'll make my testimony go away.

814
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:48,072
What about the Fitzpatricks?

815
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:50,016
Let me worry about them.

816
00:39:50,017 --> 00:39:52,234
You just stay the hell
away from my daughter.

817
00:39:53,566 --> 00:39:55,339
I assume we have a deal?

818
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:12,251
I don't believe this.

819
00:40:12,472 --> 00:40:13,969
If it isn't the puppet master.

820
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:16,860
Hey, what a man does
in the privacy of his own home,

821
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:20,789
office, and/or car is his business.

822
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,888
You know,
you cost me a five grand bonus.

823
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:26,147
You were gonna buy a new jacket?

824
00:40:26,205 --> 00:40:28,497
And give up the cheap women?
Not likely.

825
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:30,327
Give it.

826
00:40:30,753 --> 00:40:31,482
What?

827
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:33,048
Kim's cellphone.

828
00:40:33,049 --> 00:40:35,623
I called you,
left a threatening message.

829
00:40:40,098 --> 00:40:41,650
You didn't get it from me.

830
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:46,716
Exactly how many times have
you had to say that in your life?

831
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:50,552
You know what's really
disturbing about you...

832
00:40:51,935 --> 00:40:53,429
...other than everything?

833
00:40:54,427 --> 00:40:56,840
You're a halfway decent
private investigator.

834
00:40:56,841 --> 00:40:58,747
Stop.
You're embarrassing me.

835
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,436
You can embarrass the shameless?

836
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:07,143
This is for your sister's friend Kim.

837
00:41:07,144 --> 00:41:08,511
Thank you, Veronica.

838
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,727
Check it out.

839
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,210
Heidi he aded up to the L.A.
Jewelry exchange,

840
00:41:14,314 --> 00:41:15,180
hocked the ring,

841
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:17,660
and kept right on going
to Nick's next show.

842
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:19,545
So, how does it feel to play cupid?

843
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:22,095
Uncomfortable.

844
00:41:22,539 --> 00:41:24,202
This better last.

845
00:41:24,203 --> 00:41:26,007
Guess you never know where
true love is gonna find you.

846
00:41:26,055 --> 00:41:27,768
If it comes looking for me,

847
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:29,687
I'll be over by the espresso machine.

848
00:41:31,065 --> 00:41:31,965
Hey.

849
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:35,971
Um, I know you're busy,
but, uh...

850
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,709
I think I've done something horrible.

851
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:45,330
