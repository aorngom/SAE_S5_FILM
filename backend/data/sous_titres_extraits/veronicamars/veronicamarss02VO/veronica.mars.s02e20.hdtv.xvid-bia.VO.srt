1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,084
Previously on "Veronica Mars"...

2
00:00:02,241 --> 00:00:03,304
I can't date you anymore.

3
00:00:03,716 --> 00:00:04,412
Huh.

4
00:00:04,612 --> 00:00:08,337
Balboa county sheriff don Lamb 
questions baseball legend Terrence Cook

5
00:00:08,428 --> 00:00:10,712
in connection with 
the Neptune high bus crash.

6
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:11,681
You'll take my case?

7
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:14,280
Terrence broke into
his ex-girlfriend's family home...

8
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,464
the journalism teacher
who died in the bus crash.

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,120
There's something you gentlemen
should probably see.

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,539
-That's inside my house.
-I'll look into this, as well.

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,382
I'm not speaking to you.

12
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,433
Butters asked if he should
rent a room for prom night.

13
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:29,447
Move, or you're a hood ornament.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,526
I've got what?

15
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,810
-Chlamydia... it's a, uh, sexually...
-I know what it is.

16
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,252
There must be a mistake.

17
00:00:38,303 --> 00:00:40,838
I don't have any symptoms.

18
00:00:40,897 --> 00:00:41,682
I don't feel anything.

19
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:42,697
Which is not uncommon.

20
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:46,086
Have you been sexually active at all
within the last year or two?

21
00:00:47,294 --> 00:00:51,646
We were, you know, safe,
and the guy...

22
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,562
there's no way he...

23
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:56,143
you think that,
but you never know.

24
00:00:56,788 --> 00:00:58,346
Antibiotics will take care of it.

25
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:00,611
So, my grandma Reynolds
was always saying,

26
00:01:00,707 --> 00:01:02,707
"when life gives you lemons,
make lemonade."

27
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:04,257
I wish she was still alive,

28
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:06,849
because I'd really like 
to ask what she suggests

29
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:08,636
for when life gives you
chlamydia.

30
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:10,501
Please, get a room...

31
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:11,895
in Australia.

32
00:01:12,146 --> 00:01:13,567
Hey, we're practicing for the prom.

33
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,015
What debutante bit you and 
turned you into a prom zombie?

34
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:21,740
We just gave in...
The Whole Nine Yards...

35
00:01:21,853 --> 00:01:22,956
the ridiculous dress,

36
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:25,693
the tux, lobster dinner, limo.

37
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:28,207
I mean, it happens once.
Why not go all out?

38
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:31,169
'Cause no one sold you as
an indentured servant to Butters.

39
00:01:31,473 --> 00:01:33,144
Mac, I didn't think he'd actually...

40
00:01:33,198 --> 00:01:34,910
he's picking me up
in a hummer limousine,

41
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:37,003
we're having dinner
on a replica pirate ship,

42
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:39,354
and I suspect he's hired
a zeppelin for the ride home.

43
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:41,158
I'm gonna fill my pockets with rocks,

44
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:42,325
get a good grip on your ankle,

45
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:43,329
and I'm gonna jump off the top of...

46
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,530
<i>Attention, students.</i>

47
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:48,170
<i>Due to a significant number of
alcohol violations on the senior trip,</i>

48
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:50,471
<i>this year's prom has been canceled.</i>

49
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,812
<i>That is all.</i>

50
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:56,226
Yes! Prayer works!

51
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:57,991
Hello?

52
00:01:58,382 --> 00:02:00,523
Woody,
to what do I owe...

53
00:02:02,474 --> 00:02:03,592
What... right now?

54
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,419
What room number?

55
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:18,939
I swear it's not what it looks like.

56
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:26,966
Okay, it is what it looks like.

57
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:27,834
And that is?

58
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,779
Do... do I have to spell it out?

59
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,063
She's with the incorporation campaign.

60
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:33,712
We had a few cocktails.

61
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:37,272
She must have mixed with pills
or something, because she just...

62
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:44,957
This is not a proud moment for me.

63
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:47,093
I need help to take care of this.

64
00:02:47,395 --> 00:02:50,167
I'm on retainer to help Terrence Cook,
not take care of things.

65
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:51,970
"Mayor brings mistress to E.R.

66
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,236
Booze, pills, underwear.
Film at 11:00."

67
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:56,792
Please, Keith.

68
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:00,710
I'll get her to the hospital,

69
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,451
and I'll be discreet.

70
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,149
Okay.

71
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,889
But don't get the wrong idea.
This is not the sort of thing I do.

72
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:08,906
Okay. Thank you.

73
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:28,491
I owe you big-time,
Keith.

74
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:36,445
Hey.

75
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:38,967
Have you ever been stalked?

76
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:40,649
As a matter of fact...

77
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,293
because someone's stalking me.

78
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:44,559
I was hoping you might have
some tips or something.

79
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:48,841
Dancing around in your underwear
with the curtains open is always good,

80
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:52,184
and if you're in chat rooms
and they suggest meeting face-to-face,

81
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:55,924
do it in an abandoned railroad car
down by the riverside.

82
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:58,603
No, no, no.
I mean for catching the guy.

83
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:00,955
I keep seeing this car
following me around.

84
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:04,204
Can you describe it?

85
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:06,319
It's totally nondescript.

86
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:08,417
I mean,
that's what's so unique about it.

87
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,596
Um, okay.

88
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,546
Any reason anyone would want
to follow you around?

89
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,016
Well, last week at karaoke,

90
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,360
I did "can't get you out of my head",

91
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,733
and I dedicated it to
this table of cute guys,

92
00:04:19,797 --> 00:04:21,889
but then I realized they weren't cute.

93
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:25,347
They were dweeby pan high guys,
and not the nice nerd kind,

94
00:04:25,402 --> 00:04:26,750
but the weird, creepy...

95
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,864
potential stalker kind?

96
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:34,419
Is there any way that
you could do some P.I. thing?

97
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,266
For you?

98
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,670
The daughter of
the most powerful man in town?

99
00:04:38,994 --> 00:04:40,238
That's a marker I want.

100
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,008
Come to my house after school.

101
00:04:57,535 --> 00:04:58,613
Something I can help you with?

102
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:00,809
You  should really
keep your office locked.

103
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:06,635
I want my hard drive back.

104
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:08,766
Come on.

105
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,654
My friend saw you take it
from my apartment.

106
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:13,654
Your friend Liam, the drug dealer
who tried to shoot me.

107
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,401
There was an intruder in my house.

108
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:19,012
-He  feared for his life.
-Out of curiosity,

109
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:21,570
did your husband know
that you kept your own place?

110
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:25,729
Did he know about your jail time
or that you're not even really you?

111
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:29,847
If the hard drive reappears by friday,
I won't press charges.

112
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,747
I filled out the form.

113
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:35,436
Me sending it to me...
no paper trail.

114
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:40,309
Mrs. C,
I trust you're well.

115
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:42,509
Oh, well, if it isn't little
miss teen getaway.

116
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,030
Your dad and I were just 
dealing with a little trouble.

117
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:49,324
Like, trouble with a capital "T", that
rhymes with "C", that stands for...

118
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,060
-Veronica!
-I was gonna say "cute."

119
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,712
Ms. Casablancas was just leaving.

120
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,418
So, what did the doctor say?

121
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:00,925
Well, you got your money's worth.

122
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:01,926
What does that mean?

123
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:03,533
It means...

124
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:06,561
the stethoscope was freezing.

125
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:08,886
But I'm fine. Tip-top.

126
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:10,559
Can I borrow the remote
cameras tonight?

127
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:11,807
What for?

128
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,208
For a school project?

129
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:17,139
I don't believe you.

130
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:20,073
Okay, this girl I know suspects that 

131
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,474
one of several creepy weirdos
she sang a kylie minogue song to

132
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:25,805
at karaoke night
might be following her around.

133
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:27,598
We're trying to narrow down
which one it is.

134
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:29,539
I like your first answer better.

135
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,099
You can earn it.

136
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:35,462
send a copy to everyone
on our business contact sheet,

137
00:06:35,923 --> 00:06:37,525
see if anyone can find him.

138
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:39,304
Hey who is this charming fellow?

139
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:42,758
The charming fellow who hired
the escort to steal Cliff's briefcase.

140
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,583
-And his heart. Poor cliff.
-Yeah.

141
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:47,279
She must have been something,

142
00:06:47,517 --> 00:06:49,189
'cause he won't shut up about it.

143
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:52,602
Cameras are on the roof,
so if this guy followed you here,

144
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,862
we should be able to spot him.

145
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,183
Wow!
How "Mission Impossible".

146
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:57,537
I feel like, at any moment,

147
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,020
Tom Cruise is gonna dangle
from the ceiling on cables.

148
00:07:00,623 --> 00:07:03,549
Great.
Now I won't be able to sleep.

149
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:05,581
I hope he doesn't try to marry me.

150
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,012
There.
That's the car.

151
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:12,265
Isn't it totally nondescript?

152
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,113
That's a 2002 silver galant.

153
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:20,075
We should order him pizza.
He would totally freak.

154
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:21,840
Why stop at pizza, Gia?

155
00:07:22,204 --> 00:07:25,011
Bet you a hot-oil rubdown
would really show him.

156
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:33,410
And you can just look him up
right there on your computer?

157
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,712
That's awesome.

158
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:36,708
Actually, I'm updating
my netflix queue.

159
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:41,111
No, wait.
I think we got him.

160
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:42,918
Leonardo d'Amato?

161
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:45,751
God, what kind of a loser is that?

162
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:47,738

163
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,432

00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:31,165
You have that "I'd-rather-be-making-
out-with-a-broken-bottle" look,

178
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:34,352
which, if history serves, means 
you're about to say something awkward.

179
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,706
This? This is my 
"I'd-rather-be-spelunking" look.

180
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,077
It's like you don't know me at all.

181
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:41,082
All right.
So, let's have it.

182
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:42,627
So...

183
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:44,625
you remember Duncan.

184
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:46,652
-Right, blue eyes.
-Right.

185
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,531
Yes.

186
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:49,795
You wouldn't happen to know
if he was with...

187
00:08:50,785 --> 00:08:52,418
and by "with," I mean "with"...

188
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:54,690
uh, someone other than Meg?

189
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:56,291
Well, there was this one girl.

190
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,832
She was, uh, blonde, petite.

191
00:09:00,362 --> 00:09:01,890
Smelled of marshmallows
and Promises.

192
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:05,247
Promises?
That's the name of my perfume.

193
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:08,287
You know,
generally speaking,

194
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,430
I've kind of grown immune
to your left-field questions,

195
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:12,603
but I'm gonna bite on this one.

196
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:16,073
What do you care who Duncan did
when Duncan did do dudettes?

197
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:20,842
Would  you believe it's
for a college application?

198
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,138
Weird, huh?

199
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,079
You and Meg...
that's all I know about.

200
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:30,278
Duncan didn't talk about
his sex life much, though.

201
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:35,763
But he'd blush and shower a lot. That's
how you'd know he was getting some.

202
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:38,025
Well, I'm gonna miss these moments.

203
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:39,530
You  going somewhere?

204
00:09:39,582 --> 00:09:40,890
Oh, you see this?

205
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:42,824
Uh, this is high school.

206
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,124
We're here for four years,
and then we move on,

207
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,460
and all these people you see every day
vanish from your life,

208
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:50,365
and you never
have to think about them again.

209
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:53,267
So we should savor
our remaining moments.

210
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,170
You should come to alterna-prom.

211
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:56,972
I don't know what that is.

212
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,280
Wow.

213
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:04,029
You and your drunk 09er buddies
get the prom canceled 

214
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,762
and then use your inherited wealth
to throw a private prom.

215
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,526
When you say it like that,
it sounds unjust.

216
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:10,025
How does it sound when you say it?

217
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:11,200
Glamorous.

218
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,401
So, are you coming?

219
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:19,643
What?
You'd rather be spelunking?

220
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,904
No, I'd rather be...

221
00:10:23,546 --> 00:10:25,429
...strapped down on an anthill.

222
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,539
Man, you've really lost it.

223
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:30,560
I was going to console
Jackie and Wallace that night.

224
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,278
You got their prom canceled,
remember?

225
00:10:34,494 --> 00:10:35,543
Well, bring them along.

226
00:10:36,724 --> 00:10:37,634
And bring whoever.

227
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:39,539
We, with our inherited wealth,
don't mind...

228
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:43,044
as long as you bathe
and keep your hands off the silver.

229
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:45,467
I'll consider it.

230
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:49,824
Where does any disgraced
former lawman go?

231
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:51,803
Private security, baby.

232
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:54,069
Ooh, it sounds exotic.

233
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:57,634
Nah, it's boring...
big firm, tons of B.S.

234
00:10:58,122 --> 00:10:59,315
Same old Leo.

235
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,199
I got to admit I was surprised
to hear from you, Veronica.

236
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:04,646
I figured after the eased-out-
of-the-department episode,

237
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:06,030
I kind of fell off your radar.

238
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,245
Are you kidding?
My radar is vast.

239
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:10,158
So, how's your love life?

240
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:12,960
Terrible.

241
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:14,580
How's yours?

242
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:16,147
Also terrible.

243
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:23,147
So, is that, maybe, why you've been
stalking miss Goodman here?

244
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:25,225
Hi. It's Gia.

245
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:27,053
Same old Veronica.

246
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:30,815
It's not stalking.
It's personal security.

247
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:32,714
Miss Goodman is a job.

248
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:33,921
I'm a job?

249
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,129
Your dad hired the firm.

250
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:37,165
A couple of us were assigned
to keep an eye on you.

251
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:40,388
Want to go say "hi" to Earl?
I'm sure he's parked outside.

252
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,996
Why does he want Gia watched?

253
00:11:42,237 --> 00:11:43,697
I just punch the clock.

254
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:45,420
My bosses don't share
that kind of stuff with me.

255
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:48,813
I assume there's been some sort
of threat, but I don't know.

256
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:52,971
Is that why you wanted to see me?

257
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:57,023
That was pretty much it, yeah.

258
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,298
Well, I'm a little disappointed.

259
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,028
It was good seeing you again, Veronica.

260
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:03,630
Miss Goodman.

261
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:07,804
You went out with him?

262
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,134
He's cute... in a tough,
mumbly kind of way.

263
00:12:12,794 --> 00:12:14,805
Why  would my dad hire security?

264
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:18,561
I wonder if it has anything to do
with that thing with your dad.

265
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:19,887
What thing?

266
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:24,470
I don't know why they're making
such a big deal of it.

267
00:12:24,514 --> 00:12:27,271
I mean, a girl drinks too much...
that's not your dad's fault.

268
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,701
He's just doing what he was hired to.

269
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,827
Just make sure those vans are
at the Senior Center at 9:00 sharp.

270
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:40,301
-Yeah. Thanks. I got to run. Bye.
-Woody?

271
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:42,149
You blame me for this?

272
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:44,356
-Keith, please, let me explain.
-"When reached for comment,

273
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,130
Goodman's office said "Mars had been
engaged to investigate leaks,

274
00:12:47,354 --> 00:12:50,412
"but mr. Goodman had interceded when
he learned the investigator

275
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:51,940
had plied the staffer with alcohol."

276
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:53,216
Look you're right. You're right.

277
00:12:53,268 --> 00:12:55,336
I help you,
and this is what I get?

278
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:03,341
How could I know
the manager had a camera?

279
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:05,173
I'm sorry I had to do this,

280
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:07,670
but there's just so much
riding on this incorporation vote.

281
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:10,812
I think you may be confused
about something, Woody.

282
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,493
I'm voting against incorporation.

283
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:21,960
So, I dropped by my dad's office
and asked him about the security thing.

284
00:13:22,012 --> 00:13:24,531
He said it was nothing,
just normal election precautions,

285
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:26,254
and he agreed
to pull the security detail

286
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:28,155
once I told him
that it was creeping me out.

287
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:30,856
Okay.
So, that's good, right?

288
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:32,834
But then I got home,
and I found this.

289
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:39,868
That's my brother.

290
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:41,824
I know.

291
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:43,674
I met him, remember?

292
00:13:48,472 --> 00:13:49,663
What do you think it is?

293
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:53,483
Something very creepy.

294
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:04,797
Is a lunch lady who does
body building human interest?

295
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,804
Human, maybe.
Interest, no.

296
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,172
I can't believe I'm expected
to meet newspaper deadline

297
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,107
when I have some creepy dude
stalking me.

298
00:14:19,136 --> 00:14:21,269
Do you know who that is...
the woman with the camera?

299
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,997
That's mrs. Harmon.
You don't think she has...

300
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:26,529
No, look where she's shooting.

301
00:14:27,537 --> 00:14:31,207
Whoever made this, she probably
got him on that video.

302
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:33,743
Do you think you can get that tape?

303
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:36,735
Look, off the record, Lloyd.

304
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:38,840
It's not that I never worked for Woody,

305
00:14:39,115 --> 00:14:40,818
but I never investigated any leaks

306
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:44,650
and I never used a bottle of scotch
to question a campaign staffer.

307
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,483
Then you might want to put that
out there on the record.

308
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:50,048
Woody's pushing
this whole thing on you, Keith.

309
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:53,784
We had him on a conference call...
all off the record, of course...

310
00:14:54,403 --> 00:14:58,891
and he more or less implied he caught
you taking advantage of this girl,

311
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,519
Jennifer Stansfield.

312
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:04,014
You don't believe me,
talk to the staffer, Stansfield.

313
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:06,106
You know,
funny thing about her.

314
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,392
After you dropped her off
at the hospital,

315
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:12,248
she took off before being treated
and now no one can track her down.

316
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:14,768
Batting cages.

317
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:16,354
There's one up north.

318
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,203
We could get some flowers,

319
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:20,110
play a little music,

320
00:15:20,368 --> 00:15:21,876
take out some chinese.

321
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:27,421
The prom is canceled and you want
to take me to a batting cage instead?

322
00:15:28,686 --> 00:15:29,492
Yeah.

323
00:15:30,298 --> 00:15:33,304
It's for that so-casual-
it's-super-romantic thing.

324
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:37,188
That's not a thing.
That's male wishful thinking.

325
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:40,569
But I want to wear my dress.
Think fancy.

326
00:15:42,537 --> 00:15:43,841
Can we do it anyway?

327
00:15:44,615 --> 00:15:45,852
Maybe this afternoon.

328
00:15:46,097 --> 00:15:47,842
No, I'm going to see my dad
in the hospital.

329
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,666
How's that going?

330
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:52,805
Strange, but great.

331
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:55,882
It's never been worse for him,
but between us...

332
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:57,392
best it's ever been.

333
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,815
For the first time ever,

334
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:01,106
it's like one of my parents
actually has time for me.

335
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:03,699
Okay, I have news.

336
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,194
The senior memories,
once thought lost forever,

337
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:09,477
can,  in fact,
be generated, after all,

338
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,686
albeit in a slightly degraded form.

339
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,207
The rich kids are throwing
a private replacement prom.

340
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,696
Damn, they just privatizing
everything these days.

341
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:22,373
Alterna-prom?
Hmm...formal attire.

342
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:23,785
That's what I'm talking about.

343
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,582
Please don't give us
the tux speech again.

344
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:26,407
What?

345
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,825
You mean... how
when I put on a tux,

346
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:33,020
I make James Bond look like Cletus,
the slack-jaw yokel.

347
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:33,963
Shh!

348
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:40,768
Oh, please tell me Butters
knows nothing about this.

349
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:42,147
Hey, what's up?

350
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:45,645
Eehh... did you say, uh,
alterna-something?

351
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,239
Not exactly who I was expecting to see.

352
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:59,787
They're finally allowing
non-family visitors.

353
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,514
Thought I'd drop by,

354
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:04,969
find out what the hell you were doing
breaking into the Dumas family home.

355
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:08,139
She said she was writing 
a story... a tell-all...

356
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:10,047
about the gambling,
the debt, about...

357
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:12,092
how I threw a playoff game.

358
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:15,100
And when the bus thing hit, I was
worried her parents would find it.

359
00:17:15,363 --> 00:17:18,779
So when you're accused of taking out
a busload of kids to off your lover,

360
00:17:18,853 --> 00:17:21,476
you decide your best move is
to break into her parents' house?

361
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:24,152
Well, their unlocked garage,
actually, but, yeah.

362
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,273
This whole bus thing...

363
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:29,023
I'm not their man.

364
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:33,402
But if that story about throwing
the playoff game ever got out,

365
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,559
I'm ruined.

366
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:36,580
Hey, there's my girl.

367
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:39,059
Good afternoon, mr. Mars.

368
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:40,772
It's that time of day again...

369
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,665
clubhouse gossip.

370
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:44,631
My favorite time of day.

371
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:46,837
Okay, I'll be in touch.

372
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,876
You keep him out of trouble.

373
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,155
I'll try.

374
00:17:50,813 --> 00:17:52,079
So, what have we got?

375
00:17:52,183 --> 00:17:55,432
Well, it seems that Mets manager
Willie Randolph is not happy.

376
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:01,672
So I told mrs. Harmon 
that my friend's boyfriend

377
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:03,513
might have been
at the game with another girl.

378
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:04,826
Clever.

379
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:05,883
Not bad.

380
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:09,215
You just might have a future
in this racket.

381
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,154
Look.

382
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,671
That's a Neptune letterman jacket.

383
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:33,676
He's gone.

384
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:39,423
But the letterman jacket's
got to be something, right?

385
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:47,638
There. Look. You see?
The red truck.

386
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:54,937
It's gone,
and so is he.

387
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:56,433
It must be his.

388
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:57,769
Snap.

389
00:18:58,842 --> 00:19:02,463
So now we just need to find a varsity
letterman who drives a red pickup,

390
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,381
and we've got our stalker.

391
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:25,337
I wanted to see what it was like
getting your news off the ground.

392
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,535
And the stories...

393
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:29,449
so tawdry.

394
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,724
There was one yesterday
about you getting a girl drunk.

395
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:34,108
I can't believe it.

396
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,660
What? You don't think a girl
would have a few drinks with me?

397
00:19:38,424 --> 00:19:39,666
I just read otherwise.

398
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:42,530
Enjoy your headlines.
Got to go vote.

399
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:05,032
So, special ballot measure number 51...

400
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:08,029
should Neptune consolidate
its wealth and exclusivity 

401
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,559
at the expense of the poor
and the unglamorous?

402
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:13,316
Answer... no.

403
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,234
Who are you taking to the alterna-prom?

404
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:18,112
Well, I considered a lot of chicks,

405
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,014
but finally,
I figured I'd just go stag.

406
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,566
I mean, it's not the prom.

407
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:22,824
It's the alterna-prom.

408
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:24,257
Why narrow my options?

409
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:26,389
You shot down, huh?

410
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,196
It's like a conspiracy.

411
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:29,709
Yeah, it's a good thing
we're graduating.

412
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,369
Sounds like you've hit that point
where every girl in school knows you.

413
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,350
Bring on the sorority girls.

414
00:20:34,582 --> 00:20:37,376
Dude! You need me to bring
anything to the big bash?

415
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:40,215
'Cause if it's one thing I know
how to do right, it's pot luck.

416
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:42,914
Uh...which big bash is that?

417
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:45,666
Alterna-prom.
I make these killer brownies.

418
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:48,114
The secret...
it's all in the Butter.

419
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:54,232
The student parking-permit list
doesn't show any red pickups,

420
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:55,692
but that doesn't mean much here,

421
00:20:55,746 --> 00:20:57,802
as it's not uncommon 
for certain students

422
00:20:57,853 --> 00:21:00,287
to trade up to new rides
whenever they get bored.

423
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:03,612
So either our mystery student
doesn't drive to school,

424
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:05,546
or I'm barking up the wrong tree.

425
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:09,199
So, the only red pickup
on the list belongs to a girl...

426
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:10,307
I don't care about that.

427
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,031
Oh, I thought we were...

428
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:15,006
What I do care about what
your stupid dad thinks he's doing.

429
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:16,588
Gia...

430
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:18,974
So, now he's saying that it was
my dad in that motel 

431
00:21:19,048 --> 00:21:21,789
and he was sleeping with a hooker
he paid in campaign money?

432
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:24,223
My dad didn't get that woman drunk.
That's all he said.

433
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:26,637
I just don't get you people.
I just don't.

434
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:32,349
<i>And there will be
no incorporated town of Neptune,</i>

435
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:36,497
<i>as the special ballot measure goes
down by a three-point margin.</i>

436
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:41,302
<i>Many point to the supervisor's
ongoing scandals as a deciding factor.</i>

437
00:21:41,654 --> 00:21:44,397
<i>No official comment yet
from the supervisor's office, but...</i>

438
00:21:44,444 --> 00:21:46,216
so Neptune has to keep us.

439
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:48,608
What's a yacht without barnacles?

440
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:52,981
So, I'm stuck on something
and hoped you could help me.

441
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,142
Absolutely.

442
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:56,285
Unless it's physics or chemistry...

443
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,391
or math or in english.

444
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,290
P.E....
I was good at P.E.

445
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:06,427
So, some guy's been stalking Gia.

446
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:08,978
I got a tape of him shooting
Gia's brother's soccer game.

447
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:10,628
Hey, what do you mean,
"him shooting"?

448
00:22:13,126 --> 00:22:15,705
She found a DVD
this guy sent to her house...

449
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:17,426
creepy footage of her.

450
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:19,169
When did she get this?

451
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:20,400
The other day.

452
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,943
Let me show you something.

453
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:25,442
He got this last month...

454
00:22:25,757 --> 00:22:29,316
hired me to look into it, figuring some
antiincorporation guy crossed the line.

455
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:32,894
That's the same thing he told Gia when
she asked about the security detail.

456
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:36,531
Until I figured out that this was shot
before incorporation was announced.

457
00:22:36,582 --> 00:22:37,944
All of a sudden,
I'm off the case,

458
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,191
and his gardener confessed
out of the blue.

459
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:43,912
So what does that mean?

460
00:22:44,187 --> 00:22:47,422
Woody's scared of something and 
he's lying about it and it's serious.

461
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:50,375
I want you to leave that tape with me
and stay away from this case.

462
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:53,297
This is more than just
some obsessed school kid,

463
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:55,004
and I don't want you
sticking your nose in.

464
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,720
And I mean that,
you understand?

465
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:04,095
Miss Mars, 
what do you think you're doing?

466
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:06,453
Just some clerical business.

467
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:10,149
This is study hall.
If you wanted clerical hall,

468
00:23:10,229 --> 00:23:11,846
you should have signed up
for clerical hall.

469
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:15,285
Mr. Echolls,
so glad you could join us...

470
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,903
late.

471
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:22,901
And that is what happens
when you never get laid.

472
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:26,290
Well, why don't you invite him
to your bitchin' party?

473
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:29,978
Hey, speaking of my bitchin' party,
a funny thing happened.

474
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:34,209
That stoner dude, Corny...
whom I don't recall inviting...

475
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:35,902
offered to bring dessert.

476
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:39,423
Exactly how many losers
are now coming to my party?

477
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:40,816
You said invite whoever.

478
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:42,988
It didn't occur to you
that I might not have meant it?

479
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:46,387
What is that?

480
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:48,156
Just some work stuff for my dad.

481
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,746
Why?

482
00:23:53,671 --> 00:23:54,453
Nothing.

483
00:23:55,215 --> 00:23:57,978
It just looks like the guy
my dad shared a cell with.

484
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:03,337
Now, that's a hell of a dress.

485
00:24:03,683 --> 00:24:05,909
Gucci knock-off...
still pretty slinky, though.

486
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:07,576
I thought you said
your prom was canceled.

487
00:24:08,134 --> 00:24:11,483
It was, but some kids
are having kind of a replacement prom.

488
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:13,313
So Wallace and I
are doing the whole thing...

489
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,666
The dinner and the limo.

490
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:16,554
Oh, he got his tux,
which, he's warning me,

491
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:20,841
is some kind of insanely 
masculine mesmerizer of women.

492
00:24:20,914 --> 00:24:22,495
You just better be careful, Jackie.

493
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:24,278
Relax, dad.

494
00:24:26,186 --> 00:24:28,982
I learned the birds and the bees
the hard way, remember?

495
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,280
I mean it sounds like you're really
falling for this Wallace guy.

496
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:36,774
He's a nice young man whom I like, yes.

497
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:41,303
Wait, are you trying to give me,
like, fatherly advice?

498
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:44,117
Trying.
How am I doing?

499
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,481
Not bad for a novice.

500
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,904
I like Wallace,

501
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,942
but I'm leaving for Paris. We both
know it, so there's no illusions...

502
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,346
which is actually nice.

503
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:56,900
Deadline night.

504
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:59,462
I've been lying in wait
to try to walk out with Gia

505
00:24:59,513 --> 00:25:00,706
to warn her about her dad,

506
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:02,903
but either she's writing
the greatest story

507
00:25:02,949 --> 00:25:04,993
about lunch-lady body building ever

508
00:25:05,189 --> 00:25:06,879
or she's determined to avoid me.

509
00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:12,812
Hey, Gia, I was heading out 
and thought maybe...

510
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:14,121
I'm really busy right now.

511
00:25:15,421 --> 00:25:18,166
So, since strangling her would be
counterproductive,

512
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,827
that only leaves giving up.

513
00:25:20,076 --> 00:25:21,834
-Good night, Veronica.
-Good night.

514
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,609
-Hey, Veronica.
-Hey, Lucky.

515
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:54,946
Dad, it's me.

516
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,053
I know you told me to stay away
from this stalker thing, and I did.

517
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,927
But it just popped up
right in front of me.

518
00:26:00,283 --> 00:26:02,279
The red truck...
it's the janitor's,

519
00:26:02,554 --> 00:26:04,390
and Gia's in the building with him.

520
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,055
Call me.

521
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:14,173
15 minutes, dad... that's all
the longer I can be expected to wait.

522
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:15,915
Have taser, will travel.

523
00:26:21,635 --> 00:26:23,737
That's... Kuwait.

524
00:26:24,545 --> 00:26:27,318
And that's Iraq.

525
00:26:28,232 --> 00:26:29,272
Wow.

526
00:26:30,707 --> 00:26:32,421
Was that freaky?

527
00:26:33,847 --> 00:26:35,376
Was it freaky?

528
00:26:37,517 --> 00:26:38,955
You want to see freaky?

529
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:45,437
It's a roadside bomb.

530
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:46,469
Boom!

531
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:48,224
That was freaky.

532
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:50,085
Ugh! You know?

533
00:26:50,446 --> 00:26:51,618
The insurgency...

534
00:26:52,107 --> 00:26:54,064
always leaving us presents.

535
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:58,003
But, hell, you know,

536
00:26:58,603 --> 00:26:59,791
the whole world...

537
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,307
is freaky.

538
00:27:04,695 --> 00:27:05,856
Right?

539
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,117
That is so wild.

540
00:27:09,513 --> 00:27:10,693
Yeah.

541
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:15,815
I should do, like, a human-interest
thing on you for the navigator.

542
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:21,190
You should.

543
00:27:21,695 --> 00:27:23,278
Hey, let me show you
something else.

544
00:27:28,953 --> 00:27:30,198
What do you want?

545
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,069
Hey.

546
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:39,434
Veronica Mars...
just in time.

547
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:41,418
Do you want to see something freaky?

548
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,283
-Um...
-Hold on.

549
00:27:51,095 --> 00:27:53,693
The guy with the red truck.
The varsity jacket.

550
00:27:55,937 --> 00:27:56,926
Check it out.

551
00:27:57,827 --> 00:28:01,047
I got this off an iraqi corpse.

552
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:04,794
This sucker will do
some serious damage.

553
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:06,094
Serrated blade.

554
00:28:06,373 --> 00:28:07,932
That's really cool,
but, actually...

555
00:28:08,926 --> 00:28:10,086
We got to go.

556
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:12,067
Right. I'm sorry.

557
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,998
Guess the human-interest story
will have to wait.

558
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,381
That's too bad,

559
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:22,293
'cause I got some
pretty crazy stuff I could tell you.

560
00:28:25,518 --> 00:28:26,683
I know your dad,
you know.

561
00:28:30,431 --> 00:28:31,773
What the hell, man?

562
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:33,554
The sheriff's on his way.
Don't move.

563
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,984
Get off me, man.

564
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:37,726
Why have you been stalking Gia?
The videos and the break-ins... why?

565
00:28:37,931 --> 00:28:41,166
Screw you, man. Just screw you.
He deserved it.

566
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:42,365
He deserved it!

567
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:43,888
Everyone, freeze.

568
00:28:45,254 --> 00:28:47,903
Keith, when you call the sheriff,
you don't have to come yourself.

569
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:48,957
Would you get up off the man?

570
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,712
You said you have evidence
to back up what you said?

571
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:54,279
And he basically confessed already.
We get him in a room for an hour...

572
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:55,949
We?
I appreciate the heads-up.

573
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:58,934
This is a law-enforcement matter now, 
mr. Mars. You can go.

574
00:29:00,236 --> 00:29:01,794
Go on ahead to your party, honey.

575
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,426
Might be a little late tonight.

576
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:18,137
Madison.

577
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:20,261
Flying solo?

578
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:22,902
Ditto.
Just me and the party pig.

579
00:29:23,193 --> 00:29:24,042
Hold it.

580
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,201
What's that smell?

581
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:34,017
-Mac, you really do...
-Don't distract me...

582
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,267
I'm plotting how to kill you
and make it look like an accident.

583
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:39,729
Oh, hold it. Sweet.

584
00:29:40,124 --> 00:29:42,816
Penthouse, please.
All right.

585
00:29:52,515 --> 00:29:55,522
God... longest elevator ride ever.

586
00:29:56,204 --> 00:29:57,883
Wait for the space elevator.

587
00:30:01,657 --> 00:30:02,899
They're designing it now...

588
00:30:02,944 --> 00:30:05,372
a huge elevator on a 100-mile
carbon-polymer cable

589
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,752
that goes all the way to space.

590
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,049
That'll be a long elevator ride.

591
00:30:11,611 --> 00:30:13,111
Still not as long as this one.

592
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,819
Thank god.

593
00:30:23,017 --> 00:30:24,955

Hey! Welcome.

598
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:41,438
So, tonight there's only 
one thing I ask of you.

599
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,732
Make senior memories.

600
00:30:43,782 --> 00:30:45,701
Uh, that's why I brought the party pig.

601
00:30:46,868 --> 00:30:48,213
Better watch yourself, Danielle.

602
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,410
Here comes me and my hog.
Soo-wee!

603
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,517
-Yo man.
-Okay, how'ya doin'?

604
00:30:57,518 --> 00:30:58,518
Fine

605
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:02,128
I need a drink.

606
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,197
Mac just had dinner on a pirate ship.

607
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:18,170
Back at the school, you were
saying Woody deserved it. Why?

608
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:19,680
Did he do something to you?

609
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,202
Someone you know?

610
00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:40,412
What are you looking at, nutjob?

611
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:42,262
Cut him some slack, Don.

612
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:45,447
I wasn't talking to him, Keith.

613
00:31:53,722 --> 00:31:55,223
I don't think he likes you.

614
00:31:55,941 --> 00:31:58,077
<i>[unidentified song]</i>

615
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:02,894
I'm not stupid, you know.

616
00:32:03,952 --> 00:32:06,995
I know it's weird to force someone
to go to prom with you.

617
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:08,159
I know.

618
00:32:09,158 --> 00:32:10,583
So why did you do it?

619
00:32:11,871 --> 00:32:14,868
Because I wanted to be true to myself.

620
00:32:15,591 --> 00:32:16,933
I am weird.

621
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:20,402
I thought maybe 
you'd understand because...

622
00:32:20,848 --> 00:32:22,405
you're a little weird, too.

623
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:24,814
That's a compliment.

624
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,669
Oh.

625
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:33,027
Well, then you're really, really weird.

630
00:32:45,903 --> 00:32:47,045
Senior year's almost over.

631
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,752
In a month, we might
never see each other again.

632
00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:52,239
Never.
Think about how long that is.

633
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,054
It's like forever, but worse.

634
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:55,767
I'm not gonna sleep with you.

635
00:32:56,325 --> 00:32:58,068
We could fool around in the bathroom.

636
00:32:58,528 --> 00:32:59,676
Old time's sake?

637
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:02,086
Never...
it's a long time, Madison.

638
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:03,294
Leave her alone, Dick.

639
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,642
You don't want to make her
have to call the law,

640
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:09,731
'cause I hear the law
really comes down hard.

641
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:10,593
Have you heard that?

642
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:13,684
So, I guess you're here alone
since Duncan, like,

643
00:33:13,735 --> 00:33:15,061
ran away or whatever.

644
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,393
You mean "took it on the lam"?

645
00:33:17,606 --> 00:33:20,067
'Cause I can't imagine
what that's like. Can you?

646
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:21,885
Being on the lam.

647
00:33:22,349 --> 00:33:24,967
I think you'd just want to close
your eyes and pray for it all to end.

648
00:33:25,026 --> 00:33:27,328
You'd have the cops
crawling all over you.

649
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:28,710
Right?

650
00:33:28,711 --> 00:33:30,012
What do you think, Madison?

651
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,550
There's Gia.

652
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:37,163
What does Madison
care about Gia, Ronnie?

653
00:33:38,537 --> 00:33:39,376
What do you think the odds are

654
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:41,127
of you and me hooking up 
by the end of the night?

655
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:45,650
I happen to have them right here.

656
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:49,020
They are a googolplex to one.

657
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:50,492
Right on.

658
00:33:50,746 --> 00:33:53,444
So I'll send over a bartender
and check back in with you later.

659
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:56,599
Hey, Shelly...
speaking of pork...

660
00:33:56,823 --> 00:33:58,071
want to meet my hog?

661
00:33:58,282 --> 00:33:59,135
Ow!

662
00:33:59,218 --> 00:34:01,317
You don't want to drink that.
Trust me.

663
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:05,207
Hey, thanks for rescuing me
back at school.

664
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:06,234
That was cool.

665
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,215
And I'm sorry about
what I said about your dad.

666
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:12,123

You can't just leave me here.

674
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:29,799

That's not me anymore.

00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:23,225
So, what are you like now?

695
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:24,692
You know... tortured.

696
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:27,743
Ever since I had my heart broken.

697
00:35:29,645 --> 00:35:31,760
Hannah really did do
a number on you, huh?

698
00:35:31,977 --> 00:35:33,840
Come on, you know I'm not talking
about Hannah.

699
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:38,314
<i>I’m seeking girls
In sales and marketing</i>

700
00:35:38,381 --> 00:35:39,719
<i>Let’s go make out...</i>

701
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,638
I thought our story was epic, you know?

702
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:43,561
You and me.

703
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:45,514
Epic how?

704
00:35:46,802 --> 00:35:48,827
Spanning years and continents,

705
00:35:49,134 --> 00:35:51,576
lives ruined,
bloodshed... epic.

706
00:35:51,577 --> 00:35:54,269
<i>...are ringing 
Joyful and triumphant </i>

707
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,110
<i>-and I can
-I can...</i>

708
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:57,057
<i>Hear the bells</i>

709
00:35:57,058 --> 00:35:58,258
But summer's almost here,

710
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:01,518
and we won't see each other at all.

711
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:06,657
And then you'll leave town,
and then...

712
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:12,280
...then it's over.

713
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:13,947
Logan...

714
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:15,243
I'm sorry...

715
00:36:17,698 --> 00:36:19,213
...about last summer.

716
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:22,921
You know,
if I could do it over...

717
00:36:24,328 --> 00:36:27,713
Come on.
Ruined lives, bloodshed?

718
00:36:28,379 --> 00:36:30,888
You really think a relationship
should be that hard?

719
00:36:32,034 --> 00:36:34,533
No one writes songs
about the ones that come easy.

720
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:38,181
<i>I hear the bells
So fascinating and</i>

721
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:41,050
<i>I’ll slug it out
I’m sick of waiting</i>

722
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:42,881
<i>-and I can 
-I can</i>

723
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:47,764
<i>hear the bells are ringing
joyful and triumphant</i>

724
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:49,773
<i>-and I can 
-I can</i>

725
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:54,405
<i>hear the bells are ringing
joyful and triumphant</i>

726
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:56,226
<i>-and I can 
-I can</i>

727
00:36:56,279 --> 00:37:01,001
<i>hear the bells are ringing
joyful and triumphant</i>

728
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:01,904
I have to go.

729
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:03,616
I have to go.

730
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:07,961
<i>hear the bells are ringing
joyful and triumphant</i>

731
00:37:07,962 --> 00:37:09,591
<i>-and I can 
-I can</i>

732
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:15,707
<i>[DJ Harry - "All My Life"]
Oh. Come right down to it</i>

733
00:37:21,566 --> 00:37:27,209
<i><song playable online!>
How do I accept the gift?</i>

734
00:37:32,273 --> 00:37:37,931
<i>She don't matter now I exist</i>

735
00:37:37,932 --> 00:37:43,079
<i>I've thought lots about it</i>

736
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:47,717
<i>and I am still in limbo</i>

737
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,518
<i>I still don't know if it's down there</i>

738
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:56,636
<i>in my soul
if it's down there in my soul</i>

739
00:37:57,872 --> 00:37:59,766
So, mayor Goodman.

740
00:38:01,642 --> 00:38:03,200
Why do you want to scare
that guy so bad?

741
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:07,368
I mean, I admit, I'm no great fan
of the man's policies, myself.

742
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:08,748
His policies?

743
00:38:10,314 --> 00:38:11,715
You see,
that's the thing.

744
00:38:13,777 --> 00:38:15,897
People always talk about him
as this great guy.

745
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:20,020
"He's the mayor."
"He makes good burgers.

746
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:22,718
 "He's awesome, Woody Goodman."

747
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,308
She don't know what he really is.

748
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:29,257
What is he, really?

749
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,482
You want to know?

750
00:38:39,546 --> 00:38:41,289
You might want to apologize to Sacks,

751
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,014
who spent the last hour
with his arm down that drain.

752
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:49,333
A couple more minutes.

753
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:53,592
Please, Don.
He's about to open up.

754
00:38:54,755 --> 00:38:57,349
No can do. He's going home now.
He just made bail.

755
00:38:58,198 --> 00:38:59,307
Who bailed him out?

756
00:39:02,204 --> 00:39:03,329
Mr. Manning.

757
00:39:04,494 --> 00:39:06,199
Mr. Manning?
Meg Manning's father?

758
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,012
Guess he's got a soft spot for weirdos.

759
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:17,230
Hey.

760
00:39:17,808 --> 00:39:20,816
Must not have been that wild a party
if you're up this early.

761
00:39:21,368 --> 00:39:23,460
It was... whatever.

762
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:26,749
Ahh... whatever.

763
00:39:44,385 --> 00:39:45,638
You can go ahead in now.

764
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:54,094
Good morning.

765
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:24,884
Hello.

766
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:28,442
First, let me say that I'm sorry
for running out last night like I did.

767
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:32,659
I was a bit overwhelmed.
I needed to collect my thoughts,

768
00:40:33,006 --> 00:40:34,265
think about what you said.

769
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:37,229
-Veronica...
-Let me just get this out.

770
00:40:38,627 --> 00:40:40,467
I don't want to lose you
from my life, either.

771
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:45,473
And I'm not saying I'm ready
to dive back into anything, but...

772
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:49,723
after graduation, let's make it
a point to see each other,

773
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:52,067
see where that takes us.

774
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:56,069
Remember what you said
about our relationship being epic?

775
00:41:04,372 --> 00:41:05,587
Oh, god.

776
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:11,061
Last night was kind of a blur.

777
00:41:11,495 --> 00:41:13,396
Is that our room service?

778
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:18,263
No.

779
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:21,371
Just Veronica Mars.

780
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:23,409
What a disappointment.

781
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:26,541
Come on,
let's get you cleaned up.

782
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:28,808
Bye, Veronica.

783
00:41:33,572 --> 00:41:35,061
Look, whatever I said, I...

784
00:41:36,563 --> 00:41:37,416
You should know...

785
00:41:37,466 --> 00:41:38,588
Stop.
