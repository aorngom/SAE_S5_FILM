1
00:00:00,293 --> 00:00:02,132
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:02,183 --> 00:00:04,900
It just went straight of the cliff. They're all dead.

3
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:06,173
The bus crash...

4
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,039
It was meant for me.

5
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:11,285
He caught me completely of guard.

6
00:00:11,383 --> 00:00:13,259
We dated almost twenty years ago.

7
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,406
He was crazy.

8
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:17,070
Veronica, are you in immediate life threatening danger?

9
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:18,960
At this precise moment? No.

10
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:21,464
If she needs me, I'm gonna come through, just like she would for me.

11
00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:26,007
Where I'm from, the girl who you make out with is the one you do favors for.

12
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:27,755
Who are you?

13
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:29,221
I'm your father.

14
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:46,636
I was just gonna come outside to grab you.

15
00:00:47,918 --> 00:00:49,285
Food is ready.

16
00:00:50,162 --> 00:00:51,652
I'm not hungry, mom.

17
00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:54,743
I just met somebody out in the driveway.

18
00:00:55,212 --> 00:00:56,720
Wallace, what's wrong?

19
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:59,182
A guy from Chicago --
he said he knew you.

20
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:01,193
Name Nathan woods ring a bell?

21
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:02,763
Oh, Wallace.

22
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:03,935
Is it true?

23
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:06,773
- Baby --
- No, just tell me if it's true.

24
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:09,089
You were never supposed to see that man.

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,081
Is he still here?

26
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:11,005
"That man"?

27
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:14,086
You got to be kidding.
Why don't you just call him what he really is?

28
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:17,229
So, who did we put in the ground back in cleveland?

29
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:20,021
Who was it I cried for all those months?

30
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:21,278
That was your father.

31
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:25,025
Oh yeah? 'cause I don't see how that works, having two fathers.

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,516
Nathan woods and I got married when I was 21 years old.

33
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:41,246
He was...

34
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:43,777
a narcotics detective.
He told me already.

35
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:46,266
No, Wallace, that's how he started out.

36
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:50,691
But then he went undercover on some case that he said would make his career.

37
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,121
And soon, he got so deep into it, he had me fooled,

38
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,488
unless coming home high was a part of the job,

39
00:01:57,612 --> 00:02:01,983
unless stashing heroin and guns under my bed was all in the line of duty.

40
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:12,665
I hate that you had to find out like this.

41
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:19,039
But if you are asking me who is your real father, that's Hank Fennel.

42
00:02:25,238 --> 00:02:26,561
What are you doing?

43
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:29,604
I wanted to show you your birth certificate, but...

44
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:34,249
I know wre it went.

45
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:41,833
You know...

46
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:45,398
that the day hank Fennel asked me to marry him

47
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:50,425
was the day that he signed his name on that piece of paper, calling you his son.

48
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,912
And that is who your father was.

49
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,104
And that's who he still is.

50
00:03:18,544 --> 00:03:19,598
Can I guess?

51
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,277
You got a sweet love hangover, and you don't need no cure.

52
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,588
Can I have your attention, please?

53
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:29,179
As you know, homecoming season is upon us.

54
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:31,090
Much like the plague.

55
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:34,049
Each homeroom will nominate one boy and one girl.

56
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:38,539
The top five vote-getters from each class will comprise the royalty court.

57
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:42,711
Homecoming king and queen will be announced at this friday's dance.

58
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:44,795
Floor is open for nominations.

59
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:46,010
Anyone?

60
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:48,849
Anyone?

61
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:52,559
You know, sometimes when I'm feeling, I don't know, glum,

62
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:55,394
I like to get a little pirate love.

63
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:56,618
Veronica.

64
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,999
I'd like to nominate Wallace Fennel.

65
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:00,121
Whoo-hoo!

66
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:02,002
Go, Wallace!

67
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:05,048
Yes, douglas.

68
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,341
I'd like to nominate Veronica Mars.

69
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,152
Like, ironically?

70
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:12,720
Yeah, she's badass, smoking hot, and nice to come home to.

71
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:16,023
Hmm, zippy the pinhead with a smashing idea.

72
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:17,816
My ass would make a better homecoming queen.

73
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:20,939
We should nominate Veronica.
She deserves it.

74
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:23,095
Remember when she helped me find my dog?

75
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:26,212
She was totally nice to me, even though we barely knew each other.

76
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:28,214
Plus, she found polly the parrot last year.

77
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:29,543
Veronica Mars --

78
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:32,609
saving the world, one pointless act at a time.

79
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,691
Veronica's so good at helping people.

80
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:37,686
If you ever need any help, you should ask her.

81
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:43,646
Uh, wait, wait, wait.
Let me get this straight.

82
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:46,429
No alcohol, no dimly lit corners,

83
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,488
and I'm not allowed to freak, grind, and/or mosh?

84
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:52,074
Uh, what's the allure of homecoming, again,

85
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,377
besides a chance to wear pink taffeta and cheek shimmer?

86
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:57,239
It's really all about the after party.

87
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,740
The dance itself is more like a means to an end.

88
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,055
Cora, I'm kidding --
I want it all --

89
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:03,783
the corsage, the photos under the balloon arch,

90
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:06,902
the clandestine lovin' with my age-appropriate date...

91
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,524
with the focusing problem. Hey!

92
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,065
Dream weaver.

93
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,763
Yeah, I'll be right back.

94
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:18,344
Got to go talk to Veronica for a minute.

95
00:05:18,795 --> 00:05:21,756
I saw the most fantastic dress at miu miu last weekend.

96
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:23,376
It was, like, made for you --

97
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:24,599
so perfect.

98
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:31,187
So, your biological dad is like some sort of "donnie brasco" renegade cop?

99
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:34,384
So, what's your bio-dad like?

100
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,053
Shh!

101
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,046
I don't know.

102
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:39,610
He seems...

103
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:42,724
whatever.

104
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,206
Could you just keep this to yourself?

105
00:05:44,257 --> 00:05:46,821
I just need to figure things out before --

106
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:52,431
what, are you guys still planning my surprise party?

107
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:53,457
Hi, Jackie.

108
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,185
Bye, Veronica.

109
00:06:00,497 --> 00:06:02,507
I better go take care of that.

110
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:19,566
You are aware that "blanketing the electorate" is, like, a figure of speech?

111
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:22,762
What's that smell?

112
00:06:23,314 --> 00:06:25,449
A buddy of mine in sanitation called.

113
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,584
One of his crews found those in a dumpster downtown.

114
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,136
At least lamb has the sense not to use

115
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:34,827
the dumpster behind the sheriff's department.

116
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:35,972
Ahh.

117
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:37,734
Look, Veronica...

118
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:42,885
your father's campaign is riding on a gravy train with biscuit wheels.

119
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,307
Woody's numbers guys just called to say I've got a 12-point lead.

120
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:49,583
I don't need to roll around in the mud with lamb.

121
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:50,385
In that case,

122
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:54,302
it sounds like you don't need a photographer from the Neptune navigator

123
00:06:54,353 --> 00:06:56,451
who knows how to shoot your good side?

124
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:59,056
I got nothing but good sides, baby.

125
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:09,377
Your grandma wants me to remind you that you're a risk-taker, with an...

126
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:13,206
"if it feels good, do it" approach to love.

127
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:14,577
You're supercharged.

128
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:15,903
You're wired.

129
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:17,612
You're ready for action.

130
00:07:17,874 --> 00:07:19,121
That lady ought to know.

131
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,280
She was married four times.

132
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:25,475
I'm sorry, child.

133
00:07:25,526 --> 00:07:27,268
This card's been declined.

134
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,324
Lip balm?

135
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:43,387
It's a surge of lip-quenching fruit flavor.

136
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:48,457
Wallace said I would find you here.
I need to ask you something.

137
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:53,974
I'm in some trouble.

138
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,771
I didn't know who else to go to.

139
00:07:55,822 --> 00:07:58,084
Wallace said that you might help me.

140
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,984
<i>A long time ago,</i>

141
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,236
<i>we used to be friends but I</i>

142
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:11,638
<i>Haven't thought of you lately at all.</i>

143
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:15,259

00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:17,918

145
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:21,265
<i>just remember me when</i>

146
00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:23,594
<i>we used to be friends</i>

147
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:25,508
<i>a long time ago</i>

148
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:28,239
<i>we used to be friends</i>

149
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:33,433
<i>Saison 2 - Episode 5
"Blast from the past"</i>

150
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:37,738
someone stole my credit card and maxed it out.

151
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,120
So call the credit card company.
They'll erase the charges.

152
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:43,147
I've done that. It's not the bill I'm worried about.

153
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:44,982
What are you worried about?

154
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:48,864
My friend cora borrows my stuff all the time.

155
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:50,958
It's like she doesn't have clothes of her own.

156
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:53,350
And, well...

157
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,876
I noticed my card was missing after I went shopping with her.

158
00:08:55,927 --> 00:08:59,856
Then I found it in my car, like someone had deliberately put it back.

159
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,785
I don't want to just accuse her.

160
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:03,485
So you want me to prove she did it?

161
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:06,116
No. I want you to prove that she didn'T.

162
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:08,674
She's the only friend that I have here.

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,618
I...

164
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:12,275
printed a list of the charges.

165
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:23,185
$100 for lip enhancer at estée lauder, $1,200 for a leather jacket at nordstrom,

166
00:09:23,468 --> 00:09:26,964
$500 on vanilla-scented candles at tricky wicks?

167
00:09:27,288 --> 00:09:30,246
Yeah, she's a full-time resident at the galleria.

168
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:33,229
I think she hit every store in the mall.

169
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,887
Except for unicornucopia.

170
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:37,198
Hmm.

171
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,664
Any idea what this is?

172
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,083
No.

173
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:44,840
So, if you were gonna help me, where would you start?

174
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:46,155
With the obvious.

175
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:49,917
I'd figure out if cora had any of the things on the list.

176
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:58,249
I'm here to pick up my papers.

177
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:03,101
I'm talking about the personal documents that you stole from my house.

178
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:04,678
I didn't steal, Alicia.

179
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,687
Borrowed without my knowledge, accidentally dropped into your briefcase --

180
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:10,759
I don't care what you're calling it.

181
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,384
I just want them back.

182
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:22,907
Why didn't you just tell me your ex-husband was a cop?

183
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,010
I was trying to protect my son.

184
00:10:26,153 --> 00:10:30,590
I was young and scared, and Nathan woods was scary, violent, and high.

185
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:33,699
I don't doubt that what you did was for the best.

186
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:37,519
I'm just suggesting it might have been wise to let Wallace know.

187
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,522
You are giving me parenting advice?

188
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,821
What is that supposed to mean?

189
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:45,694
That means I protected Wallace's childhood.
I didn't sell it out.

190
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:48,758
I will not invite chaos into my house.

191
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,647
Oh, come on, Alicia, you invited chaos!

192
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:53,713
All you did was postpone it!

193
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:21,030
Folks say papa never was much on thinkin'

194
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:25,333
spent most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'

195
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:28,113
mama, I'm dependin' on you

196
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:30,629
to tell me the truth

197
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,992
mama looked up with a tear in her eye and said, "son..."

198
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:41,266
papa was a rolling stone wherever he laid his hat was his home

199
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:47,317
and when he died all he left us was alone

200
00:11:47,368 --> 00:11:49,630
talked with your moms about me, huh?

201
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:53,124
Don't worry. I'm not here to defend myself.

202
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,702
Truth is, I barely remember those days.

203
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:02,232
So how can I blame her for running out on me?

204
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:03,773
So why are you here?

205
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:06,558
What brought you to Neptune?

206
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:10,004
You had almost 18 years to track me down.

207
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:11,453
She never told you?

208
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:12,443
Told me what?

209
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:13,548
I did try --

210
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:15,121
for years, Wallace.

211
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:19,564
It drove me crazy to think my son would grow up a stranger.

212
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:22,552
Alicia's mom wouldn't tell me where she'd gone.

213
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:28,016
She did promise to pass along these.

214
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,816
Grandma always liked me, I guess.

215
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:38,177
If it weren't for her, I never would have known Alicia was pregnant.

216
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,123
Mom said she gave you a choice.

217
00:12:42,174 --> 00:12:44,612
She said, "your job or being a father."

218
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:50,141
If she would have given me that choice, I would have chose you.

219
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:55,336
The votes have been tallied, and the nominees for king are...

220
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:56,475
Duncan Kane...

221
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,218
Mark Fraser...

222
00:12:58,962 --> 00:13:00,208
Steve Vargo...

223
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,001
Hank Ditten...

224
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,880
And Wallace Fennel.

225
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:06,557
Yeah! Go, Wallace!

226
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,270
All right, man!

227
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:13,471
How many kneecaps did you break to make that happen?

228
00:13:13,522 --> 00:13:14,655
Only, like, four.

229
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:17,161
The people have spoken, my friend.

230
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:21,266
Lucy franks...

231
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,010
Josie Shelman...

232
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,928
Emma Harris...

233
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:27,086
Liz Levine...

234
00:13:27,385 --> 00:13:28,565
and Kate Riggs.

235
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,308
Hmmm...

236
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:35,228
well, there's always winter carnival.

237
00:13:35,824 --> 00:13:37,909
Veronica can be ice princess.

238
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,460
Can we skate on her?

239
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:42,478
I didn't hear your name called.

240
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:44,805
Seems like a bit of an oversight.

241
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,983
Talk about fashion police.

242
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:01,791
I'm on a stakeout for a pair of enhanced lips,

243
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,144
a $50 push-up bra, a vintage purse, and --

244
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:06,961
bling-O.

245
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,512
Why buy the cow

246
00:14:08,563 --> 00:14:12,902
when you can score a $1,200 calfskin jacket on your friend's credit card?

247
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,714
Oops! I'm so sorry!

248
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:17,781
Oh, my god.
I love this.

249
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,336
You have amazing taste, cora.

250
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:22,175
You -- you know who I am?

251
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:24,799
Eighth-grade badminton partner?

252
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:27,170
You never forget someone you've been in the foxhole with.

253
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:28,275
I guess not.

254
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:29,511
Anyway, thanks.

255
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:30,741
I'm just a savvy shopper.

256
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:32,004
Where did you get this?

257
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:33,243
It's a secret.

258
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:35,872
Okay, outlet mall outside of chatsworth.

259
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:37,541
I'm going later to get my homecoming dress.

260
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:38,463
Can I come?

261
00:14:38,514 --> 00:14:41,160
We can carpool, save a little money on gas.

262
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:42,265
That's cool.

263
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:43,855
I'll call you.

264
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:50,900
Though I haven't really been asked to homecoming yet, have I?

265
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,334
So, I was thinking --

266
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:02,660
you're an emancipated minor, I'm an emancipated minor.

267
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:04,307
Maybe we should get together thursday night,

268
00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:06,484
chug cough syrup, mug some old ladies?

269
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:08,184
Oh, golly, I don't know.

270
00:15:08,235 --> 00:15:13,099
I was thinking about staying home, making a hope quilt for the lonely.

271
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:14,866
A little "hot shots"?

272
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:16,202
Golf tourney?

273
00:15:16,424 --> 00:15:17,948
A little room service?

274
00:15:18,973 --> 00:15:20,137
You're on.

275
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:27,706
So, she's got to be the thief, right?

276
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:28,927
Well...

277
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:32,110
let me just double-check before you accuse her of anything.

278
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:36,449
But she'd have to be pretty thick to wear stolen merchandise to school.

279
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:40,369
The girl's sweet, but she's not the brightest bulb on the bush.

280
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:43,654
I should have a definitive answer for you by tomorrow.

281
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,697
You know what else bugs me?

282
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:48,250
Gang violence bugs me.

283
00:15:48,301 --> 00:15:49,620
Illegal immigration bugs me.

284
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:51,349
Drug trafficking bugs me.

285
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,277
Street-racing bugs me.

286
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:54,129
But come election day,

287
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,462
I am confident that the voters of balboa county will do what is best and put

288
00:15:57,513 --> 00:15:59,643
"the exterminator" back in office.

289
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:04,465
Next question to you, Mr. Mars.

290
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:07,799
We're all familiar with your role in the Lilly Kane murder case.

291
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,754
Does the nature of that crime or the conditions of your recall

292
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:13,920
color your feelings for Neptune?

293
00:16:14,344 --> 00:16:15,484
I love Neptune.

294
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:17,527
I wouldn't be running if I didn't.

295
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:18,356
But...

296
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:22,109
what does -- to borrow a slogan -- "bug me"

297
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,868
are the subtle changes in Neptune over the last few months.

298
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,131
You mean violent crime dropping 11%?

299
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:31,138
I'm talking about the growing sense of resentment,

300
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:34,890
of friction, of polarization within our community.

301
00:16:39,424 --> 00:16:42,318
Well, nothing has been more divisive than the bus crash,

302
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:47,416
and many feel that you were quick in attributing the accident to driver error, sheriff.

303
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:53,654
On the subject of the bus crash, it's just come to light that back in '89, then--

304
00:16:54,003 --> 00:16:58,384
deputy Mars pulled ed Doyle over for driving under the influence.

305
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:02,375
He had simply decided to follow him home rather than follow procedure.

306
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:04,173
Had a D.U.I. Appeared on his record,

307
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,392
he would have never been hired by the school district.

308
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:11,521
Mr. Mars, your response.

309
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:13,616
I'm sorry. I'm n--
I'm not familiar with it.

310
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:18,201
It's okay -- I have a copy of your patrol log if you need to jog your memory.

311
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:27,094
This, I have the only car left in america without a cupholder,

312
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:31,277
so now I end up with a caramel Latte rorschach test all over my blouse.

313
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:35,195
- Thanks for letting me borrow something of yours.
- No problem.

314
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,655
Must find stolen goods.

315
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:40,830
You know, the mall's in chatsworth.

316
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:43,277
No one worth knowing is gonna see you.

317
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:45,306
Oh.

318
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:46,159
No, not that one.

319
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,853
There's nothing you'd want to see in there.

320
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:49,706
I love looking through your clothes.

321
00:17:49,757 --> 00:17:52,892
It's like the fashion equivalent of a skin mag.

322
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,900
No, seriously, I don't --

323
00:17:57,434 --> 00:17:58,172
oh...

324
00:17:58,874 --> 00:17:59,660
yeah.

325
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:02,875
I so did not want you to see that.

326
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:04,289
Isn't this...

327
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,262
the oh, boyo pollo chicken.

328
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:08,388
Yep.

329
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:13,436
You know, if anyone finds out about this, I'm afraid I'll have to kill you.

330
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:16,477
If I tell anyone, I won't blame you.

331
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,558
Your dress is perfect.

332
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,225
Duncan's gonna love it.

333
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:30,359
Thanks.

334
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:34,992
Outlet therapy is considerably better than retail therapy.

335
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:37,850
Thanks for driving.

336
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:38,723
Bye.

337
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:50,311
Oh, boyo pollo?

338
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:52,709
May I speak with the manager, please?

339
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:54,718
Hi, this is may hadwell.

340
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,717
I'm the vocational ed coordinator at Neptune high.

341
00:18:57,768 --> 00:19:01,067
I need to verify some work hours for cora briggs.

342
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,304
She worked sunday, as well?

343
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:08,309
Until what time?

344
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:11,926
I see. Thank you.

345
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,409
Jackie, it's Veronica.

346
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:23,808
There's no way cora could have stolen your card.

347
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,946
We're back to square one.

348
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:28,757
Thanks, Carl.

349
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:29,602
Mm-hmm.

350
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:34,907
It's weird that you live here.

351
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:38,136
I don't want you going all howard hughes-y on me.

352
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:39,685
I am not a shut-in.

353
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:40,753
These nails --

354
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,934
neatly trimmed.

355
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,439
Though, now that you mention it, I have started bottling my own urine.

356
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,090
Ew.

357
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,128
Hey!

358
00:19:51,186 --> 00:19:55,100
What do you say we invite some people over here for an after party?

359
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:56,704
After party?

360
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,145
After what?

361
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:01,780
The homecoming dance?

362
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:03,739
The thing after the big game?

363
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,668
Oh...

364
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:08,191
tell me more of this thing you call "homecoming."

365
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,400
I haven't asked you yet.

366
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:12,373
Mnh-mnh.

367
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:13,778
I'm such a dope.

368
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:17,754
Well, of course I want you to go with me.

369
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:19,143
You're my woman.

370
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:21,215
See?
Was that so hard?

371
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:22,217
Okay.

372
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:25,029
I'll be needing an orchid wristlet --

373
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:27,515
preferably in the fuchsia family --

374
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:32,772
a rolls-royce limo, and some Kane software stationery.

375
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:36,830
Seriously? Stationery?

376
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:38,511
What for?

377
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,985
You're here for your looks.

378
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:44,136
Why don't you leave the heavy thinking to me, sugarpants?

379
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:46,013
Now go make yourself pretty.

380
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:53,859
"After surrendering an early lead,

381
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:58,585
"former sheriff keith Mars is now in a statistical dead heat with the incumbent."

382
00:20:59,147 --> 00:21:02,063
What do your number guys have to say about that?

383
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:07,008
Criminy.

384
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:09,403
What kind of bug is that?

385
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:11,588
You worry about the election.

386
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:13,778
I'll worry about my bio project.

387
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,130
What are those?

388
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:23,494
Don't you know?

389
00:21:24,045 --> 00:21:26,693
It looks an awful lot like your handwriting.

390
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,076
"Return to sender." Hmm.

391
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,849
Maybe we should just see what dad has to say.

392
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,538
It's better late than never, right?

393
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:35,566
No, Wallace, no!

394
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:37,009
What were you thinking, mom?

395
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,856
That he was so strung out, he'd O.D.
And just forget about me?

396
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:44,078
I'm still your mother, and I told you to stay away from him,

397
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:45,425
and I expect you to listen to me!

398
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:47,704
You told me you gave him a choice.

399
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:48,901
You lied.

400
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,554
She made my dad out to be some kind of a psychopath just to cover her tracks.

401
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,354
If he's so nuts, how'd he manage to stick with the Chicago P.D. all these years?

402
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:08,600
If he was a cop, how did it take him all these years to track you down?

403
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:10,055
Your mom is right, Wallace.

404
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:12,318
He had his chance, and he passed it up.

405
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:14,371
Take it from someone who knows.

406
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:17,537
The one who sticks with you is the one who cares.

407
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,793
Sorry to interrupt.

408
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:35,024
Check this out.

409
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:38,636
Jake Kane sent a vote of support all the way from aspen.

410
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:41,654
"Dear exterminator, knock 'em dead on election day."

411
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:43,605
Got those guys in interrogation.

412
00:22:43,656 --> 00:22:46,178
The two goons you picked up in cliffside?

413
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:49,782
You're not gonna believe the story they're trying to sell.

414
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:05,099
Consolidated elemental industries, 5003 james --

415
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:08,071
the first place where someone used Jackie's card.

416
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:16,701
Yeah, when I think of elemental industries, I think of palm readings.

417
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:22,903
I'll be out in a minute.

418
00:23:33,951 --> 00:23:35,701
Vanilla-scented candles...

419
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,057
$500 worth, perhaps?

420
00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:39,365
Purchased at...

421
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,228
...tricky wicks.

422
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,211
It just doesn't make much sense.

423
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,524
How would she have gotten your card?

424
00:23:52,205 --> 00:23:56,896
Although I guess it's possible that cora and the psychic were in this together.

425
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:59,976
I know how madam sophie got the card.

426
00:24:00,027 --> 00:24:01,475
She got it from me.

427
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:03,913
You see a psychic?

428
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:05,919
My grandma died two years ago,

429
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,464
and even a person pretending to be grandma

430
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:12,985
telling me everything's gonna be all right gives me comfort.

431
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:13,864
Shh.

432
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:15,464
It's my secret shame.

433
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:18,893
I'm sure you've got one.

434
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:22,551
Remember mamma-max?

435
00:24:23,937 --> 00:24:27,724
The stuff from the infomercial, the cream that you rub on your chest?

436
00:24:27,775 --> 00:24:28,569
Mm-hmm.

437
00:24:29,071 --> 00:24:31,618
In my defense, I was a freshman.

438
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:33,810
I've got it.

439
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,683
I know how to get even.

440
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,327
I'm going on her show.

441
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:39,608
She has a show?

442
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:42,414
You tivo a community access show?

443
00:24:42,617 --> 00:24:44,829
Everyone at Neptune high watches it.

444
00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:49,233
Welcome, everyone.

445
00:24:49,726 --> 00:24:52,243
Someone special is trying to reach you...

446
00:24:52,668 --> 00:24:56,310
a friend who passed before her time.

447
00:24:58,822 --> 00:25:00,832
Do you know who that might be?

448
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,036
I think I do.

449
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,084
My friend rhonda...

450
00:25:06,415 --> 00:25:07,902
she was on the bus.

451
00:25:13,152 --> 00:25:16,152
And suddenly I have a new life's mission --

452
00:25:16,203 --> 00:25:17,837
destroy madam sophie.

453
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:23,039
Dad, you remember Veronica Mars.

454
00:25:23,142 --> 00:25:24,534
We met at shark field.

455
00:25:24,585 --> 00:25:27,220
Right -- promised you wouldn't wash that hand.

456
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:28,264
I haven'T.

457
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,988
People are starting to complain.

458
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:33,175
What did the sheriff want?

459
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:35,961
He wanted me to emcee the department's charity ball.

460
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:37,192
You're kidding.

461
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:38,471
Wish I was.

462
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:41,292
It was nice seeing you.

463
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,306
Before I left her place,

464
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:46,660
Jackie and I came up with a plan to get even with madam sophie.

465
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,218
Since she already knew Jackie,

466
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:51,889
I would go on madam sophie's show and expose her as a fraud.

467
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:55,808
Terrence Cook's mention of his visit with the sheriff reminded me --

468
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:00,291
maybe it's time to check in on Neptune's finest dirty politician himself.

469
00:26:02,265 --> 00:26:05,231
You have to make a report on your own, sweetheart.

470
00:26:05,282 --> 00:26:06,202
Thank you.

471
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:15,292
Mr. Cook.

472
00:26:15,622 --> 00:26:17,238
Good to see you,heriff.

473
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:27,133
I was thinking that you might be interested in buying some tickets to our annual fundraiser.

474
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:28,731
They're 10 bucks a pop.

475
00:26:28,782 --> 00:26:31,691
You asked me to come all the way down here just to hit me up for a donation?

476
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:34,784
I like to get to know our more notable residents --

477
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:38,236
business leaders, hollywood types, all-star athletes --

478
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:39,199
personally.

479
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:41,453
Put me down for two.

480
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:43,575
It was real nice to meet you.

481
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:48,075
Actually, I was thinking you might purchase more like 1,000 tickets.

482
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:53,438
Oh, and if you could emcee the bachelor auction, that would be great.

483
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,291
That's a lot of money, sheriff.

484
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:57,245
Yeah, that's $10,000...

485
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,311
if my math's correct.

486
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:02,319
Hey, it's not $3 million.

487
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:04,807
Now, that is real money.

488
00:27:04,912 --> 00:27:11,165
I mean, that's the kind of money that certain people take very, very seriously.

489
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:13,188
Gambling debt like that,

490
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:20,001
and they might send some guys down to your nice new cliffside house to remind you payment's due.

491
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:21,320
What are you getting at, sheriff?

492
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:23,500
Pretty sure I just got to it, slugger.

493
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:25,400
I never bet on baseball.

494
00:27:28,538 --> 00:27:31,160
I got a guy in a holding cell back there.

495
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:36,407
Says you did favors for gentlemen who bet extensively...

496
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,013
on baseball.

497
00:27:42,387 --> 00:27:43,005
Hmm.

498
00:27:45,989 --> 00:27:48,075
We both have something in common.

499
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,872
We'd both like to see you make it into the hall of fame.

500
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,550
Say it ain't so, terrence.

501
00:28:00,672 --> 00:28:02,514
Do you mind if I sit here?

502
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:04,461
Michele, right?

503
00:28:05,052 --> 00:28:06,572
I saw you on tv --

504
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:10,109
"answers from angels." That was pretty amazing.

505
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,348
Oh, it so was.

506
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:13,823
The reason I wanted to talk --

507
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:16,614
I'm thinking about going on the show, and...

508
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:19,922
what exactly did they have you do when you got there?

509
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:24,245
Did someone from the show ask you who you wanted to communicate with?

510
00:28:24,475 --> 00:28:25,220
Oh.

511
00:28:26,253 --> 00:28:28,528
No. No, not at all.

512
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:30,520
So nobody there knew about rhonda?

513
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:33,130
Well, there was this one lady backstage,

514
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:36,131
this other audience member, and we got to talking.

515
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,454
What did she look like?

516
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:38,207
Crazy.

517
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:40,385
Big hair...

518
00:28:40,943 --> 00:28:42,241
rhinestone glasses.

519
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:43,575
Why?

520
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,844
Details just flesh out a story.

521
00:28:46,905 --> 00:28:49,240
Before madam sophie contacted rhonda

522
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:54,246
and let me know she wasn't angry at me for not picking up, I couldn't eat.

523
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,019
I couldn't sleep.

524
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,250
Not picking up?

525
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,319
Rhonda called me from the bus.

526
00:28:59,506 --> 00:29:00,342
I was...

527
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:02,128
painting my nails...

528
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:04,552
and I let it go to voice mail.

529
00:29:04,603 --> 00:29:08,693
You have a message from when the bus went over?
Do you still have it?

530
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:14,670
Please, don't tell anyone I have this, Veronica.

531
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,822
I wouldn't want them to...

532
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:19,310
...You know?

533
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:25,160
You have one saved message.

534
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:27,827
Michele, why aren't you picking up, you big loser?

535
00:29:27,878 --> 00:29:30,831
I can't believe you bailed on that field trip without telling me.

536
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:32,574
Hey, about next weekend --

537
00:29:33,352 --> 00:29:34,808
Oh, god!

538
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:41,517
To delete message, press 7.

539
00:29:41,818 --> 00:29:43,644
To forward message, press 8.

540
00:29:44,187 --> 00:29:45,535
For more options...

541
00:29:45,802 --> 00:29:48,487
hey, are you okay?

542
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:51,365
Yeah.

543
00:30:00,845 --> 00:30:02,415
Sure you want to do this?

544
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:04,434
Does a bear wear a funny hat?

545
00:30:04,823 --> 00:30:08,545
You know, this visit's all about mending fences, building bridges,

546
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:11,524
and I'm afraid that my waxing your ass just isn't gonna help.

547
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:12,758
Ooh-hoo!

548
00:30:13,117 --> 00:30:14,171
You talk it.

549
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,254
Let's see you walk it.

550
00:30:19,816 --> 00:30:20,996
Roger that one.

551
00:30:21,064 --> 00:30:22,420
You'll see, honey.

552
00:30:22,896 --> 00:30:26,282
You're gonna do just fine at those baton-twirling tryouts.

553
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:30,930
Apparently, the dead are looking out for the shallow.

554
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:32,334
I, on the other hand,

555
00:30:32,385 --> 00:30:36,394
am here for emotional guidance from dead-before-his-time uncle roger,

556
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:41,269
who I gushed about ad nauseam to crazy big-haired lady with the rhinestone glasses.

557
00:30:44,962 --> 00:30:47,004
Someone is looking for an "R."

558
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:52,309
He was...special to you, took you places...

559
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:53,675
made things for you.

560
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,300
That's my uncle roger.

561
00:30:55,424 --> 00:30:56,544
That's it, lady --

562
00:30:56,595 --> 00:30:57,838
dig your own grave.

563
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,623
Wait -- I am receiving another voice...

564
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:01,893
a young woman.

565
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:07,899
I see...the letter "L." She is holding out a flower, A...

566
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,620
lily.

567
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:10,074
Lilly?

568
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,022
She has a message for you.

569
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:17,637
She says...

570
00:31:18,554 --> 00:31:21,328
you should have stayed away from her boyfriend.

571
00:31:32,264 --> 00:31:32,924
Wait.

572
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:37,109
Wait, she has something else to tell us.

573
00:31:37,351 --> 00:31:39,009
This can't be happening.

574
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,786
Something about...

575
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:44,061
infomercials?

576
00:31:44,734 --> 00:31:47,242
She says to be happy with your own body.

577
00:31:47,293 --> 00:31:49,142
You...don't...

578
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:50,295
need the...

579
00:31:52,263 --> 00:31:53,483
mamma-max...

580
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,324
...Veronica.

581
00:32:03,097 --> 00:32:06,175
I was thinking that you might be interested in buying some tickets

582
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:07,876
to our annual fundraiser.

583
00:32:07,972 --> 00:32:09,164
They're 10 bucks a pop.

584
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:10,705
Put me down for two.

585
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:12,762
It was real nice to meet you.

586
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,918
Actually, I was thinking you might purchase More like 1,000 --

587
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,957
Chesty larue.

588
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:23,180
Hey, Duncan.

589
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:27,366
I'm fine. I'm slathering up my boobs as we speak.

590
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,002
Can I call you back?

591
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:30,424
Okay.

592
00:32:30,424 --> 00:32:33,834
Hey, do you know who's deejaying in between sets tomorrow?

593
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:35,320
Corny?

594
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:37,121
Perfect.

595
00:32:38,302 --> 00:32:40,536
No, I just have a special request.

596
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:42,833
Okay. Bye.

597
00:33:00,572 --> 00:33:01,810
You okay, Veronica?

598
00:33:01,861 --> 00:33:05,952
Compared to how your girlfriend's gonna be feeling, fan-friggin'-tastic.

599
00:33:06,003 --> 00:33:09,439
I hope she really got a kick out of tonight's performance.

600
00:33:09,515 --> 00:33:10,973
What are you talking about?

601
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:12,682
She was worried for you.

602
00:33:13,018 --> 00:33:17,357
If by "worried," you mean enjoying the fruits of her evil labor, yeah.

603
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:18,193
What?

604
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,000
What makes you think --

605
00:33:19,051 --> 00:33:20,500
the boob-cream thing.

606
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:23,935
She used to be the only person alive who knew about that.

607
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:25,251
It's time to pick a side, Wallace.

608
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:28,661
No, Veronica. How about you doing me a favor for once?

609
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:32,337
I'm sure she didn't do it.

610
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:35,649
But if she did, I'm asking you to let it go.

611
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,064
You know I can't do that.

612
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,743
Why does it have to be about you all the time?!

613
00:33:39,794 --> 00:33:42,098
Look, Jackie's right about one thing.

614
00:33:43,015 --> 00:33:45,377
It's your world.
I just live in it.

615
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:48,265
I'm asking you for a favor, Veronica.

616
00:33:48,613 --> 00:33:49,646
Let it go.

617
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:52,488
Don't do whatever it is you're gonna do.

618
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:56,606
Have you been paying any attention lately?

619
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:59,437
I just learned my whole life is a lie.

620
00:34:00,817 --> 00:34:02,357
My dad isn't my dad.

621
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,453
I've always been a shoulder you could lean on.

622
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:08,942
You've given me no time, no sympathy --

623
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,292
nothing.

624
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,417
Wallace.

625
00:34:24,468 --> 00:34:25,744
I want to clarify something.

626
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:27,123
Did you set up Veronica?

627
00:34:27,174 --> 00:34:29,652
It was supposed to be funny --
a punking, that's all.

628
00:34:29,703 --> 00:34:31,948
You humiliated my best friend on tv.

629
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:32,872
Wallace...

630
00:34:33,913 --> 00:34:36,638
look, I feel terrible.

631
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:39,967
I just wanted to take her down a peg for tattling on me

632
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:41,844
for having coffee with dave,

633
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:45,407
for being the person that my boyfriend confides in,

634
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,367
for supposedly being this legendary badass.

635
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,233
You have no idea what she's been through.

636
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:53,175
I swear, that psychic came up with the Lilly stuff on her own.

637
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:54,858
I only told her about the mamma-max.

638
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,307
I screwed up, okay?

639
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:58,828
Just let me make it up to you at the dance.

640
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:02,911
I'm only going to the homecoming dance because of that stupid election.

641
00:35:03,753 --> 00:35:05,419
I'm not going with you.

642
00:35:15,529 --> 00:35:16,999
You look beautiful.

643
00:35:17,904 --> 00:35:20,258
There's something I need you to hear.

644
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:23,873
If it's "live at budokan," I already discovered it.

645
00:35:25,135 --> 00:35:28,702
It's a voice mail from one of the students who died in the crash.

646
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:31,107
She called just as the bus went over.

647
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,766
You have one saved message.

648
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:38,579
Michele, why aren't you picking up, you big loser?

649
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,403
I can't believe you bailed on that field trip without telling me.

650
00:35:41,454 --> 00:35:43,146
Hey, about next weekend --

651
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:45,827
Oh, god!

652
00:35:50,195 --> 00:35:52,071
To delete message, press 7.

653
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:53,790
To forward mess--

654
00:35:54,262 --> 00:35:55,534
Did you hear it?

655
00:35:55,794 --> 00:35:56,707
An explosion.

656
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:58,760
Before the bus hit the railing.

657
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:00,402
The bus was sabotaged.

658
00:36:00,513 --> 00:36:02,706
That means ed Doyle had nothing to do with the crash,

659
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:04,639
and there's still time before the election to --

660
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,314
No.

661
00:36:08,517 --> 00:36:12,535
I'm not gonna leverage the deaths of seven people just to win an election.

662
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:15,224
There are people who think this crash is your fault.

663
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:16,799
Let them think that...

664
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:19,085
at least for now, Veronica.

665
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:22,447
If that sound is an explosion, not only were those kids murdered,

666
00:36:22,498 --> 00:36:24,936
but the guilty party is still at large.

667
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:26,543
That evidence can't go public

668
00:36:26,594 --> 00:36:28,639
if we want this investigation to stay ahead of the --

669
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,019
what investigation?

670
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:32,445
You think lamb is gonna solve this?

671
00:36:32,496 --> 00:36:37,245
The only way the killer gets put away is if you win the election.

672
00:36:47,365 --> 00:36:49,535
Honey, you have a gentleman caller.

673
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:52,390
You got the emphasis on the "gentleman" part, right?

674
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:53,193
I did.

675
00:36:55,404 --> 00:36:56,304
Don't wait up.

676
00:36:56,355 --> 00:36:58,115
Tell Wallace I'm pulling for him.

677
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,169
Hmm. Not feeling the Mars family love.

678
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,224
Tough crowd.

679
00:37:01,624 --> 00:37:03,802
Oh, come on, it's like rooting for the yankees.

680
00:37:03,853 --> 00:37:06,004
Hey, do you want this, Veronica?

681
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:10,687
Your cd?

682
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:14,545
Um...

683
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:16,611
no.

684
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:44,462
Come on.

685
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:49,515
<i>Boy, you won't be sleeping</i>

686
00:37:49,802 --> 00:37:51,295
<i>no sleep tonight</i>

687
00:37:51,652 --> 00:37:55,204
<i>do I have to spell it out in black and white?</i>

688
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,894
<i>Boy, you won't be sleeping</i>

689
00:37:59,095 --> 00:38:00,795
<i>no sleep tonight</i>

690
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:09,687
<i>I've been lying here for like a million years in my bed</i>

691
00:38:10,953 --> 00:38:13,300
<i>get up, get up, get up</i>

692
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:16,853
You look gorgeous tonight.

693
00:38:20,093 --> 00:38:22,354
<i>Shut up, shut up, shut up</i>

694
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:25,040
<i>everybody says</i>

695
00:38:25,091 --> 00:38:27,522
<i>I should be moving on</i>

696
00:38:27,735 --> 00:38:29,901
<i>everybody knows</i>

697
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:31,847
<i>I'm still waiting</i>

698
00:38:31,898 --> 00:38:33,672
no freakin' way.

699
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:39,586
<i>I don't care whatever it takes to be...</i>

700
00:38:39,637 --> 00:38:40,416
Jackie?

701
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:41,838
<i>...with you.</i>

702
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:46,124
Jackie, if you want to lock horns with me, duck and charge.

703
00:38:46,175 --> 00:38:48,528
If you think I'm gonna let you break Wallace's heart for sport,

704
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:50,962
you have grossly underestimated my wrath.

705
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:54,283
God, Veronica, what is your problem?

706
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:57,937
You really can't make up your mind, can you?

707
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:00,223
Just...pick...

708
00:39:00,537 --> 00:39:01,591
one of them!

709
00:39:02,412 --> 00:39:05,722
God, how many guys here do you expect to want only you?

710
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:12,987
So, where's the after party?

711
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,967
<i>Give up, give up, give up</i>

712
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:20,821
Hey.

713
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:23,067
He'll be all right.

714
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:34,709
All right, what's so important, keith?

715
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:35,997
It's about the crash.

716
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:37,186
'Course it is.

717
00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:38,663
Looking for another book deal?

718
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:40,532
Veronica found a recording --

719
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:44,446
a voice mail from one of the victims left at the precise moment of the accident.

720
00:39:44,497 --> 00:39:45,521
Now, there's a noise.

721
00:39:45,572 --> 00:39:47,398
It sounds like an explosion.

722
00:39:48,836 --> 00:39:52,352
Maybe ed Doyle decided to blow his brains out on the way down.

723
00:39:52,403 --> 00:39:55,648
Damn it, Lamb, just send it to the acoustics lab and let them decide.

724
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:58,550
Are you trying to tell me that this has nothing to do with clearing yourself?

725
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:01,428
Nothing to do with winning this election?

726
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:04,907
This is about finding out what happened on that school bus.

727
00:40:05,095 --> 00:40:06,791
If I wanted to hang you out to dry,

728
00:40:06,842 --> 00:40:10,782
I would have brought that evidence straight to the local news station.

729
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,582
And you are so making me wonder why I didn't.

730
00:40:21,914 --> 00:40:23,007
Is that you and the governor?

731
00:40:23,058 --> 00:40:23,886
Governor?

732
00:40:25,304 --> 00:40:28,002
Some marlin I hooked down in cabo last year.

733
00:40:28,274 --> 00:40:30,402
Is your eyesight starting to fail?

734
00:40:39,946 --> 00:40:40,783
Hello?

735
00:40:42,646 --> 00:40:43,449
Alicia.

736
00:40:44,795 --> 00:40:48,927
I was just working up the courage to call you, just to say how sorry --

737
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:51,740
No, no.

738
00:40:52,558 --> 00:40:54,350
When did you see him last?

739
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:00,920
Dad, where have you been?

740
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:02,587
You were out all night?

741
00:41:06,252 --> 00:41:08,774
Wallace didn't come home after the dance.

742
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:10,147
Honey...

743
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:12,970
I need to know if you saw him last night.

744
00:41:26,011 --> 00:41:28,139
you got Wallace.
leave a message.

745
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,100
I screwed up, Wallace.

746
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:34,623
I didn't mean to let you down.
I just...

747
00:41:36,843 --> 00:41:38,719
I can't lose another friend.

748
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:41,509
Please call me back.

749
00:41:57,911 --> 00:42:02,770
