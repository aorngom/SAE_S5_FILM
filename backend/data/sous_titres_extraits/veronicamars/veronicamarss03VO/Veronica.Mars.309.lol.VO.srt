1
00:00:01,272 --> 00:00:03,663
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:03,664 --> 00:00:04,271
What the hell, Bonnie?!

3
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:06,253
Another cute frat boy.
What the hell?

4
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:08,270
I was never gonna tell
anyone about your...

5
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:10,310
situation with
the dean's wife.

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,869
The whole motel was
going up in flames.

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,374
We had to get out of there.

8
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,373
You didn't stick
around to try to help?

9
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:18,097
You didn't see if
everyone was okay?

10
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:24,888
I'm on my way to vote.

11
00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:26,558
Fate of the Greeks
in my hands, and all.

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,778
How are they faring?

13
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,527
"Screw 'em."
They're out of here.

14
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,307
Someone raped me!

15
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,839
The Hearst rapist has
everyone on edge.

16
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:43,171
[Right here right now - Fatboy Slim]

17
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:46,667
Right here right now...

18
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,534
You seen Veronica?

19
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:58,102
Not in a while.

20
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:15,381
Wallace!

21
00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:16,668
Piz, help!

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,590
Veronica Mars

23
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:36,591
3x09 "Spit and Eggs"

24
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:52,352
Vieni a trovarci!

25
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:56,353
veronicamars.it

26
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:03,117
TWO DAYS EARLIER

27
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:04,633
Na - na, hey hey...

28
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:06,868
Goodbye!

29
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,534
Na na na na.
Na na na na.

30
00:02:10,535 --> 00:02:14,121
Hey, hey...
Goodbye!

31
00:02:14,122 --> 00:02:17,326
If the Lilith House's mission was
to protect women on campus,

32
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:20,056
I'm not sure this display
is doing the trick.

33
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,014
Sure, the Board of Trustees voted
to dismantle the Greek system,

34
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:25,069
but there's still
a rapist at large.

35
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,416
That hasn't changed.

36
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:28,571
Sponduly!

37
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,136
Ah. So the boy can still smile.

38
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:37,809
Seems like a week
since I've seen his teeth.

39
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:41,694
Hey, handsome.

40
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:42,180
Shh!

41
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:44,355
Not in front of the old man.
He's the jealous type.

42
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:45,695
Hey.

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,917
Hello Dick!

44
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:51,543
I can't believe they got
such a perfect likeness.

45
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,551
Did you actually model for them?

46
00:02:53,552 --> 00:02:54,684
Yeah, you know,

47
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:57,040
that reminds me, they left
out one important detail.

48
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:58,673
Excusez-moi.

49
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:07,424
Take a picture, ladies.
It'll last longer.

50
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:15,550
Great job, Dick.

51
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:17,331
I'm sure you won that debate.

52
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:18,979
Well, he's a master debater.

53
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:20,961
You two kiss, hold hands,

54
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:22,188
head to the soda
shop for some malts.

55
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:23,262
I'm out of here.

56
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:27,880
Okay. Don't try and stop me.

57
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:32,515
You weren't outside my
criminology class. I waited.

58
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:34,607
Yeah.

59
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,182
Something wrong?

60
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,141
I can't do this anymore, Veronica.

61
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:47,668
You know, I've been thinking, and...

62
00:03:49,732 --> 00:03:51,157
This isn't working.

63
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:54,804
I don't think I quite measure up...

64
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:56,725
to the person that
you want me to be,

65
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:01,137
and I just can't take feeling
like a disappointment anymore.

66
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:04,402
- Logan, I don't-
- Hey, let me get this out, okay?

67
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:06,753
The other thing...

68
00:04:06,754 --> 00:04:09,294
you told me you weren't
built to let people help you.

69
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:12,575
- That's not exactly what I said.
- It's close.

70
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:13,955
And you know what?

71
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:16,293
I'm not built to
stand on the sidelines.

72
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,143
I don't know, I think
we have a choice.

73
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,387
And I think we can take a tough...

74
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:28,811
but survivable amount of pain now...

75
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:33,186
or stay together...

76
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:35,422
and deal with
unbearable pain later.

77
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:40,160
So, I vote for the pain now.

78
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:45,126
But I'm always here...

79
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:48,788
If you need anything.

80
00:04:55,537 --> 00:04:57,366
But you never need anything.

81
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:11,228
Yeah, but heavyweights weren't
always a freak show, man.

82
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:14,137
Ali, Frazier, those were
fighters, you know?

83
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,121
Just seems nowadays...

84
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:18,047
All the talent's in the
lower weight classes.

85
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:19,128
You're so right.

86
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:20,969
The average fight fan?
He doesn't care.

87
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,338
You should be good.

88
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,691
You gonna test it?

89
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,437
Hot damn, I'm back in business.

90
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:29,060
What would I do if
you ever left me?

91
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:31,734
Call human resources and
have them send a replacement?

92
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,516
It's just a guess.

93
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:34,854
Listen, you don't have high-def yet.

94
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:36,777
I'll swing by when
the receiver gets in.

95
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:38,201
Page me if it goes out again.

96
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:39,518
Thanks Eli.

97
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:45,854
Oh, hard at work, I see.

98
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:47,626
This job is easy.

99
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:48,898
To what do I owe the pleasure?

100
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,240
I brought you the minivan.

101
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,564
You're gonna have to haul
around Gram's drums tonight.

102
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:56,707
Just got called up to Sacramento
to meet with Helm's people.

103
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,051
Can't they send Wally?

104
00:05:58,052 --> 00:05:59,148
Wally's going, too.

105
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,925
I need the Volvo keys.

106
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:02,979
Gonna be bored.

107
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,001
I may be forced to
speak to our children.

108
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:08,306
Oh, remind them of
how things used to be.

109
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:09,543
They love that.

110
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:13,288
I'll be home tomorrow by noon. Okay?

111
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:15,463
You can order pizza, can't you?

112
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:17,167
I'm sure someone will show me.

113
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:21,064
Dean O'Dell, I'm
sorry for interrupting.

114
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:22,076
What is it?

115
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:25,086
I have a man waiting for you
who doesn't have an appointment.

116
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,095
He won't give me his
name or put out his cigar.

117
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:28,215
Is that so?

118
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,210
Cyrus.

119
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:35,667
We need to talk.

120
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:37,529
So, Mel...

121
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,852
what can I help you with?

122
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:42,320
You know what I liked best about
my days here at Hearst, Cyrus?

123
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:44,792
A quality education?

124
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:48,262
No.

125
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,680
It was hanging out on the
front porch of my frat,

126
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,119
watching the girls go by,

127
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:54,599
drinking beer.

128
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,903
I had such a good
time here at Hearst,

129
00:06:56,904 --> 00:06:58,992
in fact, that I've been very
generous over the years.

130
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:01,521
Wouldn't you say
I've been generous?

131
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:06,873
Here you go.

132
00:07:15,763 --> 00:07:16,648
Veronica.

133
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:17,646
I'm fine.

134
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,971
- I know. We know.
- Nobody said you weren't.

135
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,176
- But it's okay if you're not.
- You're Veronica Mars.

136
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:21,447
I'm fine, seriously.

137
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,482
I just told the two of you 'cause I...

138
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:25,089
I figured you should know.

139
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,649
I'm not looking
for a pity party.

140
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,334
That's good.

141
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:29,561
I always get stuck
blowing up the pity balloons.

142
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:32,214
Is there anything that
we can do for you?

143
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:33,322
Nope.

144
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:35,412
I... we're done with this topic.

145
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,660
I just shared some info.

146
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:37,720
Moving on.

147
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:39,911
Hey, gang. What's the word?

148
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:41,520
Is it "avuncular"?

149
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,097
No?

150
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:44,133
Just a shot in the dark.

151
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:45,565
Hey, set your dials
to K-Ruff tonight.

152
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,029
I mean, we're already
moving on as to what to do...

153
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,649
with the whole Greek Row
ghost town next semester.

154
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,807
I got this one guy
coming on the show,

155
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:53,522
want to turn it into an
ROTC training battlefield.

156
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:55,306
Quality radio, people.

157
00:07:57,098 --> 00:07:58,197
What?

158
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:03,028
You say your wife doesn't
kiss you like she used to?

159
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:04,542
I know how it sounds, Keith.

160
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,208
How long you been married?

161
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,197
Six years.

162
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:09,484
Simply sounds normal, Cyrus.

163
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:11,438
I'm sure everything's fine.

164
00:08:12,227 --> 00:08:14,829
Still, I'd like to be able
to shake this feeling.

165
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,704
She's on the 4:30 to Sacramento.

166
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,417
She is, as she usually is,

167
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:21,417
travelling with her
associate, Wally Wornkey.

168
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:22,180
He's handsome,

169
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:24,211
he's a bit more
age-appropriate for my wife,

170
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:27,740
and I've seen him wipe Ranch dressing
from her chin at a faculty function.

171
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,468
Will you take the case, Keith?

172
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,461
Hey, there you are.

173
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:40,269
Going somewhere?

174
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,614
Oh, very good, number-one daughter.

175
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:44,635
You might make a detective yet.

176
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,789
I'm off to Sacramento.

177
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,744
Husband thinks his wife is
fooling around in capital city.

178
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,645
Here's my hotel information.

179
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:54,621
You all right, honey?

180
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:58,112
Logan and I broke up.

181
00:08:58,113 --> 00:08:59,690
I'm sorry to hear that.

182
00:09:00,512 --> 00:09:01,709
Are you okay?

183
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,575
I can put off this assignment.

184
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,997
No, you go. I'm fine.

185
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:07,833
Just kind of unexpected.

186
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,234
You sure?

187
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:10,616
Go.

188
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,142
Honey?

189
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,313
Go!

190
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,588
We're back and we're
talking about Greek Row.

191
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,589
Jennifer?

192
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,884
Dean O'Dell refused to
even read our proposal...

193
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,236
to turn one of the
deserted Greek houses...

194
00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:57,988
into a residence for
devoutly Christian students.

195
00:09:57,989 --> 00:09:59,848
Had I been lobbying on behalf...

196
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,462
of the African American
students or gay students,

197
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:04,791
would I have been dismissed
out of hand like that?

198
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:05,971
No Way.

199
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:09,784
As always, we have an empty
chair here for Dean O'Dell,

200
00:10:09,785 --> 00:10:12,417
should he ever accept We Were
Just Talking's standing invitation...

201
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:13,966
to join us on-air
and defend himself.

202
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:15,798
Lieutenant McGee, you
have a radical plan...

203
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,208
for what should become
of the Greek houses.

204
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:20,433
Which one of these is mine?

205
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:22,874
T- take that one.

206
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:28,179
And like magic, we have our
illustrious dean here with us.

207
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,775
Dean O'Dell, What
do you got for us?

208
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:31,434
I felt it was imperative...

209
00:10:31,435 --> 00:10:34,247
to get this news out as quickly
as possible to the student body.

210
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:37,177
It was recently discovered that one
of our Board of Trustees members...

211
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,118
who voted to abolish the
Greek system at Hearst...

212
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:43,674
owns property currently leased
by several of the Greek houses.

213
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:45,421
Due to this conflict of interest,

214
00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:47,439
his vote has been nullified.

215
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:49,840
Hearst Charter dictates...

216
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:51,758
that the dean
of the university...

217
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,356
is allowed to cast the,
uh, dissenting vote...

218
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:56,657
in just such an occurrence,

219
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:59,873
and I voted to retain
the Greek system.

220
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:03,734
Thank you for your
time. That is all.

221
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,037
Uh, all righty, then.

222
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:11,999
The Greeks are back.
Let's go to the phones.

223
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:23,329
Yeah! What's up, girls?

224
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:28,512
[Have you never been mellow
- Olivia Newton-John]

225
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:32,384
Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried...

226
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:42,750
Have you never been happy...

227
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:47,208
...just to hear your song?

228
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:53,053
Have you never let
someone else be strong?

229
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:01,557
Rapist!
Traitor!

230
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:04,782
Rapist! Rapist!

231
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:11,576
Running around as you do...

232
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:15,830
...with your head
up in the clouds...

233
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,542
Get me a roster of all the
women of Lilith House.

234
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:21,009
You have a guest. I told him
that without an appointment-

235
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,752
Keith,

236
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,062
come right in.

237
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:26,903
Have a seat.

238
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:27,904
Thanks.

239
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:33,303
So... what you got?

240
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:35,455
Only good news.

241
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:37,246
You have nothing to worry
about except, perhaps,

242
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,002
your apparent lack of gaydar.

243
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,566
I don't know what that is.

244
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:41,992
Wally Wornkey's gay.

245
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:44,498
Your wife spent the
night in her room alone,

246
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:47,266
and Wally, on the other
hand, visited, in succession,

247
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:51,288
the Boathouse, Oilcan
Harry's, and Taboo.

248
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:53,775
Let's both just forget that
I ever doubted my wife.

249
00:12:53,776 --> 00:12:55,249
Consider it forgotten.

250
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:58,317
You need to see this.
I circled it.

251
00:12:58,318 --> 00:12:59,108
What is it?

252
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:01,678
It's a classified ad warning
the student body to...

253
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,512
stay away from the Pi Sig party.

254
00:13:03,578 --> 00:13:06,570
"I'll choose my next victim at
the Pi Sig party tomorrow night.

255
00:13:06,571 --> 00:13:08,074
You've been warned."

256
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:13,586
Veronica!

257
00:13:13,587 --> 00:13:14,948
Hey, come here.

258
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:19,097
"I'll choose my next
victim at the Pi Sig party"?

259
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,245
The rapist is getting cocky.

260
00:13:21,246 --> 00:13:21,921
Yeah.

261
00:13:21,922 --> 00:13:24,962
Or Nish just wants to scare
girls away from the frat blow-out.

262
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:26,253
If that was the plan,

263
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:27,700
I don't think it's working.

264
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:30,529
We probably had a hundred
girls stop by and pick up these.

265
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:32,307
Coasters?

266
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:33,388
Special coasters.

267
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:35,787
You pour a drop of
your drink on them,

268
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:38,907
and they'll turn red if there's
any GHB or Rohypnol in it.

269
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:40,533
You mind if I take
a bunch of these?

270
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:41,923
Planning on tying one on?

271
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:43,996
You can test ten
drinks on one card.

272
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:46,749
I suddenly find myself
with free time and...

273
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,921
in need of a project.

274
00:13:47,998 --> 00:13:49,771
You do get one of these, as well,

275
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:51,277
a rape whistle.

276
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:54,687
You actually think people
would come a-running, huh?

277
00:13:55,227 --> 00:13:58,614
You have more faith in
mankind than I do, my friend.

278
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:02,640
What's it do?

279
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,409
It turns red if there's a
date-rape drug in the drink.

280
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:08,561
You should require the Pi Sigs
make them available at the party.

281
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:09,792
I think I will.

282
00:14:10,118 --> 00:14:11,399
Cora,

283
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:13,920
track down Chip Diller for me.

284
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:16,035
I poked around at
the newspaper office.

285
00:14:16,036 --> 00:14:18,545
No explanation on how the
ad made it into the paper.

286
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,223
They think it was
changed at the printer's.

287
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:21,999
You're a credit to
the college, my dear.

288
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:23,022
Well...

289
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:24,626
aren't you warm and cuddly...

290
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:27,090
for being the most
reviled man on campus?

291
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:29,759
My life doesn't begin and
end at the university.

292
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,004
My wife's getting back
from Sacramento today,

293
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,532
and I've got something special planned.

294
00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:38,456
Sacramento?

295
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:40,892
What an enlightening weekend I had.

296
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:42,387
You learn a lot about people...

297
00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:44,464
when you read their "Plan
a Perfect Murder" papers.

298
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,901
I must say,

299
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:48,539
I'm a little frightened to
appear before you today,

300
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,400
and it's not just that a good
half-dozen of you offed me.

301
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:54,238
A chain saw, Biggles?

302
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:55,447
Really?

303
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:56,638
Let's see.

304
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,927
We got rid of a full score of
ex-girlfriends and ex-boyfriends,

305
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:01,521
the local sheriff bit the dust,

306
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:04,962
and several of you decided to
turn yourselves into only children.

307
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:07,867
As to how perfect your
perfect murders were,

308
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:09,724
eh, the results fell pretty
naturally into a bell curve.

309
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,724
Didn't even have to adjust.

310
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:14,364
I will be posting the three A
papers on the class website...

311
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:16,463
so you can see examples
of what I am looking for.

312
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:19,133
For those of you who
got A's, congratulations.

313
00:15:20,015 --> 00:15:21,575
You can get away with murder.

314
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:25,578
Tim?

315
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:28,957
Okay, but you should know,

316
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,261
if you're gonna make me wait,

317
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,222
I'm gonna pore over your
creepy rape-investigation board.

318
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,432
What's this?

319
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:37,439
Dick, Chip Diller,

320
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,268
and what's his face?

321
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:42,954
Can I help you find something?

322
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:46,327
What's with the circled Pi Sigs?

323
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:47,656
Are you onto something?

324
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:48,705
Did I miss something?

325
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:49,840
Are we working together now?

326
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:52,038
Are we Starsky and Butch?

327
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,187
Cagney and Pastey.

328
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:55,977
I think I'll keep my findings to myself.

329
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:57,887
When I solve it,

330
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:01,006
I want Dr. Landry to
know where credit's due.

331
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:04,353
And here I thought we
were trying to protect girls.

332
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:05,040
Huh.

333
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,059
Then you...

334
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,869
want to share your
working theories with me?

335
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:12,299
Excellent.

336
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:14,266
Now, about your paper,

337
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:16,405
I- I wanted to give
you the opportunity...

338
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:19,909
to fix some of these syntax
and book marking errors...

339
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,320
before I post it online.

340
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:22,596
Ah, Veronica,

341
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:24,784
have you met my girlfriend?

342
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:26,948
Hi.

343
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:28,253
Have we met?

344
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,411
I don't think so.

345
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,755
So Tim Foyle's girlfriend likes
Dick and sundry other Pi Sigs.

346
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:40,530
So what, if anything,
does that mean?

347
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:46,151
Soup?

348
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:47,412
You know how
I feel about soup.

349
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:48,389
It's a side dish.

350
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,063
There's a meat
loaf in the oven.

351
00:16:50,064 --> 00:16:51,823
Now we're talking.

352
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:56,928
Dad, you know that case
you took up in Sacramento?

353
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:57,996
Yeah.

354
00:16:57,997 --> 00:16:58,899
False alarm.

355
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,532
I got to deliver
good news for once.

356
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:02,790
Dean O'Dell's wife
is cheating on him...

357
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,236
with Dr. Landry, my
criminology professor.

358
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:07,422
- And how'd you-
- I dropped by his office.

359
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:09,763
He told me his wife just
got in from Sacramento.

360
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:11,433
Two and two.

361
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:12,220
And how'd you-

362
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:14,363
I saw the two of them together
at the Neptune Grand.

363
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:17,028
He checks in under the
pseudonym Rory Finch.

364
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:18,393
You should double-check, but...

365
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:20,013
I'm certain it's true.

366
00:17:20,602 --> 00:17:21,831
Are you gonna tell him?

367
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:24,238
You know the rules,
honey. I have to.

368
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:36,527
I don't exactly know
how to put this.

369
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:40,061
It's the sort of thing that makes
me hate being a resident advisor,

370
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:41,238
but I have to ask.

371
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:44,097
Someone has been leaving a surprise...

372
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:46,825
in the third stall every day
for the past two weeks.

373
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:50,016
This person apparently
never learned how to flush,

374
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:52,373
and it's my amateur
medical opinion that...

375
00:17:52,374 --> 00:17:55,402
he's also suffering from what
must be a terminal disease.

376
00:17:56,736 --> 00:17:57,615
So?

377
00:17:57,616 --> 00:17:58,940
Not guilty, man.

378
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,603
Third stall stage
right or stage left?

379
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,692
Stage right.

380
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:06,293
Yeah, not guilty, either.

381
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:09,676
Howdy, boys.

382
00:18:09,677 --> 00:18:12,615
Anyone up for going
to a Pi Sig blow-out?

383
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,274

384
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:19,076
and other stuff

385

390

We were already
planning on going.

391
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:31,048
I think everybody at
Hearst is gonna be there.

392
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,038
Awesome.

393

Then you can help me out.

394

What about you?
Moe, are you going?

396
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,210
Sort of.

397
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:42,247
I'm driving the Take-Back-the-Night
cart for the early shift.

398

399

Here's my number.

400
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:50,235

girls who are beyond drunk...

401
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:52,773
or shady guys lurking around.

402
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:53,831
Sure.

403
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:55,113
Excellent.

Sounds fun, right?

413
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:12,455
Will they let me in?

414
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:15,091
I think all the glitter has come
off my porn star tube top.

415
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:17,565
Please, Mac. I could
really use the help.

416
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:26,836
Resistance is futile.

417
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:31,546
Thanks for coming in
on a Saturday, Cora.

418
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,024
Here's to a better
week next week.

419
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,418
Night, Cyrus.

420
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:47,877
I've highlighted the cell phone calls
they've made to each other,

421
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:51,329
as well as the numerous charges
made to Professor Landry...

422
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,648
at the Neptune Grand.

423
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:57,156
He always checked in under
the pseudonym Rory Finch...

424
00:19:57,157 --> 00:19:58,986
and paid cash for the room but...

425
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,238
charged drinks
at the bar and...

426
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,932
dinner at the restaurant.

427
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,236
Those dates mean
anything to you?

428
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,885
If I recall correctly,

429
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:11,855
these coincide with the nights
of Mindy's junior league meetings.

430
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,949
So, here's the plan.

431
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,545
Do your own thing
at the party, but...

432
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,795
if you see a girl
who looks out of it,

433
00:20:33,796 --> 00:20:34,927
sneak up to her drink,

434
00:20:34,928 --> 00:20:36,487
dip the coaster in,
see if it turns red.

435
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:38,447
If it does,
the drink is dosed.

436
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:40,770
If you see a really cute girl
and you want to dance with her?

437
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:41,855
Dance.

438
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:43,335
Just know that your libido...

439
00:20:43,336 --> 00:20:44,745
caused some girl to get raped.

440
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:46,598

the fun out of it.

about giving you the little...

spot the difference.

whether drinks are wet.

There you go, Bambi.

484

If it turns red, he's
trying to rape you.

If it doesn't,

486
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,325
he still might be
trying to rape you.

00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:21,243
A refill.

539
00:25:21,631 --> 00:25:23,957
It seemed a much
shorter distance earlier.

540
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:26,150
What's the rest of
your evening entail?

541
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,706
Passing out on this couch.

542
00:25:27,707 --> 00:25:29,088
All right, then.

543
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:32,070
They warned me, Keith.

544
00:25:32,593 --> 00:25:34,294
"She's much too young for you."

545
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:36,619
Keith, no!

546
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:41,163
Do you know what
you're holding?

547
00:25:41,983 --> 00:25:43,268
A bottle of scotch.

548
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:46,061
That's a forty-year-old
bottle of Glen Cracken.

549
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,755
One of the chief joys
of my existence...

550
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:51,907
is the anticipation of tasting
the contents of that bottle.

551
00:25:51,908 --> 00:25:53,145
But for tonight,

552
00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:54,563
I'm just getting drunk.

553
00:25:55,707 --> 00:25:56,926
Pour me the swill.

554
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:02,358
[Thank The Lord For The Night Time
- Neil Diamond]

555
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:06,757
It seems like just one time
I'm feelin' cool...

556
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:09,290
Thank the lord for
the night time...

557
00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:12,142
Yeah?

558
00:26:12,143 --> 00:26:13,931
Ah, is that your friend?

559
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:18,625
So?

560
00:26:18,626 --> 00:26:19,857
You think she's okay?

561
00:26:20,103 --> 00:26:22,002
We called the Safe-
Ride-Home people already.

562
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,933
Look, there they are.

563
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:25,248
Happy?

564
00:26:28,948 --> 00:26:30,031
Hey, guys.

565
00:26:30,677 --> 00:26:32,424
Mind helping us
out with this one?

566
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:34,992
Yeah, no sweat.
We got it. Here.

567
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,528
Nice way to take
care of your friend.

568
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,074
Don't mind her.

569
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:43,909
She's always like that.

570
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:50,386
Sure I can't give
you a ride home?

571
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:51,721
What's the point?

572
00:26:51,722 --> 00:26:54,193
My wife has a junior
league meeting tonight.

573
00:26:54,228 --> 00:26:55,260
Ha!

574
00:26:55,813 --> 00:26:57,056
I'll just sleep here.

575
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,105
Tim Foyle?

576
00:27:31,106 --> 00:27:32,106
Here?

577
00:27:32,107 --> 00:27:33,146
This can't be good.

578
00:27:36,428 --> 00:27:37,604
That's it, Bonnie.

579
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:38,835
I've had enough!

580
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:40,379
I've known about all of them.

581
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,977
I've known about every
knuckle-dragging frat boy...

582
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:44,222
you've given a free ride,

583
00:27:44,223 --> 00:27:45,355
but guess what.

584
00:27:45,378 --> 00:27:47,912
I wasn't sitting
back and taking it.

585
00:27:47,913 --> 00:27:48,949
Not at all!

586
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,701
For every guy you were with,

587
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,872
I was with someone new myself.

588
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:54,986
Did you think
I didn't know?

589
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:58,358
I know everything!

590
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:07,620
Looks like I'm single.

591
00:28:26,729 --> 00:28:28,326
Hey, Veronica.

592
00:28:28,563 --> 00:28:29,537
Hey.

593
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:30,937
Hey.

594
00:28:35,018 --> 00:28:37,619
Okay.
You two have fun.

595
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,182
You don't have to go, Mercer.

596
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:40,291
I'm just saying hi.

597
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:42,753
Be that as it may, they're turning
my show on after the band.

598
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,731
Hope you brought
your dancin' shoes.

599
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:47,507
Let me guess.

600
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:48,903
You're here because
of the investigation.

601
00:28:48,904 --> 00:28:50,148
I am what I am.

602
00:28:50,324 --> 00:28:51,438
- Hey!
- We got a positive.

603
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:53,266
Positive what?

604
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:55,022
This cup was dosed
with a date-rape drug.

605
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:56,897
It belongs to some Kim Kaiser.

606
00:28:56,898 --> 00:28:57,979
So where's Kim Kaiser?

607
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,276
We asked for her.
N- no one's seen her,

608
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:00,421
but we found someone
who knows where she lives.

609
00:29:00,422 --> 00:29:01,559
She's off campus by the marina,

610
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,135
uh, the Harbour View Apartments.

611
00:29:03,136 --> 00:29:05,306
All four girls were raped
in their own rooms.

612
00:29:05,307 --> 00:29:06,507
We've got to get there.

613
00:29:06,508 --> 00:29:07,830
I parked on campus and walked.

614
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,068
Who's got the closest car?

615
00:29:09,069 --> 00:29:10,531
I do, but you're
staying here. I'll go.

616
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:13,389
- If you think-
- Veronica, please. Let me do this part.

617
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,148
Okay, go.
Be careful.

618
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:17,200
I'll go with you.

619
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:20,339
Get her out of her apartment.

620
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:32,765
That's all for us tonight, people.

621
00:29:32,766 --> 00:29:34,516
Club Flush is up next.

622
00:29:35,736 --> 00:29:38,703
Hi, uh, we're looking
for Kim Kaiser.

623
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:40,817
We think she's been
given a date-rape drug.

624
00:29:40,852 --> 00:29:42,685
If you've seen her or
you're friends with her,

625
00:29:42,686 --> 00:29:43,864
please come find me.

626
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,326
I'll be right in
front of the stage.

627
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,246
Don't go.

628
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:52,238
I've got crème brûlée
arriving any second.

629
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:53,835
You know, maybe someday...

630
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:56,342
we'll have sex and
you won't be stoned.

631
00:29:56,775 --> 00:29:59,742
I swear I'm having an
affair with Annie Hall.

632
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:23,522
Mind if I come in?

633
00:30:36,845 --> 00:30:38,520
Are you the girl
looking for Kim?

634
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:40,008
Because Kim didn't
come to the party.

635
00:30:40,358 --> 00:30:42,090
I saw her drink cup.

636
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:44,746
She lent her ID to
her little sister, Carrie.

637
00:30:45,106 --> 00:30:46,399
Where's Carrie?

638
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,726
She wasn't feeling good.

639
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:49,489
She was walking
back to her room.

640
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,515
Which dorm?

641
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,575
Benes Hall.

642
00:30:51,576 --> 00:30:53,144
You think she's all right?

643
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,405
Line one. You're first caller.

644
00:30:54,406 --> 00:30:55,763
What do you want to hear?

645
00:30:55,764 --> 00:30:57,395
Yeah, man, you got
any Chicks on Speed?

646
00:30:57,396 --> 00:31:00,072
Always, my friend, always.

647
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:13,556
We just got a call, said a
bomb was gonna go off...

648
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:15,154
at one of the residential
halls up at Hearst.

649
00:31:15,155 --> 00:31:16,771
Should we evacuate it?

650
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:17,772
It's nothing.

651
00:31:17,773 --> 00:31:19,628
Happens all the
time around finals.

652
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:21,390
Let the Hearst police handle it.

653
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:22,904
It's their jurisdiction.

654
00:31:24,088 --> 00:31:25,741
Maybe I should
ask the sheriff.

655
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:29,960
You want to call
and wake him up?

656
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:51,218
Unicorns, really?

657
00:31:52,587 --> 00:31:55,561
Well, we'll definitely be
needing some mood music.

658
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:58,638
[Right here right now
- Fatboy Slim]

659
00:31:58,673 --> 00:32:00,509
You know, techno
has a bad reputation,

660
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,785
but I think it's undeserved.

661
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,938
Groan if you disagree.

662
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:05,874
Good.

663
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,080
We're on the same page.

664
00:32:24,493 --> 00:32:26,400
It's unfortunate that
when you wake up,

665
00:32:26,401 --> 00:32:28,042
all you'll know is that
your hair is gone...

666
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:31,474
because it's gonna be good.

667
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:34,208
I'd wager your best ever.

668
00:32:34,754 --> 00:32:37,126
And it's a me thing,
I'm sorry to say.

669
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:39,120
I have no patience.

670
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:41,895
I mean, if I'd met you
in a bar or at a party,

671
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:43,058
I would have had
you back here...

672
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:44,942
and on your back in an hour.

673
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,744
But that's an hour of my life...

674
00:32:48,745 --> 00:32:50,018
I would have never had back,

675
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:52,408
an hour of listening to you talk...

676
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:55,126
about unicorns and...

677
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:56,625
your high-school boyfriend...

678
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:59,605
and how you hate
the taste of beer.

679
00:33:02,621 --> 00:33:06,025
I'm just taking what you
would have happily given.

680
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:09,147
I mean, that's hardly a crime. I-

681
00:33:17,585 --> 00:33:18,472
What the he-

682
00:33:30,848 --> 00:33:32,202
Help!

683
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:34,756
What are you doing
here, Veronica?

684
00:33:34,757 --> 00:33:36,200
No one invited you.

685
00:33:40,531 --> 00:33:42,583
What am I gonna do with you?

686
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,837
That's my face, you bitch!

687
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:54,602
Oh, come back here, Veronica.

688
00:33:54,603 --> 00:33:56,821
Let's fix that hair of yours.

689
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:39,855
Wallace,

690
00:34:39,856 --> 00:34:42,195
Piz! help!

691
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,732
Veronica, are you okay?

692
00:34:54,087 --> 00:34:57,690
It's Mercer.
Mercer's the rapist.

693
00:35:00,677 --> 00:35:02,879
Room 212 Benes hall.

694
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,417
Get here as fast as you can.

695
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:06,002
There's been an attempted rape,

696
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,712
and the rapist may still be in the room.

697
00:35:07,713 --> 00:35:09,645
Hurry, please.

698
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:11,803
They're on their way.

699
00:35:11,804 --> 00:35:13,519
The girl, Carrie Kaiser,

700
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,965
she's still in the room.
We can't wait.

701
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:17,702
I'll get a bunch of guys
and go down there.

702
00:35:17,703 --> 00:35:19,086
Stay in here.

703
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:20,210
You'll be safe.

704
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,985
Dad, pick up.

705
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:53,226
Hi, this is Keith Mars.

706
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:55,262
Please leave your
message after the tone.

707
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:30,317
You said she was here, Moe.

708
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:31,463
She was.

709
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:40,079
You let her get away, Moe?

710
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,548
I'm sorry, sir.

711
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,176
I don't care that
you're sorry.

712
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:50,780
Dad, help.

713
00:37:51,463 --> 00:37:52,802
Get the phone.

714
00:37:58,289 --> 00:37:59,340
Shut up!

715
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:01,637
Stop blubbering, prisoner.

716
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:03,250
What are we
gonna do with her?

717
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:04,275
I'm thinking.

718
00:38:04,276 --> 00:38:05,453
We're gonna get caught.

719
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:07,481
Shut up.

720
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:08,902
We're not gonna get caught.

721
00:38:08,903 --> 00:38:09,940
Give me all the GHB
you've got left.

722
00:38:09,941 --> 00:38:11,055
We'll get it down her throat.

723
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:13,053
She won't remember last
year, let alone last night.

724
00:38:13,054 --> 00:38:14,745
I'm out of it. No.

725
00:38:14,946 --> 00:38:16,688
Then watch her.

726
00:38:16,689 --> 00:38:18,025
I'll go to my room.
I got plenty.

727
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,834
Hey, there.
Uh, Parker, is it?

728
00:38:48,835 --> 00:38:49,858
Going somewhere?

729
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:51,204
Uh, yeah, as a
matter of fact.

730
00:38:51,322 --> 00:38:52,384
Where is she?

731
00:38:52,385 --> 00:38:53,390
Uh, excuse me.

732
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:54,391
Rape!

733
00:38:54,392 --> 00:38:56,512
Rape! Rape! Rape!

734
00:38:56,513 --> 00:38:58,056
I just touched you.

735
00:38:58,057 --> 00:38:59,524
Buddy, what's up?

736
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:01,473
Mercer, what's going on?

737
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:02,607
Who blew that whistle?

738
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:03,670
Mercer, what do we do?

739
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:04,805
What happened
to your leg, man?

740
00:39:04,806 --> 00:39:07,063
Pet cougar, all right?

741
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:09,000
Look, show's over,
people, okay?

742
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:10,201
Moe, shut up and
get in your room.

743
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:11,567
Good night, everyone.

744
00:39:11,568 --> 00:39:12,668
Sweet dreams.

745
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,542
What are you looking at?

746
00:39:15,543 --> 00:39:17,583
You got someone
in your room, Moe?

747
00:39:18,324 --> 00:39:19,436
Mercer?

748
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:22,247
All right, you all have fun, okay?

749
00:39:22,248 --> 00:39:23,340
I'm out of here.

750
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:26,886
She's just a psycho,
and you're all falling for it.

751
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,014
Mercer, where are you going?

752
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:30,168
Mercer!

753
00:39:32,216 --> 00:39:33,329
Are you okay?

754
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,506
Yeah.

755
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:39,057
Oh, my God, Veronica.

756
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:40,445
Oh, my God.

757
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:08,338
What are you doing here?

758
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:10,479
When a bomb threat's phoned in,

759
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,777
you evacuate the building.

760
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:13,075
That's procedure, Sacks.

761
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:14,194
Sorry, Keith.

762
00:40:14,195 --> 00:40:15,594
I'm taking my daughter home now.

763
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:19,015
Sheriff Lamb's on his way in.
He wanted to talk to her.

764
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:21,521
I called you from Moe's phone.

765
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:23,789
You've got his number
saved on your phone now.

766
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,993
He's not smart
enough to turn it off.

767
00:40:46,303 --> 00:40:48,531
Your ride back to
Neptune is here, boys.

768
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,107
I suggest you don't give me
any more reason to shoot you.

769
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:55,651
Moe was the setup man.

770
00:40:55,652 --> 00:40:57,116
He'd dose the victims,

771
00:40:57,117 --> 00:40:58,781
then call Mercer with
the room number...

772
00:40:58,782 --> 00:41:01,014
and give him the master
keys he needed to get in.

773
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:03,590
Moe was the one who
shaved me in the parking lot.

774
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:06,151
I don't think he ever
planned on raping me.

775
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:08,363
He was just providing
an alibi for Mercer.

776
00:41:08,364 --> 00:41:09,921
Well, what did the Pi Sigs
have to do with it?

777
00:41:09,922 --> 00:41:10,922
Nothing,

778
00:41:10,923 --> 00:41:12,683
just nights Moe and
Mercer could be sure...

779
00:41:12,684 --> 00:41:14,188
there'd be plenty of drunk girls,

780
00:41:14,189 --> 00:41:16,500
plus a convenient scapegoat.

781
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,796
Has Logan been by?

782
00:41:18,797 --> 00:41:20,301
I haven't seen him.

783
00:42:06,963 --> 00:42:08,963
