1
00:00:00,671 --> 00:00:02,704
Previously on Veronica Mars...

2
00:00:02,705 --> 00:00:05,017
How many women like me had to be raped

3
00:00:05,018 --> 00:00:07,718
have to end up like
this, their heads shaved

4
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:10,310
before this administration
listens to our demands.

5
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:13,661
Shut down the fraternity houses!

6
00:00:14,617 --> 00:00:16,162
Parker's in there with some guy.

7
00:00:16,497 --> 00:00:18,097
Don't mind me.

8
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:22,631
I thought it was just sex.

9
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:26,568
It didn't occur to me that
it was against your will.

10
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:31,124
Thanks, Veronica. Thanks for
thinking I'm the slut of the world.

11
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:33,446
This is a bad idea.

12
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:34,404
No, it's not.

13
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:36,514
You only thinks it's not
'cause you came up with it.

14
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:38,490
Ergo, how could it be bad?

15
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:42,433
Math, sweetie. Me plus idea equals good.

16
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:54,250
You were expecting Sidney Poitier?

17
00:00:57,381 --> 00:01:00,389
No jokes. No innuendoes, no quips.

18
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,337
Don't even think of alluding
to having seen me naked

19
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:06,601
or having touched any part of my
body that does not have fingers.

20
00:01:06,602 --> 00:01:08,798
Can I mention that my eyes adored you?

21
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,195
I got it.

22
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,521
No calling you bobcat,
no talk of milky thighs.

23
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:14,707
Go home!

24
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,702
Veronica, I won't say anything bad.

25
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:30,201
So, how's school going, Logan?

26
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,192
Well, I'm actually not hating it.

27
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:34,699
My grades aren't exactly...

28
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,800
Oh, Hearst took him in late
because of his high test scores.

29
00:01:37,857 --> 00:01:39,529
Oh, what classes are you taking?

30
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,882
Where is this going?

31
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:44,863
My end game is to find out
what classes Logan is taking.

32
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:48,097
Just core stuff, you know,
sociology, freshman comp.

33
00:01:48,698 --> 00:01:51,272
Mass com, which is
kinda coming in handy.

34
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,296
You know, apparently being the
offspring of a murderer doesn't get old.

35
00:01:56,087 --> 00:01:58,150
I'm getting all these
interview requests.

36
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,222
Larry King wants me to
come on with O.J.'s kids.

37
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:02,385
Oh, you thinking about it?

38
00:02:02,386 --> 00:02:03,220
No.

39
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:04,021
Why's that?

40
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:05,215
Time out!

41
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:08,653
Can we stay in the shallow end, please?

42
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:13,413
I'm sorry. I think it's a good call.
I was just curious as to your reasons.

43
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:16,139
I didn't realise I had to
have the conversation vetted.

44
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,217
I would've been happy to veto
questions for you ahead of time.

45
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:20,572
Mmm, that would've been nice, huh?

46
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,532
We could've packed a
lunch and made a day of it.

47
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,335
Missed opportunity, if you ask me.

48
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:26,265
A mistake you can learn from.

49
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:29,028
What then exactly am I
allowed to ask Logan about?

50
00:02:31,457 --> 00:02:33,104
Hobbies?

51
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:36,423
Surfing?

52
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:37,720
What's the attraction?

53
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:39,224
Don't answer that.

54
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:50,441
Mac's in Bakersfield.
Her great aunt died and...

55
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:52,272
she got the call last night.

56
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:08,412
Look. You live with
one of my best friends.

57
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:09,960
I'm gonna keep coming here.

58
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:13,046
And having doors shut in
my face is gonna get...

59
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,650
old.

60
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,449
I have surprisingly strong legs
and an hour before my next class.

61
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:22,988
Well.

62
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:26,965
You wanna have a rap session?

63
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,766
Maybe in our P.J.s?

64
00:03:29,235 --> 00:03:31,765
We can eat brownie batter
and do each other's nails.

65
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:34,560
Do you really think that when I
walked in her that night, I thought

66
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:38,161
"Hmm. Look. Parker's getting raped.
Now where are those movie tickets?"

67
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:41,438
No. You just figured the
whore was getting her freak on.

68
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:44,103
So, you're really mad because
I thought you were a whore?

69
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:46,537
Because lots of people
think I'm a whore.

70
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:50,616
Don't pretend for a second
to understand how I'm feeling.

71
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:53,915
I understand exactly what
you're feeling, Parker.

72
00:03:54,137 --> 00:03:59,404
I've been understanding since Shelly Pomroy's
end-of-the-year party, summer of 2004.

73
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:02,539
I'd give you the details,
but they're a little fuzzy.

74
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,784
Uh, I-I didn't... I had no idea.

75
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,632
Not something I open with.

76
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,336
But now that I've got your attention,
I will find out who raped you.

77
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,090
That's job one.

78
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,177
Parker, hi, I'm Nish.

79
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,466
I'm the editor of the
Hearst Free Press and I'd...

80
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,591
Veronica. It's good to see you.

81
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:27,746
And that's where we differ.

82
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,158
I was hoping we could talk.

83
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,127
I'd be a little careful.

84
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:36,860
She's a friend of yours?

85
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:45,310
Parker. I'm doing an
article on the serial rapes,

86
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:47,793
and I've interviewed most
of the other victims and I...

87
00:04:47,794 --> 00:04:49,517
I don't want to be interviewed.

88
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,594
One question, then.

89
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:54,471
You were at the Theta
Beta sorority party,

90
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:55,842
the night you were attacked.

91
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:59,407
Do you remember seeing any
of the Pi Sig brothers there?

92
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:05,855
The first tier of your trust fund was intended
to last until your twenty-first birthday, Logan.

93
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:07,559
At the rate you're burning through it,

94
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,906
you've got fourteen months, maybe.

95
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:11,587
Yeah, I looked at the statement.

96
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:13,606
I should be getting more money.

97
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:16,498
You think because you still have checks,

98
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:17,606
you still have money.

99
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:19,566
I'm not saying I deserve more.

100
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:21,623
I'm saying there's money missing.

101
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:23,662
It's complicated.

102
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,082
All right, then I'll talk to my lawyer,

103
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,392
see if he can't figure it out.

104
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:29,648
I'll do you one better.

105
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:33,292
We'll send all your
financial records right over.

106
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:36,177
You're not showing me porn?

107
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:37,980
No.

108
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:39,910
Is it a fuzzy, new-born kitten?

109
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:45,512
Look the meeting with Avi Kaufman, bean
counter to the stars, didn't go very well.

110
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:49,833
My trust fund's evaporating faster than it
should. I think he's skimming off the top.

111
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,088
My dad has got a great accountant.

112
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:56,577
I'm thinking I need more of a private
detective to help me nail this guy to the wall.

113
00:05:56,578 --> 00:05:59,489
Well, show me the records.
I'm sure I can make sense of-

114
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:02,748
Go get 'em, bobcat.

115
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:10,761
Veronica Mars

116
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:13,762
3x04 "Charlie Don't Surf"

117
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:33,765
www.veronicamars.it

118
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,354
Hi. Um, I don't have an appointment.

119
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:47,296
Do you remember me by any chance?

120
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:50,265
From Judge Crawford's
Christmas parties, of course.

121
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:52,395
Harmony, right?

122
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:56,205
Right. You helped me with
my tyre that one year.

123
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:59,333
And you thanked me profusely
every year after that.

124
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,390
Sit, sit, please.
What-What can I do for you?

125
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:09,600
Um, well, uh. You ever
heard this one before?

126
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:13,449
I think my husband's having an affair.

127
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,641
You didn't know I was married.

128
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:17,619
I didn't.

129
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,032
Everyone's always surprised.

130
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:22,619
You can wear a ring, but if
the husband's never around...

131
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,356
So, what makes you think
he's involved with someone?

132
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:31,455
Working late, mysterious calls,
last minute business trips.

133
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:36,646
I keep looking for the lipstick on his
collar just so it's full-on trite but...

134
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:40,110
then there's the fact that
we're in a loveless marriage,

135
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:45,144
he's a kind of glorified roommate these
days who happens to be a fantastic father.

136
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:50,674
I had settled into that being my life,
happy daughter, façade of happy marriage...

137
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:53,047
And then you got a couple
"don't wait up" calls.

138
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:58,107
I can't just leave for
me. I need a reason.

139
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:01,172
Do I sound awful?

140
00:08:03,705 --> 00:08:08,041
Russian literature, between
Tolstoy and Turgenev.

141
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:12,291
I liked the other
place you worked better.

142
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,704
Think maybe that's
because we had food there?

143
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:16,250
Did you see this?

144
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:19,765
"Pi Sig frat common
thread in campus rapes."

145
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,803
There was a Pi Sig event
the night of every attack.

146
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:25,163
There's a little graphic and everything.

147
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:27,939
Coloured ink. It must be true.

148
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,190
The last girl, Claire, was at the Pi Sig
haunted house the night she was raped.

149
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:34,127
I trust Nish as far as I can throw her,

150
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,355
but I can't throw those
frat boys very far either.

151
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,203
I'm feeling pretty anxious
to give it a try, though.

152
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,047
Can I help you?

153
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:47,981
Do you know which one
of these is Veronica's?

154
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:54,119
Oh, guess so. This is so freaky. I've
totally been to this complex before.

155
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,090
We had to pick up our maid here once.

156
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:59,152
Is Veronica home?

157
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:08,786
Honey?

158
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,810
Ah, it's like a little
kitchen area, huh?

159
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:15,824
Oh, it's so awesome.

160
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:20,384
If you're not gonna shoo it out
with a newspaper, I'm stepping on it.

161
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:23,445
Hey, buddy. Hope it's not
weird me just showing up.

162
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:26,753
I can't believe I've known you
forever and you've never had me over.

163
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:31,900
You left a flaming bag of dog
poo in front of our door one time.

164
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:33,777
That was kind of a play date.

165
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:36,554
You need me to...

166
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:37,555
It's fine.

167
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:44,940
You guys are cute.

168
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:46,937
Dick! Why are you here?

169
00:09:47,468 --> 00:09:50,272
You saw that article about
the Pi Sig house, right?

170
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:55,160
That girl Claire gets raped after one of our
parties, and suddenly, school's all in a bunch.

171
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,504
There's like this hearing scheduled
to try to get us kicked off campus,

172
00:09:58,505 --> 00:09:59,620
and that's where you come in.

173
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:01,140
I get to do the kickin'?

174
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:03,198
You get to be the spy who loves me.

175
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:06,980
The guys were really impressed with how
you cleared the frat of the rape last year.

176
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,865
Were they? That means so little.

177
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:12,256
They knew we had, like, this connection.

178
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:13,913
So, they sent me here to hire you.

179
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:17,671
We need you to do your Veronica
thing and prove it's a pack of lies.

180
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:19,870
Is it? A pack of lies?

181
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:23,874
We're a frat. Why rape the cow
when you're swimming in free milk?

182
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:28,755
Maybe you guys should hire
someone you don't disgust.

183
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:31,908
They don't care about the
disgusted thing. They want you.

184
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:39,042
I'll need full access to the fraternity.

185
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:41,579
I need to know everything about
the night of the haunted house.

186
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,722
My fee is fifteen hundred up front.

187
00:10:44,138 --> 00:10:46,584
Really? That's what you guys make?

188
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:48,202
That's the Pi Sig rate.

189
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:50,107
Okay.

190
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,546
And you'll need to leave right
now before I change my mind.

191
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:58,932
Who knew that when opportunity knocked,
it would look like a horny surfer?

192
00:10:58,933 --> 00:10:59,733
Thank you.

193
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:03,943
And he hand-delivered an invitation
into the belly of the beast.

194
00:11:18,235 --> 00:11:19,268
Hello?

195
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:21,046
Hi, it's Keith Mars.

196
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:27,934
Can I guess? She's blonde, twenty-two,
no visible pores, and pierced navel.

197
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:31,842
Nope. Nope, looks like he's,
uh, really working late.

198
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:34,538
I've been parked by his car all night.

199
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:36,385
Really? Huh.

200
00:11:36,386 --> 00:11:38,603
The office on the bottom floor, right?

201
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:42,063
Yeah. So, you're just sitting
there looking at his car?

202
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:44,657
Yeah. It's glamorous, I know.

203
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:48,806
At least it's your job. I did it
a couple of weeks ago for sport.

204
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:52,041
I was so sure he was cheating,
I decided to follow him.

205
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:55,802
I wore a hat and sunglasses.
Not my finest hour.

206
00:11:55,803 --> 00:11:58,574
No more I Love Lucy reruns for you.

207
00:11:58,575 --> 00:12:02,752
Hey, we should have a bet. She's blonde
and twenty-two, you owe me a beer.

208
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:04,219
Goodnight, Harmony.

209
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,220
Goodnight.

210
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:46,277
My accountant said she'd be finished
looking over Logan's files this afternoon.

211
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:48,288
Snazzy.

212
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:50,638
Are we start going to church or are
you addressing the junior league?

213
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,891
Bland is the new hot.

214
00:12:53,702 --> 00:12:56,834
Is it possible your
boyfriend's financial problems

215
00:12:56,835 --> 00:13:01,174
are just his champagne wishes and
caviar dreams biting him on the ass?

216
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:07,018
One solid-gold foosball table and a couple
of man servants and suddenly he's spendy.

217
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:14,603
Umm, did you trip and fall onto sandalwood, musk,
and a hint of spicy citrus or is that cologne?

218
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:18,015
It's aftershave. I'm
going to traffic court.

219
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:20,029
Sexy traffic court?

220
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,141
Nice shoes. You change your
major to Women's Studies?

221
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:29,529
Yuck it up, fancy pants.

222
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:32,710
Hello.

223
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:34,815
In here!

224
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:38,750
Oh, I hope it's okay. I only have
twenty minutes, so I brought lunch.

225
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,811
Oh, I'm booked pretty solid too.

226
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:42,659
Oh, it's a good thing I
brought a whole pie then.

227
00:13:44,852 --> 00:13:48,094
Thank you. It's very thoughtful.

228
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:50,314
So...

229
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:55,940
The woman who dropped Marvin
off is named Carly Hearn.

230
00:13:57,106 --> 00:13:59,590
Wow! How 'bout that.

231
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:01,244
I take it you know her.

232
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:05,379
Yeah. Carly works at Reilly International.
Marvin does a lot of business with them.

233
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,282
He once told me that she was
the smartest woman he's ever met.

234
00:14:08,283 --> 00:14:11,966
I only saw her dropping him off.
It's possible it was just business.

235
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:19,432
Having such a weird reaction to this.
I'm supposed to be jealous, right?

236
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:23,562
I think you should probably
just feel however you're feeling.

237
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:29,191
I feel strangely
impressed... and relieved.

238
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:33,416
I was sure it was going to be a cocktail
waitress putting herself through massage school,

239
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:37,900
and my daughter would want me to buy her tank
tops with "Bootylicious" across the front.

240
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:40,525
I think Carly went to Yale.

241
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:42,549
Brown.

242
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,550
Still.

243
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:48,245
You ever tie your husband's tie?

244
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:04,608
When entering a frat house full of accused
rapists, the pants suit is a solid wardrobe choice.

245
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:08,411
It's fashion's way of saying,
"Move along, nothing to see here."

246
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,128
Hey, you better leave me a slice, bro.

247
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,912
Hey, Veronica.

248
00:15:15,913 --> 00:15:22,746
Yeah, hey. So, I'll need to know where each
frat brother was at the time of the rape.

249
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,136
Isn't the best way to clear us
to figure out who really did it?

250
00:15:26,137 --> 00:15:30,065
That's what I'm doing. I
need to know who saw what.

251
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:34,012
Yeah, fine. Whatever you want.

252
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:38,098
So, the newspaper said that the last thing
Claire remembered from the night of her attack

253
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:41,000
was buying a drink in
front of the haunted house.

254
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,396
Do you remember who was serving drinks?

255
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:46,878
Uh, it was Charleston.

256
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,294
Uh, you don't want to talk
to him, though, he's an idiot.

257
00:16:01,344 --> 00:16:02,728
Your last name is Chu?

258
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:03,729
Yeah.

259
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:06,690
Charleston Chu?

260
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,851
My first name's really Hsiang.

261
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:12,069
Look. I just poured flat
soda into plastic cups.

262
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,860
I don't know anything about the rape.

263
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:19,545
Wow. I didn't even have to ask.
Did you work the stand all night?

264
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:23,632
I guess. I don't remember every second,
so, yeah, I probably served her a drink.

265
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,058
Doesn't mean I raped her.

266
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:31,530
Nope, it just means you're the most likely
suspect, token, and when the media circus starts,

267
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:35,109
you know, like it did at Duke,
that whole lacrosse rape scandal,

268
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:39,101
who do you think they're gonna get to
do the perp walk on the six o'clock news.

269
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:41,394
You're supposed to be working for us.

270
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,003
Okay, wait! Wait up. Wait.

271
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,931
All right, there's... there's more.

272
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:52,443
Once the bank for the refreshment
stand reached five hundred dollars,

273
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,769
we were supposed to bring it up to Chip's
room, right, 'cause he's in charge of the cash.

274
00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:01,054
So, I did but his door was locked. I heard
noises, I started knocking, and then...

275
00:17:01,764 --> 00:17:05,900
then, like, Chip whips open the
door, pissed off and out of breath.

276
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:09,439
'Cause that's where his StairMaster is?

277
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,009
He was buck naked and sweaty.
Like I caught him in...

278
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,496
Flagrante.

279
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:16,482
No, in the middle of sex.

280
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:19,593
Can you believe what's going on outside?

281
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:42,369
No more rapes at Hearst,
women's safety first.

282
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:46,950
They're here.

283
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,297
You arrested the wrong guy?

284
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:55,581
Totally wrong guy. I'd march
him away, he didn't say a word,

285
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:59,710
like he was relieved just to have
an excuse to get out of the house.

286
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:02,958
Now that was a rocky marriage.

287
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,465
Hey, Veronica.

288
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,416
Hey, yourself.

289
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:11,629
Veronica, the liberator of lobsters?

290
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,830
Awe, I never knew.

291
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:18,023
A single lobster, once, from
the Chart House when I was seven.

292
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,735
He tells that one to
all the new clients.

293
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:25,967
Uh, you know, Harmony, I, um, 'm actually
expecting another appointment coming in.

294
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:27,299
Of course.

295
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:29,109
Okay, I'll talk to you.

296
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,106
Yeah, I'll be in touch. Thanks.

297
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:32,107
Bye.

298
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:33,108
Bye.

299
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:41,676
I spoke to my accountant, and, uh, your business
manager doesn't appear to be stealing anything.

300
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:46,737
The Echolls estate contributes ten thousand dollars
a month to an organisation called Aaron's Kids,

301
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:48,595
and that's where the
missing money is going.

302
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:53,702
And Aaron's Kids? Is that my dad's
pathetic excuse for a charity?

303
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:56,993
I hope that helps
clear things up for you.

304
00:19:00,364 --> 00:19:02,227
Hey, I'm sorry it took so long.

305
00:19:02,803 --> 00:19:06,311
I went out for a Thai and
ended up getting a massage.

306
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,123
You should have been more specific.

307
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:15,777
Your dad's charity, Aaron's Kids, was a
non-profit corporation that shut down years ago.

308
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:20,951
Aaron's Kidz, spelled with a Z,
is still in business, however.

309
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:24,773
It's chairman is Avi Kaufman,
your dad's business manager,

310
00:19:24,774 --> 00:19:29,013
and this Aaron's Kidz isn't
even remotely a charity.

311
00:19:35,286 --> 00:19:39,462
Hey, you think I should dangle
Kaufman out of a window by his ankles?

312
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:42,218
How 'bout you numb your
fury with grease and fat,

313
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:44,050
until I can do a little more homework?

314
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:47,076
Reason, huh? Not sure I like it.

315
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:51,365
Here's a fun thing to say to your beau.

316
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:53,847
Mind if I go put the screws to someone?

317
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:56,468
Go ahead, screw your brains out.

318
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:08,357
Whoa! What happened to your mitts?

319
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:10,810
Let me guess. It involved a cookie jar.

320
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,752
I was working the boo
room at the haunted house.

321
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,793
"Boo room"?

322
00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:16,311
You know, it's a staple
of haunted houses.

323
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:19,557
It's pitch black, we dress like
cat burglars, jump out, yell "boo."

324
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:22,460
So your hands ended up bruised how?

325
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:25,446
Uh, I was crouched down and
one of the guys stomped on 'em.

326
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:32,097
Hmm. Okay, next question, and this one's tougher.
Who were you knocking boots with that night?

327
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:38,696
The night Claire was raped, you were naked and
sweaty, locked in your room with some mystery girl.

328
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:42,434
Charleston's pretty chatty,
huh? Ah, that boy scares easy.

329
00:20:42,435 --> 00:20:45,026
A problem is just an
opportunity in disguise.

330
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:47,935
Tell me who you were with, I'll
confirm it and you're in the clear.

331
00:20:47,936 --> 00:20:54,580
No, I'm not. I could tell you but the girl I was
with will never in a million years admit to it.

332
00:20:59,223 --> 00:21:01,052
Okay, I gotta go.

333
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:09,798
Sad to see him go, but it's
nice to watch him leave.

334
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:11,651
Do I know you?

335
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:16,761
Oh, I'm friends with your boyfriend,
Charleston... and your boy on the side, Chip.

336
00:21:17,245 --> 00:21:18,958
What are you talking about?

337
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:22,107
You and Chip. Weren't you
his date to the haunted house?

338
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:24,114
I hear you went as the
beast with two backs.

339
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:26,054
No. Why would you even say that?

340
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:28,203
Look, you're Chip's alibi.

341
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:33,145
The time will come when you'll have to own up to it or
things will really go south for Chip and the Pi Sigs.

342
00:21:33,146 --> 00:21:36,046
I don't need to own up to anything.

343
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,224
You're torturing me.

344
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,421
Without even trying? God, I'm good.

345
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:46,062
My brothers are all sorts of pissed.

346
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:49,268
They think you're coming after them,
instead of trying to find the real raper.

347
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:51,745
Do you mean rapist?
Learn the terminology.

348
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:53,741
What happened to your hand?

349
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:58,636
Window fell on it. Whatever. Look, people
are really starting to think we rape.

350
00:21:58,637 --> 00:22:03,150
The hearing is in two days, so go work
your little pixie spy magic and fix this.

351
00:22:03,151 --> 00:22:06,180
Logan said you showed up at his
place the night of Parker's rape,

352
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:09,100
all wrecked, saying you screwed up.

353
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:12,671
Whipped guys make the worse friends.

354
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:18,494
So, Dick, a rapist? Two in
the same household. Possibly.

355
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:20,728
Quarterbacks seem to run
in the Manning family.

356
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:25,519
I know Logan's always worried about being
genetically predestined for anti-social behaviour.

357
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,555
I suppose that's a question best
left to the social scientists.

358
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,869
Right now, it's time to figure
out where his money is going.

359
00:22:57,983 --> 00:23:00,545
Hi. Can I speak to Ryan Douglas, please?

360
00:23:01,408 --> 00:23:04,983
It's about his interest
in Micardo Enterprises.

361
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:32,034
This new case is keeping you out late.

362
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,277
You look wiped out. What you up to?

363
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:39,187
I was trying to seal the embezzlement
case against Logan's business manager.

364
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:43,129
I discovered something else entirely.

365
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:46,271
Who's Charlie Stone?

366
00:23:56,111 --> 00:23:57,643
Perfect timing.

367
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:01,920
I think Lonely Telescope Guy is
getting tired of me just mooning him.

368
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:03,553
I need to talk to you.

369
00:24:05,418 --> 00:24:10,282
I followed the trust money all
the way down the rabbit hole.

370
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:15,900
The payments are going to a
person named Charlie Stone.

371
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:19,273
Do you know who that is?

372
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:20,774
No, should I?

373
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:26,203
Yeah, probably.

374
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,176
Charlie Stone is your brother.

375
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:41,502
Your dad's business manager buried him
pretty deep. You weren't supposed to find out.

376
00:24:41,503 --> 00:24:43,343
No one was.

377
00:24:43,678 --> 00:24:45,665
I googled him.

378
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:51,245
All I learned was that he teaches at a
private school, in San Juan Capistrano,

379
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:55,341
but he is in the book.

380
00:24:58,676 --> 00:25:00,467
Here's his number.

381
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,806
And what am I supposed to do?

382
00:25:23,346 --> 00:25:26,654
Hi, this is Charlie.
Please leave a message.

383
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:35,571
Hi. Charlie, it's, uh...
Logan Echolls calling.

384
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,692
Parker! Hey.

385
00:25:37,693 --> 00:25:41,076
Save yourself the performance. I
know you're working for the Pi Sigs.

386
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:43,787
I'm not working for the Pi
Sigs. I'm working for you.

387
00:25:43,788 --> 00:25:44,588
Yeah.

388
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:49,147
I'm just using this opportunity to get close
to them so I can figure out what they're up to.

389
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:53,353
Yeah, and you're trying to find out who raped
me by hugging it out with Dick Casablancas?

390
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:54,801
You know Dick?

391
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:59,376
I gave him my number at orientation.
I actually thought he was cute.

392
00:25:59,377 --> 00:26:04,170
Mac said he showed up at our room the night before
the rape and was pounding on the door, looking for me.

393
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:06,082
Did you tell anyone?

394
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:09,913
No, when I talked to the sheriff, I didn't
know about it. He's not as harmless as he looks.

395
00:26:09,914 --> 00:26:14,351
Nancy said he chased her out of the haunted
house, screaming at her, calling her a bitch.

396
00:26:14,352 --> 00:26:15,552
Why was he screaming at her?

397
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:21,272
Next time you guys are snuggling
on the frat house porch, ask him.

398
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,793
I would if I could, but for
now, Jerry is still the boss.

399
00:26:47,794 --> 00:26:49,129
Does he respect your opinion?

400
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,838
I think he sees Joe as
some kind of a side project.

401
00:26:56,246 --> 00:27:00,577
He thinks he's going to get Joe
to turn around. Based on what?

402
00:27:01,962 --> 00:27:04,900
Projections he came up with...

403
00:27:04,901 --> 00:27:09,063
He's one of those people who
thinks that years he's logged

404
00:27:09,064 --> 00:27:11,784
are in direct proportion
to how smart he is.

405
00:27:26,384 --> 00:27:27,832
Can I talk to you?

406
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:30,540
You a little busy doing
funnel shots with the Pi Sigs?

407
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:33,395
Aren't you? I heard you
went to their haunted house.

408
00:27:33,396 --> 00:27:36,466
That must have been fun.
Did you go as a hypocrite?

409
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:39,072
I went with Claire because we
heard there was a grope room.

410
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:42,121
And you were looking
for a little grab-assing?

411
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:43,832
A little poetic justice.

412
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,992
They set up this boo room so they
could fondle girls as they went through.

413
00:27:47,993 --> 00:27:53,045
So, we dressed up as rats and strategically
put rat traps on all of our gropable parts.

414
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:55,499
Okay, that is pretty genius.

415
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,001
I was in the room all of three seconds before
Dick Casablancas was caught in one of my traps.

416
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,278
Their bruised hands.

417
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,144
It must have hurt because he ran
me out of the party, screaming.

418
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:07,039
Was Claire with you?

419
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,993
No. That's when I lost track of her.

420
00:28:10,194 --> 00:28:15,599
I looked for her forever and I thought I saw her later
on down the street from the party, but it wasn't her.

421
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,800
You're sure?

422
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:19,683
Yeah. I yelled for her. Nothing.

423
00:28:19,684 --> 00:28:21,084
The sheriff knows all of this.

424
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:25,820
So, the girl you thought was
Claire. Where did you see her?

425
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,226
Nancy thought she saw Claire on the
street outside of this convenience store.

426
00:28:30,227 --> 00:28:33,059
It's worth making sure she
wasn't right the first time.

427
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,099
Hi. I was wondering-

428
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,300
I'm not hiring.

429
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:41,238
Actually, I was wondering if you
were working last Saturday night.

430
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:44,580
I work every Saturday night.
What else am I gonna do?

431
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:49,118
Do you remember seeing this
girl. Her name is Claire.

432
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,568
Yeah, I saw her. So drunk
she could barely stand.

433
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:55,692
If your parents knew what
you kids really do here...

434
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,741
A-And you're sure it was her?

435
00:28:57,742 --> 00:29:02,124
She came in with a guy. She's
falling asleep on my magazine rack.

436
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:05,144
He's trying to scrap together
change to buy prophylactics.

437
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:10,130
Then he's all mad because he can't use a
credit card unless he spends fifteen dollars.

438
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:15,829
So, I sent him next door to the ATM. They
came back later, he bought his raincoats...

439
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,631
one less bastard child
conceived by morons.

440
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,516
Everyone's happy.

441
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,217
Thanks.

442
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,259
I started bugging my mom about who my dad
was when I was, I don't know, six, seven.

443
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,476
Then on my tenth birthday, my mom takes
me to see Aaron Echolls in Thought Police.

444
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:41,863
She points to the screen and she says,
"That's the guy. That's your dad."

445
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:45,741
She took you to see Thought Police
on your birthday? Did she hate you?

446
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,945
I'm, like, mom, don't
screw with my head. I'm ten.

447
00:29:49,946 --> 00:29:54,182
I can't deal with the news that the guy
mind-wrestling with Stallone on screen knocked you up.

448
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:57,342
She was a stewardess when she met Aaron.

449
00:29:57,343 --> 00:30:01,022
She said she met him working first
class on an L.A. to New York red-eye.

450
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:03,164
My mom is a looker.

451
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:04,831
Yeah, I'm sure she is.

452
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:09,527
I didn't believe her 'til she showed
me the cheques, the hush money.

453
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:13,253
How many kids of single parents
flight-attends score the best private schools,

454
00:30:13,254 --> 00:30:17,340
still I'd see pictures of your family
and think that life should be mine.

455
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:19,355
Nah, you don't want it. Trust me-

456
00:30:19,356 --> 00:30:23,932
No, I know, that's the thing. The more I watched,
the happier I was that it wasn't my family.

457
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:27,775
Your dad cheats on your mom,
it's on the cover of People.

458
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:31,793
Your sister shoots Nicole Richie with a BB
gun, Jay Leno opens his monologue with it.

459
00:30:31,794 --> 00:30:35,993
Then the murder. I started wondering if something
was wrong with me, you know, if this is my bloodline.

460
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,728
Yeah, join the club.

461
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:45,386
Ah, this has been great but
I gotta run. Papers to grade.

462
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:51,320
Well, yeah, it has. We'll have
to do it again. Longer next time.

463
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:55,088
I'd like to hear about him,
Aaron, the details, good or bad.

464
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:56,400
Yeah, bad mostly.

465
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:58,525
There's just this void. You know him...

466
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,591
Oh, hello.

467
00:31:02,305 --> 00:31:07,780
Veronica, this is my half-brother,
Charlie. Charlie, my girlfriend, Veronica.

468
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:08,781
Hey, nice to meet you.

469
00:31:08,782 --> 00:31:09,782
Yeah, you too.

470
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,603
Oh, Charlie has to get home, grade
papers. He's got an honest job.

471
00:31:15,604 --> 00:31:19,508
He's a contributing member
of society. Very un-Echolls.

472
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:23,192
Yeah, and if I get them graded by
tonight, I can hit Zuma at dawn.

473
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,873
You surf?

474
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:28,269
As often and as long as I can.

475
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,180
Man, we are brothers.

476
00:31:37,658 --> 00:31:40,649
I have options. I could
be excited for Logan.

477
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:45,512
Thrilled even that his new brother
is such a keeper. Or, I can be me.

478
00:31:56,173 --> 00:32:02,790
Hi. Um, sorry to bother you. Are you
by any chance the sub for Mr. Stone?

479
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:05,634
No, I'm the real deal. I'm Mr. Stone.

480
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,278
Sorry, I've got a class
starting. Did you need something?

481
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,472
No, uh, just looking for someone else.

482
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:16,697
Okay, then I gotta call roll.

483
00:32:25,102 --> 00:32:27,012
So, it's Christmas, right?

484
00:32:27,507 --> 00:32:31,544
The entire family unit
is around, which was rare.

485
00:32:32,248 --> 00:32:35,048
And I'm, I don't know, I'm nine

486
00:32:36,484 --> 00:32:40,855
and Aaron hands me a gift, but he notices
the box has been re-wrapped, you know,

487
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:45,844
so he knows I peeked. I'm nine years
old, he's re-gifting me a fruit basket.

488
00:32:45,845 --> 00:32:48,503
He starts shouting about
how I've ruined Christmas.

489
00:32:48,504 --> 00:32:49,648
Oh, my God.

490
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:56,818
Yeah. And he, uh, he tells me I'm not opening
another gift until I eat all twelve pears in the box.

491
00:32:56,819 --> 00:32:58,766
Damn, man, the scissors incident,

492
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:01,619
the drained swimming pool
episode, now the box of pears.

493
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:07,234
So, I'm eating the pears and taking
my time, taking these dainty bites...

494
00:33:09,775 --> 00:33:11,823
the man comes unhinged.

495
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:18,341
Takes these pears and just starts shoving
them down my throat one after another.

496
00:33:18,845 --> 00:33:24,193
And then...and I'm choking but he doesn't stop
until my mom holds a cheese knife to his throat.

497
00:33:25,574 --> 00:33:28,263
To this day, I puke if I smell a pear.

498
00:33:43,637 --> 00:33:45,648
Quick Jim, hide them hookers!

499
00:33:50,315 --> 00:33:53,301
Hi, Logan. Hi, Norman Phipps.

500
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,222
What did you call him?

501
00:33:56,223 --> 00:34:01,758
His name, Norman Phipps. At least, that's
the name of the guy who rented his rental car

502
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:06,326
and a quick google check reveals that Norman
Phipps is a contributor to Vanity Fair.

503
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:10,873
Thank God for mobile wireless, huh?
So, Norman, how's your story coming.

504
00:34:12,578 --> 00:34:17,248
It's great. In fact, I'm almost there.
Just one thing, Logan. That fruit basket?

505
00:34:17,249 --> 00:34:20,309
Was it from Harry and
David? God is in the details.

506
00:34:20,997 --> 00:34:24,420
Ah, please take a swing.
It'd make a great lead.

507
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:34,740
I'm so sorry. I should've
just left it alone.

508
00:34:41,635 --> 00:34:44,314
I guess this is the money shot, right?

509
00:34:46,615 --> 00:34:49,223
I wanted proof, I got proof.

510
00:34:49,224 --> 00:34:52,091
So, now I do it, right, I leave him.

511
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:52,708
Harmony...

512
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:54,320
Is that standard operating procedure?

513
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:59,044
I mean, do I kick him out, will he move
out, do I take our daughter to a hotel.

514
00:34:59,045 --> 00:35:00,723
Before you do anything...

515
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:07,340
you need to hear this.

516
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:13,494
He's one of those people, thinks the number of years
he's logged are in direct proportion to how smart-

517
00:35:13,495 --> 00:35:22,732
Whoa, wait, Carly. Stop. I can't. I have
a wife, family. I'm not gonna do this.

518
00:35:22,733 --> 00:35:27,029
They left separately. I followed
Marvin back to your house.

519
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:34,712
This morning he handed off the Reilly International
account to someone named, uh, Daryl Derryberry.

520
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,569
I should go home.

521
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:43,151
Yes, you should.

522
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:10,624
Remember that case a couple years ago
where that woman was impersonating her boss?

523
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:14,980
How did you obtain the
ATM photos that proved it?

524
00:36:14,981 --> 00:36:16,403
I know a guy...

525
00:36:18,354 --> 00:36:22,101
a representative of the bank.
He needs to request a court order

526
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:25,937
and once the court order is issued, it
only takes about an hour to get the photos.

527
00:36:25,938 --> 00:36:28,019
So, it's a piece of cake.

528
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,679
A monkey, with a friend who's
a bank representative can do it.

529
00:36:31,928 --> 00:36:37,142
So, Bubbles. You feel
like doing me a solid? Hm?

530
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:49,084
Hello, Chip, Dick, faceless
Star Trek crew members.

531
00:36:49,085 --> 00:36:51,113
Hey! Here to give us our money back?

532
00:36:51,114 --> 00:36:54,588
Mm. The morning after the haunted house,

533
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:58,192
Claire woke up alone in the park,
five am, her head was shaved.

534
00:36:58,193 --> 00:37:01,171
This photo was taken of
Claire the night she was raped.

535
00:37:01,172 --> 00:37:06,891
It's from an ATM on the corner of Stanton
and Lake. Look at the timestamp. Two am.

536
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,322
The haunted house had
been closed for two hours.

537
00:37:09,323 --> 00:37:13,856
She still has her hair, so we know she hasn't
been raped yet. And look who she's with.

538
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,044
Who's that dude? It's not one of us.

539
00:37:16,045 --> 00:37:21,410
Precisely. You Pi Sigs have exactly
one Asian member and that's not him.

540
00:37:21,411 --> 00:37:26,785
Voila. It's proof of innocence.
Courtesy of pixie spy magic.

541
00:37:33,672 --> 00:37:38,176
Hmm. When did the Greek chorus
of feminist shame arrive?

542
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:49,178
Charlie!

543
00:37:57,691 --> 00:38:01,037
Good news. The Pi Sigs were absolved.

544
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:02,561
Because they were innocent.

545
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:07,008
Because you helped them, which is
what you were trying to do all along.

546
00:38:07,215 --> 00:38:09,174
How do you live with yourself?

547
00:38:09,175 --> 00:38:14,273
I was looking for the truth and I found
it. You wanna nail someone to the wall,

548
00:38:14,274 --> 00:38:18,220
just to have someone nailed there, or do
you want the person responsible to pay?

549
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:32,617
Hey! Careful, man,
there's a beverage here.

550
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,349
You doing okay?

551
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:37,499
On top of the world,
looking down on creation.

552
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,485
Saw you on Larry King last night, giving
your half-brother a little coming out party.

553
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:45,770
Life as Charlie Stone
knew it is officially over.

554
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:47,476
I'm choking with empathy.

555
00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:51,826
He served me up to that Vanity Fair
reporter and brought it on himself.

556
00:38:51,827 --> 00:38:53,563
Well, we don't know that for sure.

557
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,385
Well, how else could it have happened?

558
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:01,114
Well, I'm glad you went digging.

559
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:05,285
I have now erased any and all
romantic notions about my family.

560
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:08,518
That's me: all sorts of helpful.

561
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:12,072
I was hoping you could [?bus some?] around
again and help me find Norman Phipps.

562
00:39:12,073 --> 00:39:13,073
Why?

563
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:16,819
Well, I gave him a pocket watch
that belonged to my grandfather,

564
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,006
the only decent member of my family.

565
00:39:19,504 --> 00:39:22,255
'Course, he died when I
was five, so who knows.

566
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,079
Still, kinda burns thinking
of Norman having it.

567
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:29,158
In my world, the wicked
don't get parting gifts.

568
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,782
Hey there, fake Charlie.

569
00:39:40,783 --> 00:39:44,393
You weren't expecting to see me
again, were you? Can I come in?

570
00:39:48,202 --> 00:39:50,946
Look, I was just doing my
job. None of it matters anyway.

571
00:39:50,947 --> 00:39:53,015
The magazine dropped the story
when Larry King scooped them.

572
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,768
That was the plan.
I'm here for the watch.

573
00:39:57,001 --> 00:39:59,812
Your boyfriend got one detail
wrong in that interview of his.

574
00:40:01,093 --> 00:40:02,824
Charlie Stone never talked to me.

575
00:40:02,825 --> 00:40:05,489
I tracked him down, but he
wanted to remain anonymous.

576
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,424
Then how did you end up meeting Logan?

577
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:09,817
I had a tap on Charlie's phone.

578
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,292
[ Space Needle "Never Lonely Alone" ]

579
00:40:18,031 --> 00:40:24,012
The reporter acted alone. He was
tapping Charlie's line when you called.

580
00:40:24,513 --> 00:40:27,391
Your real half-brother is innocent.

581
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,368
And I was so quick to believe that guy.

582
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:43,695
And, you know, I look at you and your
dad, you know, that thing that you have.

583
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:46,335
I never had that.

584
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,287
You couldn't have known.

585
00:40:53,228 --> 00:40:55,931
No, I'm sure that won't matter to him.

586
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:11,584
Hi, this is Charlie.
Please leave a message.

587
00:41:11,585 --> 00:41:15,367
Hey, Charlie, it's Logan again. Uh...

588
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:20,372
Listen, I'm sorry about
all the messages...

589
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:25,636
yeah, I guess I thought
I'd give it another shot.

590
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:29,634
Fourth time's a charm, right?
