1
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:06,382
<i>Since I was a kid, I've been able</i>
<i>to sleep through anything.</i>

2
00:00:06,598 --> 00:00:08,554
<i>Storms, sirens, you name it.</i>

3
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:10,795
<i>Last night I didn't sleep.</i>

4
00:00:12,437 --> 00:00:15,190
<i>Couldn't stop thinking</i>
<i>about this past year.</i>

5
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:20,127
Oh, please.
I've seen you naked before.

6
00:00:21,363 --> 00:00:25,242
Dude, you had that?
Five up high for cherry pie!

7
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,387
You find it funny, Dr Dorian?
Why don't you tell me

8
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,015
the EKG findings of Wolff-
Parkinson-White Syndrome?

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,922
I haven't even showered yet.

10
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:38,043
We could shower together
for old time's sake.

11
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:41,327
I never would've slept with you
if I knew you were Dr Cox's ex.

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,142
What was that, newbie?

13
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:47,791
Relax. He doesn't know.

14
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:50,005
He likes Carla anyway.

15
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,413
I got Carla wrapped
around my finger.

16
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:53,955
I heard that!

17
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:56,538
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

18
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:59,484
- Thank you.
- Forget about it.

19
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:03,686
No, no, no.
You can't forget about these.

20
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:07,337
I'd pull those hands back
if you wanna keep 'em, Q-tip.

21
00:01:07,576 --> 00:01:09,407
That's just the kind of thing

22
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:12,615
that can be construed
as sexual harassment.

23
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:16,380
Got a few hairs
in the sink, there, huh?

24
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:20,301
For God's sake, man,
don't comb so hard.

25
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,856
All right, enough is enough!

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,996
I guess I don't fit in
with your mirror friends.

27
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,979
Enjoy.

28
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:43,448
<i>I don't know why my mind</i>
<i>is all over the place.</i>

29
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:47,043
<i>Maybe it's because today</i>
<i>isn't just any other day.</i>

30
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:50,001
<i>It's my last day as an intern.</i>

31
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:52,352
Oh, you got me!

32
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:54,448
Let me go, let me go!

33
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:56,181
Hey, amigos!

34
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,244
Can you guys believe this?

35
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,568
Tomorrow,
we are officially residents.

36
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,790
Let's get our last day on.

37
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:06,001
<i>What the hell?</i>
<i>He deserves it too.</i>

38
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,417
Mother...

39
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:26,599
Mr Bober has been complaining
of abdominal pain and nausea.

40
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:29,290
- Looks like cholecystitis.
- What, newbie?

41
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:32,563
This gentleman is suffering
from an inflamed gallbladder

42
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,584
and you have him eating
a grilled cheese sandwich.

43
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,428
Here's an idea.
Why don't we just have him

44
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,254
wash the whole thing down
with a big ol' mug of vodka?

45
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:45,841
Mr Bober back there is
one of our frequent flyers.

46
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:49,405
He's with us every six months
for years and I've grown fond of him.

47
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,070
So if you could somehow
manage to not kill him,

48
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:54,732
well, then, oh, gee,
that would just be ducky.

49
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:58,005
How come you haven't mentioned
it's my last day as an intern?

50
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:00,105
Haven't I?

51
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:03,150
- Come here. Oh!
- OK. OK.

52
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,143
Despite the fact that tomorrow
you will be a resident,

53
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:10,001
you'll still be the excitable girl
that you are now.

54
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:12,632
The only difference will be
that some new intern

55
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:16,262
will mistake you for somebody
who actually knows something.

56
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,009
<i>Why is he so uptight today?</i>

57
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,315
- Hey, Perry.
- <i>Oh, OK.</i>

58
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,253
Jordan. To what
do we owe the horror?

59
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:24,860
Come on, Perry.

60
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,758
No soft spot for the one woman
who slept with you sober?

61
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:30,560
Now, if you could sign
this insurance physical,

62
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,070
I'll go back to trying to forget
that horrible, horrible night.

63
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:37,025
For me to sign this, I would
have to give you a physical.

64
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:38,624
And when I say ''I,''

65
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:42,317
I, of course, mean
absolutely anybody but me.

66
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:45,681
Barbie!
Give my ex-wife here a physical,

67
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:49,098
and don't be afraid
of that third eye on her chest.

68
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:53,633
Just remember, it's just as scared
of you as you are of it.

69
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,126
Let's get physical?

70
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,397
- Doesn't matter...
- Carla, can you do me a favour?

71
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:07,779
Mr Bober needs yet another
Foley catheter. I am so swamped.

72
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:10,645
Sure, no problem.
But we're not finished yet!

73
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:12,355
I know we're not finished yet.

74
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:16,026
I didn't say we were finished yet.
But, baby, it's up to you.

75
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:17,777
<i>When a couple argues,</i>

76
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:20,003
<i>you should run</i>
<i>before you get roped in.</i>

77
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:21,504
Hey, JD.

78
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:26,225
- You got him, baby.
- I got him.

79
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,549
- I got him!
- Bring him in.

80
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,205
We were talking about our relationship
and how great everything is.

81
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:35,200
I said, ''lt's weird to think
I'll never date again.''

82
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,717
That's close,
but not quite what you said.

83
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:41,381
What you said was, ''lt's weird
to think I'll never get to date again.''

84
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:44,854
You see that? ''Get to date again'',
like she's missing out.

85
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,645
- How messed up is that?
- I did not say ''get''.

86
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:50,398
You're being ridiculous.
What do you think, JD?

87
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,582
<i>Careful, Tiger. Careful.</i>

88
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:56,032
I wish people
would call me Tiger.

89
00:04:56,221 --> 00:04:57,415
What?

90
00:04:57,556 --> 00:04:59,672
I agree with Laverne.

91
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:10,227
Damn kids and their stupid problems.

92
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:14,998
I just wanna get home to a warm bath,
catch a little bit of that <i>Fear Factor.</i>

93
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:22,399
Ted, the reason we're not admiring
the new parking structure

94
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:27,135
is because you failed to get legal
clearance from the zoning board.

95
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,669
Honestly, sometimes I wonder
if you're happy here.

96
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,857
Do it, Ted. Just do it.

97
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:44,014
Bob! When I heard
you were up on the roof

98
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:46,825
I just assumed it was
because your evil mission

99
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:50,173
here on planet Earth had finally
come to an end, so tell me this.

100
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,436
Where exactly is the mother ship?

101
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:54,681
- Look, Ted. It's Dr Cox.
- Hey.

102
00:05:54,863 --> 00:05:58,378
I just saw the new shift schedule.
Give me a break, will you?

103
00:05:58,617 --> 00:06:01,927
I'm glad you're here. The hospital
needs a new Residency Director

104
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,153
and I've decided to recommend you.

105
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,720
Now, finish your tantrum
on your own,

106
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:10,876
because I'm going to go down to
the cafeteria and get myself a fro-yo.

107
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,484
Ted, chop-chop.

108
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,075
Save my spot.

109
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,570
Bambi, Mr Bober's hypotensive.
I think he's becoming septic.

110
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:23,923
This guy is more work than
all my other patients combined.

111
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:28,215
Maybe if you tell him how hard it is
on you, he'll get better!

112
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,311
I'll get paper towels.

113
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:32,871
Don't worry.
Somebody else will get it.

114
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:34,740
Yeah. Who can we get?

115
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:37,292
I'm not shocked.
That's how you live your life.

116
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:39,957
Got a problem?
Hey, just pass it on down the line.

117
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:41,511
<i>I was gonna say something,</i>

118
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,379
<i>but it turns out</i>
<i>he gave me a pretty good idea.</i>

119
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:48,064
Thank you so much
for taking Bober from me.

120
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,720
- But, JD, I...
- I owe you.

121
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:55,034
<i>I'm a little doormat,</i>
<i>I sit and stay</i>

122
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:58,329
<i>Let people use me</i>
<i>every single day</i>

123
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,951
Excuse me?

124
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:04,168
Oh, it's a song I'm working on.
I made it up.

125
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:07,390
So I let myself get taken
advantage of sometimes, you know?

126
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:10,070
I mean, big deal.
How do you make friends?

127
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:11,864
I've seen your type before.

128
00:07:12,023 --> 00:07:15,174
You're that girl that thought
she wanted to lose her virginity

129
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,962
at a party while another guy
was asleep in the room.

130
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:20,146
Chaz really cared for me.

131
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:23,121
And I'm sure you have
a cool T-shirt to prove it.

132
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:25,203
Can we please finish this physical?

133
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,521
And I can't pee right now,
so you'll have to go for me.

134
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:34,482
What a good girl. Good girl.

135
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:38,630
<i>Still, Elliot wasn't gonna let herself</i>
<i>get stuck with Mr Bober, either.</i>

136
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:41,682
- How you doing, Mr Bober?
- Fine.

137
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:44,447
OK, why did you let
Elliot turf him up here?

138
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,788
I don't know.

139
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,641
All I really remember is she dropped
her pen and bent over.

140
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:52,568
Dude, thong city!

141
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,240
No. No high-five for you.

142
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,434
- Todd did bad?
- Todd did very bad.

143
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:00,530
Todd did very, very bad.

144
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:02,555
What the hell, Elliot?

145
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,974
You can't just pawn
this Bober guy off on me.

146
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,470
It was JD's patient! I was just
the middleman. Woman. Person.

147
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,344
We can stand here
and argue about who screwed who.

148
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,576
Or?

149
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:14,586
Or nothing.
I'm on break. Let's do it.

150
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:18,143
- Rock-paper-scissors right now.
- Fine. Loser gets Bober.

151
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:20,451
Once, twice, three, shoot!

152
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,352
Did you say Bober?

153
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:25,105
I'm looking for my grandfather,
Frank Bober.

154
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:29,218
We moved him to the ICU, dear.
He'll show you up.

155
00:08:30,852 --> 00:08:32,922
That's OK. She...
She didn't hear us.

156
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:36,062
No, but Jesus did.

157
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:41,746
<i>Just a closer walk with thee</i>

158
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:46,333
I didn't appreciate
your game this morning.

159
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:50,130
Heavens to Betsy,
the gazpacho is scrumptious today.

160
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:52,806
Dangling that fake promotion
in front of me.

161
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,309
I was dead serious about the
Residency Director's position.

162
00:08:56,545 --> 00:09:00,538
Well, what makes you think
that I'd be interested in that?

163
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,118
Because you want my job,

164
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,853
and you'll never get it
without this on your résumé.

165
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:06,964
But you hate me.

166
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:11,576
- Like nuts in brownies, captain.
- I don't get your angle.

167
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,446
What could you want
in exchange for my support,

168
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:18,161
because I'm telling you,
I am not dating that daughter of yours.

169
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,516
I only have a son.

170
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:24,164
That's my bad. I was just going
by that picture on your desk.

171
00:09:24,406 --> 00:09:26,761
You know the financial burdens
I deal with.

172
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,260
I want you to stop busting my chops
all the time and get on my team.

173
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:35,523
- Forget about it.
- Fine. Walk away.

174
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,726
Scrumptious.

175
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:44,232
Wanna bite?

176
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:47,179
We're doctors.
That's how doctors talk to doctors.

177
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:50,584
Our only mistake was not being careful
about where we were.

178
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:52,399
We agree we did nothing wrong,

179
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,993
so let's check in on him
and forget about it.

180
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:57,496
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>the three of us realized,</i>

181
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:00,522
<i>even though we'd all</i>
<i>spent time with Mr Bober,</i>

182
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,646
<i>none of us had any idea</i>
<i>what he looked like.</i>

183
00:10:03,862 --> 00:10:05,773
Over here.

184
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:09,846
Hey, guys.

185
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,912
<i>When we started here a year ago</i>

186
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,961
<i>and saw some of the</i>
<i>insensitive and jaded doctors,</i>

187
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,967
<i>we all said the same thing:</i>

188
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,121
<i>''That's not gonna be me. ''</i>

189
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:25,971
<i>Really, the only solace</i>

190
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:29,171
<i>is that the guilt</i>
<i>passes pretty quickly.</i>

191
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:48,277
What's wrong, dog?

192
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,598
You guys,
we have to do something.

193
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:54,936
If we remove Mr Bober's gallbladder,
it should relieve the abdominal pain.

194
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:57,321
Isn't he a little old
for that procedure?

195
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:01,378
- Well, he seems stable enough.
- Problem is, he has no insurance.

196
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:07,418
<i>And then, all at once,</i>
<i>we realized we had to do something.</i>

197
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:13,295
<i>We decided to attack</i>
<i>the problem on three fronts.</i>

198
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:15,498
Dr Cox?

199
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:22,008
Ms Sullivan?

200
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:29,057
Dr Wen?

201
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:32,151
I thought if you looked
at Mr Bober's chart and agreed,

202
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:34,927
you might be able
to pull some strings or...

203
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,873
<i>And now, here it comes:</i>
<i>The calling me a girl's name,</i>

204
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:40,231
<i>the telling me</i>
<i>not to waste my time...</i>

205
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:43,727
Yep. I'll be more than glad
to help you there, Charlotte.

206
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:45,634
<i>I was half right.</i>

207
00:11:45,797 --> 00:11:47,549
Well, thank you.

208
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:50,788
Don't ever be afraid
to come to me with stuff like that.

209
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,445
The simple fact
that you seem to give a crap

210
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:56,436
is the reason I took an interest
in you to begin with.

211
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:59,474
It's why I trust you as a doctor.
Hell, it's...

212
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,527
It's why I trust you as a person.

213
00:12:06,651 --> 00:12:08,846
Are you dying?

214
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,065
I've got a new shrink.

215
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,698
<i>Ah, just say it.</i>

216
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,542
You know, I want to thank you
for this whole year.

217
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:20,339
Oh, no.

218
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:23,889
And I just want to know
if I can buy you dinner.

219
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,401
That'd be terrific.

220
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,537
- Great! I'm off in a half hour...
- Oh, no!

221
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:31,476
Here I was led
to believe that you were...

222
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:33,985
...doing a gift certificate
kind of thing.

223
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:37,535
But to sit and eat with you? That's...

224
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:40,838
That's just... That's crazy talk.

225
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,894
I have half a mind
to issue you a drug test.

226
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:48,064
- Come on! What'd I sign up for...
- Would've been nice.

227
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:52,391
He doesn't have insurance. If you could
talk to the board, JD thought maybe...

228
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:55,045
First he dumps that patient on you,

229
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,233
and now he wants you
to ask me a favour?

230
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,162
If you don't start saying no,

231
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:01,399
you're gonna wind up
on the playing a game

232
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,493
- I call Hide The Pickle.
- JD and I are just colleagues.

233
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:07,746
I was joking, but you actually
slept with him, didn't you?

234
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:10,203
A little.

235
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,219
I don't know where your mother was when
she should've told you these things,

236
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:17,222
but you cannot have sex
with someone you care about.

237
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,103
Sex is for making babies and revenge.

238
00:13:20,308 --> 00:13:22,026
Oh, you're so full of it.

239
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:27,198
Listen, stick,
if you wanna wipe your nose

240
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,072
and pretend that was a sneeze,
I will play along.

241
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:33,349
But if you have something to say,
say it.

242
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:37,587
Everybody knows
you're sleeping with Dr Cox,

243
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:41,140
and it can't be about making babies,
cos you'd end up eating them.

244
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,885
As for revenge, I'm not sure
that pleasuring him

245
00:13:44,082 --> 00:13:47,154
while he watches <i>SportsCenter</i>
hurts him as much as you think.

246
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:49,971
You still care about him
whether you admit it or not.

247
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:54,245
And if you lay one finger on me,
I'm blowing my rape whistle.

248
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:03,094
Kiss her?

249
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:09,213
So you see, Dr Wen,
it's not really a favour.

250
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,790
We were supposed to do surgery
on Mrs Beckerman, but she passed away.

251
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,822
Go on.

252
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:19,698
She's dead, and we hoped that you
could keep her name on the roster.

253
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:21,748
We don't wanna do surgery on her.

254
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:25,029
Let's face it, Dr Wen.
We're good, but we're not that good.

255
00:14:25,248 --> 00:14:27,887
- You know what I'm saying?
- No.

256
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:30,644
We want to get a patient
approved for surgery.

257
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,714
We hope you can keep the slot open.

258
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:34,030
Oh, sure.

259
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,529
Dr Turk, next time
you need to talk to me,

260
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:39,755
think hard about what you want to say,
then send her.

261
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:43,566
- Of course. Thanks, Dr Wen.
- See, what happened there was,

262
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:47,802
I knew what you were trying to say
despite the exact words you were using.

263
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:51,373
I tried to help you out instead
of getting mad at you over nothing.

264
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:54,202
Baby, we both know
it's not the same.

265
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:57,394
You are the dumbest man
I ever laid eyes on.

266
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:02,027
Still.

267
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:06,601
Didn't hurt! Didn't hurt!

268
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,281
Tell me if it hurts this time!

269
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:13,532
So, you want me to approve
surgery on a 76-year-old man

270
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:16,595
with no insurance
and no life-threatening condition?

271
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,711
Young man, I'm curious.

272
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:22,560
What did you think the end result
of this conversation would be?

273
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:24,285
Well, pretty much, this.

274
00:15:24,432 --> 00:15:27,265
Except I'm invested,
so I thought I might try crying.

275
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:29,149
Sport, if crying worked on me,

276
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:31,951
my wife would have
her own car by now.

277
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:41,466
- Bob? I think you should reconsider.
- What's that, Perry?

278
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:45,617
I mean, because that didn't sound
like something a teammate would say.

279
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:49,625
Maybe you meant to pat me on
the ass and say, ''Go get 'em, Bob.''

280
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,514
Right, but what if
we were to look at this

281
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:55,509
from a purely fiscal perspective?

282
00:15:55,714 --> 00:15:57,670
<i>Did he just say ''fiscal''?</i>

283
00:15:57,841 --> 00:16:00,833
After all, Mr Bober
is here every four to six months,

284
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:03,168
and if we were
to consider his surgery

285
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:05,302
as a one-time expenditure, then...

286
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:09,467
...you would be making
the right financial call.

287
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:14,714
See now? That's the kind of thinking
I can get behind!

288
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:16,902
How'd that make you feel?

289
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:20,140
- Dirty all over.
- You get used to it.

290
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:23,275
Boys, I'll do what I can,
but if you're gonna pull this off,

291
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:25,847
you're gonna need
a board member behind you.

292
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:28,834
<i>How the hell</i>
<i>are we supposed to get that?</i>

293
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:31,633
This is the closest I've come

294
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,711
to not hating myself
after sleeping with you.

295
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,797
Oh, you're just saying that.

296
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:41,115
Actually, I'm not. I...
We connected.

297
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:46,405
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

298
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,916
I guess I was just thinking
of a guy I kind of like.

299
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:52,160
Let me guess.

300
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:58,228
He is an arrogant, self-hating
narcissist who just needs to be loved.

301
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:02,243
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Nobody better.

302
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:05,826
Hey, stud?

303
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,745
Thank you for not asking me
to help on the Bober thing.

304
00:17:08,954 --> 00:17:11,548
I would've,
but it would've been pointless.

305
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:14,706
Turns out, you're a very
predictable woman there.

306
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:17,716
- Please.
- I know you.

307
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:21,709
You're gonna walk into that boardroom
tonight all tall and strong,

308
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:26,836
and then you're gonna sit back and just
pray that nobody asks your opinion.

309
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:29,130
I mean, I'm sure
you probably think

310
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:32,265
that your little visits here
are a spontaneous surprise,

311
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:35,389
but did you ever wonder
why the only two candles I own

312
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:37,721
are already lit
when you walk in that door?

313
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:40,857
I mean, doll, I hate to tell you this,
but I don't walk around

314
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:43,663
all day with cologne
down in my engine room.

315
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:46,537
I'm not that guy.

316
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:48,936
Some people like reliability.

317
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,270
In a sedan, it turns out it's terrific.

318
00:17:52,497 --> 00:17:56,615
Cheers.
Here's the good news, however.

319
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,806
Turns out it's never too late
to turn the whole thing around.

320
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,686
Really?

321
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:06,595
All you gotta do
is stir it up a little bit.

322
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:09,317
- Stir it up?
- Stir it right the hell up.

323
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:13,553
- I'll try to remember that.
- So I'm guessing

324
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,120
I'll be seeing you
in about 11 days, right?

325
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,090
Probably at the exact same time.

326
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:25,697
Don't forget to stir it up, baby.

327
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:32,056
<i>And so it comes down to this,</i>

328
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:35,920
<i>the hospital board meeting</i>
<i>to decide Mr Bober's fate.</i>

329
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,202
<i>And in a weird way, ours too.</i>

330
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,287
<i>As cheesy as it sounds,</i>

331
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,805
<i>I think we knew</i>
<i>we were all gonna be OK.</i>

332
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:15,349
Hi, Mr Bober.

333
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,815
<i>Still, I've had this feeling</i>
<i>that I'm forgetting something.</i>

334
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:20,441
Hey!

335
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:22,860
Congratulations
on becoming a resident.

336
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:24,445
Glad I could help.

337
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:28,025
Help? You were awful to me.

338
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,216
You... awful.

339
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:33,424
Anyway, go get 'em, tiger.

340
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:39,400
The world is your oyster, my friend.
What?

341
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:42,964
It's my first day.
I'm waiting for someone.

342
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:45,022
This door is broke.

343
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:47,548
Every fifth time or so,
it don't open.

344
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:50,092
Maybe there's a paper clip
stuck in there.

345
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:56,463
- Why a paper clip?
- I was just making small talk.

346
00:19:56,705 --> 00:20:00,220
- Did you put a paper clip in there?
- No.

347
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:03,496
If I find a paper clip...

348
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:06,272
...you're goin' down.

349
00:20:06,465 --> 00:20:09,616
- Here's to the new residents!
- Here, here!

350
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:12,152
- I'm a doctor!
- <i>It's been a long year,</i>

351
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:15,178
<i>but the important thing is,</i>
<i>we got through it together.</i>

352
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,302
- <i>We were a family.</i>
- Hey, everyone.

353
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,748
- Oh, hi.
- How are you?

354
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:23,849
Ms Sullivan, thank you
for helping us with Mr Bober.

355
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:27,614
Don't mention it. Even though
I wasn't invited to your party,

356
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:31,012
- I brought presents for everyone.
- Brace yourself, newbie.

357
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,912
Carla, my ex-husband
is in love with you.

358
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:37,075
It's true.
Ask your boyfriend. He knows.

359
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:39,243
He and Perry
talk about it all the time.

360
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:42,008
I don't know why you haven't
mentioned this to her.

361
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:44,962
Perhaps you're afraid
of something. Huh.

362
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,162
And, Bob, when are you gonna
tell Perry that that promotion

363
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:52,738
you're making him jump through
hoops for was filled months ago?

364
00:20:53,011 --> 00:20:56,401
It just seems wrong.
Which brings us to Twinkie.

365
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,110
If you don't have the courage
to tell your ''colleague'' Dr Dorian

366
00:21:00,352 --> 00:21:02,343
that you're still crazy about him,

367
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:06,036
I'm gonna do it for you,
cos that's what friends do. Yeah.

368
00:21:06,274 --> 00:21:09,425
And finally, Perry,

369
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:11,769
you are not gonna
believe what happened

370
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:14,586
the first time I met
your little protégé here.

371
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:17,297
<i>Oh, please, God, no.</i>

372
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:21,612
I slept with him,
and it was good.

373
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:24,433
How's that for stirring things up?

374
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:29,222
Have a great summer, everyone. Bye.

375
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:13,353
<i>Yup. One big happy family.</i>

376
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
