1
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:05,950
Nothing. Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing.

2
00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:12,772
I can see.

3
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:17,637
Come on. Let's get out of here.
There's something to do.

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,030
There's film festivals,
theatre, there's museums.

5
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:23,725
Let's get out and get some culture.

6
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:25,804
Let's put Rowdy on top of the TV

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,359
and see who can
throw a hat on him first.

8
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:31,673
<i>Turk turns everything</i>
<i>into a competition.</i>

9
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:33,884
<i>It can get annoying.</i>

10
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:38,138
Let's play ''Steak''.

11
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:41,433
The first person
to finish their steak is the winner.

12
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:44,213
I paid $17 for this steak,
and I'm not...

13
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:47,940
You want some?

14
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,030
''Ankles'' is a simple game.

15
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:56,118
The first one to get embarrassed
and pull up their scrubs loses.

16
00:00:56,376 --> 00:01:00,130
<i>The problem is, these stupid games</i>
<i>always end the same way.</i>

17
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:03,659
Say it!

18
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,163
Say it!

19
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:14,283
Just say it.

20
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:17,150
- I'm your bitch.
- Yes, you are.

21
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,794
Now, sit back baby,
cos <i>Iron Chef</i> is on.

22
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,710
- I win.
- I wasn't racing.

23
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:41,470
- I was just walking in.
- Good clean win, T-Dog.

24
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:45,505
Now, let's go down to the caf
and get our doughnut on.

25
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:47,510
It wasn't a race!

26
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:50,475
OK, fine!
Let's just play...

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,671
Let's play
''Tip Over the Trash Can''.

28
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:54,840
OK? I win.

29
00:01:56,894 --> 00:02:00,364
- I win.
- Can I play?

30
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:06,097
- This is fun.
- Yeah.

31
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:11,421
Sorry to keep you, Mr Kelly.
I was just...

32
00:02:21,002 --> 00:02:24,677
So, what, are you sick or something?

33
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:28,393
My heartbeat, it's like,
it's irregular.

34
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:30,910
- What's the medical word?
- Irregular.

35
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:32,813
Yeah. That's it.

36
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:37,170
Of course. The heart.
The old ticker.

37
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:39,266
You're my doctor?

38
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:42,634
I have something for you in my pants.

39
00:02:42,857 --> 00:02:44,688
No. Not...

40
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:47,054
I'm not wearing any pants right now.

41
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:52,311
My pants are over there, and there's
a note from my GP in the pocket.

42
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:57,087
If you guys need me, I'll be under here.

43
00:02:57,288 --> 00:03:02,282
I'm in love with that guy and if I don't
sleep with him, I'll kill myself.

44
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:05,383
It's inappropriate
to jump a patient, isn't it?

45
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:07,146
- Totally.
- Ever done it?

46
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:09,573
- Tons of times.
- ''Tons of times'' what?

47
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,750
Nothing, baby.

48
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:16,354
Why hasn't he had a surgical consult?
I'm sorry. That's my fault.

49
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,115
I didn't make it clear how I feel about
things that should already be done.

50
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:25,025
I almost always wish
things were done already.

51
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:28,108
Mr Hoffner asked for all his options.

52
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,278
- He never asked for a surgical consult.
- Could I have a surgical consult?

53
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:35,444
You may have whatever you want.

54
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:41,204
How is that helpful? Do you get
the doctor-patient relationship?

55
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,334
We're supposed to be a team.

56
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:46,493
You and me? We're gonna get killed.

57
00:03:50,883 --> 00:03:55,001
For the love of Our Lady
of Guadalupe, that is a fine brew.

58
00:03:55,263 --> 00:03:57,493
- It's just coffee.
- Oh, no.

59
00:03:57,682 --> 00:04:01,197
This is liquid crack.
This is a mug full of sunshine.

60
00:04:01,436 --> 00:04:04,508
My dear, for me, this is like sex.

61
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:07,689
Is that why you always
finish so quickly?

62
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:10,210
And sassy too.
If you could cook a steak,

63
00:04:10,403 --> 00:04:12,553
I'd eat it right off your bottom.

64
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:17,938
Ladies. This is that beverage
I've been trying to describe to you,

65
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:20,474
and it turns out, this is weird,

66
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:24,178
but the secret is,
you grind it from beans, not crap.

67
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:26,567
I'll grind your beans.

68
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:29,551
When are we gonna get it over with?

69
00:04:29,756 --> 00:04:34,671
We are already understaffed, and
Dr Kelso fired two nurses for no reason.

70
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:39,804
Forgive us if we don't have time
for the Dr Cox show today.

71
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:42,215
We have to reschedule every nurse.

72
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:45,430
- What'll we do about ICU...
- We don't need them.

73
00:04:45,647 --> 00:04:48,286
<i>Here's the problem</i>
<i>with a surgical consult.</i>

74
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:53,079
<i>Mr Hoffner should be treated medically,</i>
<i>but a surgeon will want to slice him.</i>

75
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:57,151
<i>Surgical and medical interns</i>
<i>are like two rival gangs.</i>

76
00:04:57,408 --> 00:05:01,879
<i>Not real gangs. More like those cheesy</i>
<i>gangs you see in Broadway musicals.</i>

77
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:24,603
<i>Surgical, medical, surgical, yeah!</i>

78
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:29,243
<i>Still, I knew there was</i>
<i>one surgical intern I could count on.</i>

79
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:36,072
<i>If you have some moles</i>
<i>I will inspect them</i>

80
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:40,076
<i>I'll remove tumours from</i>
<i>your brain to your rectum</i>

81
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:43,875
<i>Between the two of us</i>
<i>there is no wall</i>

82
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:46,352
<i>We're a surgeon and a doc</i>

83
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:50,773
<i>Above it all</i>

84
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:54,632
<i>A surgeon and a doc</i>

85
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:58,872
<i>Above it</i>

86
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:01,571
<i>All</i>

87
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,622
No problem. Whatever you want me
to tell your patient, I'm your guy.

88
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:17,800
- How are you feeling?
- I'm not tired.

89
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:20,989
Stress tests are supposed to be hard.

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,158
It helps if you visualise
running toward something,

91
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,203
- like your girlfriend.
- I don't have a girlfriend.

92
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:29,451
How could you possibly be single?

93
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:32,265
I don't know.
I'm kind of anal and neurotic.

94
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:34,293
My God. Me too.

95
00:06:34,464 --> 00:06:35,738
- Really?
- Please!

96
00:06:35,882 --> 00:06:39,238
I like to keep my pens in order
from least to most ink.

97
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:43,348
That is hot.
I guess the truth is that

98
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:45,589
I don't go out a lot, you know?

99
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:47,803
I always seem to
put my foot in my mouth.

100
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:50,491
I'd let you put your foot in my mouth.

101
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:52,679
What?

102
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:55,742
I said I'd let you put
your foot in my mouth.

103
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:58,412
That's weird.

104
00:06:58,613 --> 00:07:00,365
I know.

105
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:12,768
Who gets to tell us the symptoms
of Ménière's disease?

106
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:23,422
- Dr Murphy.
- Can you use it in a sentence?

107
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,433
Sorry to interrupt you there,

108
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:30,554
but I gotta ask you a quick question.
Now, when you were born, nay,

109
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:32,848
spawned by the Dark Prince himself,

110
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:36,935
did he forget to give you a hug
before he sent you along your way?

111
00:07:37,193 --> 00:07:41,391
Because you can't just let nurses go
on account of feeling insignificant.

112
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:43,772
And besides, with your money,

113
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,226
you ought to be able to keep a man
tucked away in the closet

114
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:51,924
and bring him out when you want to
knock him around.

115
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,199
As you were.

116
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:01,168
Doug, look away.

117
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:04,103
I can't.

118
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,019
- What are you serving for dinner?
- That's not really my area.

119
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:12,827
I'd like chicken.

120
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,494
Mr Hoffner,
here's your surgical consult.

121
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:22,091
But he's gonna agree with the medical
course I set for you. Now, Dr Turk,

122
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:26,000
tell Mr Hoffner whether or not
you think he should have surgery.

123
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:28,233
I think he should have surgery.

124
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:31,323
<i>The important thing</i>
<i>is that we're professionals,</i>

125
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:34,576
<i>and we should behave as such</i>
<i>in front of the patient.</i>

126
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,792
No! Tell me he did not fire her.

127
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:46,081
You had to show up Kelso
and now another nurse is out of a job.

128
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:48,735
- I went to confront...
- Am I done?

129
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:50,331
You don't look done.

130
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:53,751
- You know what your problem is?
- I put myself...

131
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:57,175
Who answers that question?
That is your problem.

132
00:08:57,398 --> 00:08:59,992
You think you have
the answers to everything,

133
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:04,550
but end up throwing gas on the fire,
and everyone pays the consequences.

134
00:09:04,822 --> 00:09:07,052
That's what I was going to say.

135
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:09,551
Carla, can I talk to you for a second?

136
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:11,939
My God, Barbie needs you.

137
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:14,157
To be continued.

138
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,902
Why hasn't he asked me out? I'm single.
I mentioned five movies I want to see.

139
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:26,291
I drop things so when I pick them up,
he can see I'm flexible.

140
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:30,026
Elliot, these things
take time and self-respect.

141
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,096
So we're going to focus on time.

142
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:35,703
- Nobody likes me when they meet me.
- Exactly!

143
00:09:35,937 --> 00:09:38,132
I'm helping.

144
00:09:38,314 --> 00:09:41,511
- We've got all the time in the world.
- Right.

145
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:45,143
- No.
- I knew it.

146
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:48,552
I'm dying.
I was exhausted on that treadmill.

147
00:09:48,783 --> 00:09:51,422
I should have said something.
But I never do.

148
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:56,488
Not when it comes to my well-being.
And now I'm getting a pig heart.

149
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,907
You're perfect.

150
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:02,202
You're free to go. Today.

151
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:06,476
- That seems like good news.
- Best news ever.

152
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,513
Dropped my clipboard.
I'll just...

153
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:18,442
Do I need to sign something?

154
00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:23,398
- You were going to back me up.
- He's had colitis for ten years.

155
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:27,606
And no girlfriends.
It's a gassy disease.

156
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:32,574
- You can't consider it a reoccurrence.
- He's high risk for colon cancer.

157
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:35,781
- Give him frequent colonoscopies.
- How frequent?

158
00:10:35,997 --> 00:10:38,352
You're turning this into a competition.

159
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,294
Luckily, it's not up to you.
It's up to Mr Hoffner.

160
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:42,981
I'm going with surgery.

161
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:46,007
- You're getting meat for dinner.
- I eat chicken.

162
00:10:46,215 --> 00:10:48,285
I'll set it up.

163
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,925
- Say it!
- I'm your bitch.

164
00:11:07,237 --> 00:11:09,307
<i>I'm not gonna let Turk beat me.</i>

165
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:12,128
<i>I'm gonna fight back,</i>
<i>and you want to know how?</i>

166
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:13,724
<i>I'm telling.</i>

167
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:15,699
Dr Cox?

168
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,525
He stole my patient.

169
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:22,824
And then, and then...

170
00:11:23,044 --> 00:11:25,353
It's OK, Jumbo.

171
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:29,016
Now, who's my big boy?

172
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:31,727
- I am!
- You're my big boy!

173
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:34,158
- You're my big boy.
- I'm your big...

174
00:11:34,347 --> 00:11:38,579
Good God, newbie, do you think
you're the only one with problems here?

175
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:41,968
Give me a break. Watch this.
Pick a nurse, any nurse.

176
00:11:42,188 --> 00:11:45,578
Laverne, when you get a chance,
could you grab a file for me?

177
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:48,172
- Grab these.
- Rough all over.

178
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:51,910
So don't talk to me, Joanie.
Just go talk to your patient.

179
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:53,589
Go.

180
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:59,834
- What's up, Benedict?
- What?

181
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,392
Benedict Arnold?

182
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:06,331
- That's the lamest smack talk.
- That's not what the redcoats thought.

183
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:08,347
You went colonial on his ass.

184
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:11,657
So you're gonna go under the knife
just cos he told you to?

185
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:15,877
- No, I spoke to some other people.
- Like who?

186
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,573
All fixed.

187
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:22,645
- He's a janitor.
- Yeah, but he seems confident.

188
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,379
What are you gonna do,
take a swing at me?

189
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:41,969
- Maybe.
- Well, if you do, I'd better die.

190
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,202
Because if I don't,
I will be coming for you.

191
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:47,659
Good cake today.

192
00:12:47,837 --> 00:12:52,228
You fired a dear, dear friend of mine.
That woman was like family.

193
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:55,466
- Who?
- I'll tell you who.

194
00:12:58,723 --> 00:12:59,951
Coffee Nurse.

195
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:03,887
When you fired Coffee Nurse,
you made this whole thing personal.

196
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:05,703
No, you made it personal.

197
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:08,733
You gave me lip yesterday
in front of the interns.

198
00:13:08,942 --> 00:13:11,740
You know why I laid off
those first two nurses?

199
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:16,575
Budgetary constraints forced a cut,
and those two had negative reports.

200
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:20,302
And you think I did it
to make myself happy.

201
00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:25,064
I wouldn't notice
if they all caught on fire.

202
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,727
Then why in God's name
did you axe Coffee Nurse?

203
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:30,953
Because you were being an ass.

204
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,281
You're right, that was personal.
My bad.

205
00:13:36,594 --> 00:13:39,631
Golly, I do love moist cake.

206
00:13:45,562 --> 00:13:48,360
Where are you going?
You're not off 'til midnight.

207
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:52,001
It's my last chance,
and Sean's only seen me skanked out.

208
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:54,590
Does it look like I'm trying too hard?

209
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,134
No. Do you need me
to ice up your nipples?

210
00:13:57,323 --> 00:14:00,554
- What would that do?
- Go get him, tiger.

211
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:11,531
Dr Reid, we need help
with one of your patients.

212
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:22,114
I'm just a janitor. I don't know much.
But I do know this:

213
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,381
You need surgery.

214
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,197
<i>What?</i>

215
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:39,623
How's it going?

216
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:42,657
It's good. Yeah, it's good.

217
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:44,825
You have something on your cheek.

218
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:47,874
Yeah, that's just...

219
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,931
That's poo.

220
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:54,323
You know what they say, right?

221
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:57,224
Because everybody poops. I just did.

222
00:14:57,425 --> 00:15:01,498
Earlier. Not this second.
But down there, I pooped.

223
00:15:01,763 --> 00:15:04,914
That is so cool
that you can just talk about it.

224
00:15:05,141 --> 00:15:07,177
Really?

225
00:15:07,352 --> 00:15:09,582
Yeah, I love to poop.

226
00:15:10,396 --> 00:15:12,546
Dr Dorian, present your patient.

227
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:14,609
Yes, sir.

228
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:17,165
The patient presented in DKA,

229
00:15:17,362 --> 00:15:20,160
which is why I've started him
on an insulin drip...

230
00:15:20,365 --> 00:15:24,278
Don't bother.
I'm gonna go in for surgery.

231
00:15:24,535 --> 00:15:26,446
Me too.

232
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:29,738
I'm having surgery right now,
and loving it.

233
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,189
Let's get you out of your skin.

234
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:36,855
Bob, could I talk to you for a sec?

235
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:45,982
Can I let my mind wander,
or are we doing something?

236
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:48,579
I just wanted to say that I'm...

237
00:15:49,894 --> 00:15:52,692
- I'm sorry.
- Holy crap.

238
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:55,491
My bad behaviour is my own doing.

239
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:58,604
I don't think a nurse should
suffer on account of it.

240
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,972
- Then I'll make it right...
- Thank you.

241
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:07,393
...if you will apologise again
so the interns can hear.

242
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,653
Your call, Perry.

243
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,242
Dr Kelso.

244
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,015
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

245
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:29,132
- Doug, for God's sakes.
- I don't care. It's beautiful, man.

246
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:37,875
I cannot believe I talked to Sean
about poo for ten minutes.

247
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:41,545
- Relax. Nobody knows.
- Hey, Poopie.

248
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:44,418
At one point,
I tried changing the subject to art.

249
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:48,894
But we went from art to artists
to alcohol to coffee,

250
00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:52,199
and that just led right back to poo.

251
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:57,045
You know the saying, ''No one will love
you until you learn to love yourself" ?

252
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:59,931
My mother used to say,
''No one will love you''.

253
00:17:00,131 --> 00:17:03,680
Fake it. Don't let him see
what a neurotic mess you are.

254
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:06,600
You see Turk over there?

255
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:13,050
He doesn't know I cry sometimes because
I'm not sure there's a cat heaven.

256
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:18,184
It's hiding the crazy and acting like
the most confident girl in the room.

257
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,474
No problem.

258
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,519
<i>I too decided it was time to act</i>
<i>confident and face things head-on.</i>

259
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:31,613
That was my patient, Turk.
I brought you in as my friend.

260
00:17:31,871 --> 00:17:35,989
You're so competitive, you just
take him from me? That sucks.

261
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:38,719
- Tough.
- Excuse me?

262
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,879
You're damn right I'm competitive.
That's what makes me a good doctor.

263
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:46,920
I want to win at everything,
every day, and you should too.

264
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:49,328
That sounds like a great friendship.

265
00:17:49,514 --> 00:17:54,793
If you don't want to play ''Steak'', fine.
This has nothing to do with friendship.

266
00:17:55,103 --> 00:18:00,894
You're angry at yourself because you
couldn't get the guy to believe in you.

267
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:04,112
He never got the concept of the team.

268
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,311
I know.

269
00:18:07,073 --> 00:18:09,268
Have a cookie, man.

270
00:18:13,246 --> 00:18:16,955
- I win at ''Cookie''?
- Yeah.

271
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:21,087
- Thanks again, sir.
- No matter what the board says,

272
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:25,649
I'm not going to let someone like you
get away. Not without a fight.

273
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:31,704
You think she doesn't see through you?
These people know who really cares.

274
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:36,091
- You and Jennifer are pretty tight?
- Hell, yeah.

275
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:38,946
Jenny. Gosh, I'm glad you're back.

276
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:41,138
Thanks. My name's Patti.

277
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:45,168
Fool.

278
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:53,411
Sean?

279
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,585
Sean, wait.

280
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:06,978
- Is that...
- No!

281
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:11,407
No. This is just muddy water. See?

282
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,594
- You just tasted muddy water.
- I know. That was weird.

283
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,879
You're like, the best doctor ever.

284
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:35,544
- Why didn't you ask me out?
- Are you kidding?

285
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:39,704
I was laying there, pants-less,
with crusties in my nose, and I just...

286
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,949
- Ask me out this minute.
- Yes, ma'am.

287
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:44,560
Do you want to go out with me, Elliot?

288
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:47,738
Yes.

289
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:51,431
<i>When most of your time</i>
<i>is spent fighting death and illness,</i>

290
00:19:51,678 --> 00:19:56,149
<i>you look for any victory you can get,</i>
<i>even a victory over your own self-doubt.</i>

291
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:59,230
- How cool was that?
- OK, cool it.

292
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:03,231
- I'll check you later.
- Check you later.

293
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,237
I'm OK.

294
00:20:09,404 --> 00:20:10,883
Bye.

295
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,669
You two are perfect for each other.

296
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,531
I got a date. I got a date.

297
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:26,774
<i>Sometimes your ego leads you</i>
<i>into battles you can't possibly win.</i>

298
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:37,072
<i>And sometimes you have to admit that</i>
<i>feeling competitive isn't a bad thing.</i>

299
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:40,818
<i>If you believe you're right,</i>
<i>you have to fight for it.</i>

300
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:45,292
I know it's the right way to go, and
I am not gonna take no for an answer.

301
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:47,795
So what do you say?

302
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:52,954
Let's do it.

303
00:20:55,116 --> 00:20:57,311
You won. Now beat it.

304
00:20:57,493 --> 00:20:59,484
- What?
- Go.

305
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:03,720
Let's get you some sherbet.

306
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:07,432
<i>Bottom line, when the stakes are high,</i>
<i>go for the win.</i>

307
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,389
<i>As long as you don't</i>
<i>get caught up in the petty stuff.</i>

308
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,947
Newbie, if we lose to these cutters,
don't bother showing up tomorrow.

309
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:18,017
I don't want to beat them.
I want to embarrass them.

310
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:31,459
And go!
