<i>With all the bureaucracy
in the hospital,</i>

2
00:00:02,762 --> 00:00:05,370
<i>sometimes you have to bend
the rules to help a patient.</i>

00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:07,776
<i>Unfortunately, the new
Chief of Medicine didn't like it</i>

4
00:00:07,876 --> 00:00:09,211

00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:13,390
Uh, nothing, I'm just, uh...

9
00:00:18,682 --> 00:00:19,724
That's not right!

<i>Even the O.R!</i>

13
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,655
Thanks for letting
me observe, fellas.

14
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,259
Come on,
you got five more surgeries today!

15
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:32,873
Tumour's down by his bean bags!

16
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:35,360
We should probably take that out.

17
00:00:35,838 --> 00:00:38,339
It's like, all of a sudden,
this hospital is a police state.

18
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:39,158
I mean,
next thing you know,

19
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:41,126
they're gonna be charging doctors
for candy at the gift shop.

20
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,875
They do charge doctors for
candy at the gift shop, Elliot.

21
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:44,760
Really?

22
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:47,035
Then, why does Johann always let me--

23
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:50,265
Because he wants to make you his
wife and bring you back to Estonia.

24
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:53,901
That's why he's always asking me
if I'm comfortable around oxen.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,384
Elliot, I'm trying to
talk to you about Maddox

26
00:00:55,434 --> 00:00:57,032
and how we can't work the system anymore.

27
00:00:57,417 --> 00:00:58,459
Correction:

28
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:00,681
You can't work the system anymore.

29
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:02,522
I, can.

30
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,596
For instance, I just got Mr. Tillman
back there into a clinical trial

31
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:08,965
that has a cut-off age of 30.
He's actually 35.

32
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:11,873
But if anyone asks Mr. Tillman,
you're how old?

33
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,109
35!

34
00:01:13,503 --> 00:01:15,014
I forgot to mention

35
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,280
that it is a clinical
trial for head injuries.

36
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:19,034
- Ah, he hurt his head.
- Ah!

37
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:20,649
The point is,

38
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:24,053
that I'm still able to give
top-notch care to my patients,

39
00:01:24,132 --> 00:01:25,954
whereas you, are not.

40
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,673
35!

41
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:29,854
You know why?

42
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:32,876
I am a much, much
better doctor than you.

43
00:01:35,183 --> 00:01:37,968
Ooh, look at that big lollipop!

44
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:39,811
I wouldn't know whether I'll lick it

45
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,053
or that it'd just lift up my
skirt and spank myself with it.

46
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:44,436
Elliot!

47
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:45,584
It's free candy!

48
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,614
Dr. Reid, I thought you gave a great
endocrynology lecture today,

49
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:54,582
even though some of the other interns think
you go of on personal tangents too much.

50
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:55,503
Who?

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,234
Oh, I shouldn't say.

52
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,088
Denise.

53
00:01:58,122 --> 00:01:58,817
Anyway, I was hoping

54
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:01,348
you could have signed me some
more interesting procedures?

55
00:02:01,383 --> 00:02:02,351
Rain it in...

56
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,080
Katie.

57
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:05,303
Just go place a
central line on Mr. Clark.

58
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:06,349
Thanks!

59
00:02:06,384 --> 00:02:07,461
Wow!

60
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:09,332
The butt-kissing isn't even the worst part.

61
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:11,780
I feel like Katie will do
anything to get ahead, you know.

62
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:13,778
I'm this close to
freezing her olive (sp?).

63
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:16,126
Just like I did Dr. Simmons.

64
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:18,047
Yeah,
what would you do with her?

65
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:21,391
Hello, she wears the exact
same thing as me everyday.

66
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:22,120
Yeah,

67
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:23,996
we're talking about you, skank!

68
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:25,775
Nice dress!

69
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:29,752
Veronica, I have no idea how are
you doing this! But I will find out.

70
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,787
35!

71
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,402
Hi, Mr. Tillman.

72
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:36,243
You ready to go to work?

73
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,690
Hello, Mr. Rosell!

74
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,079
You can call me Pat.

75
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:41,902
This is my daughter Christine.

76
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:44,080
So Pat, I understand that you
have multiple sclerosis

77
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:46,373
and that you are interested
being put on Interferon.

78
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,318
I held off
as long as I could but,

79
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:51,687
now the hand spasms and
the nausea are pretty bad.

80
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,146
Plus, I'm colour-blind.

81
00:02:53,284 --> 00:02:55,542
Well, we're gonna go run
a whole bunch of tests.

82
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:57,299
<i>And get some coffee.</i>

83
00:02:58,259 --> 00:02:58,990
Oh!

84
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:01,247
Dammit!

85
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:02,654
Now I have to go change.

86
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:04,651
So,

87
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:05,849
how you holding up?

88
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:08,959
Cleaning's an art,
my mop was my paintbrush.

89
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:12,450
<i>Oh no, it's the first time I've
seen the janitor since he was fired.</i>

90
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:14,169
<i>I have to seem like I care.</i>

91
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:15,784
<i>Think of the saddest thing you can.</i>

92
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:19,613
<i>Turk's dead, Turk's dead,
Turk's dead, Turk's de--</i>

93
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:21,123
<i>Oh my God!</i>

94
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:22,572
<i>What if something
really happened to him?</i>

95
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:23,476
<i>I'd be lost!</i>

96
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:25,716
<i>Stop thinking like that,
Turk's fine!</i>

97
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:27,886
<i>Turk's fine, Turk's fine,
Turk's fine, Turk's fine!</i>

98
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:29,171
JD!

99
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,134
The janitor got fired.

100
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:32,673
No, it's okay.

101
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:34,896
He knows,
he just doesn't care.

102
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:37,441
See, in his mind, I'm the
bad guy in our relationship,

103
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:39,526
even though if he stopped to think
about it for a minute, he would realise

104
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:41,634
I never did a thing to
him that he didn't deserve.

105
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:43,910
You locked me in a water tower!

106
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:45,177
You were on the wall.

107
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:47,140
You destroyed my scooter, Sasha!

108
00:03:47,174 --> 00:03:48,675
You know I hate Wednesdays.

109
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:50,753
You haunted my pediatric patients.

110
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:53,462
You didn't wear the shorts that
my imaginary wife made for you.

111
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:56,152
Janitor, I just heard.
I'm so sorry!

112
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:57,750
What?

113
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,052
'Sup?

114
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:02,640
Oh, come on!
How's that even possible?

119
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,281
Hey!

120
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:23,667
Thanks for placing that
central line for me.

121
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,498
I'm just so not great at
that procedure, you know.

122
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:28,157
Look at you,

123
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:32,598
watching over the ICU like a proud
lioness looking out over her jungle.

124
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:34,282
Elliot, stop.

125
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:36,394
Oh my God,
that wasn't a real 'stop',

126
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:39,503
that was a 'keep going because
I'm actually loving this stop', wasn't it?

127
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:41,211
Maybe...

128
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,549
I never got one of these before!
This is so exciting!

129
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,321
I'll leave before I ruin it.

130
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:51,312
Great job on
Mr. Clark's central line.

131
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:53,170
Thanks, it was super easy.

132
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:59,771
Okay Mr. Rosell,
let's get you on in some Interferon.

133
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:03,748
So it can start interferring
with that pesky MS of yours.

134
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:06,142
Are you making fun
of my multiple sclerosis?

135
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:06,941
Sorry, I mean...

136
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:10,258
I'm just trying to lighten the moment.
It won't happen again, I promise.

137
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:14,286
<i>Interferon, sounds like the name of
a robot that always gets in the way.</i>

138
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,603
So we brought you some pills
for your pain and your nausea.

139
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:17,940
Dr. Dorian?

140
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:21,439
- JD. Pills.
- Right, pills.

141
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,618
Take the red one now
for the pain.

142
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:28,375
Mr. Rosell took the red pill.

143
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:29,816
Yeah, we told him to.

144
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:33,151
If he can't see colours,
how did he know which one is red?

145
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:36,858
He's just another addict
scamming us for meds.

146
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:39,081
Frick on a stick!

147
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:44,240
Looking for something?

148
00:05:44,397 --> 00:05:46,324
Yes, my 'Cloak of Invisibility',

149
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:50,231
so that I can avoid conversations with
soul-less dictators such as yourself.

150
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,254
Unfortunately,
it's really hard to find,

151
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:54,407
because as the name suggests,

152
00:05:54,494 --> 00:05:55,901
it's invisible.

153
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:58,013
Alright, Dr. Cox.

154
00:05:58,117 --> 00:05:59,402
Ridiculous name,
by the way.

155
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,030
If you're looking for your patient
Mr. Tillman,

156
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,868
my guess is he's probably in a
bus somewhere, screaming, "35!".

157
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:07,787
See, I've anounced him
from his head trauma trial

158
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:11,434
because I learned that
somebody was lying about his age.

159
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:13,214
See ya!

160
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,423
I gotta get rid of this Maddox.
Honest to God, she is...

161
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:21,333
Why aren't you listening to me?

162
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,985
Because of that.

163
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,076
That scone looks good.

164
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:27,194
Oh yeah?

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,292
We should have sex later.

166
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:37,296
How did you get from
that image to that thought?

167
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:39,491
I'll tell you tonight.

168
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:42,518
Just bring home a scone
and a Hawaiian shirt.

169
00:06:42,872 --> 00:06:45,169
Mama's heating up!

170
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,894
Donnie,

171
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:49,482
do my free muffins per
wife include scones?

172
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:50,489
Nope.

173
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,742
Damn you, God!

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,320
I am getting rid of Maddox.
Who's in?

175
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:57,497
I'm in.

176
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,852
Ever since you fired me,
I've been moping around my apartment,

177
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,014
making parking sounds.

178
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,419
I-I'm not crazy,

179
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:04,981
I just need some human interaction

180
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:08,107
and the barking makes the neighbours yell,
"Shut the damn thing up!"

181
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:11,154
Then I can go over there with a bottle
of scotch and apologize for Rusty,

182
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:12,717
my imaginary akita.

183
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:15,487
The only downside is that about
the time Lady, my girlfriend,

184
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,727
gets home,
I'm too drunk to talk to her.

185
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:19,290
Much less make love.

186
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:23,093
You've never pictured me as an
organism that has sex, have you?

187
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:24,854
- We have not.
- No.

188
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:25,757
I understand.

189
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:28,448
Is Dr. Maddox really that bad?

190
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:31,183
Hmm, she's like you.
Only smarter on the ball.

191
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,712
That must suck!

192
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:35,398
Admit it.

193
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:39,618
You miss having me as the
Chief of Medicine.

194
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,242
Bob!

195
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:43,895
I will gladly admit to
anything that's true,

196
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,202
no matter how embarrasing.

197
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,494
For example,

198
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:49,575
I've always wished that I
could carry a child inside of me,

199
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:51,190
and you know, birth it.

200
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:54,369
But I'll never admit
to missing you, Bob.

201
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,506
Ever.

202
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,808
Rusty, heel!

203
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:00,831
Donnie,

204
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,138
I'm gonna need a Double Chocolate
Blaster as a 'pick-me-up'.

205
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:08,290
Maybe another.

206
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:12,588
Hello, girls.

207
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:15,363
Oh, sit down, Katie,
sit down!

208
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,295
It's time to set you straight!

209
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,418
But we'd better do it fast because,
man, you're annoying.

210
00:08:20,423 --> 00:08:23,027
Why do you think you
can talk to me like this?

211
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,573
You're just a nurse.

212
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:25,858
Okay.

213
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:26,622
A:

214
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:28,193
I'm a lioness.

215
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,096
B:

216
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:32,066
Who the hell do you think
runs this place?

217
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:34,766
The nursing staff is
already turned on you.

218
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:38,699
Why do you think you were assigned
75 baldous impactions (sp?) this week?

219
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:40,835
I don't care, I'm good at it.

220
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,988
Plus, this morning,
I found a silver dollar.

221
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:45,940
Everyone's onto you,
missy.

222
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,302
Pretty soon,
you're gonna get called out.

223
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,399
You're lying to us.

224
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:52,518
You took the red pill,
you can see colours.

225
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,496
You know, I'm
sick and tired of low-lifes like you

226
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,907
trying to come here and
squirt pain medication off of us, okay?

227
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,418
You make us care

228
00:09:00,435 --> 00:09:02,867
and then because you're word,
we're gonna see through your little plan.

229
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:04,551
You don't even laugh
at our jokes.

230
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,538
Actually, the Interferon joke
was sort of funny.

231
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:09,776
You damn right it was, Pat!
Okay?

232
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:11,548
But this time,
no one's getting off easy.

233
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:13,076
My cousin is a cop.

234
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:14,569
And not a good cop either,

235
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:15,767
a rogue cop!

236
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,265
- Christine, it's you, isn't it?
- Hold on, hold on Elliot.

237
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,107
You ever watched The Shield, Pat?

238
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,035
Do you happen to get FX, Pat?

239
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:23,902
Because you're gonna get
Michael Chicklest!

240
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,666
In the head!

241
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,096
He's the orange guy
in Fantastic Four;

242
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:28,399
that's coming down on ya!

243
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,250
JD!

244
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:32,037
Look at her hand,
it's in spasm.

245
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:34,590
You're the one who
wants the MS, right?

246
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:38,583
I don't have any insurance and
my dad just thought that since he did--

247
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:40,563
Look, we'll go, alright?

248
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:43,176
If you, uh,
could just not tell anyone,

249
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:44,922
we'd be very grateful.

250
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:47,946
<i>Elliot and I knew
what we had to do.</i>

251
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,509
Okay, Pat.

252
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,776
You have MS.

253
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:54,839
And you're not leaving here
until you get your medication.

254
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:57,479
Thank you.

255
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,070
Do you know how grateful
people would be

256
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:03,525
if you showed them even
a little common decency.

257
00:10:03,682 --> 00:10:06,373
Oh please!
This place is so competitive.

258
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,874
No one looks out
for each other here.

259
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:12,076
Ah, yeah.
This Maddox is a damn sketchy.

260
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,643
I guarantee you will find
something in these files.

261
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:17,228
Hurry up, man,
I don't wanna get busted!

262
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,215
Now listen there, great babe,
I only invited you to help me

263
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:22,082
because it had never dawned
on me that you'd get all

264
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:24,374
panicky over a little
breaking-and-entering.

265
00:10:24,426 --> 00:10:25,520
Actually, I'm not.

266
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:27,430
See, this stuff has
become so mundane to me

267
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:28,924
that I've created a character

268
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,487
who's terrified about
going back to prison.

269
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,477
And through him,

270
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:34,412
I hope to feel once again,
the old rush.

271
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:35,957
You carry on.

272
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:36,870
Good.

273
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:39,058
'Cause I can't go back there, man!

274
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:41,038
Not after what they did to Johnny!

275
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:44,016
Oh Johnny, he was the best.
I wish you knew him.

276
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:48,009
They shaked him with a shiv,

277
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,388
then they shift him with a shick.

278
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,140
Out for a pack of smokes.

279
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:54,520
Johnny,

280
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:57,316
you were too beautiful
for this world, man.

281
00:10:57,828 --> 00:10:59,790
I'll be king in the next!

282
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:03,489
Johnny!

283
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:05,295
Johnny.

284
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:09,515
Hey, guys?

285
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,192
Listen!

286
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:13,058
I popped in here earlier
and not Mr. Rosell

287
00:11:13,075 --> 00:11:15,046
but his daughter showing signs of MS.

288
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:18,606
They were lying to get her the drugs.
Can you believe it?

289
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:19,604
I'm angry!

290
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:21,758
I wanna shake these things!

291
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:22,506
Hard!

292
00:11:22,524 --> 00:11:25,823
Anyway, I played the bad guy for you
and I tossed them out.

293
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:27,872
I love playing the bad guy!

294
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,208
I'd even wear black scrubs
if they made them.

295
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:34,324
Do you even know what people
are calling you around here?

296
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:36,147
I know, I don't care.

297
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:38,961
Because I wrote the worst one
on this piece of paper.

298
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,691
Sausages, sausages
and more sausages?

299
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:46,254
It's actually...

300
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,052
Turk's grocery list.

301
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,101
But you do care,
don't you?

302
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:52,566
Katie, if you keep
going down this road,

303
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,240
eventually,
people will come after you.

304
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,612
Hey, you!

305
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,895
How do you think the board will feel
if I can show 'em proof that

306
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:01,935
you're in the take
for a medical supply company?

307
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:03,484
I'm guessing they'd be thrilled

308
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,523
since I'm rolling that money
back into the hospital's budget.

309
00:12:06,714 --> 00:12:09,250
Please,
stop handcuffing us!

310
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:13,201
You're making it impossible
for us to help our patients.

311
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:17,471
Does anybody else
feel that way?

312
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,842
Great!

313
00:12:21,912 --> 00:12:24,794
Now I don't have to tell you
each individually that, um...

314
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,599
I don't give a rat's hairy ass!

315
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:30,646
It's a huge time-saver!

316
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:32,287
Thanks, gang!

317
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:34,166
And eventually, Katie,

318
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:36,511
everyone here is
gonna hate you.

319
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:40,976
Look, Carla,

320
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:43,199
I appreciate this whole
mother-hen thing...

321
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:43,946
Lioness.

322
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,923
Lioness thing that you've got going
on here, but I don't need your help.

323
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:50,274
Look, I know you think
you're fine on your own,

324
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:54,520
but in order to survive here,
you need to surround yourself with friends.

325
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:56,673
Look over there.

326
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,678
I can count on three
out of four of those people.

327
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,753
I trust them
with all my secrets.

328
00:13:01,776 --> 00:13:02,727
Oh, you guys...

329
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:05,592
Carla had the nastiest sex
dream about the cafeteria lady.

330
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:07,242
Watch how uncomfortable she gets.

331
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:11,915
Nice ear-rings!

332
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:13,556
- Thank you.
- You're welcome!

333
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,595
How are we gonna get
rid of Maddox, Janitor?

334
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:19,668
Would you like to get your
useless ideas out of the way first?

335
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:21,283
Well, thank you, Perry.

336
00:13:21,604 --> 00:13:24,365
Of the top of my head,
I go reindeer stampede.

337
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:25,737
Astronaut attack,

338
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:27,499
barbed-wire chandelier,

339
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:28,611
Photoshop,

340
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:29,992
poisonous sushi--

341
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:32,318
When you said "Photoshop",

342
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:36,208
did you mean use Photoshop to
create an incriminating picture?

343
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:39,481
No. I meant we build
an actual photo shop.

344
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,088
Or a chain of photo shops.

345
00:13:41,122 --> 00:13:42,182
We each manage one.

346
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:46,002
We let time pass. Eventually,
Maddox has to have her film developed.

347
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,043
She comes in,
we all hop out,

348
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,154
yell, "Surprise!"

349
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:51,585
and beat her to death
with pool cues.

350
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:53,547
I'm gonna go ahead
and apologize

351
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:56,776
because it's my fault
that we're back-tracking.

352
00:13:56,846 --> 00:13:58,322
It's okay. I'm not mad.

353
00:13:58,374 --> 00:14:00,773
You guys, let's face it:
Maddox is intouchable.

354
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:03,854
<i>Not true. I know how
to get rid of any woman.</i>

355
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:06,438
Dr. Maddox?

356
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:08,253
I love you.

357
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,406
Excuse me for just a second.

358
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:12,881
Where you going,
I'm telling you that I love you, I...?

359
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,183
Okay.

360
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,526
<i>Too mean, psychée.</i>

361
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:22,953
Admittedly, getting rid of Maddox
is a board issue

362
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:25,888
but as you all know,
I recently retired

363
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:27,451
to become a full-time mom.

364
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,275
<i>Crap, we forgot Jordan's
retirement party last week!</i>

365
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,907
<i>I hope we
weren't the only ones.</i>

366
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:34,186
I really should have
gone to your party.

367
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:35,297
You think?

368
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,509
Afternoon!

369
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:38,992
Power walk, coming through!

370
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:42,507
Why don't you guys just
get him to help you?

371
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,417
He has so much dirt on
all the board members,

372
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:45,789
they'll do whatever he want.

373
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:47,832
She's right Perry,
let's roll!

374
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:53,623
Big cat? I need ya.

375
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,138
If you come with me to Dr. Kelso,
I won't talk to you.

376
00:14:58,172 --> 00:14:59,301
There it is.

377
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,965
Hey, Johann.

378
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,719
Give me some chocolate.

379
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:07,560
Johann, you slut!

380
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,373
These puppies,

381
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:11,970
they pay for themselves.

382
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:14,264
Katie,
what you don't realise--

383
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:15,217
What are we doing here?

384
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:16,738
Are you setting us straight?

385
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:18,022
I'm trying to!

386
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:20,554
Look Katie,
we don't realise--

387
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:21,243
May I cut in?

388
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:22,230
Go ahead.

389
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:25,738
My rules for getting by here

390
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:28,212
are the same as my rules
for getting by in Mexico.

391
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:30,600
One:
Don't drink the water.

392
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,538
Two:
Party till you drop.

393
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:33,359
Three:

394
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:35,964
Everything is negotiable.

395
00:15:36,114 --> 00:15:40,218
So you want me to go coerce the
board and get firing Dr. Maddox.

396
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:41,532
I'll tell you what.

397
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:44,594
I'll think about it over a muffin.
Donnie!

398
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:46,744
Dude!

399
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,448
We need an answer now,
Bob.

400
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:50,585
Fine, I'll do it.

401
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:54,412
If you tell me you
miss having me as chief.

402
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,479
- Oh, so much, sir!
- Oh, so much.

403
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:56,597
I missed your smell!

404
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:57,706
Not you two.

405
00:15:58,955 --> 00:15:59,497
Him!

406
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:02,791
You know,
you hurt my feelings earlier.

407
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:04,253
In my defense,

408
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,621
you are a soul-less creature
from another world

409
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:08,295
who doesn't really have feelings.

410
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:12,420
Thank you, Donnie,
but I'll fight my own battles.

411
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:15,523
You want Maddox gone?

412
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:17,343
Just tell me you miss me.

413
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:18,830
Fine.

414
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,332
But he can't do it in front of people.

415
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:22,311
Everybody out!

416
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:22,994
Go!

417
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:26,957
Actually,
I think I'm going to need

418
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,033
Dr. Reid and Dr. Dorian
here to bear witness.

419
00:16:30,686 --> 00:16:32,709
Barbie! Newbie!
Back in!

420
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:36,820
Calm down, there's like 23
people back in that supply closet.

421
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,617
<i>And then we saw something amazing.</i>

422
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:43,335
<i>Dr. Cox said something
nice to Dr. Kelso.</i>

423
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:45,834
When you were the chief,

424
00:16:45,835 --> 00:16:49,204
you were a jackass and a nightmare
and I hated you in great deal.

425
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:51,053
That's a good start.

426
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,327
But I always sensed...

427
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:56,748
Well, I always sensed

428
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,548
that you were burdened,
by the job

429
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:00,788
but in, what in necessarily,
who you were as a person.

430
00:17:01,057 --> 00:17:01,863
And...

431
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:02,973
Every once in a while,

432
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:05,228
you showed a shred of humanity.

433
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:08,892
Plus you did manage to,
look the other way, a couple of times.

434
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:09,649
That was pretty good.

435
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,819
So for all that stuff, Bob...

436
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:14,366
Yeah.

437
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,305
I miss you.

438
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:19,136
Thank you.

439
00:17:20,434 --> 00:17:21,132
You're welcome.

440
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:22,662
Everybody back!

441
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:26,648
Look, Katie, I've seen all kinds
of people come through this place.

442
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:29,840
Tall, short,
gay, straight,

443
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:30,908
smart,

444
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:32,043
weird...

445
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:37,991
The point is,
this childish, self-centered atittude

446
00:17:37,994 --> 00:17:39,417
you keep throwing
everyone's way

447
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:40,666
is nothing new.

448
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:42,916
You know what's
really driving me crazy?

449
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:45,337
You keep acting
like you know me.

450
00:17:45,694 --> 00:17:47,108
Don't bother with the sob story.

451
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:50,127
I've been here a long time,
I've heard it all before.

452
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:50,915
Really?

453
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:53,676
Because my dad died
when I was six,

454
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:54,745
and to cope,

455
00:17:54,902 --> 00:17:57,289
my mom drank herself
through most of my childhood.

456
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:00,841
No one ever did
anything for me.

457
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:03,690
I've always had
to do it for myself.

458
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:05,662
Oh, Katie.

459
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:07,276
Good, huh?

460
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:09,080
Heard it!

461
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,706
Me...

462
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,549
Did mom.

463
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:12,283
JD--

464
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:13,303
Did dad.

465
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:14,055
Elliot--

466
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:15,591
Emotionally abusive parents.

467
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:16,257
Dr. Cox--

468
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:19,032
Emotionally and physically
abusive dead parents,

469
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,592
which he may have killed,
no one's sure.

470
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:22,604
Look, Katie,

471
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:23,943
now that you're here...

472
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,668
It doesn't matter what
crap you have in your past;

473
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:29,070
all that matters is
that you leave it there.

474
00:18:29,573 --> 00:18:31,723
Because this hospital
is your home now

475
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:33,417
and these people
are your family.

476
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,492
And I can tell you
they will love you

477
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:37,340
unconditionally if you let them.

478
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,880
But if you don't, they...

479
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:40,575
Check that.

480
00:18:42,096 --> 00:18:44,500
We will eat you alive.

481
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:54,557
Hey!

482
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:55,609
Frank!

483
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:58,525
My favourite board member.

484
00:18:58,721 --> 00:18:59,854
Say hi to your wife for me.

485
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:04,814
You remember that trip
we took to Thailand together?

486
00:19:05,831 --> 00:19:08,766
You still keep in touch with
that hermaphrodite you nailed?

487
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:10,857
What was his name?

488
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:12,468
Lou.

489
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:14,230
[ Song: Healed
Artist: Matt Ryd ]

490
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:15,531
<i>The rest was predictable:</i>

491
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:17,347
<i>They fired Maddox...</i>

492
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,537
Oh...

493
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:20,388
So this is where the party is.

494
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:22,727
It's okay,
go on celebrating!

495
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,270
I don't care!

496
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:25,594
I mean, sure,
I've spent the last 3 months

497
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:26,566
building a life here.

498
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:28,241
Buying a condo,

499
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:29,781
finding a school for my kid,

500
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,932
having sex with Mickhead.

501
00:19:32,695 --> 00:19:33,828
But this doesn't
have to end, baby.

502
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:35,423
Oh yes, it does, Walter.

503
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:38,056
You shouldn't have to strangle me
to keep your erection.

504
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,341
I have needs.

505
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:40,776
Anyway,

506
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:42,724
you all think that you've won.

507
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,297
But they're just gonna replace me
with someone exactly like me.

508
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,968
Because nothing ever changes.

509
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:49,575
People don't change.

510
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,055
Relationships don't change.

511
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:54,396
And the medical system
will never change, either.

512
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:56,430
But you guys go ahead
and have fun

513
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:57,517
till the moment he gets here.

514
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:00,442
Should be a great cuppa' days.

515
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:02,279
<i>And then, poof!</i>

516
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,529
<i>She was gone.</i>

517
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:06,847
<i>And I like to think
we proved Maddox wrong</i>

518
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:07,968
<i>those next few days.</i>

519
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:11,460
<i>We found a way to work
around the system.</i>

520
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:13,093
Thanks.

521
00:20:13,657 --> 00:20:14,897
Here's the medicine,
Mr. Rosell.

522
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:17,541
I hope that helps.

523
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,478
<i>A relationship evolved...</i>

524
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,630
Good morning, Bob.

525
00:20:25,694 --> 00:20:26,097
Perry.

526
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:29,454
It just goes to show you
that with a little help,

527
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:30,622
anything can change.

528
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:32,322
Even interns.

529
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:32,992
Dr. Reid?

530
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:37,537
I'm not the one that placed
that central line the other day.

531
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:39,061
