1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:05,430
<i>[J.D.] Work at a hospital long enough,</i>
<i>you get used to anything.</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:10,169
<i>Whether it's Dr. Kim, who makes patients</i>
<i>take their pants off no matter what...</i>

3
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,177
Yep, you've got pink eye.

4
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:14,213
Can I put my pants back on?

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,043
Right after I put some drops in.

6
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,580
<i>Or nobody remembering</i>
<i>Ray Ketay's 80th birthday.</i>

7
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,985
Why aren't you making
a bigger fuss?

8
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,115
Uh, I would have, Mr. Ketay,

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:29,355
but Dr. Reid is throwing a huge
celebration for you later.

10
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,397
<i>[J.D.] I should tell her about that.</i>

11
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:35,366
<i>Truth is, thanks to modern medicine,</i>
<i>80 isn't that big a deal anymore.</i>

12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,993
<i>It's not like the olden days.</i>

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:42,004
Let us not feel sorrow for Bobby Adams.

14
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,135
He was 12. He led a full life.

15
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,111
He will be missed.

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,240
Especially by his
beautiful wife, Jenny,

17
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,683
who stood by him,
even when he turned six,

18
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:54,913
had a mid-life crisis,

19
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,582
and was caught banging one of those
naked people that brought us corn.

20
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,591
I'd be the oldest man
in Pilgrim Village.

21
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,187
<i>[J.D.] Still, you should</i>
<i>always celebrate life</i>

22
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,200
<i>because you never know when</i>
<i>it will throw you a curveball.</i>

23
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,826
<i>Like with Dr. Cox.</i>

24
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,736
<i>He recently made a decision</i>
<i>any doctor would have made,</i>

25
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,570
<i>and because of it,</i>
<i>three patients died.</i>

26
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,306
<i>At first, he was inconsolably sad.</i>

27
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,708
<i>After that, he started acting out.</i>

28
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:34,015
In his defense, he did ask
for dressing on the side.

29
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,224
Daphne!

30
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,493
I heard that he attacked
one of the busboys.

31
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,127
Yeah, I heard he
bitch-slapped the maitre d'.

32
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:46,000
Enough, gang.
That's how rumors get started.

33
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,768
Gloria, I made a joke that
you hooked up with Leonard,

34
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,608
the security guard with the hook-hand,
now everyone thinks it's true.

35
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,206
It is true. And I'm never going back.

36
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,147
Gloria!
[Makes kissing sound]

37
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,378
[Kissing sound]

38
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,386
I love me some white meat.

39
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:06,522
OK... well, make sure you put
antiseptic on any puncture wounds, OK?

40
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:10,154
Now I know Dr. Cox seems
crazy mad at the world right now,

41
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,629
but let's remember,
three patients died.

42
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:15,292
What's amazing is that
he can take a hit like that,

43
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,665
one that would knock any of us
out for good,

44
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,671
and come out still standing.

45
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,902
That's why the man's an inspiration.
I mean, he is a rock.

46
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,910
<i>- [Pager beeping]</i>
- Yep, he's the best damn doctor here.

47
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,346
Newbie, give me a little trouble?
I'm having some help here.

48
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,609
<i>Oh, no.</i>

49
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,842
# <i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

50
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:38,482
# <i>No, I know I'm no Superman</i>

51
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,361
# <i>I'm no Superman</i> #

52
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,158
All right, people, listen up.

53
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,791
We are a family.

54
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,871
And what do families do when
one of their own is in trouble?

55
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,806
When my brother came out of the closet
my parents sent him to hetero camp.

56
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,740
Families not from Connecticut.

57
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,973
<i>[J.D.] Pregnancy had made Carla</i>
<i>a little hormonal.</i>

58
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,175
Dr. Kelso, I asked you to keep this
matter away from the Board.

59
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,480
- Were you able to?
- Nurse Espinosa, I...

60
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,521
- Were you?!
- Yes!

61
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:12,785
I told them Dr. Cox was taking a leave
of absence due to problems at home.

62
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,588
- Should anyone ask, you beat him.
- Beat him. Got it.

63
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,130
I couldn't believe
how depressed he was.

64
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,166
- It was so sad.
- Oh, I know.

65
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,100
When I first heard about it,
I was like, "Whoa, no way."

66
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:27,333
- You don't know what this is about.
- Sure, I do, donkey-boy up in ICU.

67
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,374
We're talking about Dr. Cox.

68
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:33,606
Oh. Well, if anyone's interested,
there's a donkey-boy in the ICU.

69
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,977
- Baby?
- No, Turk.

70
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,711
Now, Dr. Cox needs our help
getting through this.

71
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,050
Jordan can watch him at morning
and at night, but she's got Jack.

72
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,352
- She's not that emotionally available.
- I'm dead inside.

73
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,723
We're all going
to spend time with him.

74
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,228
I've made up a schedule.
I have the first shift.

75
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,197
- Any questions? Meeting is adjourned.
- Oh.

76
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,958
- Gosh!
- What?

77
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:59,095
For God's sakes, Reid,
there's a donkey-boy upstairs.

78
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,042
[Turk] Damn.

79
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,350
That boy is going to town
on that carrot.

80
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,754
You fellas want to go to
a real donkey show?

81
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,590
It's really very tastefully done.

82
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,822
One of the women
who entertains the donkey

83
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,295
used to be on a soap.

84
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,093
Pass.

85
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,225
Standing invitation, every Thursday.

86
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,065
Always pass, sir.

87
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,401
Well, I'll ask Mickhead.

88
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,839
Turk, you know what bothers me?

89
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:39,002
Dr. Cox shows up to work drunk,
we act like nothing happened.

90
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,444
I don't know.
I kinda feel for the guy.

91
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,607
Besides... I am way too excited.

92
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:48,382
I start my orthopedic rotation today.
It is going to be awesome.

93
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,187
<i>Turk was psyched because</i>
<i>orthopedic surgeons</i>

94
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,057
<i>are notoriously the most unemotional,</i>
<i>jockish surgeons of all.</i>

95
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,858
<i>Turk was going to have</i>
<i>a boss he could connect with.</i>

96
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,764
Hey, guys, I'm Dr. Stone.
I'm your new attending.

97
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:05,065
- All right, fellas. Hands in.
- Yeah.

98
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,835
[Stone] Mm. Mmm.

99
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,842
[Turk] Dr. Stone?

100
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,935
Usually, when people put their hands in,

101
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,345
someone says,
"Go get them!" or "whoo!"

102
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,577
No. No words yet.

103
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,346
I want you all to get comfortable

104
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,048
with the feel of your
brother's hands on yours.

105
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:26,888
As surgeons, we're constantly
opening people up and looking around.

106
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,518
But have you ever stopped
to open yourself up

107
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,222
and look around?

108
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,788
- Whoa.
- Mmm.

109
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,356
Whoo!

110
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,136
- Hey. How's he doing?
- Hi.

111
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,076
He's not talking and he's...
you know...

112
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,177
What?

113
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,736
Daddy drinks a lot.

114
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,512
First complete sentence. Fantastic.

115
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,519
Thanks for doing this.

116
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,147
Hey, sunshine.

117
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,920
You gonna at least say hello?

118
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,325
Nothing? Listen...

119
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:08,163
I know you keep blaming yourself
for this, but you just can't.

120
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,431
When my mom died, I thought
that because I was a nurse

121
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,268
I should have been able
to prevent it somehow.

122
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,568
But over time...

123
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:19,577
...I realized that
bad things are going to happen

124
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:23,342
and beating yourself up
isn't going to help anyone.

125
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,483
That's it, sweetie. Come here.

126
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,750
Come here.

127
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,865
Nurse, I need you to help me
drain some fluid.

128
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,767
But first, we have to work
on this patient.

129
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,400
Todd, take the scalpel
and carve this into your arm.

130
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,309
"No nurse will ever touch your dangle."

131
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,745
- Christopher, come on.
- Oh.

132
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,376
You know what?

133
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,817
You're edgy because
you're on the sidelines.

134
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,946
- I know how that digs at you.
- Yeah.

135
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,490
It digs at you right in here.

136
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,991
And that's OK, you know?

137
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:10,495
What would you say if you could
have that big knee reconstruction?

138
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,628
- Awesome.
- You bet it is.

139
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,792
- Right.
- Yeah. OK.

140
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,029
- Finished.
- Let's just take a second here

141
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,105
to think about what we just did.

142
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,901
[Crying] We fixed an elbow, yeah?

143
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,602
The last thing this man said
before he went under was

144
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:28,636
how much he enjoyed
Sunday morning tennis.

145
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,182
Right? And I just,
I think that's special.

146
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,617
And we're special.
This was special. Thank you.

147
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,017
He actually said,
"I think that's pretty special."

148
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,457
Then he got all emotional.

149
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,689
- I mean, how lame is that?
- It's pretty lame.

150
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,363
I'm just not into all of that
sensitive touchy-feely stuff.

151
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,095
You hug me all the time.

152
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,636
And even that took a while.

153
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,865
Remember the first time
you tried to hug me?

154
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,133
Yeah!

155
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,234
Your sports team won
the World Series!

156
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,449
- What a game!
- A grand slam!

157
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:09,346
With Dr. Stone it's different.
We're not friends.

158
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:13,084
What kind of guy gets all cuddly
with people he just met? It's pathetic.

159
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,525
Dude, that's a little harsh.

160
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,159
How long have you been
holding that button?

161
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,394
Long enough for me to hear
what you really think.

162
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,793
Great.

163
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,931
Is there another guy on this planet
who's that sensitive?

164
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,839
[J.D.] OK. Let it out.

165
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:35,072
I got ya. J.D.'s got ya.

166
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,446
Hold me tighter. Little too tight.

167
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,009
- There's a good spot.
- [Sobbing]

168
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,589
- Elliot, why did I have to come?
- Because we're a couple, Keith.

169
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,324
- We do things together.
- OK.

170
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,731
Would it be OK if I moved?
This couch is... uncomfortable.

171
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:03,203
Dr. Cox, I am not going to pretend
to know what you're going through,

172
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,437
but believe me,
I've had my experiences.

173
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:09,242
Remember when I put my malaria patient
through that painful procedure,

174
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,180
when everyone knew he'd die anyway?

175
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,117
You know what? I'm just going
to go sit in the bathroom.

176
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,718
Know what I do when I'm having a really
tough time getting through things?

177
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,994
<i>I just leave the city,</i>

178
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:28,931
<i>get into nature, and just take stock</i>
<i>of what's really important.</i>

179
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,970
<i>Just make sure you don't go</i>
<i>to a popular parachute drop-zone.</i>

180
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,438
<i>I don't know if it was</i>
<i>the adrenaline rush</i>

181
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,779
or because I thought he was an angel,
but it's fastest I've gone

182
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,115
from meeting to kissing.
Yeah. True story.

183
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:53,555
- I'm just worried about this mole.
- Doesn't look cancerous.

184
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,025
Ah, get in there and
take your pants off.

185
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,954
- You gonna go talk to Dr. Stone?
- It'll blow over.

186
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,795
Plus, he's a surgeon.
Surgeons don't hold grudges.

187
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,199
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go scrub up.

188
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,036
By the way, your shift with
Dr. Cox starts in ten minutes.

189
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,006
<i>Turk was right.</i>
<i>Personal feelings</i>

190
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,638
<i>shouldn't get in the way of a</i>
<i>professional relationship, but they do.</i>

191
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,245
What do you say we rebuild that knee?

192
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,877
Actually, I think
I'm going to let Dr. Norman here

193
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,547
take the lead on this one, OK?

194
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,052
Look, Carla, I have a real problem
with what Dr. Cox did

195
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,494
and I don't think
I can go over there.

196
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,760
I'm gonna send somebody else
over for you, OK?

197
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,328
J.D. Was supposed to come but, um...

198
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,398
...he... he's not coming.

199
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,916
<i>[J.D.] I couldn't really worry</i>
<i>about bailing on Dr. Cox.</i>

200
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,421
<i>The Stanleys' child was sick and</i>
<i>I had just spent the last 20 minutes</i>

201
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,323
<i>asking them awkward questions to rule</i>
<i>out the possibility of child abuse.</i>

202
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,954
- Who would smother their own child?
- You'd be surprised.

203
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,793
There's Munchausen Syndrome,

204
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:10,029
where a parent will intentionally harm
their child to get attention themselves.

205
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,297
I've never heard of that.

206
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,431
Someone should do a public service
announcement about it.

207
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,203
<i>[J.D.] Hmm. Someone should.</i>

208
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,205
Had a tough day at the office,
come home, make yourself some dinner,

209
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,250
smother your kids, pop in a movie,
maybe have a drink.

210
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,512
It's fun, right? Wrong.

211
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,645
Don't smother your kids.

212
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,916
That problem would be gone forever.

213
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,395
- I am so mad at you.
- Yeah, you big jerk.

214
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,523
How could you stand up Dr. Cox?

215
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,761
Wait, is that what
we came to yell at him for?

216
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,803
Well, yeah.
What did you think it was?

217
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,034
Apparently J.D. Told Mr. Ketay
I'm throwing a birthday party.

218
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,302
He asked where the cake was.
I panicked.

219
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,378
I told him we got him
a weekend in Vegas.

220
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,914
- What?
- Can I see Celine Dion?

221
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,881
Oh, anything you want, Mr. Ketay!

222
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,713
You're going halfsies with me.

223
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,788
I can't believe you didn't
show up at Dr. Cox's.

224
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:06,120
Do you have any idea who I
had to send in your place?

225
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,920
# <i>Gray skies are gonna clear up</i>

226
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,758
# <i>Put on a happy face</i>
<i>Hap-happy-hap</i>

227
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,992
# <i>Brush off the clouds and cheer up</i>

228
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,624
If you're not digging this,

229
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,329
I've got a hundred jokes about these.

230
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,373
# <i>Sunshine all over the place</i>

231
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,237
# <i>Just put on</i>
<i>Put on</i>

232
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,210
# <i>A happy face</i> #

233
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,245
Yeah.

234
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,447
I'm just not down with the whole
drinking and doctoring thing.

235
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,075
- Deal with it.
- [Snaps fingers]

236
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,550
Excuse me.

237
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,553
I'll never get a good
surgery on this rotation.

238
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,819
I can help you with Dr. Stone.
He's one of my people.

239
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,258
- He's a sensie.
- What's a sensie?

240
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,297
It's short for sensitive guy.

241
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,924
Our music is acoustic alternative.

242
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,968
We marvel at fireflies.

243
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,765
And when we help a drunk girl
home from the bar,

244
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,601
sure, we cop a feel...

245
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,971
...a feel of her hair
as we're pulling it back

246
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,669
so she doesn't get vomit on it.

247
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,871
I'm having a weird
med school flashback.

248
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,244
I think you held my hair back
while I vomited.

249
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:07,274
It was our last year. I didn't want you
to get Jägermeister in your cornrows.

250
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,355
- My Latrell Sprewell phase.
- Hockey?

251
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,946
- Basketball.
- Damn it.

252
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:15,790
- What am I going to do about Dr. Stone?
- You're going to cry in front of him.

253
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,661
Laugh if you must, but it'll show
you have emotional depth

254
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:25,830
and it will trigger a nurturing impulse
inside him that we sensies can't resist.

255
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,169
How the hell am I supposed to cry?

256
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,003
You need to cry. Let's brainstorm.

257
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,669
I could hit you
over the head with a wrench.

258
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,908
Or... I could stab you
in the gut with a knife.

259
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,817
# <i>Knife-wrench</i>

260
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,853
Practical and safe.

261
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,178
Whoa!

262
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,917
Ow!

263
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:50,291
- Oh! Oh, boy!
- Anyhoo, don't worry about crying.

264
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,421
I got this menthol
from the pharmacy.

265
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,728
I read online that
actors in Holly-weird

266
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,098
spray their eyes
when they need to fake-cry.

267
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,329
Why do you have five?

268
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,804
I'm using it for the final death
scene in my movie, <i>Dr. Acula.</i>

269
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,844
Last night, my German financier, Hans,

270
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,038
rest in peace, died on the Autobahn.

271
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,775
So now I got to shoot
the whole thing on my cell phone.

272
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,010
Hello, Bob.

273
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:18,648
- No cheek kiss necessary.
- Oh, good. I had pipe breath.

274
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,421
So... when was the last time I was here?

275
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,689
'97? I know it's been a while

276
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,493
because Enid could still
fit through that door.

277
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,625
I shouldn't joke,
she's very ill.

278
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,636
I'm going to go take a shower.

279
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,003
Oh, Perry?

280
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,346
I don't really know why I'm here,
but Nurse Espinosa said

281
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,780
if I didn't, she'd stop
coming over to my house

282
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,648
and giving instructions
to my pool boy.

283
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,245
He speaks English,
but doesn't have front teeth,

284
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,654
so I can never look at him
without laughing.

285
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,386
[Kelso chuckling]

286
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,121
Anyway, I don't know what
she expects me to say to you.

287
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,157
I mean, all you do
is bust my ass day in and day out.

288
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,237
I guess you... you keep me
in line on those rare occasions

289
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,276
when I lose sight of things.

290
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,869
You could say we
balance each other out pretty well.

291
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,579
[Sighing]

292
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,584
Perry...

293
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,143
...the hospital needs you.

294
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,586
I need you.

295
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,452
What the hell are you doing?

296
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,285
Did Elliot leave
without telling me?

297
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,130
Why is there an intern
in my bathroom?

298
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,756
It's not my birthday.

299
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,960
She made me watch.

300
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,010
OK, there he is. You ready?

301
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,302
Ow!

302
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,075
He's the one that needs to cry,
you idiot. Not me.

303
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:51,809
Ow!

304
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,216
Oh yeah. I forgot all
about that crying stuff.

305
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,516
I was just... oh hey!
Loose thread.

306
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,078
- No!
- Got it.

307
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,351
# <i>Knife-wrench!</i>

308
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,189
For kids.

309
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,929
OK, he's hugging Colonel Doctor which
means you got about seven seconds.

310
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,728
A hug takes seven seconds?

311
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,362
A good one does.
Here's the plan.

312
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,531
You're going to tell him
a story that isn't inherently sad.

313
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,974
When you get emotional,
he will think you're extra-sensitive.

314
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,012
I'll nail you with the menthol.

315
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,344
You'll be crying like a
ten-year-old Pilgrim widow.

316
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,350
Here he comes.

317
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,682
And... black-tion.

318
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,917
- Dr. Stone.
- Christopher.

319
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,118
Yeah, you know, I'm just
out here thinking about my wife.

320
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,287
She's pregnant with our first child.

321
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,821
<i>[J.D.] Now come on, fishy.</i>
<i>Take the bait.</i>

322
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,163
Children are pretty darn special.

323
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:47,467
I have seven of my own, and each one is
just as compassionate as the next one.

324
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,905
That is the quality
that me and my six ex-wives

325
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,443
tried to instill in our children.

326
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,806
It's overwhelming here.

327
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,179
Exactly.

328
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,282
You know, my new wife, Carol,

329
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,877
she is four months pregnant.

330
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,651
- Congratulations.
- We're separated.

331
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,692
Uh-huh.

332
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,661
We are not so different, you and I.

333
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,061
<i>[J.D.] He's not a sensie.</i>
<i>He's a nut job.</i>

334
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,692
It's hug time, Chris.
Come here.

335
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,497
- Whoa!
- [Thump]

336
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,938
Old habit.

337
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:25,404
So he has a mild concussion and they're
going to let him rest for a while.

338
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,139
Good. That gives us time
to come up with a new plan.

339
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,976
Oh, no. That's it. I'm done.

340
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,243
There's no way we will
have a relationship.

341
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,115
Not unless I want to bear
his 17th child.

342
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,586
He's your attending,
you have to connect.

343
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,784
You need somebody you can look up to,
someone you can count on.

344
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,953
What you need is someone
who will always have your back.

345
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,327
No, J.D., that's what you need.

346
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,764
That's what you've always needed.

347
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:52,234
Maybe after five years working here,
that's not such a good thing.

348
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,234
I got to go and do
my shift with Dr. Cox.

349
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,007
<i>[J.D.] Right then I knew</i>
<i>what I had to do.</i>

350
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,818
- Hey.
- What's up?

351
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,951
[# Gary Jules: <i>Something Else</i>]

352
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,657
You're probably wondering why
I didn't show up before, huh?

353
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,066
I know you wanted me to,
even though you'd never admit it.

354
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:28,438
Normally I would kill
to get into this apartment,

355
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,998
and you'd try and keep me out.

356
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,340
I say "try" because,

357
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,073
at your Super Bowl party,

358
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,377
which I was not invited to,

359
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:42,079
I was lucky enough to be able to watch
the second half from right over there.

360
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,123
I was the bearded Domino's
employee you invited in

361
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:49,160
because I said I was a fan of
Jerome Bettis, whoever the hell that is.

362
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,030
Anyway, I tried to convince myself

363
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,123
the reason I didn't come earlier

364
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,691
was because of you
coming into work drunk.

365
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,035
But that's not it.

366
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,668
I was scared.

367
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,444
I guess after all this time,

368
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,746
I still think of you as, like,
this superhero

369
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:16,686
that will help me out
of any situation I'm in.

370
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,518
I needed that.

371
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,219
But that's my problem, you know,
and I'll deal with that.

372
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,227
I guess I came
over here to tell you...

373
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,060
...how proud of you I am.

374
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,833
Not because you did the best
you could for those patients...

375
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,003
...but because after 20 years
of being a doctor...

376
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:44,070
...when things go badly,
you still take it this hard.

377
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,743
And I got to tell you, man, I mean...

378
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,813
...that's the kind of doctor
I want to be.

379
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,121
<i>[J.D.] Maybe he just needed</i>
<i>time to heal,</i>

380
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,652
<i>or maybe he just needed to see</i>
<i>how much everybody cared,</i>

381
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,960
<i>but I'd like to believe</i>
<i>it was because of me</i>

382
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,934
<i>that he was finally able to say this...</i>

383
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,431
You don't drink scotch.

384
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,042
That's awful.

385
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,907
I'm glad you finally shaved.

386
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,574
<i>[J.D.] That's the thing about family.</i>

387
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,083
<i>If you fall off the deep end,</i>

388
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,985
<i>you can always count on them</i>
<i>to rally around you.</i>

389
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,991
<i>And when you come back,</i>
<i>you might get a quick hug...</i>

390
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,993
<i>... a pat on the shoulder...</i>

391
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,529
<i>... maybe just a nod...</i>

392
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,390
<i>... but no words</i>
<i>really need to be spoken.</i>

393
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,126
<i>Of course...</i>

394
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,135
<i>... it's always nice when they are.</i>

395
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,693
J. D...

396
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,298
...thank you.

397
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,201
You're welcome.
