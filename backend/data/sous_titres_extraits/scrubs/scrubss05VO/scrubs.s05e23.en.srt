One reason interns have so
much trouble putting in chest tubes

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,636
is because it is a violent procedure.
You must not be scared, though.

3
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:12,576
You need to use force to get
the tube between the ribs,

4
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:16,411
then pop it through the pleura. What
do you say there, Lis? You can do this.

I'm comfortable with this.

Mr. Peters, having a gal urologist
might seem a little uncomfortable,

but the penis is
just another excretory organ,

zip out to my house and grab $400.

169
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,466
I'll do it.

170
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,060
I shouldn't be mopping here anyway.
This is a rug.

171
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,070
[Sloshing]

172
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,869
Don't let him in your house, sir.

173
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,968
He'll steal everything you've got
like he stole my camera.

174
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,377
You know the difference
between you and me?

175
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,813
Your melon-sized prostate, sir?

176
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,478
I will never fear this man.

177
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:18,148
- You think I'm afraid of you, chief?
- No, sir, I do not.

178
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,955
Look, I keep my extra cash in a pickle
jar on the top shelf over the sink.

179
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:30,198
Enid wants that jar so bad
she can taste it. [chuckling]

180
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,531
Oh, right.

181
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:35,438
You don't remember she's paralyzed
and can't stand out of her wheelchair.

182
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,443
- That's why you're not laughing.
- No, Bob.

183
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,071
We're not laughing
because we're all horrified.

184
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,775
Well, it tickles me.

185
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,343
[Sloshing]

186
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,911
Huh.

187
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,589
OK, honey, I know Elliot upset you
with this whole Keith thing,

188
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,127
but listen,

189
00:09:56,195 --> 00:10:00,461
we're all gonna be extra, extra
sensitive so you don't get riled up, OK?

190
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,724
I'm wearing red.
Should I not be wearing red?

191
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,771
She's pregnant, she's not a bull.

192
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,567
I know you think I'm just
being crazy, but Elliot,

193
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,405
you should not give up on Keith.

194
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,809
You say he's not strong enough because
he gets stepped on at work,

195
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,643
but that's what it's like.

196
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:20,049
You're doing what we do when we
get into a serious relationship,

197
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,417
freaking out and
trying to poke holes in it.

198
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,787
Remember when I started dating Turk
and I wanted to bail on him

199
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,689
because he cried at the end of sex?

200
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,819
- Baby!
- Relax, Brown Bear.

201
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,056
There's no shame in cry-maxing.

202
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,658
And you know how hard
single life can be. Just ask Kim.

203
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,498
Wait. Kim's single?

204
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,834
Yeah. She's been divorced
for over a year.

205
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,874
She wears the ring at the hospital
so she doesn't get hit on.

206
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,738
Turk, keys!

207
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,013
Yahtzee!

208
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:59,721
Hey, girl. What are you doing?
Want to get some coffee later?

209
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,522
<i>- And then, the ultimate Cox-block.</i>
- [Cox whistles]

210
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,325
Hey. Why isn't Mr. Peters
in there getting surgery?

211
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,161
I decided against it.

212
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,168
She thought it would be best
if I treated him medically.

213
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,694
First of all, Newbie,
nobody's ever thought that, ever.

214
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,241
Secondly, she's a cutter.

215
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,334
When is the last time you met
a cutter who didn't want to cut?

216
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:23,508
Laverne, you've been here 40 years now.
You ever heard of such a thing?

217
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,142
I'm gonna kill somebody.

218
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,585
<i>I guess we all get mad when people</i>
<i>say things we don't want to hear.</i>

219
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,316
Elliot!

220
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,154
I'm sorry, but you can't
leave until you promise me

221
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,955
you'll think about it with Keith.

222
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:40,192
Oh, my God, Carla! Will you
please just butt out of this one?

223
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,134
<i>Especially when things feel a bit fishy.</i>

224
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,733
- Here's your cash.
- Oh, thanks.

225
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,743
Hey, is that a new coat?

226
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,506
Yeah. Just picked it up.

227
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,638
Where did you get the money to buy it?

228
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,980
Mmm, I don't think that's
any business of yours.

229
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,023
<i>Still, it's always good</i>
<i>to hear the truth.</i>

230
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,027
Surgery is really
the only thing that has a shot

231
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,654
at curing this guy,

232
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,199
and the reason that
she's not going to do it

233
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,599
is he's older and has heart issues,
which makes him high risk.

234
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,606
And if he were to drop dead
on her operating table, well,

235
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,734
that would make her
surgery stats go down.

236
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:29,179
And that wouldn't look very good on
a young doctor's résumé, would it?

237
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,614
<i>Even if it means losing respect</i>
<i>for someone you might like.</i>

238
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,415
What can I say? You got me.

239
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,922
<i>Damn.</i>

240
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,391
Hold on. Dr. Turk,

241
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:49,423
I covered your gastric-bypass patient
last night. He left a message for you.

242
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,233
- What'd he say?
- You are square.

243
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,135
- [Greasers laughing]
- [Tires squealing]

244
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,377
Stupid greasers.

245
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,915
Oh, here comes Kim.

246
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,644
She had all night to think.

247
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,551
She'll probably be
in a shame spiral. Let's enjoy it.

248
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,749
- Oh, hey, fellas, how you living?
- Large!

249
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,985
What!

250
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,128
What, was I not supposed to answer?

251
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,926
<i>I wasn't the only one</i>
<i>having relationship problems.</i>

252
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,834
Sorry about the way I left last night.

253
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,336
We're OK, right?

254
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,737
Until you receive further notice,
consider us not speaking.

255
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,767
I know you took my money
to buy that ridiculous coat.

256
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,313
I bet you can't prove it.

257
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,982
Enid, you are my eyewitness.

258
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,080
Did he take more than $400?

259
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,524
Enid, is that a new pantsuit?

260
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,826
You think you're
pretty smart, don't you?

261
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,458
All I think is that leather
never goes out of style,

262
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,095
and if you keep money in a pickle jar,
you should know how much is there,

263
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,106
and it won't hurt to buy your invalid
wife something nice

264
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,039
so she can feel pretty.

265
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,738
These are just general thoughts
about life, nothing specific to you.

266
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,550
- Mmm, that was nice. Thank you.
- That wasn't me.

267
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,746
- Hey, dudes.
- Don't "hey, dudes" us.

268
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:19,382
- You know what bothers me?
- Non-threatening colloquial greetings?

269
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:23,952
It bothers me that a doctor won't help a
patient so she could keep her stats up.

270
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,997
- Yeah!
- Look, J.D.

271
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,898
Surgery's competitive.
We do what we must to get ahead.

272
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,663
My best friend here's a surgeon,

273
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,899
and he'd never pass
on risky surgery to keep his stats up.

274
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,134
Actually, I have done that.

275
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,802
- Everyone has.
- Oh, my God!

276
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,847
Out of here! Dr. Cox, please weigh in.

277
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:45,680
Well, it's no secret how I feel
about surgeons. I hate them.

278
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,480
I'd liken them to rocks,
but that would insult rocks

279
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,081
because, you see, at least rocks
are useful to society.

280
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:56,457
We build bridges, throw them at guys
wearing phones clipped to their heads.

281
00:14:56,528 --> 00:15:00,191
It's a phone. You can't do this?

282
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,724
- However...
- Now, back to the crux of the matter.

283
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,531
Hit her, Per!

284
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,971
However, it is not Dr. Briggs' fault

285
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,066
that she works in a broken system.

286
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,907
Top hospitals are only
interested in hiring surgeons

287
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,503
who they think are flawless.

288
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,913
That's not the answer you
thought you'd hear,

289
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,645
but as always, I don't care.

290
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,721
Thank God he didn't see this.

291
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,123
Yeah, Mom, I was listening
the whole time. I just couldn't talk.

292
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,684
[Groans]

293
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,530
[Kelso whistles]

294
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,765
Looks like somebody took their new
titanium eight iron with a leather grip

295
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,534
and went to town on your van.

296
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,269
Well done, sir.

297
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,709
What? You think I did it?

298
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,474
Too bad you can't prove it.

299
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,277
Really?

300
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,480
<i>I think I need to take more...</i>

301
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,283
<i>... blood.</i>

302
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,324
What the hell is this?

303
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,724
It's Dorian's camera. This must be
a scene from <i>Dr. Acula.</i>

304
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,731
<i>You ain't taking no more blood</i>
<i>from my ho-slapping hand.</i>

305
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,700
<i>I will pimp slap you!</i>

306
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,532
<i>This feels really racist, J.D.</i>

307
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,163
<i>- Why can't I be a vampire?</i>
<i>- Because it's my movie!</i>

308
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,734
<i>Now, let's take it from the top and</i>
<i>I'm not gonna ask you again, blacker!</i>

309
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,245
<i>- Blacker.</i>
<i>- Yes, please.</i>

310
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,837
<i>- Blacker.</i>
<i>- [J.D. Screaming]</i>

311
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,577
<i>[Hissing]</i>

312
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,152
Now comes the good part.

313
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,489
<i>Prove that!</i>

314
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,890
<i>And that! And that!</i>

315
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,225
<i>And that! And that!</i>

316
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,324
<i>Yeah!</i>

317
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,962
What do you want?

318
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,541
So, hey, I thought you
might be hungry.

319
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,099
You enjoyed the pancakes
I left on the computer?

320
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:56,011
No, but I enjoyed the 3,000 ants
crawling on my keyboard.

321
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,049
There's two doing it on the F button.

322
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,085
I could be wrong,
but it looks like two girls.

323
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,316
- What do you want, Elliot?
- I wanted to apologize.

324
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,789
- Well, save it.
- Look, Carla, I...

325
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,225
You must be bored
with this friendship

326
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,353
when all you do
is take, take, take.

327
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,456
The most embarrassing thing is
you don't realize you do it.

328
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,501
Because, at the end of the day,

329
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:20,265
you're nothing but a spoiled, selfish,
neurotic girl from Connecticut

330
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,398
who has absolutely
no idea how to...

331
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,135
OK, that's enough!

332
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,542
I don't know what you are fighting
about, but it doesn't matter.

333
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,743
No one's allowed to be that mean to my
girl, especially when she's apologizing.

334
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:36,083
- Are we clear?
<i>- [JD] Nobody speaks to Carla like that.</i>

335
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,123
It was cool getting to know you, man.

336
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,783
<i>The irony was Keith was</i>
<i>yelling at the one woman</i>

337
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,988
<i>who was trying</i>
<i>to save his relationship.</i>

338
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,131
I'm sorry, Elliot.

339
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,226
<i>And even more ironic</i>
<i>was that it looked like she had.</i>

340
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,231
- Thanks for standing up for me.
- Yeah, totally.

341
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,145
<i>I think Elliot finally seeing</i>
<i>who Keith really was</i>

342
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,772
<i>made me understand</i>
<i>why I was so upset with Kim.</i>

343
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:07,045
[# Aqualung: <i>Easier to Lie</i>]

344
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,545
Look who's happy again.

345
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,420
- Yeah, well, it's just...
- J.D., one sec.

346
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,289
I'm on the phone with my mom.
She just got her RV fixed.

347
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,421
Mom, I gotta go.
You can call me from the road.

348
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,665
My mom loves the road.

349
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,235
I finally figured out
what bothers me so much about you.

350
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,272
Well, lay it on me, studly.

351
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:31,002
It's the way you're so concerned
about protecting yourself.

352
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:36,142
I mean, no one in this entire hospital
has a bad thing to say about you,

353
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:40,777
and I'm guessing that's because you're
careful not to rub anyone the wrong way.

354
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,451
And you still wear your wedding ring.

355
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,822
That prevents any guy
from getting anywhere near you.

356
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,861
You wouldn't operate on Mr. Peters,

357
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:53,659
and we both know how you're
protecting yourself there.

358
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:58,169
I don't know. I guess, in the grand
scheme of things, it's not a big deal.

359
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,468
I was a little disappointed to find out
who you turned out to be.

360
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,543
I'll see you around, Kim.

361
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,511
See you.

362
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,013
- I don't want to do this.
- No problem.

363
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,817
I'll give the tape to the police.

364
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,758
Ladies and gentleman, this is
your chief of medicine, Bob Kelso.

365
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,388
"I feel compelled
to tell you that I do,

366
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,658
in fact, fear the Janitor.

367
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:32,295
<i>Honestly, is there anyone else</i>
<i>with such a brilliant mind?"</i>

368
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,962
You planned this, didn't you?

369
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,304
The whole being mean thing,
so that Keith would stand up for me.

370
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,307
Oh, thanks.

371
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,883
- You didn't plan a damn thing, did you?
- No, I snapped like a twig.

372
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,978
Please don't tell her.

373
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,693
<i>Anyway, I guess people</i>
<i>can always surprise you.</i>

374
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,255
Who's Dr. Briggs operating on?

375
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,195
Your patient, Mr. Peters.

376
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:04,031
"So please join me in basking

377
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,128
in the glow of the Janitor's awesome:

378
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,735
...this isn't a word.
- Read it.

379
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,872
"Fearitude." Good night.

380
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,778
[Imitating Edward Murrow]
And good luck. I loved that movie.

381
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,687
I saw you did that surgery
on Mr. Peters.

382
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,592
Did you decide
it was the right thing to do?

383
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,623
No, actually, it was
a stupid career risk.

384
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,090
Then why'd you do it?

385
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,967
Because for some reason,
I find myself

386
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,803
really caring about
what you think of me.

387
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,247
Oh.

388
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:56,814
Cool.

389
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,197
