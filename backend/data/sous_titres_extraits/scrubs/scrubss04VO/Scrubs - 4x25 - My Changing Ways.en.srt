1
00:00:02,388 --> 00:00:03,438
So here I am...

2
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:05,424
sitting on a box

3
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:08,357
in an empty apartment
with a dead dog

4
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,473
and a single tear on my cheek.

5
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:15,144
I can't help but wonder
how I got to this place.

6
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:20,865
Who are these guys?

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,839
These are the last 8 guys in the hospital
who don't realize I suck at basketball.

8
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,535
Ok, so here's what's gonna happen.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,289
I finally masterd
my running hook shot, ok?

10
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:31,964
So when we go to pick teams,
I'm gonna hit that shot.

11
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:32,796
Then you say :

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,463
"I'll take that guy."

13
00:00:34,798 --> 00:00:37,419
At which point Carla is gonna page me,

14
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:39,759
and I say "crap I gotta go"

15
00:00:39,794 --> 00:00:42,664
and you go,  "damn, we just lost
the best player out here."

16
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,539
Then there'll be 8 guys in the hospital
who think I'm good at sports

17
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:47,429
and the word will spread.

18
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:50,419
When do you find time
to see your patients?

19
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:51,953
Between these thoughts.

20
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:54,607
Oh, ok, let's play some ball.

21
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,497
I got that guy.

22
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:08,160
Elliot's boyfriend Jake
had given her

23
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:11,412
confidence to do things she'd
never been able to do before.

24
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:12,609
Ok, you ready to do this?

25
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:14,156
You know it.

26
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:16,167
Like talking to people while
she's on the toilet.

27
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:20,003
Ok. I know how comfortable
you are with Carla,

28
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:23,151
so I'm gonna have her do the talking,
all right? You just say when.

29
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:25,713
There's cheeks on the seat
and I'm feeling good.

30
00:01:25,913 --> 00:01:26,863
Let's hear it.

31
00:01:27,398 --> 00:01:30,022
Hello, Elliot.
How are you doing?

32
00:01:33,032 --> 00:01:34,238
She went out the window.

33
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:38,526
Oh, Bob Kelso here before noon?

34
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:41,341
They're either giving away
free doughnuts at the cafe

35
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:44,226
or there's an asian prostitute
convention in the I.C.U.

36
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:46,540
Is now the time I'm supposed
to be embarrassed because

37
00:01:46,575 --> 00:01:49,167
I like fine food and
Korean call girls?

38
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:50,312
Write this down, Perry:

39
00:01:50,547 --> 00:01:54,285
I'm old and I honestly don't care what
people think about anything I do.

40
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,663
That was me, folks.

41
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:59,461
No, I'm here because
the budget's a mess.

42
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:01,364
Ted's not making much headway.

43
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,559
312 x 481 equals...

44
00:02:06,623 --> 00:02:09,417
Sir, it's not giving me the answer.

45
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:11,410
It's a typewriter, you jackass!

46
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:14,037
Oh, god, it's got my tie!

47
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:22,431
Bob, this whole thing is only gonna take a
couple of days, so why not let Jordan do it?

48
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:24,590
Yes, she is a member of the board,

49
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:27,848
but, hell, that only gets her out of the house
once every couple of months or so.

50
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:31,340
And I know she loves our
son Jack with all her heart, but

51
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:34,870
I think spending every waking
moment with the child, I think--

52
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:37,238
I think it's starting to get to her.

53
00:02:40,922 --> 00:02:42,200
I hate you.

54
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:45,483
So, what do you say there, Bobo?

55
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:47,183
Welcome aboard.

56
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:49,237
This will be your office
for the next few days.

57
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:51,089
Ted, find someplace else to work.

58
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:53,428
Oh, man! Not again!

59
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:57,942
If you need some happy pills,
they're in the top drawer.

60
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:00,458
In this hellhole, I'll need a gun.

61
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:01,824
Bottom left.

62
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,550
Yo, can I ask you a question?

63
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,119
Yeah.

64
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,206
Why are we lying on the parking lot?

65
00:03:13,356 --> 00:03:15,461
Your hook shot
knocked you unconscious,

66
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:18,448
so I lied down next to you so everyone
would just think we were chilling.

67
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:19,993
Oh, thanks, S.C.B.

68
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,003
By the way, I should tell you something.

69
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:25,520
I found an apartment. I'm moving
out the day after tomorrow.

70
00:03:25,658 --> 00:03:26,406
Wow.

71
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:27,907
Yeah.

72
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:30,486
What does S.C.B. Mean?

73
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:32,488
Super Chocolate Bear.

74
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:35,253
- I love it.
- I knew you would.

My Changing Ways

77
00:03:46,854 --> 00:03:49,250
www.forom.com

78
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:53,310
Someone stole a whole case of
laxatives from the supply closet.

79
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:55,812
Don't look at me.
I'm as regular as rain.

80
00:03:56,347 --> 00:03:57,380
Who wants a piece of pie?

81
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:58,916
Who made it?

82
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:00,376
Let's say my mom.

83
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:03,215
As a doctor, you get good
at piecing things together.

84
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:05,494
- Someone stole a case of laxatives.
- Who wants a piece of pie?

85
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:08,500
This one was obvious.

86
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:09,443
No, thank you.

87
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:12,748
Free pie?
Hell, yeah.

88
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:19,414
I can't believe you two have
lived together for 12 years.

89
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,595
Do you remember our first day together?

90
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:27,045
Yo, they call me Chris one.
What's the dealio?

91
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,599
Welcome to our lair.

92
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:32,903
I'm an eighth-level ogre magi with
invisibility, and this is Randal.

93
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,509
You were such a dork.

94
00:04:36,905 --> 00:04:38,730
I'm glad nothing else
around here's changing.

95
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:41,835
You see, this is the time of year where
everybody leaves for new jobs,

96
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:43,633
but Turk's got
another year of residency.

97
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:46,173
Yeah, and J.D. and I just took
positions here as staff internists.

98
00:04:46,408 --> 00:04:47,657
Was that what you wanted to do?

99
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:50,988
There was an endocrinology fellowship
with this amazing doctor over at County,

100
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:52,385
but it's a little over my head.

101
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,998
So you took a fallback job 'cause
you were afraid to go for it?

102
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:58,803
Uh, Jake, is it?

103
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:00,519
- Yeah, it's--
- I know your name, Jake.

104
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:01,685
I'm being condescending.

105
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,172
It's Jake, right?

106
00:05:03,856 --> 00:05:05,728
Look, no one here is settling.

107
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,954
Here at Sacred Heart, you get to work with
some of the finest doctors in the country.

108
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:09,658
Out of my way!

109
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,658
I got a doozy of a two-sie!

110
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,656
All right, then.
Before we jump into rounds,

111
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:19,723
I see it's time for my annual cologne intervention.

112
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:23,000
Lonnie, you're killing us.
And honestly, what's the point?

113
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,388
Do you understand that no
matter how badly you want to get freaky

114
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:27,500
with Karen here, that's
just not going to happen.

115
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:30,758
And here's why : she thinks
you have the body of a fetus.

116
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:34,519
Oh, Karen, did you tell
me that in confidence?

117
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:35,421
No, he knows.

118
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:36,972
She drew me a picture.

119
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,934
Don't sweat it too much, kid.

120
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:42,357
He wore so much cologne on our first date,
I had to sell my miata.

121
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,185
Why?

122
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,537
For funsies.

123
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:46,332
Heel.

124
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,574
Thank you for that.

125
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:49,853
Keep moving, fetus-face.

126
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:56,042
Come here, boy!
Come on, rowdy!

127
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:57,488
No, you come here, eat your steak!

128
00:05:57,923 --> 00:05:58,855
What are you doing?

129
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,504
Well, whoever Rowdy goes to first,
he gets to keep him.

130
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,358
Rowdy, if you come to me,
I'll scratch your special region.

131
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:06,719
So you moved back
all the furniture

132
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:09,696
and defrosted our dinner with your
sweaty hands for a joke?

133
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:11,735
Yeah, we did.

134
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:16,239
If he stays, I'll drive him out to
the country and leave him there.

135
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:18,086
He's mine.

136
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,413
I can't believe you talked me into this.

137
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,567
I will never get this fellowship.
I don't interview well.

138
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:25,969
It's the reason
I didn't get into Harvard.

139
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:28,309
The second the professor asked me what
I hoped to accomplish in college,

140
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,700
my nose started bleeding, and I sneezed
and splattered his shirt with blood.

141
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:34,882
Damn it, Elliot, how many people
do you have to talk to while you're peeing

142
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:36,608
before you start
believing in yourself?

143
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:38,777
You're right.

144
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:43,706
So, why are you
interested in this fellowship?

145
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:48,049
Well, first off, I have incredible
passion for the work you're doing.

146
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:49,344
I've heard that
you're an amazing doctor,

147
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:52,181
and I would be honored to have the
opportunity to work with you, Mr. Gold.

148
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,901
Have a great day, honey.

149
00:06:57,236 --> 00:06:59,690
You have even a better one, you.
You do it!

150
00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:02,659
Yeah, yeah. You have even a better one.

151
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:11,049
Perry, I get the feeling
something is bothering you.

152
00:07:11,184 --> 00:07:15,230
Bob, people have a private life, and
people have a professional life, and,

153
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:18,575
usually, those 2 hells are kept
pretty separate. For instance,

154
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,160
I don't know that much
about your home life,

155
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:24,794
other than the fact that you treat your
wife like a dog, your dog like a wife,

156
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:26,962
and your son like an
androgynous ne'er-do-well

157
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:30,401
who drains your retirement nest egg to
open up a yarn shop in minneapolis.

158
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:33,812
Harrison posted his
first profit this quarter.

159
00:07:33,847 --> 00:07:34,780
Aces.

160
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:38,049
And I'm guessing that's
because his significant other...

161
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:39,018
Terrence.

162
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:41,991
Terrence doesn't follow
him around the shop all day,

163
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:45,019
telling him just exactly
what color is in this season,

164
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,269
or showing all of
the other employees that

165
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,161
he is not, in fact, the boss
of his own life. You see,

166
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:52,178
the woman is everywhere.

167
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:54,422
She's there when
I work out in the morning,

168
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:56,148
when I work out in the
car on the way to work,

169
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:58,115
and when I work out
when I get to work.

170
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,402
I can't seem to get away from her,

171
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:03,042
and that used to be fine
when she just came around

172
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:06,441
for 5 minutes every month or so
to feed on my dignity,

173
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:10,027
but now, I'd honestly kill myself,
Bob, if I wasn'tconvinced that

174
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:16,047
Jordan would already be there, waiting for
me in the afterlife. You see, typical of her,

175
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:17,782
she went ahead and
signed us up for

176
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:20,938
an eternal tandem bike ride all
along the banks of the river Styx.

177
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:24,143
I'm so glad you shared.

178
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:27,549
How would you like to
make this a full time job?

179
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,237
I'll have to think about it.

180
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,393
How could you not see this coming?

181
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:40,792
Hooch just got in the shower.

182
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:42,196
Let the games begin.

183
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:46,541
Who the hell

184
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:50,672
put bouillion cubes in
the showerhead? Huh?

185
00:08:50,903 --> 00:08:51,664
Did you do it?

186
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:52,712
Did you?!

187
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:54,357
If it happens again,

188
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:57,356
I will wait in my S.U.V.,

189
00:08:57,391 --> 00:09:02,331
blast me some speed metal,
5.1 surround sound, heavy on the bass,

190
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:07,301
and someone will be getting mowed down.

191
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:13,924
Hooch is crazy.

192
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,250
I'm really gonna miss
this kind of stuff.

193
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:19,874
Why? We'll still be able to pull
pranks on him after you move out.

194
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,472
Yeah, but we won't be staying up till
6:00 in the morning

195
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:23,811
planning anything as genius as
the soup shower.

196
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:25,543
This is the end of an era,
super choc.

197
00:09:25,878 --> 00:09:30,299
You know how you're prone to overly
sensitive girly displays of sentimentality?

198
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:30,839
Guilty.

199
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,601
Ok, now, if you reel it back
a little bit,

200
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:34,317
I'll get somebody to
cover for me tonight,

201
00:09:34,852 --> 00:09:36,207
and I'll help you pack your stuff.

202
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,567
Can we cut words out of magazines that
represent how we feel about each other,

203
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:41,461
and glue them into a
"friends forever" collage?

204
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:42,196
Hell, no.

205
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,268
Oh. Can we drink beers and reminisce?

206
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,506
Hell, yes.

207
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:46,954
That's all I wanted to do anyway.

208
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:49,086
Plus, I already made the collage.

209
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:49,873
Now listen to me.

210
00:09:50,408 --> 00:09:52,048
You gotta make tonight count

211
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,860
'cause you'll never be as cool as you were
when you were rollin' with

212
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,953
the big dog as a roommate, you know?

213
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:00,567
No, I didn't know.

214
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:05,480
Well, maybe Jake shouldn't have
pushed you into that interview.

215
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:08,068
Maybe I should've covered my mouth
when I sneezed blood the second time.

216
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:11,457
Oh, come on, Elliot.
He's always telling you what to do.

217
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:12,591
That's not true.

218
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,796
Hey, it's Jake.
Buzz me up.

219
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:20,024
Oh, my god, you're right.

220
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:21,852
Don't let him be your puppet master.

221
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:24,992
- Hey.
- Hey.

222
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:27,506
What's up?

223
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,524
I have a headache.

224
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,183
Take some aspirin.

225
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:33,194
Don't tell me what to do.
You're not the boss of me.

226
00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:38,445
Ok, what just happened?

227
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:41,667
So, do you think I should take the job?

228
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:44,081
Perry?

229
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:47,277
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
I was just...

230
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:49,720
thinking about
this little boy in here.

231
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:52,149
He's only 8 years old,
and he's terminal.

232
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:56,557
I just hope his parents spent as much
time with him as they could.

233
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:59,000
You're here one minute,
and then the next, you're...

234
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:01,644
what, uh,

235
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,144
what were you saying?

236
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:04,481
Nothing.

237
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:08,945
Stick your hand out.

238
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,312
Good man.

239
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:13,345
Get yourself some ice cream.
Go on, get out of here.

240
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:19,360
J.D.,

241
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:22,915
I got a mondo 82-inch
pizza with our names on it!

242
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:26,030
Dude! It's hu...

243
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:32,798
Dude, what the hell? We're supposed to
hang, and all of a sudden you moved out?

244
00:11:33,438 --> 00:11:36,731
It's hard to hide your emotions in
front of people who know you well.

245
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:38,938
Answer it.

246
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:41,475
Or don't.

247
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:44,539
Hello.

248
00:11:44,624 --> 00:11:46,866
Like excitement about a new job...

249
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:48,330
I got the fellowship.

250
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:54,775
Or disappointment about
a lost opportunity.

251
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,800
I'm sorry, Bob.
I can't take the job.

252
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:58,321
Maybe next year.

253
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:10,376
As for me, I just didn't want Turk
to know that he'd hurt my feelings.

254
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:12,328
I don't know. I figured it
wasn't that big a deal.

255
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:16,179
Hey, I'm pretty tired from the move,
so I'm probably just gonna crash.

256
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:23,098
So famished.

257
00:12:43,824 --> 00:12:44,264
Morning.

258
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,011
Yeah.

259
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:47,258
Turk didn't even realize
he pissed me off,

260
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:50,136
so explaining my feelings
to him was the smart move.

261
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:51,984
I took a slightly different tack.

262
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,822
That seat's taken, ass-face.

263
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:54,666
By who?

264
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:57,414
Hello there, chocolate bear 2.

265
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,098
Hooch?!
J.D., what the hell's going on here?

266
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:01,338
I replaced your ass.

267
00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:02,814
By the by,

268
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:07,743
Johnny told me that you were responsible
for my brothy shower the other day.

269
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:10,993
If it happens again...

270
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:13,721
I'm gonna take one of your fingers.

271
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,651
That'll be my funny prank.

272
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:21,504
Hooch is crazy.

273
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,005
Oh, sorry. Old habit.

274
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:27,253
I wasn't the only unhappy
person in our hospital family.

275
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:30,886
Sure, Jake, I'll tell you why it feels
like I have a problem with you.

276
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:35,261
The fact that Elliot jumps so high whenever
you tell her to may seem harmless,

277
00:13:35,296 --> 00:13:38,388
but as a result, she's been
stealing all my sports bras.

278
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:42,357
Seriously! The only one I have left is the
one I'm wearing, and it works great.

279
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:43,992
See? Huh?

280
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:45,001
it works pretty nicely.

281
00:13:45,036 --> 00:13:45,920
It does, right?

282
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:50,610
But...if I wanna jump up and down again
this week, I'm stuck until laundry day.

283
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:53,540
Ok, I'm obviously gonna have to
guess what your point is here,

284
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:56,609
but I think it's that I control Elliot,
which I don't.

285
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:57,743
Here. Watch this.

286
00:13:57,778 --> 00:13:59,088
Elliot, will you shove that guy?

287
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,115
Why would you do that?

288
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:08,230
I was trying to prove
you don't do everything I say.

289
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,865
Well, clue me in, stud.

290
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,913
That was creepy Carl.

291
00:14:10,914 --> 00:14:12,763
He runs an upskirt website.

292
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,890
I'm on it.

293
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:28,026
Oh, yeah, Ted.
I moved the file cabinet.

294
00:14:28,923 --> 00:14:30,347
I'm gonna miss this office.

295
00:14:30,382 --> 00:14:35,040
Why? It smells like that odd combo of
flop sweat, hopelessness, and feet.

296
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,998
Yeah, I know.
It's just...

297
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:42,496
I guess this stupid job made me
feel valid again. You know?

298
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,556
You don't know.

299
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:46,790
It's ok.
See you at home.

300
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:57,959
Who's ready for a pie break?

301
00:14:57,994 --> 00:14:59,793
- No.
-Come on. Why not?

302
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:00,860
Why don't you ask Todd?

303
00:15:00,895 --> 00:15:03,298
Due to what can only be
described as epic diarrhea,

304
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,608
he's been on an I.V. drip for 36 hours.

305
00:15:05,843 --> 00:15:07,774
Make it stop 5.

306
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:10,272
Maybe I was being unfair to Turk.

307
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:11,812
Maybe it's too much
to expect a friend

308
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:14,110
to just sense that you're upset
and want to talk about it.

309
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:17,121
Carla, I can sense you're upset.
Talk to me.

310
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,821
Ok, but Turk's
a prideful guy,

311
00:15:20,217 --> 00:15:23,067
and it's hard for prideful guys to admit
when they've been insensitive.

312
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:26,716
Listen, Jordan,
I've been incredibly insensitive.

313
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,456
Touché, magic hallway.

314
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:33,135
Bottom line, I should've had more faith
in my friend to come through for me.

315
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,016
Turk!

316
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:37,071
No, it's me, Hooch,
vanilla bear.

317
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,001
Hooch is crazy.

318
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,413
So, hooch, this is it.

319
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:46,226
Then things took a turn.

320
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:47,229
Say, where's rowdy?

321
00:15:50,223 --> 00:15:51,745
"I'm at the hospital"?

322
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:56,632
There he is!

323
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,945
There he is!

324
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:04,856
Ok, he's going up.

325
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:07,741
I'll take the stairs. You don't let
anyone out of that elevator, ok?

326
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:08,849
Be strong, Hooch.

327
00:16:09,105 --> 00:16:09,985
I'll try.

328
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:14,744
So where's chocolate bear number 2?

329
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,781
Who else thinks they're
faster than me, huh? Huh?

330
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:24,633
Yo, Hooch is seriously cazy.

331
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:29,526
Look, Carla, Jake makes me happy.

332
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:31,747
Plus there's a decent chance he'll be
my second serious boyfriend

333
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,548
not to end up in bed with
my mom or my brother Barry.

334
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:34,947
And he doesn't always
tell me what to do.

335
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:37,585
I mean, sure, he did tell me to
come up here and talk to you,

336
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:39,333
but I was gonna do that anyway
'cause I wanted to ask you

337
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:41,643
if I should wear hooker heels
or flats with my pink skirt

338
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:43,074
when we go celebrate
my new job tonight.

339
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:45,235
But instead I'm trying to figure
out what your problem is.

340
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,400
Look! I thought you were staying, ok?

341
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:51,740
I've been here for 11 years, and
it's always the same story.

342
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:54,583
I get really close to someone,
and they move on.

343
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,310
I don't want to be 50 making friends with
the new 25-year-old interns, Elliot.

344
00:17:01,298 --> 00:17:03,567
They'll make fun of me
when we go dancing.

345
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:04,964
Not if I go with you.

346
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,356
And then they kiss?

347
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:15,844
Sorry.

348
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,835
Look at him.
What an angel.

349
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:23,451
Down, he's waking up.

350
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:27,391
Hey, jordan, um...

351
00:17:28,268 --> 00:17:31,404
Look, I tried to guilt you
into not taking that job.

352
00:17:31,588 --> 00:17:32,465
Really?

353
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:36,664
Look, I don't want to be one of those
moms that never sees her kids,

354
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:39,504
but I also don't want to be one of
those moms that stays at home

355
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,829
but then resents her kids 'cause she
wishes she was working so

356
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:44,977
she could go to an office and feel bad
about not being at home with her kids.

357
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,071
I was just worried that you
would think I was a bad mom.

358
00:17:49,162 --> 00:17:53,657
Sweetie, you are an evil, soulless,
chemically enhanced battle-ax

359
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:56,245
that I truly doubt is 100% human, but...

360
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:59,730
You are an amazing mom.

361
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:07,426
Just say you're sorry, give me
a hug, and this'll all be over.

362
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,135
Why do I have to say I'm sorry?

363
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,057
Dude, I don't mean to
sound girly,

364
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:14,182
but for the last 12 years, you've
practically been like my wife.

365
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:15,926
How is that girly?

366
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:20,336
Look, before, when you said I'd never be
as cool as when I was living with you,

367
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:22,374
you know there's
some truth to that.

368
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:29,729
I'm sorta like odd and geeky and...
you've always sort of validated me.

369
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:32,182
J.D., you're just moving out.

370
00:18:32,923 --> 00:18:34,395
Well, say things will be the same.

371
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:40,826
That's Carla.
I gotta go.

372
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:42,546
You're right.
Things are gonna be different.

373
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:45,118
But different doesn't always mean bad.

374
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,626
Just means different.

375
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:50,809
- Ok.
- All right.

376
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:56,609
No better pick-me-up than
a nice slice of mom's pie.

377
00:18:56,644 --> 00:18:58,374
Why are you so obsessed with this?!

378
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:02,160
I don't know. I think it's 'cause this time,
I wasn't trying to mess with you.

379
00:19:02,803 --> 00:19:03,681
Really?

380
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:07,962
Really.

381
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:19,210
Who would do this to himself?

382
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:20,278
Totally worth it.

383
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:22,931
As every piece of food I'd put
to my body in the last year

384
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:24,782
was rushing out of me,
it got me thinking.

385
00:19:24,817 --> 00:19:28,240
The way some things never change
shines a light on the things that do.

386
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:32,764
Like when a new person
comes into the hospital to stay...

387
00:19:34,316 --> 00:19:35,663
My office keys, Ted.

388
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:40,298
Can't believe I'm actually doing this.

389
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,811
You'll meet me out later, right?

390
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:46,631
Or an old friend leaves for good.

391
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:57,718
Sometimes the biggest changes are
a result of an impulsive decision.

392
00:19:57,753 --> 00:19:59,411
I think we should have a baby.

393
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:03,680
I know you're feeling
abandoned right now,

394
00:20:03,685 --> 00:20:06,232
but we just went through
a really rough spot,

395
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:08,956
And I'm not the type of guy
to make life-changing decisions

396
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,287
without thinking about it
for at least, like,

397
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:12,931
a few months.

398
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:18,026
Let's make a baby.

399
00:20:27,712 --> 00:20:32,033
And so here I am, a guy in an
empty apartment with a dead dog.

400
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:34,381
Oh, and that's not
a tear on my cheek.

401
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,170
That's just from the leak in my ceiling.

402
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:39,628
And, yes, change is scary,
but it's also inevitable.

403
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:41,441
It's up to you to
make the best of it.

404
00:20:41,476 --> 00:20:44,503
I mean, it's not like opportunity's
just gonna fall into your lap.

405
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,771
Then again,

406
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:50,745
Howdy, neighbor, I'm Jonathan.

407
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:52,375
Hi.

408
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,800
You eyeballin' my woman?

409
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,186
I hate change.

410
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:02,511
