1
00:00:00,808 --> 00:00:02,610
<i>I'm such a total loser...</i>

2
00:00:03,174 --> 00:00:04,357
<i>My girlfriend and I broke up,</i>

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:05,624
<i>I live in a tent...</i>

4
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:07,164
<i>Plus, I feel sick enough to</i>

5
00:00:07,165 --> 00:00:09,309
<i>actually get checked out,
and guess who's on call?</i>

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,806
I don't look right...

7
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:12,360
What? What is it?

8
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:13,594
You have a penis.

9
00:00:14,374 --> 00:00:16,693
Or...that's what I think it is...

10
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,258
It's a penis.

11
00:00:19,297 --> 00:00:19,804
Fair enough.

12
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:21,870
Noobie, go ahead and give me that blood test.

13
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:24,170
<i>I wasn't the only one suffering.</i>

14
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:26,818
<i>Turk's intern, Milos,
was driving him nuts.</i>

15
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:30,843
<i>See, Milos was already an accomplished
surgeon in his war-torn homeland,</i>

16
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:33,399
<i>but he still had to re-do his residency here.</i>

17
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:39,099
Ok, everyone, let's take a look at that
subcuticular stitch on Mr. Rodd's chest

18
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:43,661
That is beautiful. We could all learn
from whatever attending did that.

19
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,957
It was me.

20
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:48,769
Would you like to take break? I finish
taking frightened bunnies on arounds.

21
00:00:48,868 --> 00:00:50,821
No, Milos, i would not like to take a break!

22
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:54,126
- I'm absolutely fine right here, thank you!
- Ok, fine.

23
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:58,641
You know what? Everyone head down observation
and check on Mr. Foley's arm reattachment.

24
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:08,214
What? You think you can't learn from
seeing an actual arm reattachment, Milos?

25
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:14,158
I reattach child's arm once.
In rusty shell of car.

26
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:18,402
I can still see their bodies,
their littered streets...

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,815
It's my country...burn...to ground.

28
00:01:28,431 --> 00:01:29,797
Milos is so lucky.

29
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:30,770
Turk!

30
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:33,229
You're the only one in the
world who would think that!

31
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:36,769
Milos is so lucky.

32
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:38,662
That's what I'm saying!

33
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:40,728
Brown bear, I think I've spent so much time

34
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:43,197
on the ladies, and I feel my
whole life's in the crapper.

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,016
Naah, man, you'll turn this around.

36
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:49,792
Here goes Buzz and Donna, off
to the marriage counselor.

37
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:54,589
Buzz feels an eudicot because he lost his job
at Foot Locker. Now he's ding on one work.

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,740
I should not have given you

39
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,732
- the spy equipment for yout birthday.
- Are you kidding me? I need it,

40
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:01,112
so I know when I can sneek
over and use the can.

41
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,252
And by the way, I'm using the front bathroom,
now, because there's a hook on the door,

42
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:06,944
- So I can hang on my pants.
- Haaah!

43
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:11,280
- Why? Have you started listening to me?
- You're right, my friend, man is the only

44
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:14,474
- animal that wears pants during toosies.
- This is so unnatural.

45
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:28,638
Noobie's test result came back.

46
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:30,227
He's got Vasovagal Syncope.

47
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:31,917
And that makes you happy?

48
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:35,215
If he's vigorously Valsalva
he can activate his reflex

49
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:36,942
and actually lose consciousness.

50
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:40,548
Carla...he'd pass out when he pooes!

51
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:45,675
Buzz...Donna...

52
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:47,872
I was counseling.

53
00:02:49,682 --> 00:02:51,710
Uh, what if you mind handing me my cheenos?

54
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,991
<i>Turk, I need help...</i>

55
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,478
Buzz is maaaad...

56
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:17,243
Oh, I read up on Vasovagal Syncope

57
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:19,891
the treat goes after workup
on reducing my stress.

58
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,640
At least Buzz agreed not to call the cops

59
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,232
if I don't tell al the other
neighbors Donna's bare end.

60
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,547
- Damn, dude, you've got to play it rough.
- You hear that, everybody?

61
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:33,374
I do have it rough, and that's coming from
a man who knows a tinsy about adversity.

62
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,877
- And why is that, Turk?
- Ah...because I'm black.

63
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:40,407
No, because you have diabetes,
what's hard about being black?

64
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,517
Hey ya, my name is Bob
Kelso and i like whores.

65
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:50,365
Now, why don't I introduce myself like that?

66
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:53,712
Because there is a time
and a place for the truth.

67
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:57,609
Uhm, you take Dorian's intern,
Brandon, for example.

68
00:03:57,712 --> 00:04:01,824
He told his patient that it was the first
time he was performing a spinal tamp.

69
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:03,655
And what did the patient do, doctor?

70
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:06,021
Ah, well...uhm...she-she
started hyperventilate...

71
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:10,856
a-a-and then she reached fora hit of
what she thought was an oxygen tank...

72
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,250
it turned to be a helium
container from pediatrics...

73
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:14,770
then she screamed

74
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,874
<i>I'll kill you bitcheeees!</i>

75
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:19,551
which frankly we all thought was hilarious.

76
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:21,933
Oh, and did it was, but you know what wasn't?

77
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:25,729
When she ran through the door, tripped,
and fell, and broke her femor.

78
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:27,634
Now she's suing the hospital.

79
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:31,400
And since Ted is our lawyer,
what's goin' to happen?

80
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,982
Girlfriend's gonna get paiiiid!

81
00:04:36,503 --> 00:04:37,365
So you called this meeting

82
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:40,198
- to say we should lie more?
- Sorry about that, Bobo,

83
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:43,344
but I'm gonna go and tell the truth
whenever i damn will, please.

84
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:48,217
For instance, your tie. It's hideous,
in fact its only redeeming quality

85
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:52,273
is to divert attention from the very
visible outline of...your man-girdle.

86
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:55,672
- Too mean.
- Sorry.

87
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:03,259
Hey. Have fun in the next couple
days, I'm going on vacation.

88
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:08,123
- And you're taking a mop?
- Yeah, it's a custodial cruise.

89
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:09,788
Pretty cool, huh? Check this out.

90
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,598
I'ts really a great package, for guys like me.

91
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:15,767
Guests have the option of
cleaning their own rooms.

92
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:17,168
Where else you gonna get that?

93
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,842
There's a shuffleboard with urinal cakes,
instead of the discs...that's funny!

94
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:26,874
No way! Special appearance by Pat Herrington,
Schneider from "One day at a time".

95
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:28,837
Huh-hah! He's gonna be
there signing work boots!

96
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:31,701
- There'll be any chicks in there?
- No maids allowed.

97
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:35,522
-You know how janitors feel about maids.
- I do now.

98
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,281
Anyway, Todd and Ted are
gonna get 20 bucks from me

99
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:40,357
to tape you to the ceiling
of the cafeteria, tomorrow.

100
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,636
And I'm telling you this because
I figure you're very zoned out and

101
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:44,074
stopped listening to me, am I right?

102
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:48,151
<i>I don't know what the janotor had said,
but I feel like things are looking up.</i>

103
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:52,217
<i>He's leaving, plus I have friends who
are more than happy to be there for me.</i>

104
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:56,789
Ok, I've been taking care of JD all
week, it's now up to one of you guys.

105
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:00,376
Go ahead, honey, use your new go-to-excuse.

106
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:02,126
I can't. I have a baby!

107
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:07,379
Hey, i have responsabilities, too, ok?
I mean, Keith and I are still in a stage

108
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,188
of our relationship where I don't
hate having sex with him,

109
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:10,437
and I would like to keep that going.

110
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:14,418
Elliot, as for the last ten years getting JD to breakups and emotional spirals

111
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,615
I have had sex with him,
you 'd have to do that?

112
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,465
Well, I'll see you'll step outside and
handle this like we used to, back in my day.

113
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:21,771
Muskets?

114
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:27,733
<i>Bedpan race!</i>

115
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:30,156
Put your bedpans on, Elliot.

116
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:33,217
- I thought we wer carrying them.
- Put 'em on!

117
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:37,677
<i>Last one down gets to take care of JD!</i>

118
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,038
<i>Ready?</i>

119
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:40,053
<i>Go!</i>

120
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:54,851
This is a hospital! Keep it quiet!

121
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:06,912
Yuhuhuhuuu!

122
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:07,729
Ooh!

123
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,288
There ain't no rules in bedpan race.

124
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:12,508
Fuck!

125
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,814
I'm totally excited to be here, buddy,
let's start talkin' about your life.

126
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,265
Ok, first I have to go to the bathroom.
Do me a favour?

127
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:22,003
Tie this string around your wrist.

128
00:07:22,332 --> 00:07:24,782
If you feel it tug, that
means I'm down.

129
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:26,724
- Run in and check on me.
- Mm-mmh.

130
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:32,472
How is Izzy doing?

131
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:35,645
Wow, look at you remembering
my daughter's name.

132
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:37,824
Tom, your short term memory
is getting better.

133
00:07:38,077 --> 00:07:40,857
No, I had the nurses write
some stuff down, you see...

134
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,678
Apparently, I like bananas...

135
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:45,324
And...wow, am I getting
more surgery tomorrow?

136
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:48,763
You have a small bowel obstruction,
basically the shrapnel in your stomach

137
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:50,171
has caused scar tissue to form.

138
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:54,094
In Iraq we prefer to think of
shrapnel as internal body bling.

139
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:56,356
Wow, then bling bling, eh eh eh.

140
00:07:56,776 --> 00:08:01,184
So, humm, have any of your patients
ever died from this procedure?

141
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:04,075
Oh, yeah... a couple of years ago.

142
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:07,099
A guy had a bad reaction to anesthesia,

143
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:09,320
but that's not gonna happen
to you. You know what?

144
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,203
We should have a nurse write that down.

145
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:14,297
I like bananas.

146
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:18,597
<i>You shouldn't have told him
the truuth...uuth, uuth, uuth...</i>

147
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:21,414
uuth, uuth, uuth...

148
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:23,869
- Doctor Kelso.
- ...uuth...

149
00:08:23,897 --> 00:08:26,412
You can "uuth" all you want
but I'm not gonna BS Brian. [BackStab]

150
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:32,208
Look, JD, we all have low
moments in our lives...

151
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:36,054
Well, in high school I had this
amazing teacher, Mr. Higgins,

152
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:40,311
and he was funny, and inspiring, I
mean he was like a second father to me.

153
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:44,997
And then, one day I found out that
he was sleeping with his students,

154
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:49,247
and I was crashed, I mean:
why not me?

155
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:53,123
You know, and it wasn't my lazy eye,
because that was fixed by prom.

156
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:55,979
Anyway, eventually I realized

157
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,546
that your troubles don't seem so bad if you
just stop talkin' about them all the time.

158
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,197
You know what else
sucks about my life?

159
00:09:02,882 --> 00:09:05,333
Now even my neighbours are
screwing my head.

160
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,432
You called about a wolf?

161
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:08,926
A wolf? No.

162
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:12,582
Someone called 911 at that phone
claiming there's a wolf in this yard.

163
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,303
This has "Buzz" written all over it.
He's upset with me,

164
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,939
but he won't talk about it
because his peep won't perform.

165
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:22,448
He pooped in our house!

166
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:25,318
I don't know why he
can't get past that.

167
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:28,237
Oh! Auh!

168
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:32,746
Whoever has the other end of
this string, that's not funny!

169
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,450
Wow, my boobs do look good when
they're wet, don't they?.

170
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:38,678
Yeah, they do.

171
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:42,825
Then we'll make the laparoscopic
incision right...

172
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,778
Here.

173
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:47,135
Todd, anything to add?

174
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:48,769
Your nipples are stunning.

175
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:50,155
Hey, thanks brother.

176
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:53,783
It's making me look sad that
he had to answer to you.

177
00:09:54,214 --> 00:09:55,840
Interns, disperse.

178
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:00,548
What the hell is
"TheToddTime.com"?

179
00:10:00,978 --> 00:10:03,868
Well, God'll thank me later. Cyber-five!

180
00:10:05,164 --> 00:10:06,615
- Sent!
- Dude!

181
00:10:08,593 --> 00:10:10,134
That guy is such a meathead.

182
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:13,296
Come on, I thought all you
surgeons were a bunch of brainiacs.

183
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:15,908
I'm sure you got straight A
since pre-school, right?

184
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,375
Are you kidding me?

185
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:22,494
My gilfriend wasn't the only one with
34 C's, if you know what I'm saying!

186
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:24,633
No.

187
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:26,887
Yeah, I was an average student.

188
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,201
- JD, you should not drive.
- I've only had 2 Appletinis.

189
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:37,858
JD, I know when you're tipsy you
always get super-handsy.

190
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:41,931
You know what? You're right.

191
00:10:42,557 --> 00:10:44,147
Looks like I'm smuggling raisings.

192
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:47,124
I'm close by, I'll just
push my scooter home.

193
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:52,098
<i>And now, for a little radio.</i>

194
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:55,776
- Welcome to SportsTown!
- Wheew!

195
00:11:00,423 --> 00:11:03,099
<i>Aaah, much better.</i>

196
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:09,540
<i>Ah, Billy. After the Arctic and the
Pacific, you're my favourite Ocean!</i>

197
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,427
Dr. Kelso, what the hell!

198
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,707
Why are you taking
me off the Brian surgery?

199
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:22,119
Oh, since you told him you
were just an average student,

200
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,755
he doesn't want you to do it anymore.

201
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:26,901
And for extra fun, guess
who I got to replace you.

202
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:29,079
Ki-hello.

203
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:35,061
I guess you should have
followed my advice...ice..ice.

204
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,491
I come back. Finish later.

205
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,669
<i>Carl, are you there?</i>

206
00:11:48,947 --> 00:11:49,479
What?

207
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,443
There'd better be
a wolf, this time.

208
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:55,482
Oh, I'm not the person who called.

209
00:11:58,576 --> 00:11:59,982
Wait, have you been drinking?

210
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,085
A little, alright? But
I wasn't driving.

211
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:07,774
There's a key in your ignition.
In this State, that's drinking and driving.

212
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:10,930
Officer, we both know you're not
gonna hold me in for that.

213
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:20,817
So, how was prison?

214
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:21,653
Were you scared?

215
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:24,612
Actually, my cellmates were
a little scared to me.

216
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:27,922
That's so uncool, man.

217
00:12:28,469 --> 00:12:29,879
Why'd he hang up his pants?

218
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:35,741
After I became a member of the gang,
I even got the up initiate new members.

219
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:40,498
You like that, you punk ass bitch?

220
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:41,927
Take it!

221
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:44,209
Wonderful stay in touch!

222
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,956
Turkleton, be afraid to stop by
Brian surgery and check out...

223
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:54,919
Dr. Radovicnouizicioiuizciniciz
operating skills.

224
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:58,506
Unlike you, he understands
the importance of good grades.

225
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:03,734
Look, Carla, eventually it'll get out so I'm
just gonna tell everybody I got an S.U.I..

226
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,762
Scooting Under the Influence? Are
you crazy? Keep that to yourself!

227
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:08,823
Shoosh!

228
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:11,552
May I have everyone's attention, please?

229
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:15,421
<i>The reason Turk didn't want me to say
anything was beacuse this had just happened.</i>

230
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:20,410
You know those 2 upstairs, who
got hit by the drunk driver?

231
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:24,248
The daughter's gonna make it,
but the mom died.

232
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,371
<i>Anyway, back to the present.</i>

233
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,174
Last night I got arrested
for drunk driving.

234
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:31,560
Oooh!

235
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,716
But I swear you all that
this is not a big deal.

236
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:36,316
No, he did it.

237
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:39,744
<i>And suddenly I knew what it
felt like to be universally despised.</i>

238
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,166
Fire! Aaaah!

239
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:54,008
Does some of you know I'm
not a huge fan of fire, ok?

240
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:59,062
So why don't we talk this out? I'll go
first. Carl, obviously I owe you an apology.

241
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:00,962
I ate your daughter's face.

242
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,483
- Aaaaaagh!
- Auauauaaaagh!

243
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:08,362
Uncool, Carl! Knock down with the fire!

244
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:19,182
Ok, in here we have Mrs. Frank,
who is in rhino-failure, a--

245
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:23,275
and over here we have Dr. TurtleHead,

246
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:27,557
who is suffering from a severe
case of..."the Salkys"

247
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:31,260
Symptoms include bad
posture, moppy face,

248
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:34,374
and a sudden uncontrollable
flailing of the upper extremities.

249
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:38,919
Is it possible I've misdiagnosed
this modality?

250
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,377
- No...
- There it is. That a boy!

251
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:44,835
Beat it. All of ya!

252
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:47,429
I can't lie to a patient

253
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,342
- 'cause Dr. Kelso wants me to.
- See that guy in there?

254
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,906
He has pancreatic cancer, and you
and I both know he's...a conor.

255
00:14:56,376 --> 00:15:00,143
But if he'd have come out here and ask if
he has hope, what am I supposed to say? "No"?

256
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:03,891
- So you're saying I should lie?
- Of course not. See,

257
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,457
see that guy over there?

258
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:09,777
Now, the only way he's ever gonna
walk again is if he goes through

259
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:12,276
years of painful phisical therapy,

260
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:15,161
but if he'd wish to come over here
and ask me "is it gonna be hard?"

261
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:17,562
I'd tell him "Damn skippy
it's gonna be hard!". Gandhi,

262
00:15:18,386 --> 00:15:21,741
you've got to tell your patients the truth.
Now is that brain of yours starting to hurt?

263
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:26,570
It should, because it's not as large as
a normal size brain. Listen carefully:

264
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,644
Kelso lies selfishly and
indiscriminately; you,

265
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,906
you gotta draw your own lie.

266
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:35,550
This is heaven Ibuprofen,

267
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:39,999
it's just the perfect dose for your
pea-size brain, take it after I leave,

268
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:41,718
you'll save yourself the embarassment.

269
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:53,602
Dr. Dorian.

270
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:56,870
I promised the Janitor
I'd show you this email.

271
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:01,198
Can you guys look away?
I need to enter my password.

272
00:16:03,777 --> 00:16:08,666
Alligator...three...ok, you can look now.

273
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,268
A-hoy! That's my update to my trip.

274
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:15,629
Yesterday we took over the ship! AAAH!

275
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:18,210
We captured the boat people
and tied 'em up pirate-style.

276
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,301
Now we can do whatever we
want, including this. Watch!

277
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:27,535
Anithing goes, man! I gotta go, it's my turn to steer. Woooow!

278
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:32,597
Step on it guys! Uhm, hey, thinkin' about
you, hope everithing's doing well for you.

279
00:16:33,996 --> 00:16:37,743
It's not. I can't even convince the voice in
my head that things are gonna turn around.

280
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:39,968
<i>What do you want me to say, man?</i>

281
00:16:40,897 --> 00:16:43,038
Hey, come on, buddy, we'll
cheer you up. Come on.

282
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:50,474
There you are. You've gotta
help pull JD out of this spiral.

283
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:55,290
Any other day I'd say no, but today
I'm gonna go ahead and just say no.

284
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,933
He took care of you when you
were bawling on your couch

285
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,497
drinking scotch like it was vodka.

286
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:01,834
I accidentally killed 3 people.

287
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:04,980
He got arrested for pushing a scooter
and he passes out when he pooes.

288
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,980
- Ok, you're going to help him.
- But just answer me this one question:

289
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:13,750
after six long years, aren't you
getting tired of taking care of him?

290
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:16,698
Of course we are but....we're his friends.

291
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,342
<i>I heard every word. See, unfortunately,</i>

292
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:24,643
<i>I had forgotten that Ted and Todd were under
Janitorial orders to tape me to the ceiling.</i>

293
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:30,329
<i>But forgetting things isn't always bad.</i>

294
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:34,254
So, Dr. Turk, You're signed
to do my surgery today?

295
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:35,558
What?!

296
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:37,989
<i>In fact, it could give you a second chance.</i>

297
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:39,940
Doc-tape five!

298
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:50,093
That guy is such a meathead. I always thought
you surgeons were a bunch of brainiacs.

299
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:53,144
I'm sure you got straight A
since pre-school, right?

300
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,961
<i>A second chance to define who you truly are.</i>

301
00:17:56,229 --> 00:18:01,965
Are you kidding? My gilfriend wasn't the
only one with 34 C's, hear what I'm saying!

302
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:05,818
Still don't know what I'm saying...

303
00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:09,539
- I was an average student.
- Really?

304
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:13,464
But when I realized I wanted to be
a surgeon I got my act together.

305
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:18,082
Brian, if I didn't think i was the
right person to perform this operation,

306
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:19,002
I wouldn't do it.

307
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:22,852
- Ok?
- Ok.

308
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:27,294
<i>During those two hours I
was stuck to the ceiling,</i>

309
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:29,340
<i>I witnessed some pretty clear things.</i>

310
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:31,495
I'll see you tonight, Dan.

311
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:35,626
<i>But mostly I witnessed the greatest
hits of my own self-pity.</i>

312
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,514
Can't get Dr. Cox to notice me.

313
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,509
I'm dating my best friend, but....
I don't think I love her.

314
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:42,125
I'm lonely.

315
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,290
I'm a loser.

316
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:44,773
Gotta helpe me out.

317
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:46,463
- Help me out.
- Help me.

318
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:50,482
<i>And I understood how my friends felt,
because I couldn't stand it for 2 hours,</i>

319
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:51,505
<i>but along 6 years...</i>

320
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:55,725
I wash it every day, I condition, but
just can't get them where I want it.

321
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:02,720
For the love of God! Mousse and twist!

322
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,842
Don't you have something you wanna say?

323
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:18,293
Listen, I would really like it if you...
would go and grab a beer with me, what...

324
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,490
what do you say?

325
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,448
<i>And even though I'd finally gotten</i>

326
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:25,960
<i>the totally-sip-sears mountanious
