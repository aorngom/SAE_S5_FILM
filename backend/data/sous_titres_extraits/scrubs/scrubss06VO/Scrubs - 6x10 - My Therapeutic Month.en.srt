1
00:00:02,865 --> 00:00:05,094
<i>My license has been
suspended for a month</i>

2
00:00:05,185 --> 00:00:07,368
<i>for drunkenly pushing
my scooter home.</i>

3
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:12,099
<i>So Old Sasha had become
a perch for local bird gang.</i>

4
00:00:13,918 --> 00:00:16,246
<i>Luckily, I've found another
way to get around.</i>

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,739
What's up?!

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:19,511
Thanks for the ride, Lloyd.

7
00:00:19,512 --> 00:00:22,469
- This DUI is such a hassle.
- Been there, bro.

8
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,380
- Been there.
- Alcohol?

9
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:26,471
Crack.

10
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:30,446
Hey, by any chance, do you like speed metal?

11
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,021
<i>I did not.</i>

12
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:37,489
<i>I am the one, I am the one...
that you need!</i>

13
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:42,616
<i>I am the one...I am the one...to shine!</i>

14
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:47,799
Here sweetheart!

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,009
Oh babe! I didn't
want it with cream.

16
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:52,010
Oh, let me fix for
you, baby.

17
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:54,011
And this isn't soy.

18
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:55,967
Sucks to be you.

19
00:00:58,332 --> 00:00:59,833
I'll go get your coffee.

20
00:01:00,652 --> 00:01:03,199
Kid, how lucky you are
to have a husband.

21
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:06,158
I mean, I've got a brand new home,
I'm totally ready to start my life,

22
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:08,930
but I've saw no Keith
as marriage material.

23
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:11,432
My mum thinks I should test his love
by saying I'm knocked up.

24
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:13,994
If he doesn't propose on the
spot, I'll just demand

25
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:16,855
that he gives me 600$ for the
abortion, dump him, and

26
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:18,982
ease my sadness for the
breading of each one he choose

27
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,506
That's how she got her
actual collection in college.

28
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:24,872
Elliott, you can't test love.

29
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:29,147
When I met Turk, it seemed he was more
in love with his best friend than with me.

30
00:01:29,284 --> 00:01:32,272
Honey, they've got that
homemade Pascade JD loves,

31
00:01:32,273 --> 00:01:34,423
so I was wondering if I can borrow
some money so I can get him some.

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,425
No, you got him a present yesterday.

33
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:39,381
The point is, you can't force it, ok?

34
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:41,610
- Yeah.
- Take it, babe.

35
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:44,020
I think we should move in together.

36
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:45,794
Awesome!

37
00:01:49,297 --> 00:01:51,025
Turk, where's my coffee?

38
00:01:52,116 --> 00:01:55,755
Turk! TURK!

39
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:59,667
Hey, thanks the Pascade, Obi-Brown.

40
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:01,828
- No problem, Luke.
- And thanks for answering my page,

41
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:05,261
I really wanted to rent this place, but once
I told the landlord about my DUI, and that

42
00:02:05,352 --> 00:02:09,173
I sometimes pass out when I poo,
he said I need someone to cosign the list,

43
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:11,856
- what's with that?
- Oh, have no idea.

44
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:14,722
Awesome ceiling fan.

45
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:19,179
What happened? Are you ok?

46
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:21,635
It was a totally unavoidable accident.

47
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:24,774
Check out the hand skills.

48
00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:29,822
That-is-awesome!

49
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:33,006
Yeah, you wanna see awesome?
Turn it up!

50
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,690
- Ooooh!!
- Ahahahahahah!

51
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:42,694
- Turn it off. Turn it off!
- This thing came off!

52
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:45,241
This thing came off!

53
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:49,588
He was a beautiful black blur.

54
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:06,709
<i>There is not a doctor in the world</i>

55
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:09,302
<i>that would disagree with
Brian Dancer when he said:</i>

56
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:11,030
Headwound suck,

57
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,395
I mean, I feel better but I
still can't concentrate,

58
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:16,488
my motor skills are shut,
how I can't even write?

59
00:03:16,943 --> 00:03:18,108
Hi, Brian.

60
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:20,055
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

61
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,220
It's an angel.

62
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,517
That nasty birdless dancer who has Sip

63
00:03:29,518 --> 00:03:31,475
has forgot those damn ostrich feathers.

64
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,385
We're little busy
in here, Laverne.

65
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:41,731
- That was a weird one.
- Hi, I'm Ann Chase.

66
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:44,779
- I'm Brian's physical therapist.
- Konichiwa.

67
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:47,371
I'd love to put my ear on her butt,

68
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:48,918
to see if I can hear the ocean.

69
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:52,465
Oh, Brian, you're doing that thing
when you say your thoughts out loud,

70
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:54,649
it's a side effect of his injury.

71
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,558
Oh.

72
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:58,287
<i>It wasn't, but we've been having
fun since we came up with that.</i>

73
00:03:58,424 --> 00:03:59,788
All right Brian,

74
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,426
what do you think we
should start as a go?

75
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:05,155
I wanna be able to write
my name by the end of the month.

76
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:09,658
<i>Yep! The next month was gonna be
really difficult, for a lot of us.</i>

77
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:14,525
See, this way I will know if Keith
and I have a future, in a month.

78
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,459
So, anyway, I can't do
surgery for a month.

79
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:19,278
Hey, Dr. Kelso,

80
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:22,689
I was wondering, how does
one apply for paid disability leaf?

81
00:04:22,703 --> 00:04:25,123
Nice try, Turkleton,
but the medical staff

82
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:27,487
is short-handed, brought
to Gloria on bed rest.

83
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:31,081
Gloria's having twins,
my lady's having my babies.

84
00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:32,536
Damn right,

85
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:36,448
I'm gonna have your
baby so hard, baby.

86
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:40,382
So you're saying that I'll be
a medical attending fora month?

87
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:44,157
Attending? You don't have the training for
that, you're gonna be a resident again.

88
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:48,365
Good morning, "reasons why I drink",

89
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,594
you may have noticed that
we have a new face in our group.

90
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:54,095
Oh, these glasses are not
prescription, but, uh,

91
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:56,733
I figured I wear'em, so I can
feel in with you medical geeks.

92
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,962
Know what I'm saying?

93
00:04:58,143 --> 00:05:00,099
<i>Cool, a new black resident!</i>

94
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:05,625
- Oh, it's just Turk. Hey Turk!
- Good morning, JD.

95
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:07,672
Hey hey hey!

96
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,219
What is up with that
giant novelty pen?

97
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:12,402
It's an occupational therapy pen.

98
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:14,404
Brian can't hold small objects.

99
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:16,723
I had an ex-girlfriend with
the same problem.

100
00:05:16,905 --> 00:05:19,180
Kidding, no she didn't.
That's... that's awkward.

101
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:22,136
Son of a bitch.
That's hot!

102
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:25,001
Brian, such foul language

103
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:28,640
should never be uttered in front of
a lady with such... delicate...

104
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:30,596
...soft ears.

105
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:32,870
I have another appointment.

106
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,099
Right.

107
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,237
Man, why don't you
just ask her out?

108
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:41,012
Brian, expertly flirting is one thing,

109
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:42,702
but I-I'm not ready to get
back in the game yet,

110
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:44,495
I risk to have a serious relationship.

111
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,743
Plus, I'm a tent dwelling, poop
fainter who can't drive.

112
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:50,026
I have a fiberglass skull.

113
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,876
So what's the competition with you?

114
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:54,951
- Aah!
- Oh!

115
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:57,026
- Aah!
- Oh...Ooh!

116
00:05:57,252 --> 00:05:58,693
- Aah!
- Ouch!

117
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:00,577
Oh my God, that was amazing.

118
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,731
I know. Were you thinking about me?

119
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:07,551
Totally. Were you thinking about me?

120
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:10,689
I always think about you
when I'm in the box, you know that.

121
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,145
Babe.

122
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:20,104
Hmm, sweetie, this is actually my
grandmother's coffee table soup.

123
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:21,833
just use a coaster from now on.

124
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:26,290
Oh, the coaster argument.

125
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:30,702
You would not believe the stuff I had to put
up when Turk and I first moved in together.

126
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,886
Do you know what I caught
him doin' in bed,

127
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,797
even though I was sleeping
right next to him?

128
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:48,031
Have one?

129
00:06:49,737 --> 00:06:52,648
Look, the point is...it's an adjustment.

130
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:54,604
Get ready for some arguing.

131
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:58,197
Not us. He does even mind
sleeping in separate rooms.

132
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,939
Upliving with a guy before
marriage makes me feel whory.

133
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,274
You're goin' to live in separate States.

134
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:09,551
But if you do on the nasty before you
get married, your ass is gonna burn.

135
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:15,671
Ok, kids. Time to put a spotlight
on Mr. Cuckoo-pants.

136
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,923
Name a test, any test,
that you would run for...

137
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:20,090
...Lupus!

138
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:24,335
Lupus...does she live on the second floor?

139
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:25,285
Mmmh.

140
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:29,008
* Does she live upstairs from you? *

141
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,738
* I think you have seen here before... *

142
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:33,769
Still waiting...

143
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,653
<i>Antinuclear antibody test.</i>

144
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:39,826
Anti-something something test.

145
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:43,962
It really is just super that you're
here with us as a reminder

146
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:47,034
that surgeons really are simply
ignorant scalpel jocks.

147
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,267
Hell, after surgery...if there's
the slightest medical issue

148
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:53,831
you just turf the patient right down to us,

149
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:56,477
the real doctors, so we
can pick up your slack.

150
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:59,221
You cut...and run, if you will.

151
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:01,859
That's right, it's not just a
phrase used by political pundits

152
00:08:01,904 --> 00:08:04,981
who wear bow ties. It is also the
number one reason that all of you

153
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:07,293
should pray to God, or, in your case Rex,

154
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:09,491
Mocho the Samoan Bird King,

155
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:13,137
that you never have to be treated
by these flesh hungry butchers.

156
00:08:13,213 --> 00:08:15,759
Jenny, take his glasses as a trophy.

157
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:22,573
I don't understand why you're
so devoted to that guy.

158
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:24,923
He's got this strange power...

159
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:28,411
Eventually you'll crave his approval

160
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:30,195
- and become just like me.
- Pfff.

161
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,309
<i>But still, as I thought about
Dr. Cox, I knew JD was right.</i>

162
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:35,949
See?

163
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,091
Hey! Looks like I caught you with
my renewed facial hair, huh?

164
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:47,638
- Ooh, God!
- Thank you.

165
00:08:47,683 --> 00:08:50,033
I just found out that my
great-great-great-grandfather

166
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:53,080
was mutton chop enthusiast
Ambrose Burnsides.

167
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:55,232
I'm bringing back that
look to honor his memory.

168
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:58,279
It looks like tiny hamsters
died all over your face.

169
00:08:58,355 --> 00:09:00,916
That happened once, but no.
This is just how I grow facial hair.

170
00:09:01,197 --> 00:09:04,835
It start out patchy, then it
gloriously erupts. You'll see.

171
00:09:04,971 --> 00:09:08,337
When this fills in, this look's
gonna spread like wildfire.

172
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:10,599
Read'em and weep.

173
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,642
What are you doing in here?

174
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:19,258
Hiding from Ann, man.

175
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,895
Phisical therapy is too hard,
I'm getting nowhere.

176
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:25,094
I know you're scared, but
you've got to stick with it.

177
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,454
That means a lot, coming
from someone who's scared

178
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:29,188
- to ask girls on a date.
- You know what?

179
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,627
I'll make a deal: you stick
with your phisical therapy

180
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,292
and I will ask Ann out. Deal?

181
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:35,243
Yeah.

182
00:09:35,472 --> 00:09:38,232
<i>I wonder what the odds
are of Ann saying "yes".</i>

183
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:42,676
It's never gonna happen to you, champ.

184
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:44,429
Kelso just had his car washed!

185
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,181
I'm on it!

186
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:51,412
<i>What did I eat last night?!</i>

187
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:54,829
Oh. Everithing's unpacked.

188
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,283
Your
stuff looks great, by the way.

189
00:09:57,353 --> 00:09:58,586
You mean her stuff.

190
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:01,862
- She wouldn't let me put up my stuff.
- Pop op op op op op.

191
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:03,582
Everithing's awesome, our
grade up works great.

192
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:04,979
What do you mean, we're great?

193
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:06,729
We're not having
box sex in days.

194
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:09,846
Everithing was fine, until
Elliot broke with her

195
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:12,864
unending list of insane rules like:

196
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,764
Put all open cereal in giant ziplock bags.

197
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:19,712
I don't see what's insane about
not wanting spiders lay eggs

198
00:10:19,713 --> 00:10:21,652
in my cornflakes, that's how Carla's mom died.

199
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:22,961
No, it wasn't.

200
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,476
You were supposed to be my best friend!

201
00:10:24,564 --> 00:10:27,957
Elliot! You've got to cut each
other a little bit of slack.

202
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:30,699
You know, Keith, Carla's right.

203
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:32,812
I mean, if you're gonna try--Oh, my God!

204
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:35,090
How hard is it for you to
use the fucking coaster

205
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:36,840
in fucking fucking fuck!

206
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:38,401
Wha-c-c-calm down!

207
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:40,362
All right?! So-so I forget once in a while!

208
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:41,947
Once in a while!

209
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:45,423
There!

210
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:50,501
<i>As I went to ask Ann out
and felt like tough noob</i>

211
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:52,932
headin' inside, get right before a poo faint...

212
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,388
<i>...all better...</i>

213
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,783
<i>I thought about the deals
we sometimes make.</i>

214
00:10:57,651 --> 00:11:00,223
Hello....ok.

215
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:04,268
You know, Dr. Cox, I wouldn't
mind all the crap

216
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:06,731
you've been giving me if I
was actually doing anything.

217
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,817
You haven't asked me for help once.

218
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:10,637
<i>Sometimes deals stink.</i>

219
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:12,387
Because you can't.

220
00:11:13,162 --> 00:11:14,166
Make a deal here, Gandhi.

221
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,460
I will stop mocking you if you
just shut up...stead of our way.

222
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:21,653
<i>And sometimes a deal can ruin everything.</i>

223
00:11:22,786 --> 00:11:25,486
Here's the deal, Keith: my house, my rules.

224
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,900
What? I-I-I thought this was "our" place.

225
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:29,626
No, Keith, this is my place.

226
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,909
You've just rented a room.

227
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:36,025
Still, my deal with Brian was to ask Ann out.

228
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,268
And he was watching,
so I only had one option:

229
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:41,342
ask her a random question
I knew she'd say yes to.

230
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:43,303
Was Papa Smurf the leader?

231
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:44,536
Yes.

232
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,922
She said yes. We're goin' out Friday.

233
00:11:54,651 --> 00:11:57,317
<i> I FELT BAD ABOUT MY LIE TO BRIAN!</i>

234
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,925
<i>STILL I...</i>

235
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:02,190
<i>I felt bad about my lie to Brian.</i>

236
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:04,468
Still, I knew I had
to keep it going.

237
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:15,975
Later, babe.

238
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:21,244
Check out the back scratches.

239
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:26,399
Wow! Good for stale, i take it.

240
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,266
Ok, go.

241
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:31,828
- Aaaaaagh!
- Uuuh!

242
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:33,465
Let's just say:

243
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,766
kiddie like to scratchiee

244
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:37,328
Huh, yeah she does.

245
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:40,424
Hey, but don't, uhm, don't tell her that you know about us, ok?

246
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:42,659
Trying to keep it on the
deal, that's our rule.

247
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:43,692
All right, sure.

248
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:48,383
You know, Dr. Cox, there's
gotta be some I can do to help.

249
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:50,966
Well, now, Gandhi, since you don't grasp

250
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:52,974
the fact that I think you're incompetent,

251
00:12:53,223 --> 00:12:55,205
Ladies and gentlemen, pay attention please:

252
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:58,539
presenting the world's longest "Shoosh".

253
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:09,720
Mmh...Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

254
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,858
I'm goin' echo and...stop.

255
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:14,542
I'm not committing the way I normally do.

256
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:17,453
When you go away, and regroup,
maybe see you later.

257
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:22,729
<i>I knew what I did, that
somehow, i'd made Dr. Cox--</i>

258
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,776
Seriously, dude, stop doing that.

259
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:26,231
That's my thing.

260
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,531
So since I told Keith he only rents a room

261
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:33,781
he refuses to come out if it.
Doesn't matter. He'll crack.

262
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:36,147
Probably not until his party, next week.

263
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:37,920
A party in his room?

264
00:13:38,014 --> 00:13:41,786
Well, I'm up to my family
vacation in Bermuda.

265
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:45,495
Every God awful year in
its wheelchair, rusting

266
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:49,337
the salt water, harassing spends my
money getting his hair branded by trannies.

267
00:13:49,338 --> 00:13:52,475
when I fall asleep in the sun. Don't page me.

268
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,366
Damn ranny, he's got me in my sleep!

269
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,823
That is wrong!

270
00:14:03,095 --> 00:14:04,687
What are you up to, baby?

271
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:08,053
Using all my down time to study
medicine, so I can prove to Dr. Cox

272
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,054
I am not just another dumb surgeon,

273
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:12,965
but everytime I crack open
his books my brain says:

274
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:14,876
"Who cares about this crap?"

275
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:19,197
Then I wonder if we have any frozen
sugarfree fruitjuice pops at home.

276
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:21,380
I'm gonna help you study tonight, and...

277
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:23,199
for every right answer that you get...

278
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:26,337
I'll give you a bite
of frozen fruit juice pop, or...

279
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:28,270
if you prefer...

280
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:30,590
I can remove an item of clothing.

281
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:36,593
Ok. A major indicator
of hypokalemia is...

282
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:40,142
- A potassium level under 3.5.
- Right!

283
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:43,780
And here comes your reward.

284
00:14:43,962 --> 00:14:46,873
Yeah, come to daddy!

285
00:14:48,602 --> 00:14:50,057
Say baby, what happened to your shirt?

286
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,149
Oh, Izzy spit up on me earlier.

287
00:14:52,377 --> 00:14:54,014
How come you didn't put a new one on?

288
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:03,816
To mutton-chops!

289
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:05,771
Yeah!

290
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:09,274
Actually, these are fake.
You all look ridiculous.

291
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:11,730
But I did this to make a point, ok?

292
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:16,324
You have to think for yourself.
Don't be a sheep, follow the foul.

293
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:19,780
All right? You repeat after me:
"I think for myself!"

294
00:15:20,008 --> 00:15:21,964
"I think for myself!"

295
00:15:22,146 --> 00:15:25,602
- "You can't tell me what to say!"
- "You can't tell me what to say!"

296
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:28,422
- "I want to say this!"
- "I want to say this!"

297
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,970
- "Brrrlllppp!"
- "Brrrlllppp!"

298
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,608
- "Unbelievable!"
- "Unbelievable!"

299
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,724
Ehm, ehm... hello!
It's a little noisy, Keith.

300
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:40,998
Everyone, my landlord
wants us to keep quiet.

301
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,318
Boohhhh!

302
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:44,910
Carla?

303
00:15:45,183 --> 00:15:48,640
Give me a break! I haven't
partied since the baby was born.

304
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,819
I told Brian I was taking Ann
to the Poocanoos,

305
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:55,411
now he wants pictures.

306
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:58,822
You have to help me morph the photos I
secretly took her off with my camera phone.

307
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:01,090
On that the picture she seem
to fall fool here to get away.

308
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:02,974
Dude, why don't you just ask Ann out?

309
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,974
- That way you don't have to lie to Brian.
- Oh, I don't know...

310
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,192
It's the right thing to do, just
like me studying my asshole.

311
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:12,350
Now, if you'll excuse me,
let me drop some knowledge on Dr. Keez-ox.

312
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:12,873
Good luck.

313
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:15,287
Excuse me, coming through!

314
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,767
So, this patient has fever of 103...

315
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:23,224
rhino failure and platelets of 25,000.

316
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:25,543
What is the diagnosis in management?

317
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,590
Bam! Put them down!

318
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:31,138
It's obvious the patient's septic.

319
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,912
I'd treat him with an activated protein C.

320
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:35,595
Boo-ya kasha!

321
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:39,188
Dr. Turk, that is just an excellent diagnosis.

322
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:40,962
Heee!

323
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:44,034
However, with his low platelet count,

324
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:48,376
treatment with activated protein C,
would cause what, class?

325
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:50,787
Brain hemorrage!

326
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:53,015
And what would that cause?

327
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:54,653
His death!

328
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,474
Sorry, I got so excited, I was
yelling things out. He wrong.

329
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:02,295
I told you this would happen.

330
00:17:02,386 --> 00:17:05,797
I can't take you seriously
until you take off The Janitor's mutton-chops.

331
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:10,073
Why is that when it comes to relationships

332
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:12,483
people can't take advice from
someone that's already been through it?

333
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,030
- We're different than you and Turk.
- You aren't!

334
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:17,714
- We're not gonna go through the same things you did.
- You are!

335
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:20,261
- Our love is special.
- It isn't!

336
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:23,536
- How can you say that?
- Because she doesn't care a bit.

337
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:27,197
Oh...baby!

338
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:33,013
Ough! I need some new people in my life.

339
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,477
<i>ok, it's now or never.</i>

340
00:17:38,864 --> 00:17:40,228
Excuse me, Anne?

341
00:17:40,364 --> 00:17:43,685
Hey, uhm, my life really
hasn't been in the best place lately.

342
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:48,460
I recently broke up with my girlfriend
who I have impregnated on the first date.

343
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:50,280
Don't worry! She miscarried.

344
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:52,781
And I haven't even begun...

345
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:56,284
to think about asking anyone else out,
mostly because I'm concerned that

346
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:02,106
the stress of love-making will put on my body,
might cause me to pass out much like I do when I defecate.

347
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,881
I also leave in a tent and just got a DUI.

348
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:08,701
I know that as physical therapist

349
00:18:08,883 --> 00:18:13,067
you can appreciate someone who's trying
to get their life back on track, would you please

350
00:18:13,203 --> 00:18:14,977
let me take you to dinner?

351
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:19,253
Ensure you that I'm really just a nice
guy who's fallen on some hard times.

352
00:18:19,526 --> 00:18:20,481
No.

353
00:18:21,004 --> 00:18:23,323
Just... just no? Do you...

354
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:25,871
Do you wanna elaborate on the "no"?

355
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:27,235
No.

356
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:33,989
So, I lied.
And when I finally did ask Anne out...

357
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,672
she said no.

358
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:38,720
- Well, did she elaborate?
- She did not.

359
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:42,631
<i>The thing about failure is
how supportive the people close to you can be.</i>

360
00:18:42,813 --> 00:18:44,314
Hey, man, it's not a big deal.

361
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:46,338
At least you got back in the game, right?

362
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:48,976
So, Dr. Cox...

363
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,933
the cast comes out tomorrow,
any last med shot you wanna take on me?

364
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,754
You have diabetes
and you can't eat cupcakes.

365
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,118
Wow!

366
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,853
Look, you may never have the same grasp
on medicine as we real doctors do,

367
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:06,169
but you're miles ahead of
your fellow numb-nut surgeons.

368
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,675
We're ok for now but...

369
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:10,581
I still don't have Keith as marriage material.

370
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:13,921
You guys made through a month
and you still wanna live together.

371
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:16,026
A lot of couples never make it that far.

372
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:17,676
Yeah but...

373
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,375
I don't feel like I accomplished anything.

374
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:25,545
Ladies and gentlemen, Brian

375
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:28,770
would like to sign his name
on the insurance papers.

376
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:31,367
Here you go.

377
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:41,646
- Not bad, huh?
- It's great.

378
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,103
<i>Brian made us feel how huge</i>

379
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,843
<i>our smallest accomplishments
really are.</i>

380
00:19:52,062 --> 00:19:55,154
<i>Wheter it's having a little more knowledge
than your collegues.</i>

381
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,156
Todd, your appendectomy patient
may be hypertensive.

382
00:19:58,338 --> 00:19:59,976
But the medical Wee-bees deal with it.

383
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:03,796
- We need roast five.
- Don't be such a surgeon.

384
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:05,888
Let's go and check her out.

385
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:10,278
<i>Or easing up on the rules</i>

386
00:20:10,505 --> 00:20:12,204
<i>for the sake of your relationship.</i>

387
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:19,010
<i>Or finally, being ready to get back in the game.</i>

388
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:20,057
Hey, Katie.

389
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:23,058
- Wanna grab a drink?
- Yeah, but not with you.

390
00:20:23,286 --> 00:20:24,650
<i>I'm back.</i>

391
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:29,426
Well then, you're back on the road, huh?

392
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:32,337
Well, sort of.

393
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:35,221
I've got this nifty breathalyzer on my scooter.

394
00:20:35,222 --> 00:20:39,774
If there's any trace of alchool in my breath,
it won't start for 24 hours.

395
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:41,882
Yeah, that's where you blow.

396
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,867
Huh!

397
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,732
Well, time to start my shift.
