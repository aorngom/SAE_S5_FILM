1
00:00:03,202 --> 00:00:06,534
<i>The reason time had slowdown was
because I had just been blindsided</i>

2
00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:08,460
<i>by the two most important women in my life.</i>

3
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:10,583
<i>First, Elliot asked me this...</i>

4
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:11,709
JD...

5
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:14,851
Do you think I'm making
a mistake by marrying Keith?

6
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:18,911
<i>And then my ex-girlfriend Kim, who had
lied and told me she had a miscarriage</i>

7
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:21,584
<i>followed me back from a medical
convention and asked me this...</i>

8
00:00:22,082 --> 00:00:22,702
JD...

9
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:25,361
How could you just leave me there?

10
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:27,671
Holy frick! You're still pregnant!

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,128
Hey, do you think that I should marry Keith?

12
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:33,536
<i>Fortunately, Carla had
special maid-of-honor radar</i>

13
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:35,332
<i>that let her know
when Elliot was obsessing.</i>

14
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:41,311
Elliot, I already told you...

15
00:00:41,312 --> 00:00:43,980
you're just going through
some pre-wedding panic, here.

16
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:48,431
This is how it'll feel when you'll
walk out of that church married.

17
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:50,347
Clap, dammit!

18
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:53,746
Thank you!

19
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:56,713
Thank you all!

20
00:00:57,794 --> 00:00:59,089
Look, I know you're angry.

21
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:02,637
But you promised we'd talk, and then you
just left me stranded there at that bar.

22
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,028
You know what? You're right.

23
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,920
I'm sorry. Let me just
file these, and we'll talk.

24
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:07,981
Great.

25
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:14,112
Hello?

26
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,230
How could you do this to me again?

27
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:20,075
Cut me some slack! I just found
out I'm still having a baby.

28
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,155
I get it.

29
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:24,214
Look, I just ordered a cup of coffee.
I know you can't have caffeine,

30
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:26,309
but you want me to get you some
tea and we can sit and talk?

31
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:28,112
That would be great.

32
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:33,784
It's open, Kim.

33
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:37,292
JD, what the hell?

34
00:01:37,326 --> 00:01:39,915
Ok, that one was a little
excessive. I'm sorry.

35
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,727
It's just that every time I think about
running away, I look at the fat guy

36
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,468
in the track suit with a giant rabbit
head, and he doesn't say anything.

37
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:47,376
Ok, elaborating would help.

38
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:49,244
He's my conscience!

39
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:52,869
I realized that I'd listen to it more if
I imagined something I was really afraid of.

40
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:55,414
The track suit, because I had this mean

41
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,508
Phys Ed teacher in high school
named Mr. Fratelli,

42
00:01:57,894 --> 00:02:01,377
and the rabbit head, because my uncle
once ate a rabbit and he got belly worms.

43
00:02:01,863 --> 00:02:06,335
Look, I wanted to talk to you because,
well, the baby's due in a month

44
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,013
and I guess I was hoping that you'd want me
to have it here, y' know, so that we could...

45
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:14,820
go through it together.

46
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,239
Really?

47
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:20,070
I'm sorry, Kim.

48
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:21,866
This is a big deal for me.

49
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:24,097
I think I need to be alone right now.

50
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,989
Thanks for being alone with me, Choco.

51
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:28,848
So, what should I do?

52
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:30,764
Oh, that's a tough call.

53
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:34,428
When it comes to babies, women are crazy.

54
00:02:37,254 --> 00:02:39,320
If you would please,

55
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:41,982
can you hold her by that
rim over there? Right?

56
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:46,416
I'm gonna Photoshop a basketball
into her hand and Photoshop you out!

57
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:48,347
Everybody's gonna
think my baby can dunk. Right?

58
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:50,056
It's gonna be crazy!

59
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:52,066
Maybe I should ask another dad.

60
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:57,238
I know what Kim did to you was
just crazy, but pregnant women

61
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,435
are among a selected group of people
who are actually allowed to act insane,

62
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:06,053
much like sport's mascots, local weathermen,
theme park performers, and that guy with

63
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:09,976
the question marked jacket who teaches people
how to get free money from the government.

64
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:13,535
Besides, we're talking about your kid.

65
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:17,301
I think we both know what you're gonna do.

66
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:19,548
Ok, I'm in.

67
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:21,963
- Really?
- Yeah, you can even stay here.

68
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:25,013
- But this is only a one bedroom.
- This couch isn't that uncomfortable.

69
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,290
Thanks.

70
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:29,467
Actually, I'm gonna go
lie down right now, huh!

71
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:33,125
Wowowowo, you get the couch,
I get the bed. Was that not clear?

72
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:36,077
Dorian, she's pregnant! Give her the bed!

73
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:38,358
Fine, you can have the bed.

74
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:39,991
You're a great guy, JD.

75
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:49,513
Dorian, don't watch a nudie movie,
with the mother of your child

76
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:51,094
- in the next room!
- Really?

77
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:53,093
No, I'm cool with it.

78
00:03:53,403 --> 00:03:55,788
Whooo, have I got a carrot for her!

85
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:16,030
<i>Since Kim didn't have an o.b. here in town,
we made her an appointment at the hospital.</i>

86
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:19,843
<i>Unfortunately, that meant she had
to face all the people who were mad at her</i>

87
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:23,355
<i>for what she'd done. There was
my best friend, who was furious,</i>

88
00:04:23,825 --> 00:04:27,186
<i>and my mentor, who was equally
upset but didn't wanna show it.</i>

89
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:28,651
- Hi, Kim.
- Hey, Perry.

90
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:32,107
<i>And other acquaintances, who were
much more loyal than I thought.</i>

91
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:33,478
- Hussy!
- Liar!

92
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,341
Jerk!

93
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:36,079
Who is that?

94
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,228
All this group anger's made me hungry! Of
course, everything makes me hungry right now.

95
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:43,481
Well, I have to go to check out a patient.

96
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:44,796
- I'll meet you upstairs?
- Great.

97
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,396
Hem, by the way, all this sympathy
that's coming your way, that's gonna turn,

98
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:52,725
and when it does, I'm gonna be here, and
I'm going to enjoy... Hey! Not finished!

99
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:55,427
It.

100
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:01,551
Mr. Fulton, the reason you're having
chronic pain and trouble walking

101
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,919
is you have peripheral arterial disease.

102
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:05,232
How do you treat it?

103
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:07,394
Well, that's why I brought in
a surgical consult.

104
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:09,612
- Dr. Turk...
- One second, please.

105
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:12,716
<i>Turk liked patients to see him
intensively studying their charts</i>

106
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:14,241
<i>because he felt it instilled confidence.</i>

107
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:17,145
<i>Only I knew the clipboard was blank.</i>

108
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:18,929
Interesting stuff.

109
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:22,347
We are gonna discuss some
options and get back to you.

110
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:25,081
<i>Since Turk was a surgeon,
he always had the same answer.</i>

111
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:26,921
I'm slicin' that guy open.

112
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:29,286
Vascular surgery on a guy his age?

113
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:30,807
Dude, I've done tons of these.

114
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:33,446
And yes, there's a risk.
But with this type of surgery,

115
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:35,332
his quality of life would improve like that.

116
00:05:35,562 --> 00:05:37,541
Tommy, here, could be
playing tennis by the weekend.

117
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:39,291
What do you think, Perry?

118
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:42,504
Let me phrase my response
in the form of a riddle:

119
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:44,258
What's black and white,

120
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:47,177
and should never, ever, ever,

121
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:49,311
be allowed inside of a hospital?

122
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:51,421
Oh, is it Lloyd e Sharise?

123
00:05:51,422 --> 00:05:54,979
Because their PDA has gotten out of control.

124
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,256
And yet, you two still nauseate me more.

125
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,064
Oh, my God!

126
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:10,355
Is it still funny to yell "get a room"?

127
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:11,931
I don't care, I'm going for it.

128
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:13,705
Get a room!

129
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:16,996
Hey, guys.

130
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:18,965
Hey, Kim.

131
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,326
How could you be so nice to her?

132
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:22,756
- That was not nice. That was neutral!
- Neutral!

133
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,205
"Hey, Kim!". That's neutral?!

134
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:25,015
She's with child.

135
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,154
- Oh, so, she's with child..
- Fine!

136
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:27,493
I'll do it over.

137
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:29,159
Kim.

138
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:32,932
Great.

139
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:34,995
Ugh, that sucked!

140
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,173
How did you get so good at being mean?

141
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,596
It gets much easier when you're married.

142
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,995
Ah! Speaking of which, I'm
throwing you a bachelorette party.

143
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,062
Carla!

144
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:45,828
I'm your maid of honor and you
haven't let me do anything yet!

145
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:48,555
Since you've got engaged you've
become much more of a control freak.

146
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,943
Oh, I'm not that bad.

147
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:51,367
You wrote my wedding toast.

148
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:53,527
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure
there weren't any sex jokes in there,

149
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,177
because my grandma
Lati still thinks I'm a virgin,

150
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:57,253
despite what was painted
on our town's water tower.

151
00:06:57,527 --> 00:06:58,634
And what about your honeymoon?

152
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:02,656
I just want a hotel that's on the beach.

153
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,447
Oh, and it's got to have
a bathroom with a bidet.

154
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:06,798
'cause I cannot wear my going-out thong
if I've got sand in my patootie.

155
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:09,126
That's why Travelocity's so great.

156
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:10,874
You can compare 4 hotels at once,

157
00:07:10,974 --> 00:07:13,118
plus, there's tons of
user reviews to help you.

158
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:15,001
See, wouldn't I make a great spokesperson?

159
00:07:15,308 --> 00:07:17,479
Screw Hawaii.
You know where you should go?

160
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,457
Turk, for the last time. There's
no place called Cocoa Mo.

161
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:22,541
Where'd the Beach Boys shoot the video, huh?

162
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:24,587
I'm going to Hawaii.

163
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:27,180
I'm booked.

164
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,023
Hey, babe.

165
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,703
Still thinking about going
skiing for our honeymoon?

166
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:32,996
Oh, sure sweetie.
That's a total possibility.

167
00:07:34,844 --> 00:07:36,376
Ok, so I know what I like.

168
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:39,428
Kim, everything looks good.

169
00:07:40,112 --> 00:07:42,307
But since you're a new patient,
I'd like to do an ultrasound.

170
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,762
I'll be right back.

171
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:45,682
I hate ultrasounds.

172
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:48,319
That gel feels like a whale
hocked a loogie on my belly.

173
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,525
Plus, I'm always afraid in the first few seconds
they're not gonna feel a little heartbeat.

174
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:55,097
Relax, Kim. Dorians are known
for their strong will to live.

175
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:59,319
JD, thank you for being here. It's making it
a lot easier to get through this.

176
00:08:00,073 --> 00:08:01,636
Well, I'm glad I'm here.

177
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,958
So, do you wanna know the sex of the baby?
Because I've already found out.

178
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:07,985
Hit me.

179
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:09,330
It's a boy.

180
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,950
A boy! What's his name?

181
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,953
He didn't say. We have to pick one.

182
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:18,122
Can we name him Sam, after my dad?

183
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:21,165
After what I did to you, you can name
this kid whatever the hell you want.

184
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:23,648
We can name him Sam Perry Gilligan Dorian?

185
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:27,819
- Perry just 'cause I kinda like the ring to it.
- Sure.

186
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,305
And Gilligan 'cause
I've lost that bet to Turk.

187
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:33,970
Those are all better than anything
nerdy like Aragorn or Chewbecca.

188
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,604
Turk has dibs on Chewy.

189
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:42,379
Turk, should I get a male stripper
for Elliot's bachelorette party?

190
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:46,622
Are you, uh, looking for
a caucasian boy or more exotic fare?

191
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:48,050
What?

192
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:51,943
Once spring rolls around,
Enid gets a little randy,

193
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:55,580
so I throw a twenty to Churro,
our neighbour's guatemalan house boy,

194
00:08:55,605 --> 00:08:58,499
to get in our basement and let
Enid chase him around in a wheelchair

195
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,734
until the juice runs out.

196
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:02,512
Churro hates America.

197
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:04,115
Yeah, I wonder why.

198
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:08,223
Ok, Mr. Fulton, it's almost
time to prep you for surgery.

199
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:11,608
Hello! Cute grandaughter.

200
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:14,172
Actually... she's my daughter.

201
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,848
Congratulations.
I've got a daughter too.

202
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:22,721
Six months. Already playing basketball.

203
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,687
So, check out the party plans.

204
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:34,133
A limo takes all the girls to the spa
for a Margi-Marti-Pedi-Party.

205
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,032
That's Margaritas, Martinis e Pedicures.

206
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,274
Oh, what about a Margi Marti Mani Pedi Party?

207
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:41,673
You can't get manis! You need your hands
free for the Margaritas and the Martinis.

208
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:44,095
- Oh, Carla, this rocks!
- I know... - Oh-oh.

209
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:46,715
What? What? What can possibly be wrong?

210
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:50,374
Well, I just noticed that you've
put Ronni Ippolito on the list.

211
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:54,080
See, I just like being the only girl
on the list with a boy's name.

212
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,994
And I find it odd that
a month after I started working here

213
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,098
she changes her name from Veronica to Ronni.

214
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:00,951
Heh, sure Ronni claims that it's 'cause
she doesn't want the same name as her mom.

215
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:04,704
Because her mum snapped
and set fire to that pre-school.

216
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,461
But I still think it's a
tinsy bit coinkidinky!

217
00:10:06,752 --> 00:10:09,051
- No problem, Ronni is out.
- Wait, I'm not sure yet.

218
00:10:09,202 --> 00:10:12,401
I mean, Ronni has also got, like,
the best crazy mum stories.

219
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:17,559
We are talking multiple felonies, including
the attempted assassination of a federal judge.

220
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,186
- Oh... Fun!
- Right?

221
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,738
Plus, I'm not so sure we don't
wanna have a sit-down dinner,

222
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:25,766
You know, maybe do something
a little less girly,

223
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:28,846
like bowling, or paintball, or fight club.

224
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,256
Ok, let's make a list.

225
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,596
Sounds great.

226
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,965
And that's his heart, right there.

227
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:44,751
Wow! That's amazing.

228
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:48,864
Just don't get freaked out by how big his head
is in comparison to the rest of his body.

229
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:51,776
Trick or treat!

230
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:55,774
What great costumes!
I wouldn't recognize any of you.

231
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:59,208
Well, except for you.
You're Dorians' kid.

232
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:00,446
Damn it!

233
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:05,033
I bet you could fit a lot of candy
corns in those cheeks.

234
00:11:07,822 --> 00:11:12,398
I just hope he doesn't get my dad's dainty hands
and my mom's patchy facial hair,

235
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:14,233
and, no, I didn't pluck those.

236
00:11:14,317 --> 00:11:16,845
I just want what every
father wants for his son...

237
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:21,869
Health, happiness and a life long
obsession with American Musical Theatre.

238
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:26,823
This has been the first good day for me
in a long time, JD. Thank you.

239
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:28,668
I'm glad.

240
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:31,897
- I have to admit something.
- Oh-oh.

241
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,058
Last night, when I went
into your room, I couldn't fall asleep.

242
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:40,309
I just... laid on the bed staring at the door,

243
00:11:41,697 --> 00:11:43,031
hoping you might come in.

244
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:45,456
- Kim...
- I know,

245
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:49,084
you don't trust me, and I
don't even know if you like me.

246
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,845
I don't really like myself right now.

247
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,793
But do you think there's a
one in a million chance

248
00:11:53,794 --> 00:11:56,297
that a year from now, or 5 years from now

249
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:59,394
you could get to a place
where you forgive me, and then maybe,

250
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:00,880
you know,

251
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:04,288
We could give it another shot?

252
00:12:04,855 --> 00:12:06,760
<i>"No" is a powerful word.</i>

253
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,361
<i>It can surprise a colleague...</i>

254
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:13,522
Aren't you suppose to do
surgery on that guy today?

255
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,508
No. I decided to cancel it.

256
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:23,274
Ok, I just got us into a great gay bar
for some grope-free dancing,

257
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,661
then I just have to call
a few restaurants.

258
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,164
<i>"No" can piss off a friend...</i>

259
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:31,681
- Do you want some help, Elliot?
- No, Carla, I've got it.

260
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:40,072
<i>Luckily with Kim it was easy just
to say "yes" and make her feel better.</i>

261
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,428
No, Kim, I'm sorry.
There's not any chance.

262
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,329
<i>Unfortunately, I couldn't do it.</i>

263
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,050
Oh, what'd I miss?

264
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:03,277
<i>I felt bad about hurting Kim, so out of
compassion I pawned her off on my friends..</i>

265
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:06,527
Fine, she can come with us,
but I'm not gonna be nice to her.

266
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,411
Thanks. And listen, any time
you need a weekend to yourself

267
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:12,188
and you want me to take that annoying
husband off your hands, just let me know.

268
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,139
Done!

269
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:15,194
<i>Win-win.</i>

270
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,668
So where are you guys gonna go?

271
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:19,111
We're gonna go look at bridesmaid
dresses to see what Carla thinks.

272
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:21,512
Oh, yeah, because my
opinion matters so much.

273
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:24,532
- What the frick is with you?!
- Mrow!

274
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,764
Are you really that immature?!

275
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:27,441
Meow!

276
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:30,143
I'm gonna go check on mr. Fulton's recovery.

277
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:32,544
Oh, mr. Fulton didn't have the surgery.

278
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:34,183
What?

279
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:37,342
Damn it, Ted, I want a cat fight!

280
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,784
That'll do.

281
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:48,674
Hey, JD, check it out.

282
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:50,638
Ugly Betty holding Izzie.

283
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:53,194
I don't care about your
stupid photoshopping, Turk!

284
00:13:53,256 --> 00:13:56,110
Dude, what the hell?! That was real!
We saw her at Costco!

285
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,080
Uh-uh! You apologize
to your friend right now.

286
00:13:59,348 --> 00:14:00,856
I'm sorry about your picture.

287
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:03,199
Gym teacher bunny conscience?

288
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,633
Yeah. What the hell, man?
Why didn't you operate on Mr. Fulton?

289
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:10,349
Dude, I know the pain sucks,
but it's not gonna kill him.

290
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,930
And vascular surgery is way
too risky for a guy that age.

291
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:15,445
Wasn't too risky yesterday.

292
00:14:15,546 --> 00:14:18,191
Well, that was before
I found out he had a kid.

293
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:28,248
I really want to thank you guys for bringing
me out. It's nice to get out of the house,

294
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:29,759
even if you won't talk to me.

295
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:40,026
- Actually, Kim...
- Yeah?

296
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:44,509
Would you mind just trying on
this dress for my cousin Layla?

297
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:46,277
Is she pregnant, too?

298
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:48,106
Oh, no, just a fatty-fatty-fatty.

299
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:53,075
"Can you try on this dress
for my cousin Layla?!"

300
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:54,476
Ok, what is your problem?

301
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,066
You totally took over
the bachelorette party!

302
00:14:57,302 --> 00:14:59,066
You're a crazy control freak!

303
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,079
I am not!

304
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:01,141
Really?

305
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:05,333
Because even though I know you don't
want the bridesmaids to wear any jewellery,

306
00:15:05,627 --> 00:15:08,529
i thought I would wear this tiara.

307
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,690
Is that all right with you?

308
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:11,077
Of course it is.

309
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:13,332
Good. Because I think...

310
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:14,862
I said no bling!

311
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:16,458
See, i told you!

312
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:17,938
I'll pay for that.

313
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:24,335
Kim, are you ok?

314
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:26,170
What am I doing here?

315
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,707
Everybody hates me!

316
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:33,194
I can't get the zipper up on
your big fat cousin's dress.

317
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:36,821
No wonder JD said what he said!

318
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:38,703
What did he say?

319
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:41,642
How coud you do that
to the mother of your child?

320
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:44,490
Yeah, all Kim asked was if there was
a one in a million chance for the two of you,

321
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,993
and you couldn't just
give her a little hope?

322
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,227
Now you're on her side?!

323
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:50,736
She's pregnant! You're supposed to tell
her what she wants to hear.

324
00:15:50,853 --> 00:15:52,598
Yeah, like rember
when Carla was pregnant?

325
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:55,285
And we all told her how beautiful she was
even though she looked like George Lopez?

326
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:56,840
It's the same thing. Right?

327
00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:01,059
Ok, my time-out is over,
now I'm really pissed at you.

328
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,667
Well, well, well. I told you
they'd turn on you.

329
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:07,942
That's just 2 people.

330
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:09,400
Boys?

331
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:11,719
- She's pregnant, man!
- That's uncool.

332
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:13,154
How could you do such a thing?

333
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,587
What'd he do?

334
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:18,364
Hey, Turk!

335
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:20,026
You might want to buckle up,

336
00:16:20,027 --> 00:16:22,085
because the Coxian Express...

337
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,685
Coxian is not the adjective
version of your name,

338
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,995
it's a clever combination
of Cox and Dorian.

339
00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:27,685
Oh.

340
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:32,412
Anyway, the afore mentioned express, is about
to drop some knowledge on your brown ass.

341
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:36,851
You can't change who you are as a doctor
just because you're a dad. Tell him, Per.

342
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:39,907
Of course being a father
changes who you are as a doctor.

343
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:42,144
For God's sake, it changes
everything about you.

344
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:43,841
Why did you come here if you're
just going to contradict me?

345
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:47,848
I don't know. Intentionally
annoying you seems pretty Coxian.

346
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:49,894
That is the adjective version.

347
00:16:50,131 --> 00:16:52,493
Now, if you'll excuse me
I'm going to step over there

348
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:54,876
so that we can present
a united front against you.

349
00:16:57,675 --> 00:17:02,714
Listen, noobie, having a kid changes
the way you think about everything.

350
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:04,005
Hell, yeah, it does.

351
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:08,153
Before Izzie was born if I saw
a half-eaten meatball sub in the trash

352
00:17:08,154 --> 00:17:11,934
you better believe I would dust that
bad boy off and go to town on it!

353
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:12,881
But now...

354
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:16,081
I'm not riskin' my health eatin' trash food.

355
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,766
I mean, unless it's a corndog.

356
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:21,692
Thank God you procreated.

357
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,722
Noobie, the point is,

358
00:17:24,123 --> 00:17:25,956
when that kid comes, you...

359
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:29,982
You'll start seeing the world
a whole lot differently.

360
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:31,529
You develop patience.

361
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:33,234
You learn to forgive easier.

362
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,273
If you got baby poop on your thumb,

363
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:37,837
it's no big deal, you can just
rub it off on your jeans like that.

364
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:40,097
I've seen the Wiggles live in concert!

365
00:17:41,865 --> 00:17:42,475
Twice.

366
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:44,542
Did they perform Big Red Car?

367
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,390
They opened and closed the show with it.

368
00:17:46,476 --> 00:17:48,005
It... was awesome.

369
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:56,518
Carla, we need to talk.

370
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,423
Mrow!

371
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:59,109
No, sir, not "mrow!"

372
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:05,416
Look, I know that I'm a control freak,
but it's just my nature.

373
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:09,028
For example, you've got one maverick hair
sticking out of that right eyebrow

374
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:10,222
that is driving me crazy

375
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:13,006
and I want nothin' morethan to pin you
down and to pluck the hell out of it.

376
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:14,209
But of course I won't.

377
00:18:14,905 --> 00:18:15,866
Unless you want me to.

378
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:17,905
Never mind.

379
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,086
What I really wanted to say is that...

380
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:24,671
You're my best friend and I'm sorry.

381
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:26,918
Good.

382
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:28,339
'cause the party's still on.

383
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:29,819
But on one condition...

384
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:34,182
You gotta go the next 20 minutes without
asking any questions about what we're doing.

385
00:18:34,535 --> 00:18:35,319
I can do that.

386
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:41,208
Wow, this is so cool!

387
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:45,382
And, time!
That's 20 minutes.

388
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:47,243
What are we doing? Where's everyone?
This feels all wrong.

389
00:18:47,244 --> 00:18:49,609
Elliot, relax. This is your night.

390
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,465
You get to make all the decisions.

391
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:53,793
Now, all your friends are standing by.

392
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:58,043
I made reservations at 4 different restaurants.
I booked a paintball field,

393
00:18:58,102 --> 00:19:02,086
4 leads at the bowling alley and I made
reservations at various gay dance clubs.

394
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:04,680
You get to pick what we'll do,
what we'll talk about,

395
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:07,138
and at the end, Keith will show
up to carry you out the door,

396
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:10,173
reminding the rest of us that
you are the one that's getting married.

397
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:12,241
And what if I don't like the outfit
that some of the girls are wearing?

398
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:14,732
Everyone's been told that
they have to bring a bag of outfits.

399
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:15,937
Is Ronni Ippolito coming?

400
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:19,156
Ronni is waiting at the next corner,
and she has no idea why.

401
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:22,702
If you want, we can pick her up.
If not, we can fly right by.

402
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:25,476
Carla, you're the most
amazing friend ever!

403
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:26,376
Duck!

404
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:33,985
I love you.

405
00:19:34,147 --> 00:19:35,284
I love you, too.

406
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:40,343
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god!

407
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,925
We're getting married! We're getting married!
Elliot's getting married!

408
00:19:45,926 --> 00:19:48,039
<i>I was glad I was late
and that Kim was asleep.</i>

409
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:51,054
<i>It gave me time to think
about what Turk and dr. Cox said</i>

410
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:53,040
<i> about fatherhood changing you.</i>

411
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:56,211
Here's Jack right after
he's feeding some ducks.

412
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:58,594
Izzie driving a tonka truck.

413
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,162
<i>And how Elliot was getting married
and moving on with her life.</i>

414
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:05,849
Did she try to control everything?

415
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:07,307
She wasn't so bad.

416
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:11,257
Other shoulder, Keith!
It's more comfortable.

417
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,287
<i>But mostly I thought
about how much it sucked</i>

418
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:18,339
<i>that my parents were
divorced when I was a kid.</i>

419
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,168
Right here.
I'm just checking.

420
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:23,677
<i>And how much easier life would be for my son</i>

421
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:24,811
<i>if Kim and I were together.</i>

422
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:27,099
Sam just told me he's
very ticklish right here.

423
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,231
Right there?!

424
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,378
<i>It wasn't just about me anymore.</i>

425
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:36,757
<i>I had to give us a shot.</i>

426
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:39,488
Hey.

427
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:41,071
Hey.

428
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:43,464
<i>Even if it was only one in a million.</i>

429
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:56,762
<i>It felt good to be holding
the mother of my child.</i>

430
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,312
This is nice.

431
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:02,197
<i>But given recent events
cuddling was as far as I was gonna go</i>

432
00:21:02,357 --> 00:21:04,134
<i>Kim and I had to get
to know each other again</i>

433
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:08,224
<i>and build trust, and... Oh,
my god, is that side boob?</i>

434
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,339
Whoa, careful with the side boob, big guy.

435
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:11,973
My hormones are going crazy.

436
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:13,708
I might just pounce your skinny ass.

437
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:15,410
Kim, I really don't think we should.

438
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:16,443
I won't.

439
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:19,381
I got a giant boogie in my nose.

440
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:21,137
<i>Look at her saying "I won't"</i>

441
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:23,142
<i>with a giant boogie in her nose.</i>

442
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:24,375
<i>I must have her!</i>

443
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:25,539
You know what? On second thought...

444
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:26,142
Yes?

445
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,863
<i>Still, I wonder what it'll be like</i>

446
00:21:27,864 --> 00:21:29,424
<i>having sex with a pregnant woman.</i>

447
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:32,828
That was so cool... And weird.

448
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:35,252
Yeah, somebody else liked it, too.

449
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:36,974
He's going crazy in there.

450
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:38,634
And now it's disgusting.

451
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:42,168
<i>The next 3 weeks flew by.</i>

452
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,478
<i>We stayed up nights talking.</i>

453
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,222
<i>We got the place ready for a baby.</i>

454
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:54,807
<i>And before you knew it,
we were a couple again.</i>

455
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:55,697
Bye.

456
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:58,198
Bye, Sammy.

457
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:05,428
<i>Now that Elliot's wedding was only
a week away, things were getting tense.</i>

458
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:08,157
I just don't understand why our
families can't sit at the same table.

459
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:11,006
Keith, it's impossible to fit all the
Dudemeister at one table without

460
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:12,556
our wedding looking like Oktoberfest.

461
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:14,540
Plus, when our families met last month,

462
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,643
my mum ended up bonking
your uncle Roland in our basement.

463
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:19,249
Uncle Ronald and aunt Alicia
have been together for 30 years!

464
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,306
Yeah, welcome to my family, Keith.

465
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:21,965
Look...

466
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,315
I know that I'm being a bridezilla,
so to make it up to you,

467
00:22:25,316 --> 00:22:27,025
here's a kiss with extra tongue.

468
00:22:34,805 --> 00:22:36,919
Ok, now go try on that tux
that I picked up for you.

469
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:38,087
Chop, chop!

470
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:39,129
Quick like a bunny!

471
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:41,089
Hey, and you!

472
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:43,191
You are the only one who hasn't
R.S.V.P'ed to my wedding yet.

473
00:22:43,192 --> 00:22:43,794
What the hell?

474
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:45,426
I didn't know I was invited.

475
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,284
But I sent your invitation to...

476
00:22:48,487 --> 00:22:50,206
One North Cemetery Drive.

477
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,645
That's the address
of the Addams family.

478
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,903
- Oh.
- I changed my records to mess with Kelso,

479
00:22:54,904 --> 00:22:56,340
'cause he's always calling me Lurch.

480
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,931
It was either that or 1313 Mockingbird Lane.

481
00:23:00,468 --> 00:23:02,091
The Monsters?
Tv show?

482
00:23:02,496 --> 00:23:02,927
I'm old.

483
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:05,183
So can you make it?

484
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:07,651
Are you crazy? I wouldn't
miss it for the world.

485
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:09,288
Thank you!

486
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:11,456
Not a big hugger,
but...

487
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:12,790
There we go.

488
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:13,514
There it is.

489
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,493
<i>Things weren't
as heartwarming everywhere.</i>

490
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,830
<i>Dr. Cox wasn't exactly super-psyched</i>

491
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,401
<i>about me being his daughter's godfather.</i>

492
00:23:19,402 --> 00:23:21,836
Jordan, here some things I rather see happen

493
00:23:21,837 --> 00:23:24,371
than Dinkus over there becoming the godfather.

494
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:27,382
A nuclear war, a sequel to Hope Floats,

495
00:23:27,432 --> 00:23:29,210
Hugh Jackman winning an oscar...

496
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,719
Yeah, yeah, funny, long list. We get it.

497
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,752
- You need a new thing, big guy.
- Huh.

498
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,452
Sweetie!

499
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:38,416
Why would i get rid of him as godfather

500
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,184
when you keep letting me know
how much it bothers you?

501
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:42,717
It's like he's never met you.

502
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:44,587
- Right?
- And I love Hope Floats.

503
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:47,633
Anyone that's going
to the christening...

504
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,637
Not you.

505
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,965
It's at the hospital chapel.

506
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:56,679
<i>And then Jordan pushed dr. Cox over the edge</i>

507
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,370
<i>by calling their daughter,
little Jennifer Dylan, this.</i>

508
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:01,155
Ok, come on, JD.

509
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:06,312
- Dr. Cox...
- Leave.

510
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:07,577
Yes.

511
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:09,507
That goes for everyone.

512
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:16,524
All living things.

513
00:24:22,332 --> 00:24:24,140
<i>This might not blow over.</i>

514
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,702
Ooh, I gotta hurt someone.

515
00:24:27,971 --> 00:24:30,606
<i>It's amazing
how some couples are so close</i>

516
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:32,591
<i>that they can finish each other sentences.</i>

517
00:24:32,715 --> 00:24:36,028
So there we were,
hottest day of the year,

518
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,344
at the beach, and we're both wearing jeans!

519
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,282
Isn't that crazy?

520
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:43,379
- Guess who we run into...
- Also in jeans.

521
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:45,330
It was dr. J, Kim!

522
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:47,593
And unless you wanna
hear this for the next hour

523
00:24:47,594 --> 00:24:49,524
please change the subject.

524
00:24:49,745 --> 00:24:51,025
Ok, uh...

525
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:53,720
My lease is up on my
apartment in Washington,

526
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,618
my ob said that my mucus plug is holding firm.

527
00:24:57,619 --> 00:24:59,669
And that's, uh, all I've got.

528
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,921
Ugh. Why don't you just
give up that apartment?

529
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:03,138
You said it's so small.

530
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:06,210
Plus, I think it'd be fun if the baby
was around here for a few months.

531
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:08,012
Ok, i'll give it up.

532
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:10,375
Incidentally, that's not the
first time she's said that today,

533
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,671
- if you know what I'm talking about.
- Mm-mmh.

534
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:13,218
I know what you're
talking about.

535
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:14,720
I hit it, and I hit it good.

536
00:25:14,755 --> 00:25:16,089
- Yes, you did.
- Rowdy style.

537
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,092
We have to look out for
that belly, it's dangerous!

538
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:21,564
Listen, I have a video that you might
be a little interested in watching.

539
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,166
- Are you sure?
- Welcome to my world.

540
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:32,807
Babe, I like this tuxedo more than
the one you picked out.

541
00:25:33,436 --> 00:25:35,251
Yeah, it looks really great, Keith.

542
00:25:35,657 --> 00:25:38,998
You know, if you plan on sawing me in half
at the altar and yelling "abracadabra!"

543
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:40,499
But it's comfortable.

544
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,343
You think that I'm gonna be comfortable

545
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:44,953
in my 5 inch heels and my rib-crushing
corset and my nipple tape?

546
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:47,951
There will be no poppers
in my wedding photos, Keith.

547
00:25:48,828 --> 00:25:51,452
Look, you have to remember
this is probably the only time

548
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:53,221
that all of our closest
friends and our family

549
00:25:53,231 --> 00:25:54,955
are going to be all
together in the same room.

550
00:25:55,904 --> 00:25:57,979
So this wedding really isn't about us, ok?

551
00:25:58,565 --> 00:26:00,165
- Ok.
- It's about me!

552
00:26:00,168 --> 00:26:01,566
Now come on, focus!

553
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:03,256
There's no "you"
in "wedding," huh?

554
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:08,523
This is Mr. Cole. He's in a
persistent vegetative state

555
00:26:08,524 --> 00:26:10,637
and was admitted with
community-acquired pneumonia.

556
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:12,767
It's most likely
related to aspiration,

557
00:26:12,768 --> 00:26:14,750
given his prior phrenic nerve paralysis.

558
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,834
His doctor's creepy.

559
00:26:18,835 --> 00:26:20,122
- That's his wife.
- Oh, right, right.

560
00:26:21,473 --> 00:26:23,219
Men, I've gathered the brain trust

561
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,494
because I have been invited
to Blond Doctor's wedding.

562
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:30,074
Now, none of you guys should feel bad
because you weren't invited,

563
00:26:30,075 --> 00:26:31,473
it doesn't mean
she doesn't like you.

564
00:26:31,474 --> 00:26:34,205
It just means that you're not
one of her favorite 385 people.

565
00:26:34,752 --> 00:26:37,241
- I couldn't make it anyway.
- They gotta have a cut off somewhere.

566
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,930
Now, what I need from you is gift ideas.
Impress me.

567
00:26:41,155 --> 00:26:43,765
You could check their registry
and get her some nice linens.

568
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,315
Or I could check the boring
and get her some boring boring.

569
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:48,695
What the hell does that mean?

570
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:52,890
Oh! You know what I got my mom
that she really loved?

571
00:26:53,027 --> 00:26:58,929
That weird birth control thing
that they sew under your arm skin!

572
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:02,046
Ok, highly disturbing, but
you're thinking outside the box.

573
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:03,379
Oh, yeah.

574
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,337
What's goin' on, guys? I didn't get beeped
on my special brain trust pager.

575
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:12,694
This is awkward. Look, uh, Doug, I'm only
comfortable with a 3-man brain trust,

576
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:14,708
and right now, I'm giving
Lloyd here a tryout.

577
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:16,628
I'm gonna have to ask for the pager back.

578
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:19,281
Thanks, kid.

579
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:21,812
You can still come to the picnic.

580
00:27:23,286 --> 00:27:25,453
Here you go, Lloyd. Here's your pager.

581
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:28,582
- Your idea?
- There's this amazing house

582
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:31,550
on my delivery route, with all kinds of
valuable stuff and no alarm.

583
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:34,348
- We could rob it.
- I'm gonna need that back.

584
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,357
Hold onto this for a little while.

585
00:27:38,202 --> 00:27:40,127
So, it turns out my hospital in Tacoma

586
00:27:40,145 --> 00:27:42,756
won't grant me more than
a 6-week leave of absence.

587
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:44,686
Just look for a job here.

588
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:46,542
I'd love to have my kid
in the same city.

589
00:27:46,652 --> 00:27:50,048
Plus, Kelso hates the urologist
he hired to replace you.

590
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:50,915
<i>Are you sure?</i>

591
00:27:51,218 --> 00:27:53,718
Hey, I love being the new urologist here.

592
00:27:53,753 --> 00:27:56,420
But I'm having some trouble with my peers.

593
00:27:56,821 --> 00:27:58,754
Get it? Pee-ers?

594
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:00,703
God, I hate you.

595
00:28:01,456 --> 00:28:02,303
I'm pretty sure.

596
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:04,121
All right, I'll check it out.

597
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:06,855
Rog, rerun.

598
00:28:07,393 --> 00:28:12,076
Ok, Tina, here's what I'm prepared to offer
you to relinquish the post of godfather.

599
00:28:12,654 --> 00:28:13,434
Not interested.

600
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:16,035
Effective immediately I will
stop calling you girl's names.

601
00:28:16,972 --> 00:28:18,372
Interested now?

602
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,840
I'm still here, aren't I?

603
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,578
- Be strong. You can get more.
- Good thinking.

604
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:24,912
What else you got, Per-Per?

605
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:28,049
I'll give you my real pager number.

606
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:29,716
I'll be able to page him 24/7!

607
00:28:29,826 --> 00:28:31,084
- No deal.
- What are you doing?!

608
00:28:32,155 --> 00:28:33,088
Put a cherry on top.

609
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:34,957
One hug.

610
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:36,694
Per week.

611
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,260
- Decade.
- Month.

612
00:28:38,612 --> 00:28:40,753
- Year.
- Done. You're welcome.

613
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:46,067
<i>And then, as I was about
to close the deal of the century...</i>

614
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:47,269
<i>It hit me...</i>

615
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,204
Wait a minute, if I agree to that,
I only get that stuff until you retire.

616
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:53,945
But if I'm godfather,
I'm in your life forever.

617
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:55,984
I'll see you at the christening.

618
00:28:57,581 --> 00:28:59,345
I think this time I'm
actually gonna kill him.

619
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,283
Yep.

620
00:29:02,021 --> 00:29:02,593
It's the one.

621
00:29:04,964 --> 00:29:09,448
Babe, should the valets at our reception
wear green or red vests?

622
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,359
Doesn't matter. Why
didn't you just pick one?

623
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:15,092
Because I want every detail of our wedding
to be exactly the way you want it.

624
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:18,960
I've never loved you more
than I do at this moment.

625
00:29:19,654 --> 00:29:20,809
And I want them to wear green.

626
00:29:20,856 --> 00:29:22,908
- Forest, not lime.
- Got it.

627
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:27,898
How did you get him to be like that?

628
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:31,842
Did you do that thing all guys want us
to do but we swore we'd never do?

629
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,818
I didn't have to.
He just loves me.

630
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:35,385
Why, did you?

631
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:37,924
I'm saving that bullet
for a diamond tennis bracelet.

632
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:44,499
By the way, Frank's breathing was
labored, so i suctioned his airway.

633
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:49,044
Mrs. Cole, I have to say I am blown away
by how you're taking care of your husband.

634
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:50,960
Especially till 2 years.

635
00:29:51,495 --> 00:29:53,758
Isn't it hard to make
yourself do it every day?

636
00:29:54,556 --> 00:29:55,458
No.

637
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:58,776
We were married 19 years before his accident.

638
00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:00,243
You're getting married.

639
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:02,847
You understand that kind of love.

640
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:07,438
Sorry. My husband has a little eye-gunk.

641
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:18,633
Ok, I've got something we can't
give her permanently,

642
00:30:18,894 --> 00:30:22,058
but I can guarantee she'll enjoy it
while she has her hands on it.

643
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:24,839
No! Preemptive strike on the sex joke.

644
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:25,805
Take a time-out.

645
00:30:27,818 --> 00:30:30,613
What about a nice tour
in the wine country?

646
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:32,746
Come on, Doug, now you're just
embarrassing yourself.

647
00:30:33,037 --> 00:30:34,548
I still don't know what I did.

648
00:30:34,577 --> 00:30:37,093
You're old news, bro. Just go.

649
00:30:39,591 --> 00:30:41,458
Ok, maybe I didn't make myself clear.

650
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,893
I don't wanna give Blond Doctor
just a thing, you know?

651
00:30:45,006 --> 00:30:48,295
I wanted her married life to be full of joy.
I want to give her happiness.

652
00:30:48,905 --> 00:30:50,869
Well, that's not really up to us.

653
00:30:52,204 --> 00:30:53,504
It's up to him.

654
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:59,008
We can't control what kind
of husband he'll be.

655
00:30:59,643 --> 00:31:01,076
Lloyd, give me those glasses.

656
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,477
Say that again.
Exactly the same way.

657
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,514
We can't control what kind
of husband he'll be.

658
00:31:10,816 --> 00:31:11,585
Or can we?

659
00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:13,985
Dorian?

660
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:17,654
Tell your baby mama
that she can have her job back.

661
00:31:18,047 --> 00:31:21,690
By the way, I think it's hilarious
that you trust her again.

662
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,388
I know, sir. I got your email.

663
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:29,923
Well, I'm off to my thinking spot to put
the finishing touches on my goddad speech.

664
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:33,698
A word of advice...
Bring your hankies.

665
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:36,671
You can't do this to me.

666
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:39,774
Perry, I... I didn't do this to torture you.

667
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:43,509
I asked Nancy No-chin to be
the godfather because I know

668
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,294
deep down you really care about him.

669
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:49,960
And you know that he would be an
excellent godfather for our little girl.

670
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:51,988
- I'll do anything.
- Here's what I want.

671
00:31:52,098 --> 00:31:54,673
When I buy matching outfits for you
and Jack, you have to wear them.

672
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:57,198
And I get to go on one movieday

673
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:59,462
with that maitre dee at that new
Italian restaurant we go to.

674
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:02,158
And no asking what happened after I go.

675
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:03,707
- Done. May I go now?
- Yeah.

676
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:07,379
<i>Let's see,
what rhymes with baptism?</i>

677
00:32:08,113 --> 00:32:11,364
<i>Faptism, raptism, naptism.</i>

678
00:32:11,693 --> 00:32:13,426
<i>I'm so tired. I could use a naptism.</i>

679
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:16,391
<i>And there is my opening joke.</i>

680
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,709
<i>I should write down "Pause for
laughs", so I don't forget to.</i>

681
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,210
You! You're out as Godfather!

682
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:25,193
How did he find my thinking spot?

683
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:30,130
I can't believe who they picked
to be the new Godfather!

684
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:33,836
Look at him over there,
all smug and cocky!

685
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,784
Doodie!

686
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:38,251
Doodie to you, sir.

687
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:41,559
Is that blood on your scrubs?

688
00:32:41,664 --> 00:32:43,342
Yeah, just got out of surgery!

689
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:46,705
What, you gonna get all up in Jesus's face
because he don't have his shirt on?

690
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,165
Perry? We forgot
to pick out the Godmother.

691
00:32:52,952 --> 00:32:54,688
Who...

692
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,037
wants to be the Godmother?

693
00:32:57,328 --> 00:32:58,688
Put your hand out.

694
00:32:58,794 --> 00:33:00,600
Carla? Do the honors.

695
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:02,368
Yes.

696
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:04,116
- Oh, that's bullsh--
- Ssshhh!

697
00:33:04,714 --> 00:33:06,075
- Rabbi?
- Father.

698
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:07,483
Don't care. Hit it!

699
00:33:07,749 --> 00:33:10,705
Whether we think of baptism,
we think of commitment.

700
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:14,506
For when a couple decide
to bring a child into the world...

701
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:16,353
or share their lives together...

702
00:33:16,584 --> 00:33:19,048
<i>It's amazing how quickly panic can set in.</i>

703
00:33:19,095 --> 00:33:21,757
<i>Like panic over whether or not
you love your fiance enough.</i>

704
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:24,749
I've got some gunk in my eye.
Can you get it out for me?

705
00:33:25,348 --> 00:33:25,615
Uhm...

706
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,226
<i>Or panic over suddenly
finding yourself in too deep.</i>

707
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,844
Look at them!

708
00:33:30,997 --> 00:33:32,616
Mum, Dad and baby!

709
00:33:32,882 --> 00:33:34,477
That's gonna be us.

710
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:47,037
Look, Jen, if you need any legal help
concerning your accident you can talk to Jim.

711
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,911
who's a very successful,
esteemed bulldog of a lawyer.

712
00:33:49,993 --> 00:33:52,912
Or you can talk to Ted, who... well...

713
00:33:53,544 --> 00:33:55,292
My mum calls me thunder.

714
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:58,283
I'll go with the less shiny one.

715
00:33:58,623 --> 00:33:59,702
Tough break, thunder.

716
00:34:00,043 --> 00:34:03,398
You're not my Mum, Jim.
You're not my Mum.

717
00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:09,826
Sorry, Kim, I know I said I'd come straight
home but I got stopped covering a shift.

718
00:34:10,021 --> 00:34:11,699
Well, no problem. I'll wait up for you.

719
00:34:11,828 --> 00:34:14,455
Do you know that half glass of wine
my doctor said I'm allowed every night?

720
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:17,044
I'm gonna hold off until you get here,

721
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:19,426
because it makes me super randy.

722
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:20,865
Can't wait.

723
00:34:20,923 --> 00:34:24,431
<i>I really didn't have to cover that shift,
but I just needed some time alone.</i>

724
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,873
What are you doing here?

725
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:31,708
Hiding from my significant other
due to a massive panic attack

726
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:33,700
over the life-altering commitment
I'm about to make.

727
00:34:34,189 --> 00:34:35,197
You?

728
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:36,241
Same.

729
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,619
I told Keith that I was working
tonight here and he went home.

730
00:34:40,284 --> 00:34:41,364
Good night.

731
00:34:46,514 --> 00:34:48,567
Actually, your night has just begun.

732
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,840
I'm getting married in a week, a week.

733
00:34:51,887 --> 00:34:54,080
I mean, what was I thinking being
engaged for two months?

734
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,332
My Mum was engaged
for three years. She had time...

735
00:34:56,412 --> 00:34:58,864
to soul search, to figure out
if this was right.

736
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:02,055
To sail around the world with
an insatiable Pakistani oil baron.

737
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,388
Why was I in such a hurry?

738
00:35:03,482 --> 00:35:07,095
Oh, wait, I'll answer for you. Because I'm
the biggest idiot in the whole entire world?

739
00:35:07,631 --> 00:35:09,238
Really, Elliot? The biggest?

740
00:35:09,391 --> 00:35:12,300
Because few weeks ago I got back
together with the woman who lied to me,

741
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:14,118
about being pregnant with my child.

742
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:18,434
You should also know that even though I
promised myself that I was gonna take it slow

743
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:20,381
I convinced her to
give up her appartment,

744
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,472
quit her job, move in with me,
and start working here.

745
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,630
Why?

746
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:27,187
I don't know. I'm just realizing
right now that I did all of that.

747
00:35:27,281 --> 00:35:30,331
I just wish there was a test I could take
to tell me if I'm doing the right thing.

748
00:35:30,398 --> 00:35:31,547
I mean, look at Turk and Carla.

749
00:35:31,594 --> 00:35:34,574
They are so meant to be together. You spend
one minute with them and you know that.

750
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,533
They just have this
amazing give and take.

751
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,508
Don't you love this tennis bracelet?

752
00:35:41,092 --> 00:35:42,652
That was awesome!

753
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:47,406
I'm going through the same things you are,
except I'm also having a baby.

754
00:35:47,547 --> 00:35:51,102
So imagine your situation multiplied by...
what's a fair number?

755
00:35:51,172 --> 00:35:52,498
A hundred billion?

756
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:55,794
Why it is so important to you that
your freak-out is better than mine?

757
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,620
I'm a story topper, Elliot,
you know that about me.

758
00:35:58,961 --> 00:36:01,717
When I was a kid I had a friend
like that, he drove me crazy.

759
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:04,650
When I was a kid I also had a friend
like that except he snapped

760
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:07,451
and start playing hide the peanut
butter with my dog whiskers.

761
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,738
You, my friend, have just
been story topped.

762
00:36:09,844 --> 00:36:10,853
I will kill you.

763
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:14,755
How am I supposed to handle
a relationship and a kid at the same time?

764
00:36:15,482 --> 00:36:18,649
I don't know. Dr. Cox and Jordan are totally
dysfunctional but they seem to make it work.

765
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:22,434
Wow! You guys look great!

766
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:25,989
I'm gonna get the photographer.

767
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:29,552
Jordan, I hate this.

768
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:30,639
Why?

769
00:36:30,686 --> 00:36:34,792
I would think an arrogant ass like you
would love having his very own clone.

770
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,741
- Up yours, Bobo.
- Yeah, up yours Bobo.

771
00:36:40,818 --> 00:36:42,566
Outstanding. Come.

772
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,900
Ok, incredibly handsome guy,
you are about to marry Blond doctor.

773
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:53,657
My gift to her is to train you
to be a good husband.

774
00:36:54,152 --> 00:36:55,853
Well,... I think I'm ok.

775
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:58,732
Really? would you know what to do
if she suddenly woke up

776
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:02,492
That's ridiculous.

777
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,573
It's that what you gonna say?

778
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,271
When she looks at you with those
big blue eyes and cries out:

779
00:37:06,377 --> 00:37:09,157
l-m-t-k-p-k-l-t-s

780
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:14,420
Look, if I learned one thing
from my parents is this:

781
00:37:14,473 --> 00:37:19,329
The key to a good marriage is
keeping your emotions bottled up

782
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:22,551
until they finally explode and
you have to lash out physically.

783
00:37:23,055 --> 00:37:26,608
- D'you mean... beat each other up?
- I mean beat yourself up.

784
00:37:27,437 --> 00:37:31,249
My mother once snapped her own index finger
because my father was late for church.

785
00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:33,912
She turned at the car
he threw himself down the stairs.

786
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:36,508
Boys, anything?

787
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:40,731
Whatever you do, don't go bald.

788
00:37:41,106 --> 00:37:42,115
Lloyd, anything?

789
00:37:42,185 --> 00:37:44,789
Yeah, I'm still not sure who Elliot is.

790
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:48,015
Oh, come on! This guy sucks.

791
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:54,696
The thing that freaked me out
was watching this woman

792
00:37:54,743 --> 00:37:56,866
wipe eye gunk off
her brain-dead husband.

793
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,527
I mean, I don't think I can't spend 2 years
wiping eye gunk off Keith's brain dead face.

794
00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:04,505
Elliot, they were married for like
20 years before that guy was on a coma.

795
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:06,886
I'm sure once you and Keith
had that much time together

796
00:38:06,907 --> 00:38:07,858
you'll feel differently.

797
00:38:09,214 --> 00:38:11,619
Still, maybe we are freaking out
about nothing, you know?

798
00:38:12,378 --> 00:38:14,091
Maybe we are with the right people.

799
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,909
Really?

800
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:17,903
I don't know. Last night
Kim and I had a moment

801
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,721
that made me think we are
perfect for each other.

802
00:38:21,235 --> 00:38:25,013
Argh, this salad has beets.
Do you like beets?

803
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:27,422
- I hate beets.
- Me too!

804
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:28,852
We're both
beet-haters.

805
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:31,701
- You know, people is all passionate
about beets. - JD?

806
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:33,750
JD!

807
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:37,624
A mutual hatred of beets is not
enough to base a relationship on.

808
00:38:37,788 --> 00:38:40,662
I know, Elliot but you
interrupted my flash back.

809
00:38:41,015 --> 00:38:45,250
After the beets conversation I confided
in Kim that I was really scared about...

810
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:47,631
being a doctor and being
a dad at the same time

811
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,175
because both of those things require
the throw of all of yourself into them.

812
00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:55,829
And she was amazing, she really...calmed me
down and made me feel good about it.

813
00:38:57,321 --> 00:38:58,102
Oh.

814
00:38:58,411 --> 00:39:00,452
<i>Plus we both really hate beets.</i>

815
00:39:00,745 --> 00:39:02,458
You know, Keith is pretty incredible?

816
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:05,695
I've never felt this love in my entire life.

817
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:08,933
Let's face it.. Keith would
walk through fire for me.

818
00:39:09,316 --> 00:39:12,284
Yeah, I'm not walking through
fire to prove my love to Elliot.

819
00:39:12,636 --> 00:39:14,055
I find that a little suspect.

820
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,867
Still, I suppose we could
switch to some role playing.

821
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:21,528
Here is the scenario. You have
just come home from work late,

822
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:24,889
Blond doctor made you dinner and she's
angry because you didn't call ahead.

823
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:27,298
Plus you've brought along with you, Lance,

824
00:39:27,353 --> 00:39:29,957
your gay ultimate freesbie
buddy, played by Todd.

825
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:34,027
- I should probably take my pants off.
- Wait for your cue.

826
00:39:35,777 --> 00:39:39,367
And Ted, you'll be playing
Blond doctor. Get in the character.

827
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:44,876
Ok, falling in love with you,
long blond hair...

828
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:49,228
talking very fast, talking very fast,
frick, frick... ok, I'm ready.

829
00:39:51,094 --> 00:39:53,416
Good. Ok, ready and...

830
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:54,930
Action!

831
00:39:57,217 --> 00:39:58,812
Todd, did you hear a cue?

832
00:39:58,883 --> 00:40:00,666
- It's just...
- That's it! Look...

833
00:40:01,185 --> 00:40:03,461
The only person I have
to prove my love to is Elliot.

834
00:40:03,543 --> 00:40:06,218
And I plan on doing that
every day for the rest of my life.

835
00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:09,221
I'm done here.

836
00:40:10,194 --> 00:40:13,111
- Shall we go and get him?
- No, haven't you heard what he just said?

837
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:16,623
He's gonna be a great husband and you
know why? Because we got him there.

838
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:18,718
We really got brain trust. Hands in.

839
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:23,043
- Not you Lloyd. You're out.
- I figured.

840
00:40:23,161 --> 00:40:24,639
One, two, three... Braintrust!

841
00:40:28,397 --> 00:40:32,849
Why are you wearing scrubs? I haven't
seen you in those in like two years.

842
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:35,200
I didn't wanna get my
christening dress wrinkly.

843
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:36,614
That was the only thing
I had in my locker.

844
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:39,898
I like you in the scrubs.

845
00:40:41,009 --> 00:40:42,933
It reminds me when we used to date.

846
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,927
It was a disaster!

847
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,707
- All of it?
- No!

848
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:53,944
If anything, maybe we were perfect for
each other. We just had the same fatal flow.

849
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:56,627
You mean that whenever we get
too close to a commitment

850
00:40:56,642 --> 00:40:58,550
we totally freak out and try to escape?

851
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,498
That's what we've been
doing here all night, right?

852
00:41:00,787 --> 00:41:02,910
Besides I've thought about it
and there's no escape in this one.

853
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:05,608
The gifts are all here.
People bought plane tickets.

854
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:08,693
I'm getting married.

855
00:41:09,692 --> 00:41:13,168
- I've reached the point of no return.
- You and me both.

856
00:41:13,575 --> 00:41:18,804
I mean, to get out of this,
I'd have to do something huge.

857
00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:20,761
I'd have to go nuclear.

858
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:32,347
<i>So there we were.</i>

859
00:41:35,303 --> 00:41:36,946
<i>Together...</i>

860
00:41:47,356 --> 00:41:49,128
<i>But not together.</i>

861
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:04,862
<i>And as always...</i>

862
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:08,747
<i>Not knowing what the hell we were doing.</i>

863
00:42:11,293 --> 00:42:12,005
Hey.

864
00:42:13,874 --> 00:42:14,639
Hey.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
