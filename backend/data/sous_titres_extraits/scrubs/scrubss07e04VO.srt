1
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:05,884
I can't believe we're doing this
in a patient's room.

2
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:08,477
It's about to get hotter.

3
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:12,272
Yyyyes!

4
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:15,029
- Turk, you are full of surprises.
- Isn't he though?

5
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:16,673
And what are you doing here?

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,566
- He's here to kill you.
- Kill me?

7
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:21,678
Elliott won't let you get away with it.

8
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:23,023
Sure I will.

9
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:24,809
Turk's letting me raise Izzy.

10
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:27,710
I'll finally have a baby!

11
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,222
And I can spend the rest
of my life with Turk,

12
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:32,317
touring the world's greatest waterparks.

13
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:33,267
Elliott, ready.

14
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:34,905
<i>[KILL CARLA]</i>

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,422
Clear!

16
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:41,032
Noooooooo!!

17
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,182
- That is a weird dream.
- Yeah, I don't even like waterparks.

18
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:51,333
I mean, I did, until someone thought it'd be
funny to get down the slide 2 secs after me.

19
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:53,261
- Dude, the lifeguard told me to go.
- Really?

20
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,394
Did he also tell you to take
your trunks off, Turk?

21
00:00:55,647 --> 00:00:57,952
Because the last thing a guy wants to see
when he's in a splashpool,

22
00:00:57,964 --> 00:01:00,927
is your best friend's junk
headed towards me at 40 mph.

23
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,318
Felt like I got pistol-whipped.

24
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,484
Look, what was weird about this dream,
was that it was in English.

25
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:09,668
I always dream in Spanish!

26
00:01:09,842 --> 00:01:11,956
Baby, dreams have
nothing to do with reality.

27
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,717
Hey, welcome with little Elliott.

28
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:17,183
What? We saw Izzy hates it,
down at daycare.

29
00:01:17,598 --> 00:01:20,073
They doodoo down there?
You wanna tell me...

30
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:23,726
<i>Elliott wasn't the only one trying
to steal babies from the hospital.</i>

31
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:24,285
Hey!

32
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:25,852
Don't steal those babies!

33
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:28,544
Why do you call these babies?

34
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,379
It could be that when I was a kid
I didn't have any toys.

35
00:01:31,823 --> 00:01:32,568
Sure, sure. Yeah.

36
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:36,635
I used to make my own toys. As a matter
of fact, I would take the toilet paper rolls,

37
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:39,092
and draw little faces on 'em,
and... name 'em.

38
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:41,681
I surrounded myself with them
hoping they would protect me.

39
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:44,531
I, uhm, went up to the side of the
road and try to sell'em one time,

40
00:01:44,532 --> 00:01:46,193
make a little money on my own, you know.

41
00:01:46,452 --> 00:01:50,021
But... no one bought any, and when
I came back home Yvonne was gone.

42
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:52,976
You know how you and I don't
talk so much?

43
00:01:53,732 --> 00:01:56,856
If you're wondering whether or not
that makes me happy or sad,

44
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:58,641
it makes me happy.

45
00:01:59,392 --> 00:02:00,641
You love being Angie, don't ya?

46
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:01,933
I do!

47
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:05,117
Oh, missed the spot. Sad for you!

48
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,472
Ah, fresh pill of the day!

49
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:19,314
You just can't seem to get along
with anybody, can't you?

50
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,567
Life is so much easier, if you
just connect with people.

51
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:25,159
Watch and learn.

52
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,648
Colonel Doctor, I'm loving those new frames.

53
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:31,864
Oh, Snoop Dogg attending!
Then my ho's hot....

54
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,886
Oh, hey. What are you doing to
that thing? It's fluffy.  I wanna like...

55
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:38,376
rub my fingers in!
You see?

56
00:02:38,553 --> 00:02:42,042
I connect with them.
Unlike you, I'm a man of the people.

57
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:48,171
Hey, Teddy! Looking bald and sweaty!

58
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:50,410
Putting my smile away.

59
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:52,328
And down with the day.

60
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:55,668
Yeah, that looks like a healthy bone.

61
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:57,682
- Speaking of healthy bones...
- Perry...

62
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:58,710
One sec, ma'am.

63
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:01,669
I've got one in my pants.
He's all yours.

64
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:03,604
We'll go with this later. Thanks.

65
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,666
- What have you been doing all day?
- Right up until this very moment,

66
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,396
I've been successfully avoiding you.

67
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,448
I came to tell you I'm taking the kids
to my mother's for the weekend.

68
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:14,596
And seeing that you're not allowed
to it within 40 feet of our house...

69
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:17,830
- "The restraining order"!
- Chirstmas memories!

70
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:19,666
Anywho, you're staying here.

71
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,421
I'm gonna leave you alone, to celebrate.

72
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,631
People!

73
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:28,867
I expect full partecipation.

74
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:30,809
Woooo!

75
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,385
Woooooooooo!

76
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:36,720
- Oh please!
- Oh come on!

77
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:37,735
Fine.

78
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:39,658
Wooooooooo!

79
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,861
I run down here
so I can do twice.

80
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:02,960
If they do this an all sporting
event, I'm gonna start going.

81
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:04,793
Ehhhhhhhhh!

87
00:04:19,102 --> 00:04:21,062
Check out my little african princess!

88
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,766
Izzieee!

89
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:26,296
Tu sabes que tu eres el amor de mi vida!

90
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:29,184
Baby, when I'm not around, do you
want to speak spanish to Izzie? 'Cause

91
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:30,659
You know I don't understand that.

92
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,529
- Relax Turk, I speak both to her.
- Good.

93
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:37,809
- Mhh. Honey, I gotta go to work.
- Ok, say goodbye to daddy.

94
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:40,453
Now, when he comes back,
the three of us

95
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,214
cenaremos juntos y te daremos
un baneto bien tibio.

96
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:49,270
- before we put you down to bed.
- Forgot my keys!

97
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,805
And then mommy will sing you a lullaby
just like her mommy used to do...

98
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:56,066
cuando yo ero una nina

99
00:04:56,561 --> 00:05:00,458
y gozaremos muchisimo...Te gusta? Oh...

100
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:02,637
Hola, Carla.

101
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,355
As I say Hello, right?

102
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,291
I'll be back.

103
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:12,517
Well, the cars's here, for some reason
it was half an hour early.

104
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:14,232
Nooo, that was me.

105
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:17,536
You know, you're gonna miss me
more than I miss you.

106
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:21,183
Oh please, I don't need those
four pounds of makeup and,

107
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,814
quarter inches of synthetically paralyzed
skin. There is a fight little drunkgirl

108
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:27,705
but I can already hear blubbering
on the phone...

109
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:31,918
Oh... Pe... rry... I... miss...
You... So... Ahhhh!

110
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:36,956
This is you: (whining)
"Oh Jordan, please come home... Please!"

111
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:39,201
- Ahhhh!
- Uhhhh!

112
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:40,673
- Ahhhhh!
- Ahhhh!

113
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:44,111
See? This is why we're a great couple.
Bag!

114
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:48,091
- Bet you call me before I call you,
you pathetic wuss! -You're on!

115
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:52,439
Ah! Alone for the weekend.
Wonder what he's gonna do.

116
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:01,790
- Hi Perry!
- No, no you can't... get out!

117
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,928
- Well, I tought could be fun.
- No.

118
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:06,113
- He said no.
- But you told me...

119
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:07,735
Soon few it'd say yes, I...

120
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:09,320
I did not invite the Todd.

121
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:11,137
Fellas, why you wear
such giant underwear?

122
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:15,050
Sometimes, you just gotta say:
What the fudge.

123
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:17,487
- That's not the line.
- I saw it on a plane.

124
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:21,818
Can I have one of these babies?

125
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,979
- Why do you call'em babies?
- Don't know, always have.

126
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,496
I like you, Shirley.

127
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:32,549
You know something? You look just like a
nurse that used to work here, named Laverne.

128
00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:34,126
- Doesn't she?
- No.

129
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:37,768
Oh yes, she does. I feel like I'm
looking at Laverne again.

130
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:41,868
You just got yourself
a new nickname, Missy.

131
00:06:42,244 --> 00:06:44,188
See you in a bit, Lavern-again.
Lavernagain!

132
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:49,114
Baby, you can't just speak spanish
to my little african princess.

133
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,647
She's not your little african princess. She's

134
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:54,163
our little half african,
half latina princess.

135
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:55,851
Baby, that's a little weirdy.

136
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:59,079
<i>Here we go. Carla and Turk are at it again.</i>

137
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,777
My mother taught me how
important my heritage is

138
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:05,308
I would do the same for Izzie, and
speaking spanish is a huge part of that.

139
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:08,167
<i>Just a matter of time before
they rope me in.<i>

140
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:10,138
Plus, I wanna take to the homeland.

141
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:11,766
<i>Any second now...<i>

142
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:15,064
Baby you're from Chigago.
Just get her a deep-dish pizza.

143
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:17,918
Know what? Why don't you
get me a deep dish pizza?

144
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:20,261
With onions and <i>sausage</i>?

145
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:21,602
<i>Here it comes.<i>

146
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:23,967
Turk, I was referring
to the Dominican Republic,

147
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:27,729
and if you say: isn't that where I bought my
wrinkle-free cheenos, I'm gonna kill you.

148
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:29,539
Where are your ancestors from?

149
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,940
- The motherland?
- You don't even know.

150
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:38,326
<i>And now, a gentle throat clear,
to let them know I'm ready to speak.<i>

151
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:39,873
Ah-Uhm!

152
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,923
JD, drink some water.

153
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:50,994
- Go to hell Bob.
- I didn't even say anything.

154
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:56,535
There nowher else to sit, so you can drop
the scary stare, doesn't work on me anymore.

155
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:00,373
Kickin' me under the table's not
gonna make me leave either.

156
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:02,784
I did it. You talk too much.

157
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:05,871
Say it Bob. Sorry about that
"Go to hell" thing earlier.

158
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:06,606
We're cool.

159
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:10,391
You're just pissy because Jordan
left. I'mean, I'm in the same boat.

160
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:14,957
Ever since I broke up my engagement I
live all alone in a big empty house.

161
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,901
Hell, Bob here is living at the
hospital beacuse Enid kicked him out.

162
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:20,634
Did she just call me
Bob? I would kick her again.

163
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,758
We're like the "Lonely hearts' table".

164
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:27,280
No. No, actually that's
the "Lonely hearts' table".

165
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,758
<i>Who are you?</i>

166
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,237
<i>Who-who! Who-who!</i>

167
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:36,179
Ok! We'll never win the "A Cappella
Pulitzer" performing like that.

168
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:40,219
And if we don't win there's no chance
of us getting laid at the after party.

169
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:44,597
Barbie. P-lease stop
lumping us in together.

170
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:49,688
Tomorrow is my day off and I'm
joyous to have my place all to myself.

171
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:52,045
You see, I'm a lot of things.

172
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:55,994
I'm a scorpio, a registered indipendent,
a foodie, a parrothead, yes I do love

173
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:58,773
that Jimmy Buffer though he's have,
all his will, a leg man...

174
00:08:58,774 --> 00:09:00,688
- A right bastard.
- Thank you, Bob.

175
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:03,448
But I can assure you the
one thing I am not is...

176
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:04,489
Straight?

177
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:08,100
Audience participation is now
over. The one thing I'm not

178
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:10,241
is lonely. Capisc'?

179
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,139
Hey. You should know that new nurse

180
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:16,091
hates the stupid nickname you gave her.

181
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:18,299
"Lavernagain"? No way!

182
00:09:19,673 --> 00:09:20,574
I hate it.

183
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,336
Well, you might hate
it now, Lavernagain,

184
00:09:23,337 --> 00:09:26,405
but once you've heard it a few
times, you're gonna love it.

185
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:28,189
Lavernagain.

186
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:31,471
You're such a man of the people.
D'you even know anybody's real name?

187
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:32,831
Of course I do.

188
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:39,927
- Why the people keep hiding behind you?
- Challenge. What's the real name?

189
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:43,103
Well, she never told me her real name.

190
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:44,776
I like Lavernagain.

191
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,809
And, Snoop I... I'd hoped you'd really

192
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,752
change your name, that's... That's
never again around of that? Okay.

193
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,447
Ah. Colonel I have to pass on you.

194
00:09:56,558 --> 00:10:00,317
<i>Okay. You can get this one. I know it's
just like Beardface but not Beardface.</i>

195
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:02,123
<i>What is it? Oh, right!</i>

196
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:03,129
Beardmouth.

197
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:05,780
<i>It's Beardface', damn it!</i>

198
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:09,325
Man of the people indeed.

199
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:13,665
<i>It's always surprising to learn
how people close to you really feel.</i>

200
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:17,352
How can you know nothing
about your own background?

201
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:20,671
Baby, what do you want me to say?
It just doesn't mean that much to me.

202
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:26,187
<i>Still the only person's feelings you
can truly hope to know are your own.</i>

203
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:30,513
<i>Daddy, mommy says you
once peed in the garden.</i>

204
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:31,349
Guilty!

205
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:33,883
<i>Hey Perry. This isn't "come in to me" coin.</i>

206
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:34,911
It does so?

207
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:37,272
<i>Cause I made your dial and
you and I din't speak.</i>

208
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:41,856
<i>I just want to tell you I've decided
to stay here for the week. Bye!</i>

209
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,358
<i>Of course, sometimes a phone
call changes everything.</i>

210
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:51,090
<i>The obvious way to beat loneliness
is with the company of others.</i>

211
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:54,575
Hey Tedsky! Can I... Can
I maybe help you, here?

212
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:56,077
- Really?
- That's really a lot of files.

213
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:57,675
- Thanks!
- No problemo. Oh.

214
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:01,279
<i>It only gets complicated if you don't
want others to see that you're vulnerable.</i>

215
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:03,917
So, I've heard Jordan's
staying away the whole week down?

216
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:04,909
Uh...

217
00:11:05,202 --> 00:11:08,584
Yeah, we're being texting each other a lot
since we both find out we're nervous pooers.

218
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:11,240
I turned her on to one
soundproofer so talented,

219
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,009
even someone with the ear to your
door, can't hear when you fluffy.

220
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:15,023
Interesting.

221
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:18,280
Tell you what. When she gets back you two
other think about having a crazy off.

222
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,827
I'm gonna text her that you said that.

223
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:27,387
Goodness Gracious Ted, I'm-
I'm sure sorry about that.

224
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:30,396
It's okay, I'm used to it.

225
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:35,112
Say Ted... These... These are all
just blank pieces of white paper?

226
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:37,383
Shhhhh!

227
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:39,714
I need to look busy!

228
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:45,121
Hello, tall, dark and...

229
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:46,414
whatever?

230
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:47,952
- Handsome.
- No

231
00:11:48,468 --> 00:11:52,079
Well done, "Dr. John I think I am a man
of the people but now thanks to the janitor

232
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,945
everyone knows I'm a fraud now
I have egg on my face Dorian".

233
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:56,969
That's your clever new nickname!

234
00:11:57,473 --> 00:11:59,798
<i>Oh my God! You finally have a nickname!</i>

235
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:03,883
I can admit when I'm
wrong, so... Challenge!

236
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:07,638
I will learn everyone in the
hospital's real name, by the end of the day.

237
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,822
You are gonna learn 310 names in one day.

238
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,522
Hey, the night before my anatomy final
I got drunk of peppermint shnapps,

239
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:17,604
'cause Turk told me it was a special
new mouthwash, could swallow.

240
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:22,176
And after I was done crying and dry
heaving and lying in a fetal position,

241
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:26,364
I still managed to memorize
all 216 bones in the human body.

242
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:29,235
There's only 206 bones in the human body.

243
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:31,962
Well, it appears I learned
ten more than I needed to.

244
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:36,471
So, how about a little wager?
If I win, you have to do my job for a day.

245
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:37,850
And if I win?

246
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:39,881
I'll do my job for a day.

247
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:41,234
How's that fair?

248
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:43,064
I'll actually do my job for a day!

249
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:45,581
Ohh! Deal!

250
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,081
D'ya know how?

251
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,929
It's been a while... I can do it.

252
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:55,966
Well... You look like
you could use some help.

253
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,526
I'm ok. Actually,
I'm just looking for Carla.

254
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:02,645
Anyone need any... help?

255
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:05,560
Me! I need help!

256
00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:09,066
You get the hell out of the way.

257
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,438
Hi. Help.

258
00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:18,750
Ok, Dr. John - I think I'm a man of
the people, but now, thanks to the janitor,

259
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:21,819
everybody knows I'm a fraud
and I've egg on my face - Dorian.

260
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:22,829
Very funny.

261
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,185
<i>Perfect. Pretend you hate
that nick name so it'll stick.

262
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:31,424
- Who is this?
- He is a doctor... I think it's Patrick or Paul...

263
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:34,837
It's Gwen. Although she does have
a mean case of men face.

264
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:39,919
Dr Cox, I just wantna throw this out there,
it feels good to be your student again.

265
00:13:40,508 --> 00:13:44,346
Take that back, or I'm going to shelve
everyone of these polaroids down your throat.

266
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:46,334
<i>Back to best friends it is.

267
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,909
You know what you should use?
Mnemonic devices.

268
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:54,782
Associate the person's name with
something about them. I do it all of the time.

269
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:58,352
Like... this guy.
Look... at him.

270
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:01,020
Now, There's no way he's ever
going to make love to a woman,

271
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:05,546
unless that woman is dead.
And "dead" rhymes with "Ted".

272
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,445
Ted.

273
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:09,577
That's how most people remember it.

274
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:14,365
And what were your mnemonic
device for remembering my name?

275
00:14:14,617 --> 00:14:15,632
Do you really wanna know?

276
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:16,918
- Do i?
- No.

277
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:18,864
I knew it.

278
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:21,019
Look at how much
you don't want to be alone.

279
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,165
You're actually open at the guy who
you claim annoys you the most.

280
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:28,272
Elliot it's been 7 years. I think we
all know I don't annoy him.

281
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:32,295
<i>Ok, you're in it, now.
Go for broke.

282
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,403
Heck, I bet that Perry would admit that
I'm not just a collegue, I'm a friend.

283
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:41,068
<i>And arm around him...

284
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:46,619
<i>Oh, my God!
Is this what heaven's like?

285
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,209
Yep. Just... helping out a friend. There is
nothing to do with me being lonely.

286
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:55,005
Hey, wait a second.
Isn't today your day-off?

287
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:02,249
Hey, baby. You know somehing?
You're absolutely right.

288
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,045
I do need to learn more about my
heritee, so I called my mom,

289
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:10,132
and she said somehow, distantly, I'm
releated to the guy who invented peanuts.

290
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:12,082
Turk, that's George Washington Carver.

291
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:15,717
He didn't invent peanuts,
he just thought up uses for them.

292
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:20,201
I'm talking about the little phone packaging
peanuts. How dumb do you think I am?

293
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,356
Baby!

294
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:25,882
You... just don't get what's
really bothering me so...

295
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,979
A couple of days ago you dreamed in english.

296
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:31,451
Three years of marriage and
I'm starting to pay attention.

297
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:35,651
I feel like I'm losing all connections
to who makes me me, you know?

298
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,274
My best friend is a very very
white girl from Connecticut.

299
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:41,966
If who I am keeps slipping away from me,

300
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:44,226
how would I ever be able
to pass it on to Izzie?

301
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:46,683
It's bad enough then when
people look at my doughter,

302
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:49,013
they only see your little african princess.

303
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:51,386
They think she's black,
not half black and half latina.

304
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,326
- That's not true.
- Oh, really? Watch. Sir?

305
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,682
What race would you say this baby is?

306
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:03,545
Oh... Half black, half latina...
most likely dominican origin...

307
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,147
Than again, I am the new hospital geneticist.

308
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:09,445
That's just bad luck, baby.

309
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:11,553
Oh my God.

310
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:12,791
What the hell is wrong with me?

311
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,393
I used to be an Idle.
I didn't need anybody.

312
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:18,469
Now I can't function for a week,
without Jordan and the kids.

313
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,383
Well, luckily, you have a lot of very close
special friends to help you through this.

314
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:25,197
- JD, stop it.
- No, you stop it!

315
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:27,947
I'm sorry you had to see me like that.

316
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:32,075
Mostly, God, I... I feel like
I'm losing track of my identity.

317
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,239
<i>And just like that, a lot of people found
themselves asking the same question:

318
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:38,649
This one's for the ladies.

319
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,460
* Who are you? *

320
00:16:44,284 --> 00:16:45,839
* Who who? Who who? *

321
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,738
* I really wanna know *

322
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:49,258
* Who are you? *

323
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,736
Who am I?

324
00:16:53,056 --> 00:16:54,432
* Who are you?! *

325
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,627
Who am I?

326
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:58,793
* Who... are you... You! *
* Are you... who the fudge are.. *

327
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,097
Who the hell is that?

328
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,827
It's Skip, the gynecologist.
Are you honestly whining

329
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:04,832
because you feel attached
to your wife and kids?

330
00:17:05,311 --> 00:17:06,555
I like the way I was.

331
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:08,172
Uh, you've been a giant jackass

332
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:10,382
that nobody can stand to be
around for more than 20 seconds.

333
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,334
- Yes, I love that guy.
- Me too.

334
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:14,497
Well, guess what... you're still him.

335
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:17,554
Only, now when you go home there's actually
people there that are happy to see you.

336
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:19,537
Probably 'cause they don't know any better.

337
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,661
- That won't end well for you.
- Ok...

338
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,208
Buddy.

339
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:33,743
What is so funny?

340
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:39,774
I just think it's hilarious that you think
you can stop being a proud lat woman.

341
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,675
Baby, all your ringtones are bachata music.

342
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:45,942
You're the only nurse in this hospital
who demands that any doctor

343
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:48,454
who wants a big favor
has to ask you in spanish.

344
00:17:48,455 --> 00:17:50,635
Si, es lo mas mulesto.

345
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:55,958
So we got a daughter, and our life is moving
out to really really fast pace, but baby...

346
00:17:57,189 --> 00:18:00,758
You're always gonna be a latina with
an outside-down exclamation point.

347
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:02,260
You promise?

348
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:08,141
Mas... mas.

349
00:18:08,802 --> 00:18:11,241
Aaand... action.

350
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:13,104
All right.

351
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:15,578
He looks like a serial killer,

352
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:19,508
which is a kind of cereal i'd want
to stay away from, like "All Bran".

353
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:22,386
- Brandon.
- Hmm. Correct.

354
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,570
Ok, Snoop Dogg Attending.

355
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:30,436
I saw him without his pants on, and he has crazy skinny legs, like french fries

356
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:35,194
French fries are sold at McDonald's, whose
founder is Ronald McDonald... Ronald.

357
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:38,066
You saw him without his pant on, Wats?

358
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,646
That's popcorn magnate Orville Reddenbacher.

359
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:42,169
Yes.

360
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,534
<i>We all wanto to be appreciated
for our unique identities.

361
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:48,896
¿Matarme? Elliot no te lo permitira'.

362
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:53,692
Seguro que lo hare. Turk me deja criar a Izzy. Finalmente tendre' un bebe'.

363
00:18:53,848 --> 00:18:55,881
Y puedo passar el resto de mi vida con el Turk,

364
00:18:55,882 --> 00:19:00,078
corriendo todos los melhoras
waterparks del mondo. ¡Liste, Elliot!

365
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:04,220
<i> MATA CARLA

366
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:05,863
¡Despejate!

367
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:08,069
Naaaaaaaaah!

368
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:11,496
Bad dream, baby?

369
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:13,389
No...

370
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:15,643
It was a great dream.

371
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:18,613
What are you listening to?

372
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,641
Some boring medical lecture...
go back to sleep.

373
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:26,413
<i>But bone we decide to change who we
are, for someone we love...

374
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:29,143
<i>Cuando es? - What time is it?

375
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,662
<i>Cuando es...

376
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:33,963
<i>we can surprise even ourselves
with who we've become.

377
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,371
Right, Jordan, you win.

378
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:38,031
I miss you guys.

379
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:40,850
<i>I miss you too, daddy.

380
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:44,930
Jordan, wold you... like
to say the same thing?

381
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:47,715
<i>- I would not.
- She would not.

382
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:50,597
<i>We'll call you tomorrow... will we?

383
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:51,765
<i>- No.
- No.

384
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,179
Colonel Doctor. I call him that

385
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,030
because he looks like a freaky
Kentucky Fried Chicken guy.

386
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:03,421
KFC makes Cole Slaw...

387
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:05,390
Colman Slosky.

388
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,520
Incidentally my favourite name ever.

389
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:10,610
That's correct, but you also lost the bet.

390
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:12,998
- What are you talking about? I won.
- No.

391
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:15,353
Aah.

392
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:19,298
- That's not fair, nobody knows your name.
- Ha ha! You know what that means?

393
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,199
- Aye. You win.
- Yep. And you know what that means?

394
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:30,381
It's like this ammonia is... sipping
into my brain, and making me

395
00:20:30,382 --> 00:20:32,936
violent, and angry, and hateful.

396
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:34,413
Yep. That's how it starts.

397
00:20:34,727 --> 00:20:36,918
- What the hell are you looking at?
- Nice...

398
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:37,798
Good.

399
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:39,480
