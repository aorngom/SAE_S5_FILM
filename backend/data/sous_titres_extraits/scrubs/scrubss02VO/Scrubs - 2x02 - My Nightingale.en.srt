1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,076
There. Just a tiny splinter.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,152
It's funny. I can't stop thinking
about Aesop's Fables.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,755
You know the one where the lion's
always hassling the little mouse?

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,035
Then the mouse
pulls a thorn from his paw?

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,953
Right, and the lion
kills him anyway. Yeah.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,838
- No, he doesn't.
- Trust me.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,469
- Sandy, let's start work.
- Sandy isn't necessarily a girl's name.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,039
- Short for Sandra.
- Clear.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,792
Hello, Perry.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,395
- <i>Oh, God, the ex-wife.</i>
- Jordan. What a coincidence!

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,835
You were in my dream.
I can't say for certain,

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,708
but I was having the flesh torn from
my bones by a cross-eyed water snake.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,916
- You, right?
- Yes. Yeah.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,072
Let's play a game. I'll throw out
an adjective describing

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,197
how one of you is in bed,
and you guess who it is.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,396
Remember, I had no idea
she was your ex.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,311
- OK. Clumsy.
- Don't answer that.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,233
No worries.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,639
Goodbye, Jordan.

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,994
Sandy.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,673
- Good job, DJ.
- You know, it's JD.

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,752
At least I remember the names
of all my sexual partners.

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,833
I'm sure that girl from high school and
your bunkmate from Camp Morning Wood

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,480
are both extremely grateful. Yeah.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,072
Camp Meadow Wood.
I made a lanyard.

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,958
<i>It sounds insensitive,</i>
<i>but hospitals can be boring.</i>

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,396
<i>If a policeman gets into an accident</i>
<i>with a bad guy he's chasing,</i>

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,629
<i>it pumps you up.</i>

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,951
OK, move it along, fellas,
there's nothing to see here.

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,871
I'll be over here.

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,872
Officer Berson,
shortness of breath and chest pain.

32
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,997
Think anyone else gets
this excited over a car accident?

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,193
Maybe Hank.

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,272
<i>We weren't the only ones</i>
<i>psyched to be in the game.</i>

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,999
The doctor is in.

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,992
Bad guy, this is why
you don't run from the police.

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,877
Baby, are you ready to rock?

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,077
Right. Another cocky resident
that wants to start surgery

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,116
before the attending shows up.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,397
I just figured that
if we finished here quick enough,

41
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,278
we might have time
to pull the stick out of your ass.

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,316
What do you say?

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,437
- Perry!
- Beelze-Bob.

44
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,397
- Lackey!
- Hey, Dr Cox.

45
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,278
I'm being honoured tonight
by the board of trustees.

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,920
- They asked me to say a few words.
- Yawn.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,709
Anyway, I'd like you
to be the one who introduces me.

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,828
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,832
- Not interested.
- I didn't ask if you were interested.

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,354
I deeply dislike you.
It keeps me up at night.

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,557
Then use that passion.
Put that rage on the page.

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,950
Here's an idea.
Why not use Big Chief Flop Sweat here?

53
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,953
Ted's not an impressive man.

54
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,429
- Hey, that... He's right.
- You're OK.

55
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,957
You have a slight arrhythmia, so Dr
Dorian and I will monitor you closely.

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,871
But don't worry.
We're on top of it.

57
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,555
<i>There's nothing like that feeling</i>
<i>of taking charge of a situation.</i>

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,835
Mary, Rhoda, chart, please.

59
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,676
What, I stutter? Give me the chart.

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,515
Attagirl. Oh, man.
I don't like his O2 cells.

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,113
Get me a doughnut, will you?

62
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,509
You mean like a...
a blood pressure thingy?

63
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,717
I mean a glazed thingy.
And I like sprinkles on half of it.

64
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,318
If you can't find a half-sprinkle, get
all-sprinkles and pick half of 'em off.

65
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,675
You know, that was kind of demeaning.

66
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,638
You're right. Would you apologise to her
while you get me some coffee?

67
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,191
And be quick or I'll have the manager
send over a different waitress. Go.

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,236
You're done now. Yeah.

69
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,353
<i>The frustrating thing was down in OR,</i>
<i>Turk was probably running the show.</i>

70
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,715
Steady, Dr Turk,
only about two more hours.

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,995
Can you just scratch my nose, please?

72
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,959
No, I can scratch my nose.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,912
Oh, that feels good.

74
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,150
Miss Sullivan, I want to thank you and
the rest of the board for this award.

75
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,834
The fact your first choice
passed away last week,

76
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,876
in no way makes it
any less special.

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,155
Are you sure?
Cos it seems like it does.

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,712
Bob, as far as the intro thing goes,
I've given it a great deal of thought,

79
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,237
but I'm afraid I'm gonna politely have
to tell you to blow it out your ass.

80
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,675
I think we both understand
how this works.

81
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,911
It's like when my dog Baxter
goes winkle on the carpet.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,912
He always heads straight away
from the tool shed,

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,072
but we both know
that's where he's gonna spend the night.

84
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,230
- Charming story.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,279
The fact is I make it a rule
never to get in bed with people

86
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,272
that I have nothing but contempt for.

87
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,393
- That feels good, JD.
- What?

88
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,279
- You'll now pay for that.
- God, I hope so.

89
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,635
We're residents now. We're supposed
to have more responsibility.

90
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,349
I scratched my nose
with Bad Guy's toe.

91
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,750
Accept the fact we're the most
underappreciated people here.

92
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,115
- Bambi, I really feel for you.
- Thank you.

93
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,997
She doesn't.

94
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,310
I spend my time getting orders
barked at me

95
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,075
by people who take credit for my work
and blame me for their mistakes.

96
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,628
And I'm expected
to hold the doctor's hand.

97
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,871
You should try trading places
with me for one day.

98
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,589
It's actually not that bad. And the lace
feels soft against my package.

99
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,039
<i>Nah.</i>

100
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,908
I'm glad we finally
had a chance to talk.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,151
You and me both.
I haven't had anyone to talk to lately.

102
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,073
- Well, OK.
- But, boy, you sure talk fast.

103
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,195
Bye-bye.

104
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,034
Next time we talk,
maybe I could finish a sentence or two.

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,954
You still like her.

106
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,112
Why? Because we had
a conversation in an empty room?

107
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,077
That room's not empty.

108
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,233
Listen, girlfriend, I don't want to hear
your misguided romantic notions.

109
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,710
Cos you see, for me,
sex is a sport, like racquetball.

110
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,995
Play hard for half an hour,
work up a sweat,

111
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,675
- and hope you don't get hit in the eye.
- I know you care about her.

112
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,594
In fact, I bet that after you two
are done playing racquetball or talking

113
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,875
or whatever you crazy kids
are calling it,

114
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,238
you'd like nothing better than to
just lie there and watch her sleep.

115
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,074
It's impossible to actually lie
next to Jordan seeing as she sleeps

116
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,915
hanging upside down from the ceiling
wrapped in a cocoon of her own wings.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,275
That's nice.

118
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,238
I thought about what you said
and you're right, I owe you.

119
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,197
So I got you a date tonight.

120
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,430
- Who?
- Tim.

121
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,314
- I'm not gay.
- What?

122
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,359
Oh, OK, I get it. Neither's Tim.

123
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,871
<i>Unfortunately, I'm on call tonight.</i>

124
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,635
<i>As weird as this place is during</i>
<i>the day, it's even worse at night.</i>

125
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,836
<i>That's when</i>
<i>all the weirdos come out.</i>

126
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,630
<i>Like the ER doctor who likes to work</i>
<i>nights cos he says he's up anyway.</i>

127
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,517
Hey, bro'.

128
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,509
<i>Or the nurse who everyone agrees</i>
<i>is just a little bit off.</i>

129
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,114
<i>Or if there's a full moon...</i>

130
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,193
Hey. This is my band. We all work in
different departments in the hospital.

131
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,918
You told me last time we...

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,319
- <i>Legal</i>
- <i>Accounting</i>

133
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,719
<i>Shipping and receiving</i>

134
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,758
<i>On-site property management,</i>
<i>including pest control</i>

135
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,832
<i>Night-time security,</i>
<i>non-arboreal gardening services</i>

136
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,878
<i>And tenant-related easements and liens</i>

137
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,235
- You got promoted.
- <i>It's about time</i>

138
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,392
<i>He's been busting his hump</i>
<i>around here for six years</i>

139
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,030
Dr Kelso lets us practise
here at night.

140
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,475
Oh, yeah, I remember.
Cartoon theme songs.

141
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,269
No, no, no. That was lame.

142
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,999
We do prime-time now.

143
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,439
What attendings
are stuck here on call tonight?

144
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,353
- Everyone's at that Kelso thing.
- I think Dr Cox is on.

145
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,318
He went home,
but said that Carol could cover for him.

146
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,960
Is Carol the one
with the really firm butt?

147
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,792
Well, I'm Carol, so yes.

148
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,678
It's disturbing how obsessed
you are with your butt.

149
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,672
You're missing the point.
No one is here tonight but us.

150
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,433
- We are running this hospital.
- This is our house.

151
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,398
- We're in charge.
- I love my butt.

152
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,439
<i>It's amazing how, one moment, you</i>
<i>think you know exactly what you want.</i>

153
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,278
Oh, God. Come on.

154
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,396
<i>The next moment</i>
<i>everything changes.</i>

155
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,598
OK, Elliot, the ER doctor
knows there's no attending up here

156
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,276
so instead of treating he's admitting
everyone. You've got 12 so far.

157
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,592
Turk, oncology, cardiology
and paediatrics all need consults.

158
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,195
That phone's for you. It's the clinic.
They know you're on your own

159
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,748
so they're patching
all night-calls through.

160
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,038
And Bambi, room 201 needs an art line,
room 202 needs reintubation,

161
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,190
plus, Carol, you're needed in ICU

162
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,033
to place a femoral swan
under fluro on Mr Freed.

163
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,078
Never actually done
one of these unsupervised before.

164
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,037
You'll be fine.

165
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,034
<i>That's when I realised, tonight we</i>
<i>really were alone. Running the hospital.</i>

166
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,639
<i>Luckily, someone</i>
<i>had the guts to take charge.</i>

167
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,349
You've all been on call before.
So you don't have a safety net.

168
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,512
Most of the time
you don't need one anyway, right?

169
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,718
Fine, I'll tell your patients they're on
their own because you're too scared.

170
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,872
No, Carla, I'm a doctor.
I should tell them.

171
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,589
Come on, peeps,
let's go kick some sick patient ass.

172
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,151
That, my friends,
is one nerdy honky.

173
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,475
That's two.

174
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,718
- My back hurts.
- Oh, yeah?

175
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,677
Well, my front hurts, so touché.

176
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,309
Always a charmer. Hi.

177
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,791
Hi. I'm gonna go and get you
a big ice-cold glass of water.

178
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,598
What do you think of that?

179
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,117
Oh, sweet mother of mercy, Carla,
you were right, you were so right.

180
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,953
- What am I supposed to do now?
- Duck.

181
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,352
Who paged me cos a patient thinks
their tongue is too spongy? Who?

182
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,318
Under no circumstances
tell any of them that I'm here.

183
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,676
Yeah, look. Just go home
and tell Jordan how you feel.

184
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,911
- Tell a woman how I feel?
- Well, I guess you could... Duck.

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,152
This is ridiculous. He admitted him
to cardiology because he has heartburn.

186
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,199
- I hate ER docs.
- You don't understand my relationship.

187
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,679
Duck.

188
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,952
Now that's just not funny.

189
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,518
<i>I don't know why I was scared</i>
<i>of placing a femoral swan.</i>

190
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,275
<i>I guess I couldn't stop wishing</i>
<i>there was someone over my shoulder.</i>

191
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,113
<i>I was even starting to see things.</i>

192
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,556
OK, Mr Freed, I think I can do this.

193
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,756
I'm gonna need a C-arm in here.

194
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,958
- Want me to knock him out?
- What are you doing in here?

195
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,075
Helping you out.

196
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,835
This isn't like being a janitor.
It's not something everybody can do.

197
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,798
Oh, so you can do my stuff,
but I can't do yours?

198
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,233
Yes!

199
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,313
OK, hotshot, what would you use to get
a coffee stain off a tiled floor?

200
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,032
I don't know.
The rough side of a sponge?

201
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,911
Damn it.

202
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,436
Officer Berson's spiralling a bit.

203
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,990
Pulmonary edema seems secondary
to acute mitral regurgitation.

204
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,435
If it is a flail leaflet,
he'll need surgery.

205
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,433
His vitals are so weak, I wouldn't
be confident taking him to the OR.

206
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,318
<i>The classic Catch-22</i>
<i>between medical and surgical.</i>

207
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,591
<i>Somebody needs to be decisive.</i>

208
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,389
- OK, here's the plan. We do nothing.
- Sounds good.

209
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,675
- I'm in.
- That's inspiring.

210
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,911
Meet in a few hours to see
if his vitals have improved.

211
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,871
Yeah, this ends now.

212
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,191
<i>Turk should've known that</i>
<i>the worst mistake a doctor can make</i>

213
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,590
<i>is setting foot in the hospital's</i>
<i>free clinic, at night.</i>

214
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,070
I don't care if you shave down there.
That's not a medical issue.

215
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,469
But it sure is pretty.

216
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,190
Ma'am, you don't have mono.
But you do have halitosis. Mint?

217
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,193
Ma'am, three baby Tylenol is actually
an underdose for a woman your size.

218
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,433
Yes, congratulations,
you are double-jointed.

219
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,238
You can see we don't have any more beds
and we can't handle any more patients.

220
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,630
OK, you talk way too fast.

221
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,713
If you could just keep one person
downstairs, we'd throw a parade for you.

222
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,710
She needs you to give her a break.

223
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,713
Oh, well, tell her
we're really swamped.

224
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,836
- She can understand you.
- Yeah.

225
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,198
Well, then, understand this.
Chill out, bitty.

226
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,268
Didn't you go to get water,
like, an hour ago?

227
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,672
More or less. Jordan, there's something
I really want to say to you.

228
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,036
Say it while I'm drinking water.
Because I'm dying of thirst.

229
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,997
I like you... again.

230
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,679
There. You win. You can do your
victory dance or slaughter a goat,

231
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,990
or whatever it is you do
when you're happy.

232
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,399
You don't like me.

233
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,392
- I watch you sleep.
- That gives me the heebie-jeebies.

234
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,995
I can't stop thinking
about putting up with you.

235
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,198
Look, this is pointless,
angry, shallow sex.

236
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,748
Why would you go and ruin
something like that?

237
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,071
I'm real sorry,
but that's not enough for me anymore.

238
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,871
Sweetie, I have feelings for you too,
but, unlike you, I have some balls,

239
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,349
so you don't hear me
whining about it.

240
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,518
Look, Perry,
I can't let you back into my life,

241
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,876
and watch you personally
and professionally sabotage

242
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,030
every single chance that you get.

243
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,792
It's too hard. I can't do it.

244
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,110
But I have changed. I have.

245
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,320
I see a shrink now. I actually see two,
to tell you the truth.

246
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,030
Good God, what do you want me to do
to prove that I'm not that guy anymore?

247
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,669
There you are.
Had to make me sweat, didn't you?

248
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,751
Good for you, buckaroo.

249
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,037
I took the liberty
of writing out my introduction.

250
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,113
"Bob Kelso is the love of my life."

251
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,270
My wife was going to do it.

252
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,636
She doesn't even seem to be here.

253
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,711
What are you gonna do?

254
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,788
Lovely.

255
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,717
You rang?

256
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,949
Lurch.

257
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,318
My stethoscope is stuck up there
and I need you to get it down for me.

258
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,439
- You put it up there.
- That's really neither here nor there.

259
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,273
- Fine. Right. We're even.
- Oh, thank God.

260
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,557
You could've just asked me
to stop hassling you for a year.

261
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,518
- OK, I want that, then.
- It's too late.

262
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,840
But I use those for listening.

263
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,308
They want you upstairs in room...

264
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,790
...208.

265
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,231
His vitals are the same. There's got
to be one attending in this hospital.

266
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,869
- You guys are unbelievable.
- Thank you, baby.

267
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,837
- Not the good kind.
- I know.

268
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,115
You claim
you want more responsibility,

269
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,590
but you're being outsmarted by a doctor
with scrubs made of hemp.

270
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,275
You're afraid to stand up to a
volunteer who's answering the phones.

271
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,510
And did you ever
place that femoral swan?

272
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,272
It's on my to-do list.

273
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,909
I know you were hoping Officer Berson's
vitals would go up or down

274
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,870
and this decision would be made for you,
but nothing's changed. So it's on you.

275
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,952
<i>We all knew what we had to do.</i>

276
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,190
Surgery.

277
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,838
<i>Sometimes just making</i>
<i>a decision is half the battle.</i>

278
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,350
Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.
We have the Technology.

279
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,635
We can make him better
than he was before.

280
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,109
Better, stronger, faster.

281
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,598
Your shinunununununs could be louder.

282
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,716
You guys were fine.

283
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,719
Good evening, everybody.

284
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,276
Bob Kelso is...

285
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,477
<i>In moments of truth,</i>
<i>we always reveal who we really are.</i>

286
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,389
Bob Kelso is an awful, awful man.

287
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,670
I'm not joking. He's the devil.
What's wrong with you people? This is...

288
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,753
Great stuff, Perry, great stuff.
Is this guy a hoot or what?

289
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,472
- I'll get your ass for this.
- Jordan.

290
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,439
Thank you.

291
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,554
<i>Sometimes</i>
<i>we're our own worst enemy.</i>

292
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,236
<i>And sometimes we rise to the occasion.</i>

293
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,039
Everything went really well.

294
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,709
<i>Even though we know</i>
<i>that tomorrow morning,</i>

295
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,349
<i>the three of us will go back to being</i>
<i>the most unappreciated people</i>

296
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,159
<i>in the whole damn hospital.</i>

297
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,118
What you doing here?
I thought you were off last night.

298
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,397
I switched shifts to help some friends.
Have a good one.

299
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,596
Guys, wait up.

300
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,755
Shut the hell up,
Ted, it's morning.
