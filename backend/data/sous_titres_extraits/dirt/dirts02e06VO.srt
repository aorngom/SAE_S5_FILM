<i>Previously, on</i> Dirt...

2
00:00:02,216 --> 00:00:04,090
Don, your brother's been
in a car accident.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,759
I don't remember any of it.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,218
Jason, you came.

5
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:09,012
Hi, Sharlee.

6
00:00:09,172 --> 00:00:10,906
Don's gonna be
your personal photographer.

7
00:00:11,026 --> 00:00:12,536
I really liked "Love Me Monday".

8
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:13,537
Thank you.

9
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:15,977
Get your ass

10
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:17,354
off that wall!

11
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:20,231
Just promise that you'll tell me
before it gets printed.

12
00:00:20,558 --> 00:00:23,167
Do you think that Roy's gonna
find out about what you're doing?

13
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:25,236
<i>We could've gotten
another million out of her.</i>

14
00:00:25,396 --> 00:00:27,614
His whole marriage
to Sharlee was a complete scam.

15
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:30,867
- It's not good.
- Play with my hair, Don.

16
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:34,592
It's Debbie Ann.
They never really broke up.

17
00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:36,414
They planned it to get your money.

18
00:00:39,303 --> 00:00:41,127
Sharlee, I'm worried about you.

19
00:00:41,454 --> 00:00:43,296
You should be kissing my ass.

20
00:00:43,842 --> 00:00:45,215
Can I start with your lips?

21
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:51,550
And you're here to convince me

22
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,807
to buy your magazine.

23
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:55,475
What's in it for Brent Barrow?

24
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:57,018
May I?

25
00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:01,564
- I'm Lucy.
- Good to put a face to the name.

26
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:05,151
Brent Barrow says the website
can produce more revenue.

27
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:06,986
He wants editorial control.

28
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:10,115
Brent Barrow shouldn't be
in control of the air-conditioning.

29
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:12,628
Do you want to go to
the Hollywood Gold Awards with me?

30
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:13,618
Sure.

31
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:15,120
What is this thing?

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,330
I don't know.
I just want to be with you.

33
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:18,623
Me too.

34
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,459
Lucy Spiller, would you like
to go on a date with me?

35
00:01:22,446 --> 00:01:23,378
Yes, I would.

36
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:25,127
How'bout the...

37
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:28,435
the Hollywood Gold Awards?

38
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:30,333
We can't do that.

39
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,554
Besides, I'm already going
with someone.

40
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:36,716
Reporters have to be inside
before that.

41
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:38,977
Come on, this is Awards Night 101.

42
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:40,857
Thank God.

43
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:43,714
Figure it out,
or you'll be spending the night

44
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:46,025
with a centerpiece
sticking out of your ass.

45
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:47,402
Hi.

46
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:52,182
Where'd you learn
to fold one of these?

47
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:55,898
J., don't touch that.
It's for my pinhole camera thing.

48
00:01:58,357 --> 00:01:59,961
You gonna get out today?

49
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:02,792
- Why? Is there an eclipse or something?
- Come on.

50
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:06,489
Doctor said you gotta get out and about.
You've been on the couch for two weeks.

51
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:09,041
- You gotta do something.
- I am doing something.

52
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:10,883
I'm hanging out
with my big brother.

53
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:14,679
So?

54
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:16,730
- You gonna bang her?
- Who?

55
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,433
Who? Sharlee Cates, man.

56
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:20,682
I told you that's just business.

57
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,439
Dude, you're with her every day.

58
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,994
Don't act like you haven't
thought about it, please.

59
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:26,149
It's my job.

60
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:28,151
- Yeah?
- Don.

61
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:32,134
You're not like the other paps.
You're such a nice guy.

62
00:02:32,254 --> 00:02:33,886
I told you that in confidence.

63
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:35,493
Don, please, can I see it?

64
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,429
Whip it out for me, Don, please?

65
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:38,995
Just a sneaky peeky, huh?

66
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:41,706
Dude, my neck!

67
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:46,250
- J., you okay?
- Kiss me, Donnie!

68
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:48,254
You asshole!

69
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:49,362
Man.

70
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:53,134
Don't wait up.

71
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:58,264
Good afternoon, Brent.

72
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:01,601
Please. You and your friend, join us.

73
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:08,101
Champagne is already poured.

74
00:03:09,437 --> 00:03:10,964
Get in the car.

75
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:18,723
Hi. Welcome.

76
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:30,157
Hi.

77
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:35,437
Look at my little prom king.

78
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:40,174
I love flowers.

79
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,517
They're so corny.

80
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:50,116
Tonight is gonna be
the greatest night of my life,

81
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:52,057
because I am gonna present Mia

82
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:54,195
with her Lifetime Achievement Award.

83
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:58,241
And you know what?

84
00:03:58,401 --> 00:04:01,011
She asked for me.
It was completely her idea.

85
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:04,289
I just... I love her so much.

86
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:18,231
Here.

87
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:19,990
Open your mouth.

88
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,424
- Spearmint.
- THC.

89
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:31,317
No, I'm good.

<i>And The Winner Is...</i>

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,299
Love that.
Holt will be here any minute.

95
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,069
I can give you a little time with him,
but then he has to do E.T.

96
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:02,515
and thePeople photo booth.

97
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,140
Will Jasmine Ford be with him?

98
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,633
Are they officially together?

99
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:07,560
Are you looking
to have a new one chewed?

100
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,843
What? No. Hang on. Sorry, sweetie.

101
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:12,657
Holt and Jasmine are
very excited to be working together.

102
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:15,408
They have the utmost respect
and affection for each other.

103
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,779
That work? There's your quote.

104
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:20,283
Thanks.

105
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:24,452
After the event,
do we just go back to the office?

106
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,159
No. The party's just the beginning.

107
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,814
Final transmissions are at 5:00.

108
00:05:28,934 --> 00:05:31,983
Lucy'll have us up making
copy changes until about 4:59.

109
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:33,277
Danielle said

110
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:36,048
that the close schedule changed,
so all text is locked by 4:00.

111
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:37,340
Basically meaning...

112
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,384
I know what it means.
I've done this before.

113
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:40,657
Holt's here. It's now or never.

114
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:42,923
Now listen, you can ask him
anything you want about the movie.

115
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,555
No questions about Julia Mallory.

116
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:47,642
Gorgeous. Hi.

117
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,997
Willa from <i>DirtNow</i>. Don't say anything
stupid. I'll be right over there.

118
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:53,439
Be charming. Don't worry.

119
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:55,233
- Hi.
- How are you?

120
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:58,361
- Congratulations on your nomination.
- Thank you.

121
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,686
Just glad it only took
ten years' worth of work

122
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:03,185
to get nominated for Best Newcomer.

123
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:04,909
You believe that?

124
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,300
That wasn't believable enough?
Should I try that again?

125
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:11,289
Good luck.
My money would be on you.

126
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,543
Holt will next be seen
starring opposite

127
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:17,171
Jasmine Ford
in the drama <i>Fear Tactic</i>.

128
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:19,436
And here comes a tender moment.

129
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:21,125
Jasmine gives her former husband,

130
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:23,302
baseball star Trey Paulson, a hug.

131
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:26,810
They are truly two of
Hollywood's friendliest exes.

132
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,812
Obviously they're not
screening for steroids.

133
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:30,688
Don't be hating, baby.

134
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,322
I've got nothing but love for you.

135
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:34,063
Besides, do you really
want to call me

136
00:06:34,223 --> 00:06:37,002
on my shit with all
of your indiscretions?

137
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:38,943
I've been sober 13 months.

138
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,498
Seems like just yesterday you
were sober 13 months for the first time.

139
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:43,618
My beauty.

140
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:45,436
Goodbye. Come with me.

141
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:47,365
Everybody needs you down here.

142
00:06:50,446 --> 00:06:51,557
Cute.

143
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:54,878
<i>Now arriving,
America's princess of pop,</i>

144
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,568
<i>Miss Sharlee Cates.</i>

145
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:58,482
Sharlee, over here!

146
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:00,173
Come on, give me a shot,

147
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,300
Jesus Christ, it's Konkey!

148
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,566
Okay. Own it, don't hide,

149
00:07:04,686 --> 00:07:06,502
give it to them
and get it over with.

150
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:08,120
Do you smell cherries?

151
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:09,557
Hey, Sharlee,

152
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:11,936
when'd you start sleeping
with the enemy?

153
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:13,728
Donnie and I are just friends.

154
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:18,082
<i>And here she is,</i>

155
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:21,187
<i>God's gift to pop, and that's
a direct quote from her, folks.</i>

156
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,307
<i>Mia.</i>

157
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:25,714
<i>Mia is receiving the Lifetime
Achievement Award tonight,</i>

158
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:29,509
<i>and it will be given to her
by none other than Sharlee Cates.</i>

159
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:30,912
I love this girl.

160
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:33,063
Isn't she beautiful?

161
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:35,199
Mia, over here!

162
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:36,918
Come on, give me a shot!

163
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:38,553
Oh my Gosh.

164
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:41,696
- Hey.
- Hello, gorgeous.

165
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:43,508
- Hi, Jasmine.
- How are you?

166
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:46,126
Good. Did you get that
plasma screen I sent you?

167
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:48,480
Thank you, Ted,
but it's gonna take more than that

168
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,437
to get me to commit
to your mini-series.

169
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,883
I thought our offer was
quite generous, to say the least.

170
00:07:53,003 --> 00:07:55,760
Bump it up from generous
to obscene and we'll talk.

171
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,273
Besides, I can't take on anything
until I'm done with my boy here.

172
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,491
When do you guys start that project?

173
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,361
We go on location next week.

174
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:05,446
- Lucky you.
- No.

175
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:07,198
We're just good friends.

176
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:10,118
Though I always fall in love
a little bit with my costar.

177
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:13,995
What about you Holt? Do you always fall
just a little bit in love?

178
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:18,209
No. I tend a girl
for the emotionally unavailable types.

179
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:21,546
Now I know the party can start.

180
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,109
- How are you?
- Good.

181
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:25,675
Jasmine. Do you know Claire?

182
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:29,303
Of course.
We worked together years ago.

183
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,187
And this is Lucy Spiller

184
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:32,194
and...

185
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,016
- Tim...
- Ted.

186
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:35,143
Ted Coleman.

187
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,037
Lucy Spiller. I should be mad
at you for all the awful things

188
00:08:38,157 --> 00:08:39,813
you wrote about me this year.

189
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:41,732
Or stop doing awful things.

190
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:45,743
Heard great things
about The Plantation.

191
00:08:45,863 --> 00:08:47,738
Wonderful script.
Can't wait to get started.

192
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:49,115
How'bout a toast?

193
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:50,992
You need a drink.

194
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:57,666
May good fortune reign
over all of our projects.

195
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:01,745
Cheers.

196
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:05,408
Can I get you to raise your arms,
please, sir?

197
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:13,248
Sir, you're gonna
have to leave this here.

198
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:15,095
Nice try, Konkey.

199
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:19,417
Raise your arms, please.

200
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:24,006
Do you want the underwire
from my bra?

201
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:26,068
'Cause you could
probably sell it on eBay

202
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:28,862
and take your girlfriend
to Jamaica for a month.

203
00:09:38,574 --> 00:09:40,333
You certainly know your shit,
Donnie.

204
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,131
All right, I have one request
for those who win tonight.

205
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:51,219
If you haven't been in a synagogue
or a church in the last two years,

206
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:53,804
you can't thank God.

207
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:56,728
Hello.

208
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:01,354
You seem to get along
pretty well with McLaren.

209
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:03,773
Why shouldn't I?

210
00:10:04,326 --> 00:10:06,067
His girlfriend did try to kill you

211
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,867
and then wound up dead herself.

212
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:10,848
I don't know. That'd make
most people feel a little awkward.

213
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,337
Well, luckily, I'm a people person.

214
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:15,111
Yes, you are.

215
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:19,383
<i>... last year's Best Actress winner,
Jasmine Ford,</i>

216
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:23,125
<i>and the star of </i>Native Speaker<i>,
Malachi Brody.</i>

217
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:31,550
A clown, a pianist,
a little league coach.

218
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:32,968
Jasmine.

219
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:37,181
What is she doing?

220
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:40,184
- That's your line.
- It's quite all right.

221
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:43,104
A clown, a pianist,
a little league coach.

222
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,418
Jasmine?

223
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:49,902
Let's see.

224
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,173
These are some of the roles

225
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:55,908
played by the outstanding nominees
for Best Dramatic

226
00:10:56,965 --> 00:10:58,140
Male Actor.

227
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,589
Now, that's awkward.

228
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:15,052
<i>She's been sober for year,
I don't get it.</i>

229
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:17,065
Maybe it's food poisoning.

230
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:19,557
I've had food poisoning,
and I don't remember giggling.

231
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,501
Okay, half the civilized world
has caught this on live TV.

232
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:27,397
The other half will catch it
on YouTube in about two hours.

233
00:11:27,558 --> 00:11:29,858
- What happened?
- Career fallout,

234
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,593
family reactions, rehab plans...

235
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:33,946
What we didn't see,
was she drinking, when?

236
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:36,403
You know, could've been pills.
Vicodin works fast.

237
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:38,409
Even faster if you chase it with Atavan.

238
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:41,161
That's what we bookworms did in college,

239
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:42,607
in lieu of women.

240
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:44,961
All right. What did her rep say?

241
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:47,555
I was covering the smoking area.
I wasn't in the press room.

242
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:49,409
You were in the smoking area

243
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:52,681
because you wanted a smoke.
I was where I was supposed to be.

244
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:55,254
Who said anything about you?
I was covering the smoking area

245
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:57,140
It made Bee sick
and she wanted to switch.

246
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,807
You've either slept together
or you've slept together.

247
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,099
Either way, go do your goddamn jobs. Go.

248
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:05,716
- What's wrong with you?
- How was that accusatory...

249
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:08,054
That's beautiful. That's great.

250
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:11,227
Okay, good. Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

251
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,078
Why are you all smiles?

252
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:20,534
You ever been to Bora Bora?

253
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:24,079
- No, but it's on my list.
- Oh, yeah?

254
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,708
Clear next week.

255
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:35,170
Brent, I need to talk with you.

256
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:37,032
And I with you.

257
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:41,388
Go look at something shiny, will you?

258
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:45,014
Remember the rights
to all theDirtNow brand extensions,

259
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:47,562
books, TV specials, foreign editions?

260
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,107
Of course. Gibson refused
to include them in the sale.

261
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:55,653
What if I were to tell you that Gibson
has agreed to sell these to you

262
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,279
for one dollar?

263
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,746
That got you there, huh?

264
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:03,285
It turns out his lawyers misinterpreted
some clause in the contract.

265
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,181
If he hangs on to these rights, he's on
the hook for millions in tax liability.

266
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:08,916
But you... you,

267
00:13:09,077 --> 00:13:12,912
on the other hand,
have no exposure to worry about.

268
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:15,604
You are a multi-national.

269
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,059
Congratulations.

270
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:21,345
Your holdings just increased
by a hundred million dollars.

271
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:23,037
Wonderful.

272
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:26,802
Now,

273
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:29,687
- may I tell you what I wanted to say?
- Yeah.

274
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,190
Switch women with me.

275
00:13:36,303 --> 00:13:37,528
I want your date.

276
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:41,115
- Wait a minute.
- You can have mine.

277
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,120
- Adam, I can't just trade her off, man.
- Brent.

278
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:49,526
A challenge is a beautiful thing,

279
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:52,126
to lock horns, to bury a shoulder

280
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:54,003
into the heart of an obstacle.

281
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:56,552
Meet this challenge and stand victorious

282
00:13:56,672 --> 00:13:58,966
in a downpour of red roses.

283
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:01,302
Fail, and wilt,

284
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:05,008
diminished in both stature and worth.

285
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:15,998
An artist of extraordinary
vision and creativity,

286
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:19,611
she has had a profound impact not only

287
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:21,810
on the American music industry,

288
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,683
but on the world's pop
cultural scene as well.

289
00:14:24,803 --> 00:14:25,912
Get anything?

290
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:28,078
I got some stuff.

291
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:30,059
Ladies and gentlemen,

292
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:33,625
it gives me great pleasure to present
this Lifetime Achievement Award

293
00:14:33,787 --> 00:14:35,876
to my personal hero, Mia.

294
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:47,169
Hi.

295
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:06,650
It's tired, but the tongues
were a nice twist.

296
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,740
If I know Mia,
she's gonna stonewall the press.

297
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,340
But you have an inside pass,

298
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,832
so I want you to use it, Don.
Don't let me down.

299
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:20,097
Don. Hey.

300
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:22,789
Have you been drinking?

301
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,641
- No.
- Seriously.

302
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:28,253
Allergies.

303
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:31,675
It must be somebody's perfume
or something.

304
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:40,542
She's at St. Margaret's,
she's suffering from exhaustion.

305
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:41,662
That's it.

306
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:45,072
Exhaustion?
Isn't that Hollywood for shit-faced?

307
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:46,362
She was clean.

308
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:49,744
Nothing but Diet Cokes
and bottled water for the past year.

309
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:51,790
You expect me to go back to Lucy

310
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,582
and tell her that Jasmine Ford
blew chunks on national television

311
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:57,084
because she need a nap?

312
00:15:57,349 --> 00:16:00,113
I've lied for my clients before.
That's my job.

313
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:03,339
But I'm telling you, I am not lying.
She was clean.

314
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:06,753
I think somebody slipped something
in her soda.

315
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,411
How's Jasmine?

316
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:18,946
- They took her to the hospital.
- Really?

317
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,455
Was she on something?

318
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:24,078
Is this for the record?

319
00:16:24,346 --> 00:16:26,155
Would it make a difference?

320
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:29,742
Nope. Just like knowing
who I'm talking to, you know?

321
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,452
- You're talking to me.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

322
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:37,733
No, I didn't see her drink anything
that wasn't carbonated all night, so...

323
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:40,419
Did she seem upset about anything?

324
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,173
Well, she ran into her dick
of an ex-husband on the red carpet.

325
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,740
She seemed to get over it, so...

326
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:50,511
Between me and you,
she's got bigger problems.

327
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:53,084
- What?
- They want her off the movie.

328
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:56,817
According to Cheryl, with her history,

329
00:16:56,937 --> 00:16:59,188
the studio didn't want
to bond her to begin with, so...

330
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,788
- Who would replace her?
- I don't know.

331
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:05,236
But if she looks half as good
as you in that dress,

332
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,819
then I will be one happy leading man.

333
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:13,783
You're just saying that because
I'm emotionally unavailable.

334
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:14,750
Maybe.

335
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,282
What?

336
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,101
- Tim? Timmy?
- Ted.

337
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:22,122
- Ted?
- Timmy.

338
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,259
- He's not the right one.
- And you know that how?

339
00:17:29,604 --> 00:17:31,777
I can hear it in your breathing.

340
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,764
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

341
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:37,027
It's all jagged and uneven.

342
00:17:37,428 --> 00:17:39,671
A little like it is now, you know?

343
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,769
You know, her rep said that
she's clean. I think I believe her.

344
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:49,140
Yeah. Unless she's one
of those rare celebrities

345
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,999
- who's into self-destruction.
- OK, there's self-destruction,

346
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:54,576
and then there's dropping
a nuclear warhead on your career.

347
00:17:54,696 --> 00:17:57,217
I'm not buying it. Willa,
your boyfriend the baseball player?

348
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:59,988
Seemed like he might get
a kick out of seeing her crash and burn.

349
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:02,443
- Maybe he doped her.
- Her ex-husband?

350
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:06,097
Isn't that the equivalent of the butler
did it? What's his motive?

351
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:07,974
He's her ex-husband.

352
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,957
Sold, I guess.

353
00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:13,766
You know what?
Pass me those packets of sweetener.

354
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:14,883
What for?

355
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:18,539
Just because I'm not a jock
doesn't mean I don't follow sports.

356
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:20,853
Our man Trey has been known
to howl at the moon.

357
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,462
I can totally see you in music videos.

358
00:18:26,582 --> 00:18:28,945
Oh, yeah. Like Kanye Eastside and stuff.

359
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:32,415
You know, we actually have
a really good relationship with VH1.

360
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:33,568
- Yep.
- Really?

361
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:36,162
- I'm sure they would be interested.
- They'd go crazy, man.

362
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,348
Step on in.

363
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:42,271
Yippee skippee.

364
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:46,335
- Just, uh, do this.
- Did we lock the door?

365
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:48,714
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

366
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:52,334
- Oh, shit.
- Don't worry. I got my own party.

367
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:55,887
- Great. That's great.
- That's great.

368
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:57,890
- I love that stuff.
- Great.

369
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,149
You don't think that what happened
to Trey's ex tonight is gonna hurt him?

370
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:05,361
No, no. I mean, you don't have much
contact with her nowadays, do you?

371
00:19:05,481 --> 00:19:07,528
No, thank you.
I've had my fill of crazy.

372
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,525
Yeah. Man, that was
some insane shit tonight, huh?

373
00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:12,821
Yeah. But you know
who's really getting screwed here?

374
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:14,024
Me. Okay?

375
00:19:14,144 --> 00:19:16,617
My prenup says half of everything
that she makes, I get.

376
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:19,149
No one's gonna hire her now.

377
00:19:19,446 --> 00:19:22,030
I swear that bitch did that
just to spite me.

378
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,581
- Oh, go ahead.
- Hey, party time.

379
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,160
- See, Paulson's too greedy.
- He wants the money.

380
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,760
- Right. And he does not like her.
- Hates her.

381
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,555
- He wouldn't jeopardize...
- the money.

382
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:42,216
- So she's gonna lose the movie.
- The Holt McLaren movie?

383
00:19:42,336 --> 00:19:43,663
Who'd want to see that?

384
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,728
- Dumping her?
- The studio maybe.

385
00:19:46,232 --> 00:19:47,076
Jesus.

386
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:48,856
Shut up.

387
00:19:52,954 --> 00:19:53,752
Mia?

388
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:57,745
Ah, there she is. My heir apparent.

389
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,062
I... I just... I wanted
to thank you so much,

390
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:04,709
because you have been my idol
since I can remember,

391
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:07,161
and now out there, I'm just...

392
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,585
I'm so honored.

393
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:09,753
Thanks.

394
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:11,939
Thanks for stopping by.

395
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,860
Maybe we could
do the press room together

396
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,760
and that way I could be
completely honest

397
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,596
about my reaction
and it would just be about

398
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:21,891
the music and...

399
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,005
Don't take this the wrong way, Sharlee,

400
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,937
but we're... we're done here.

401
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:29,648
Oh. I just thought...

402
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,650
Yeah, well, that's the problem.

403
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,795
I'm sorry, I don't... I'm
I'm not sure I understand.

404
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:40,130
Ah, sure you do. Think about it.

405
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:44,368
Our kiss was no different than
you flashing your getting out of a limo

406
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:46,415
or cutting your hair for the paparazzi.

407
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:50,478
We're in the business
of being provocative

408
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:52,043
That's our job.

409
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:54,409
Staying relevant in a world

410
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,426
with an attention spin of a magpie

411
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,118
The way I look at it,
I just added another 5 minutes

412
00:21:01,238 --> 00:21:03,283
to what little is left of your 15.

413
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,084
Don't get me wrong, Sharlee.

414
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:13,297
I do admire you in your dead animal.

415
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:17,112
We're all creations
to a degree, but you,

416
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:21,064
you've built an empire
on nothing but smoke

417
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:22,910
and nary enough talent

418
00:21:23,538 --> 00:21:25,571
or gray matter to float a spoon.

419
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:31,336
You're welcome.

420
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:36,585
You know, all this bitterness?

421
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:38,508
Makes you look old.

422
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,886
Hey, can I bum a smoke?

423
00:21:47,127 --> 00:21:47,881
Sure.

424
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:50,758
Haven't had a cigarette
in almost three years.

425
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:53,482
Not a day goes by where
I don't think about lighting one up.

426
00:21:55,675 --> 00:21:56,944
Can I get a light?

427
00:22:03,377 --> 00:22:04,675
Gave up gambling,

428
00:22:05,226 --> 00:22:06,533
I gave up smoking.

429
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:09,121
Booze and pussy.

430
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:11,918
That's all I got left.

431
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,310
I'm sure as hell not giving up
either one of those.

432
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:16,554
I hear you.

433
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:20,759
Especially with the piece of ass
I'm banging right now.

434
00:22:21,128 --> 00:22:23,502
I mean, I've had my fair share,
you know?

435
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:25,824
How could you not, living in this town?

436
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:28,725
But I gotta be honest with you, man.

437
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:31,367
Lucy Spiller, she's one horny girl.

438
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:37,186
I know she looks
all hard on the outside,

439
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,321
but I get her bent over my sofa,
I smack her ass a little bit,

440
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:43,331
she starts howling at...

441
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:51,038
How'd that work out for you, Timmy?
Got something else to say, buddy?

442
00:22:58,636 --> 00:23:00,573
What are you thinking?

443
00:23:02,643 --> 00:23:04,193
I'm sorry, all right?

444
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,265
I shouldn't have, but he
had it coming to him.

445
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,340
Because of what? What did he say?

446
00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:11,175
That I was a slut? That I put out?

447
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:13,017
What are you, 16?

448
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,741
What world are you living in?

449
00:23:16,215 --> 00:23:17,365
He played you.

450
00:23:18,055 --> 00:23:19,483
All right. So what? So he played me.

451
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:20,527
Who cares?

452
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:22,403
This is a big mistake.

453
00:23:22,565 --> 00:23:24,280
It's a big mistake,
and you're making it.

454
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:33,322
Your friend Adam is quite a character.

455
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:35,738
Oho. You like him?

456
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:40,482
He's rich, handsome, arrogant.

457
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:43,428
And he looks at me like
I'm covered in Béarnaise sauce.

458
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:44,998
What's not to like?

459
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:46,547
Well,

460
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:48,719
he told me that

461
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,266
he finds you very attractive.

462
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:53,934
Is that my cue to jump up
and down and clap?

463
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:56,645
Oh, what is it with beautiful
women and bile?

464
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,241
What is it about rich
men and entitlement?

465
00:24:00,361 --> 00:24:02,242
I'm just saying...

466
00:24:03,236 --> 00:24:04,653
might be interesting.

467
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,614
So let me get this straight.

468
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:09,034
You're pimping me off to your boss.

469
00:24:09,362 --> 00:24:11,081
Jen, Jen, Jen, Jen, Jen.

470
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,578
I love you like...

471
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:15,930
like an 18-year-old scotch,

472
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,680
but let's not rewrite history here.

473
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,994
Before tonight, I hadn't
seen you in three months.

474
00:24:20,114 --> 00:24:22,311
All right. True. So I see how one could

475
00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:24,993
construe that to mean they
have the right to trade me

476
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:27,594
- like an old baseball card.
- I'm not trading you, sweetheart.

477
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:29,939
I'm not. I'm... I'm...

478
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:32,073
I'm alerting you...

479
00:24:32,992 --> 00:24:34,980
to an opportunity.

480
00:24:41,936 --> 00:24:43,806
One million dollars for one night.

481
00:24:43,926 --> 00:24:45,861
- Oh, God.
- Just like the movie.

482
00:24:46,748 --> 00:24:48,442
Two if his girlfriend sticks around.

483
00:24:48,562 --> 00:24:50,712
The guy can have anybody he wants.

484
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:53,048
He doesn't have to pay for sex.

485
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:55,217
Sweetheart,

486
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:57,373
everybody pays for sex.

487
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:01,750
Speak of the devil.

488
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,029
You have very beautiful toes.

489
00:25:10,413 --> 00:25:11,920
Don't you think I tried the agents?

490
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,515
Nobody is going to say anything
until they cast a replacement.

491
00:25:14,635 --> 00:25:17,307
- Quiet. Sorry, Greg, what was that?
- Don't tell...

492
00:25:17,427 --> 00:25:18,453
Yeah.

493
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,344
Got it.

494
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:21,714
No. Thanks, man.

495
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:23,942
Okay. Um, he heard the execs say

496
00:25:24,266 --> 00:25:26,669
that the whole thing
is a blessing in disguise.

497
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:29,139
Okay? Studio had buyer's remorse
on her deal from the get-go.

498
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:31,262
They even floated the idea to her agents

499
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:33,034
of putting her on a different movie.

500
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:35,209
How fortuitous.

501
00:25:36,094 --> 00:25:38,027
You don't think it was
the studio that doped her

502
00:25:38,147 --> 00:25:39,999
so that they could cancel her contract?

503
00:25:40,421 --> 00:25:42,032
Why not? This is Hollywood.

504
00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:44,588
Do you have those business
affairs sources at the studio?

505
00:25:44,906 --> 00:25:47,356
Who do you think I'm calling, Einstein?

506
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:02,099
Open your mouth.

507
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:04,440
- I talked to Jen.
- Who?

508
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:06,075
- My date.
- Oh.

509
00:26:07,553 --> 00:26:10,306
They usually take 30 minutes to kick in.

510
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:11,476
Special blend.

511
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:15,218
A little E, a little speed,
a little DXM.

512
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:17,684
She wants a million dollars
for the night.

513
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:20,040
Two if Nicolina's on the dance card.

514
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:21,879
Brent, Brent,

515
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:24,099
Brent.

516
00:26:24,219 --> 00:26:26,154
An ambiguously worded clause my lawyers

517
00:26:26,274 --> 00:26:28,159
would have found eventually
is one thing,

518
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:31,092
but this is a real test of your value.

519
00:26:31,795 --> 00:26:34,684
My offer to Jen is my
company, nothing else.

520
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:36,681
Work with that.

521
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,860
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

522
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:53,197
Come on, you're too
smart to play stupid.

523
00:26:53,507 --> 00:26:55,994
Really?
I think I played stupid really well.

524
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:02,169
Do you love him?

525
00:27:05,352 --> 00:27:06,252
I don't know.

526
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,551
What?

527
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:16,345
I thought we weren't gonna play stupid.

528
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,004
Bye.

529
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:32,362
I really love what I do.

530
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,025
I'm ashamed at

531
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:40,119
how much I love what I do, but...

532
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:44,857
if I couldn't do anything in life,

533
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:48,491
the music is...

534
00:27:52,233 --> 00:27:54,183
I think you sing beautifully.

535
00:27:58,655 --> 00:27:59,656
Really?

536
00:28:00,448 --> 00:28:03,498
Tattered? Your third CD?
It's all I listen to now.

537
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:06,565
I'm 41 years old,
and it's all I listen to.

538
00:28:08,296 --> 00:28:09,807
I love the incongruity.

539
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:12,562
What is that?

540
00:28:12,682 --> 00:28:15,370
You know,
the absurdity of something when...

541
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,657
you know, like, when
things don't go together.

542
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,061
Like us?

543
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:24,515
Yeah.

544
00:28:30,678 --> 00:28:32,228
Will you kiss me, Don?

545
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:37,109
Like normal people kiss?

546
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,863
It's an early slide to the events.

547
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:06,733
Art Department's already got them.
They just need your approval.

548
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:16,090
Oh. We thought you could
use that for the Ed. Letter.

549
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,969
Claire Leland's movie, The Plantation.

550
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:23,889
Call your source and see
if they have a start date.

551
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:27,393
I presented your offer.

552
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:28,875
And?

553
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:34,784
I wish they'd let you smoke in here.

554
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,242
What?

555
00:29:39,752 --> 00:29:41,573
- That's it?
- Apparently.

556
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:50,749
You like my Jaguar?

557
00:29:51,986 --> 00:29:53,127
It's all right.

558
00:29:54,477 --> 00:29:56,027
Just had it detailed.

559
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,425
Well, you should get your money back,

560
00:29:58,545 --> 00:30:01,995
'cause you can still smell
the desperation when you get in.

561
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:10,726
What you do tonight

562
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:12,392
to one person

563
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:16,383
I've had to do

564
00:30:16,977 --> 00:30:18,251
countless times

565
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:19,372
over

566
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:21,281
years.

567
00:30:22,848 --> 00:30:25,598
I can't tell if you're
bragging or lamenting.

568
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:33,321
Do me a favor.

569
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:35,928
If the world should go
up in flames tomorrow

570
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:38,098
and it's just you and me left...

571
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:41,864
pretend you didn't see me.

572
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:51,638
[Lucy] Claire.

573
00:30:53,636 --> 00:30:54,938
Congratulations.

574
00:30:55,058 --> 00:30:56,919
- For what?
- Your new job.

575
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,500
You're taking Jasmine
Ford's part in Fear Tactic.

576
00:31:01,023 --> 00:31:02,447
I doubt it. I think I'd have heard.

577
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:05,741
Well, you heard about The Plantation.
I mean, it's shutting down.

578
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:08,559
- I had no idea.
- Really?

579
00:31:09,488 --> 00:31:11,032
What... What was it?

580
00:31:11,654 --> 00:31:14,816
Was it ketamine that you
put in Jasmine's Diet Coke?

581
00:31:15,171 --> 00:31:16,794
Or PCP? Rohypnol?

582
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:20,088
Did you do it by yourself,
or did you get help?

583
00:31:20,294 --> 00:31:22,866
You're starting to sound
like your magazine.

584
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:24,293
Why don't you save it for your memoirs,

585
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:26,104
because you'll never
be allowed to print it.

586
00:31:26,224 --> 00:31:27,596
I'm sure I'll find a way.

587
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,759
Good luck.

588
00:31:48,388 --> 00:31:50,285
I've decided to keep both women.

589
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:54,079
But in exchange, you get

590
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:56,872
the website and the options,

591
00:31:56,992 --> 00:32:00,902
and since you did discover the
properties before my lawyers,

592
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:03,157
let's add a finder's fee, say,

593
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:06,172
two and a half percent
on the hundred mil?

594
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,580
A little something for all your
efforts tonight. One of my assistants

595
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,173
just dropped it off.

596
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:22,176
It's outside.

597
00:32:44,944 --> 00:32:47,598
All right!

598
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:19,716
One! Two! One two three four!

599
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:36,613
What'd you get?

600
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:40,169
Oh, I gotta go home and look...
look at some stuff.

601
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:42,829
All right, Don, stop it.

602
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:45,236
What about the tape recorder?

603
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:47,429
Don, I need this.

604
00:33:48,022 --> 00:33:49,772
I have nothing on Jasmine.

605
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,699
I don't have anything else.
Sharlee and Mia, that is it.

606
00:33:52,902 --> 00:33:55,786
I'm sorry, Lucy. You know,
there's nothing there.

607
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:59,164
Sharlee went and said
hi to Mia, and that was it.

608
00:34:00,098 --> 00:34:01,376
I couldn't get a story.

609
00:34:01,678 --> 00:34:02,838
Okay, which was it?

610
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,004
There was nothing there
or you couldn't get it?

611
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:06,696
Nothing there.

612
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:09,681
Okay. I don't believe you.

613
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:12,508
Give me the recorder.

614
00:34:13,435 --> 00:34:14,815
Don, give it to me.

615
00:34:14,935 --> 00:34:17,196
She is not a person, she is a product.

616
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:20,811
If you can't remember that,
maybe you should take some time off.

617
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:36,875
I should've called.

618
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:40,186
- Forget it.
- No, it's... E-mails are so impersonal.

619
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:42,582
- You know, I just... I just thought...
- I never got an e-mail.

620
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,499
I sent it from my personal account.

621
00:34:46,946 --> 00:34:49,188
I don't open e-mails
from unknown senders.

622
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:50,736
Well, I figured that

623
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,376
after we slept together,
the least I could do

624
00:34:52,496 --> 00:34:54,946
is give you my personal e-mail address.

625
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,391
That is so sweet.

626
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,605
Well, I try.

627
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:11,943
- What did it say?
- What?

628
00:35:12,063 --> 00:35:14,964
- The e-mail. What did it say?
- It said that I think you're actually

629
00:35:15,084 --> 00:35:17,045
- a very good reporter.
- Hmm.

630
00:35:26,432 --> 00:35:28,582
Lucy, Lucy, do you like this one?

631
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:35,039
Okay, all right, I need a minute!

632
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,800
Um, she needs a minute.

633
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:19,846
Oh, Don.

634
00:37:04,162 --> 00:37:05,512
I want to see you.

635
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:13,542
What? You know the drill.

636
00:37:14,038 --> 00:37:15,288
Close the book.

637
00:39:06,323 --> 00:39:10,309
