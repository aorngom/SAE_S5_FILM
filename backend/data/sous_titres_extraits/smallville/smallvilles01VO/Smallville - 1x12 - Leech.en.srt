1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,640
Okay, people, you've got 15 minutes.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,440
Storm's on its way, and I want to be
on the road before it hits.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,920
How many more rocks
do we have to find?

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,440
- Two. Rose quartz and meteor rock.
- All right, let's see who can find it first.

5
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,520
Make that one.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,400
You're a regular rock hound, Clark.

7
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,920
Hey, Clark.

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,920
Hey, Lana.

9
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,320
When is this whole geological
scavenger hunt over?

10
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,280
Not having much luck?

11
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,720
- Someone's ranting more than digging.
- I'm sorry...

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,440
...but I find geology
even more pointless than algebra.

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,920
I could order these rocks online
and have them delivered to my house.

14
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,560
Hey, Holly, do you want
a piece of meteor rock?

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,560
Oh, I've got it checked off already.
Thanks, anyway.

16
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,440
No problem, anytime.

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Hey, loser, stop hitting
on my girlfriend, all right?

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,200
Next time, I knock your rocks
into the next county.

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,880
- Yeah, I'd like to see you try.
- Oh, yeah?

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,000
Lucky your daddy's a teacher.

21
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,320
Eric?

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,120
How many samples have you collected?

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,040
- A couple, my glasses keep fogging up.
- Get with the program, Eric.

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,120
- But, Dad...
- It's Mr. Summers at school.

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,280
You have 10 minutes to complete this
assignment. Better find every rock.

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,560
Glad he's not my dad.

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,080
Has anyone seen Eric?
Apparently he's gotten himself lost.

28
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,520
I'll find him.

29
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,720
Eric! Eric!

30
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,200
Leech

31
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,760
Clark!

32
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,120
I could really use your help.

33
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,640
I loaded all the hay, my...

34
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,840
Hey.

35
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,440
You all right?

36
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,120
Yeah, I'm just a little tired.

37
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,320
The truck's stuck
up to its axle in mud and...

38
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,560
- The cows aren't gonna feed themselves.
- Yeah. Can you give me a hand, please?

39
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,600
- Ready?
- Ready!

40
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,800
Hang on!

41
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,400
Okay!

42
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,280
- Clark, are you pushing?
- Yeah!

43
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,680
Clark...

44
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,520
Come on, son,
we don't have time to...

45
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,440
What happened?

46
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,400
I don't know.

47
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,560
Here's a clean coat, sweetie,
are you feeling better?

48
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,880
I just don't understand what's wrong
with me. And why am I bleeding?

49
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,440
Maybe it's just a part of
your development, like x-ray vision...

50
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,760
...or maybe the lightning had
something to do with it, I don't know.

51
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,640
I am going to be okay, right?

52
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,280
What you ought to do is go to school...

53
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,160
...and if anything else happens
or it gets worse, give us a call.

54
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,560
You know, it's weird. I never
worried about being sick before.

55
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,000
You're not sick, Clark,
you're just not yourself.

56
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,800
Oh, you just missed your bus,
you'd better hurry.

57
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,440
- Something wrong?
- My speed's gone too.

58
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,080
Morning, Mom.

59
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,840
- Morning, Dad.
- You're late, and I can't wait for you.

60
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,640
Just give him five minutes,
what's the hurry?

61
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,440
I have a faculty meeting.

62
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,760
Fine.

63
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,880
I'll take you
when you're ready to go.

64
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,280
Thanks.

65
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,440
- Mr. Summers.
- Don't you take that tone with me.

66
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,960
Your little stunt yesterday
almost cost a fellow student his life.

67
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,520
- I can only apologize so many times.
- It was stupid and selfish.

68
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,120
Why don't you save the speeches
for your classroom?

69
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,800
- How did you do that?
- You're the teacher, figure it out.

70
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,440
Get a ride with your mother.

71
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,160
You feeling okay?

72
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,080
Yeah, why?

73
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,120
Usually you run without sweating.
Today you look like you're about to die.

74
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,840
No, I'm fine.

75
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,640
- What's wrong?
- My leg, it hurts.

76
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,280
It's a cramp, walk it off.

77
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,120
You're falling apart today, Clark.

78
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,520
Eric.

79
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,160
Hey, you got a minute?

80
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,480
Yeah, sure. What's up?

81
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,840
We really didn't get a chance to talk
after what happened yesterday.

82
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,720
Yeah, thanks for grabbing me.
That was a stupid move on my part.

83
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,000
So you feeling all right?

84
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,360
Actually, I feel great.

85
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,560
But there's nothing different about you?

86
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,520
Why, should there be?

87
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,920
No, I'm just glad you're okay.

88
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,040
Clark...

89
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,880
...your nose is bleeding.

90
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,400
- Thanks for the ride.
- You're welcome.

91
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,760
- Wanna come in to say hi to Nell?
- I can't.

92
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,760
I've gotta get over to the store.
Stock day.

93
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,440
See you tonight?

94
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,040
I've gotta run the numbers
over to my dad at the hospital.

95
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,760
- He was supposed to be recovering.
- He is, he's just...

96
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,240
He needs to feel like he's in control.

97
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,280
How are you doing?

98
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,600
Not that great.

99
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,000
Can't get my homework done,
I can't train.

100
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,760
Might as well kiss
my scholarship goodbye.

101
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,320
Come over tonight, I'll help you
with your homework.

102
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,280
Hey, when did Nell
put the shop up for sale?

103
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,040
What?

104
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,640
Why didn't you tell me
you were selling the shop?

105
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,040
I'm sorry, I only made
the decision this morning.

106
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,120
- When were you planning on telling me?
- I don't understand why you're so upset.

107
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,320
I mean, you've never shown
any interest in this store before.

108
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,640
And now I'm supposed to consult you?

109
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,680
- Are you selling the theater as well?
- Yes, Lana, it's part of the building.

110
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,160
You know how much it means to me.

111
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,840
If I'd made business decisions
based on sentiment...

112
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,800
...I would have gone bust
a long time ago.

113
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,640
Besides, the movie theater's
been closed for months now.

114
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,360
I'll sell the building
and relocate to a smaller store.

115
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,680
- There has to be another way.
- Look, I'm just thinking of our future.

116
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,440
Finished with the hay.

117
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,840
How you holding up?

118
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,600
Considering my chores used to take five
minutes and now they take two hours...

119
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,800
...I'm all right.

120
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,360
As long as you don't get any worse,
I guess we can count our blessings.

121
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
I'd better get to that fence
before dinner.

122
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,280
You need your rest.
I'll take care of it in the morning.

123
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,720
- Oh, Dad, I can do it.
- All right, but just remember something.

124
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,080
It took years to get used to your gifts.
You can't expect to adjust in 24 hours.

125
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,280
Get the gate.

126
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,760
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah.

127
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,200
How do you find the strength
to do this every day?

128
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,160
Years of practice.

129
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,040
This is very good work, Roger.

130
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,760
All the physical evidence
points to this explanation.

131
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,720
I'm sure you consulted a rogue's gallery
of qualified professionals.

132
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,560
A journalist never reveals his sources.

133
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,240
You work for the Inquisitor,
not the Planet.

134
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,320
I want to verify these experts myself.
I'll give you 10 grand a name.

135
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,920
Done.

136
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,440
This will make one hell of a story.

137
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,960
Nobody's ever going to know about this.

138
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,400
And if this story is accidentally leaked...

139
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,080
...you and I are going to have
a serious trust issue.

140
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,840
As opposed to the close,
personal relationship we enjoy now.

141
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,800
Lex, what brings you all the way
out here?

142
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,640
I needed to talk.

143
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,920
- You have a minute?
- Lf you wanna help me with this fence.

144
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,160
You can't lift that by yourself?

145
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,520
Look, I've been baling hay for the last
two hours, I can barely lift my arms.

146
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,560
So, what's up?

147
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,280
We're friends, right?

148
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,320
Yeah, last time I checked. Why?

149
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,200
Tell me what really happened
the day my car went off that bridge.

150
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,080
I dove in and I pulled you out.

151
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,640
- And that's it?
- Lex, seriously, what's wrong?

152
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,720
I don't think you're being completely
honest, and I think I know why.

153
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,360
All right, well, then,
you tell me what happened.

154
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,160
I think I hit you at 60 miles an hour...

155
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,160
...then you ripped open my roof,
pulled me out and saved my life.

156
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,480
You're the closest I've had
to a real friend my whole life.

157
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,000
- You don't have to hide anything.
- You think I'm hiding something?

158
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,840
Okay, here.

159
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,640
Take this hammer. Hit me anywhere.

160
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,520
- I'm not going to hit you, Clark.
- Come on!

161
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,880
- Lf I got hit by a car, you can't hurt me.
- I just want the truth.

162
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,080
The truth is, I'm just a guy
who tried to do the right thing!

163
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,360
Isn't that enough?

164
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,560
Apparently, Clark is still doing his chores
and that's why he blew us off.

165
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,320
He's been acting weird lately.

166
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,840
Well, Clark's always acting weird.
Give me a gauge.

167
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He was so tired in math class today,
he face-planted on his desk.

168
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,480
I have two words for him: Power Bar.

169
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,760
Give me my laptop!

170
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,840
- Give it back.
- Get out of my way, kid.

171
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,240
- Did you see that?
- Yeah. Unbelievable.

172
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,400
Thank you. That was amazing.

173
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,480
Any time.

174
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Guess we know what happened
to your powers.

175
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,880
Must have been the lightning strike.

176
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,920
You said that Eric was holding
a meteor rock.

177
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,760
It must have transferred
your powers somehow.

178
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,080
You know, all those years of hiding...

179
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,920
...I wonder if it was worth it.

180
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,440
Everyone's fine with Eric.

181
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,600
Well, that's just for now, Clark.

182
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,400
Well, the question is whether
it's temporary or permanent.

183
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,640
You know what they say: Lightning
never strikes twice in the same place.

184
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,280
Look...

185
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,360
My guess is that your powers
aren't coming back.

186
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,120
Maybe being normal won't be so bad.

187
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,280
- I mean, it works for you and Mom.
- Oh, thanks.

188
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,600
You don't feel any differently
about me now, do you?

189
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,760
Clark...

190
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:23,160
You're our son, whether you can
bench-press the tractor or not.

191
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,040
What do I do now?

192
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,520
Well, life isn't easy for anybody...

193
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,960
...whether you're normal or super,
but you're still Clark Kent.

194
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,960
And you were raised a certain way
and that's never gonna change.

195
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,800
Sure, your abilities were a part of you,
but they didn't define you.

196
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,680
Look on the bright side, Clark.
You don't have to hide anymore.

197
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,640
Try to have some fun.

198
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,720
You're kind of relieved, aren't you?

199
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,000
Well, he always said he wanted
to be normal. Guess he got his wish.

200
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,400
You should have seen it.
Eric threw the guy 30 feet.

201
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,400
And not only did he recover my laptop...

202
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,880
...but I got my first byline
in the Smallville Ledger.

203
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,080
That's great, Chloe.

204
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,080
Come on, Clark, how can
you be so blasé about this?

205
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,240
The guy stopped a purse-snatcher.
It's not that big a deal.

206
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,720
Hey, thanks for getting
that story in the paper.

207
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,960
Thanks for saving my computer,
it's my life.

208
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,160
Okay, how pathetic did that just sound?

209
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,760
- So who came up with "Superboy"?
- I did.

210
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,520
Really?

211
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,560
- I like that.
- Thanks.

212
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,320
- I thought it was kind of lame.
- I don't remember asking you.

213
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,040
Clark's just jealous.

214
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,600
I hope all this attention doesn't
go to his head. He needs to be careful.

215
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,080
You know what?
Start throwing people 30 feet...

216
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,480
...and I'll write nice things
about you too.

217
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,400
"Love from Superboy."

218
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,560
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

219
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,240
Clark, are you okay?

220
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,560
I'm great.

221
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,440
I'm getting a pickup
game together in the gym.

222
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,080
You and Kent versus me and Brent,
what do you say?

223
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,320
- Clark doesn't really play.
- No, I play.

224
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,040
Great. Bring it on.

225
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,800
Since when do you play?

226
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,200
Since now.

227
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,400
First one to 15 wins.

228
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,160
If you're interested, we play
every Tuesday and Thursday.

229
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,760
- Good game.
- Good game, man.

230
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,160
Too bad, Clark.

231
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,880
- Why are you grinning? We lost.
- I know. Pretty cool, huh?

232
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,840
Lex, you remember Dad?

233
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,680
Sir Harry? Victoria,
I've been waiting 45 minutes.

234
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,440
Oh. We were closing a deal.

235
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,000
City of Metropolis giving you
the recycling contract?

236
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,400
Lex.

237
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,000
You seem upset.

238
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,400
If this is the respect you show partners,
I wonder if I made the right decision.

239
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,560
You see, Lex, it doesn't really matter.

240
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,520
The deal is off.

241
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,120
I thought it was your life's ambition
to crush my father.

242
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:22,200
No, that's your life's ambition.
Mine is to take over LuthorCorp.

243
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,760
How do you plan to do that?

244
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,040
You heard of Cadmus Labs?

245
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,240
- I've been researching them for a year.
- Well...

246
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,560
...your research has just paid off.

247
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,560
I bought them. An hour ago.

248
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,480
With the profits you'll reap from their
patents, you'll buy LuthorCorp outright.

249
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,720
Tell your father...

250
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,160
...I said hello. Come on, girl.

251
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,240
Congratulations.

252
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,800
I hope it was worth it.

253
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,880
Tried to score the last box of jujubes
before this place is sold?

254
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,160
Those things could probably survive
a nuclear winter.

255
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,280
You must have a thing about
bad sound and stale popcorn.

256
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,640
My parents met here.

257
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,400
My dad worked the concession stand
during college...

258
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,720
...and my mom came to see
Close Encounters. She got bored.

259
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,200
How do you get bored
watching Close Encounters?

260
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,000
I don't know.
Maybe she had a thing against aliens.

261
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,720
She hung out in the lobby and spent
the entire night talking to my dad.

262
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,480
They'd only been a few years apart
in school but never noticed each other.

263
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,080
That night, they just clicked.

264
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,920
I know it sounds kind of crazy...

265
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,880
...but I feel whatever tangible evidence
I have of my parents' existence...

266
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,560
...is slowly being chipped away.

267
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,160
Sometimes letting go
is the only way to move forward.

268
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,120
I guess you're right.

269
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,400
Besides, there's nothing I can do
to stop it.

270
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,880
How'd you find me anyway?

271
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,320
Nell told me. I was wondering
if I could borrow your English notes.

272
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,600
I kind of dozed off in class.

273
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,560
Sure.

274
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Have you been feeling okay lately?

275
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
Yeah, great, why?

276
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,120
Nothing, you're just less Clark Kent-like.

277
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,720
It's kind of nice.

278
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,280
You're more relaxed, like you haven't got
the weight of the world on your shoulders.

279
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,360
Well, I guess I woke up
and realized my life had changed.

280
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,720
I decided to kick back and accept
the fact I couldn't control everything.

281
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,960
Maybe I should adopt
that philosophy myself.

282
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,720
Mom!

283
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,040
Hey, have you seen the paper?

284
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,200
People have been calling all day.
It's wonderful, dear.

285
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,600
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

286
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,400
- Are you afraid of me?
- Eric.

287
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,640
We're just a little concerned about
this new-found strength you have.

288
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,920
Where'd it come from?

289
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,080
It must have been the lightning.

290
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,760
- I've set an appointment with Dr. Litvak.
- Dad, I'm not sick.

291
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,160
I'm special.

292
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,120
Once you get a clean bill of health,
we'll take you to Metropolis.

293
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,920
Well, what are we gonna do there?

294
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,920
I've got an old colleague who's
a professor at the university.

295
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,760
- He wants to meet you.
- Don't you mean study me?

296
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,120
I'm not one of your damn
science experiments, Dad!

297
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,560
This is about you, Dad,
it's always about you!

298
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,960
Even with this, it's still not enough!

299
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,440
You might be special, but you still live
under my roof and you will do as I say.

300
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,160
I am not a freak
and I am not going anywhere!

301
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,600
Eric, put me down.

302
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,320
What are you gonna do, Dad,
ground me, huh?

303
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,800
I never have to listen to you ever again.

304
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,480
I can do whatever I want
and have whoever I want...

305
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,120
...and no one can stop me.

306
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,480
- Hey. You want to go out sometime?
- What do you think you're doing?

307
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,680
I'm asking Holly out.

308
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,480
Are you suicidal? You're not going out
with my girlfriend, all right?

309
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,720
- Watch me.
- Hey!

310
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,320
You make the cover of the paper with
some stunt, suddenly you're somebody?

311
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,600
- Brent.
- Face it, Summers.

312
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,480
You're still nothing.

313
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,280
All right, man. Don't do it.

314
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,520
What's the problem, Brent?
Why are you hiding from nothing?

315
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,640
Eric, you can't do this!

316
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,240
- Watch me.
- No, I'm serious.

317
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,640
You could kill someone. You don't want
that on your conscience. Calm down.

318
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,760
You're not my father, Clark.
Now shut up and get out of my way!

319
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,640
Get away from us, you freak!

320
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,080
Just a little higher.

321
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,200
How much longer is it gonna hurt?

322
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,880
- You'll be fine in a couple of weeks.
- A couple weeks?

323
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,160
What doesn't kill you,
makes you stronger.

324
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,000
Clark!

325
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,120
- Easy on the ribs, Mom.
- How's he doing, doc?

326
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,920
Well, nothing seems to be broken.
We could get an x-ray just to be safe.

327
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,440
I think we'll just take him on home.

328
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,400
It's your choice, but I wanna
see him back in a week.

329
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,600
Thanks, doc.

330
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,000
You help him get dressed,
and I'll go take care of the paperwork.

331
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,080
What happened?

332
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,040
Eric just flipped out,
it was kind of scary.

333
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,240
- I wish you hadn't gotten in his way.
- I don't know what it is.

334
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,280
Even though Eric has my abilities,
I still think of them as my responsibility.

335
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,720
Clark, I just heard.

336
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,000
Hi, Lex.
I'll go see your dad. See you.

337
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,960
So did you come by to make sure
I was hurt?

338
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,320
I wanted to make sure you were all right.

339
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,520
Yeah, never better.

340
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,440
We can go out in the parking lot.
You can hit me with your car.

341
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,640
Clark.

342
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,360
What I said about you the other day,
I'm sorry.

343
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,080
Nothing appears to be
what it seems lately.

344
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,960
You gonna stop snooping
around my back now?

345
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,000
Listen. I had no right
to question your honesty.

346
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,000
All I can do is plead temporary insanity...

347
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,920
...and hope we can find a way
to put this behind us.

348
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,120
Only temporary?

349
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,440
You need some help?

350
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,840
Yes, thank you.

351
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,240
Eric. Where have you been?

352
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,080
I really messed up.
I need your help.

353
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,040
Your father spoke with Principal Kwan.
We know what happened.

354
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
No, Mom, it was an accident.

355
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,920
- Mom, don't be afraid of me!
- Stay away from her, Eric.

356
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,680
What are you doing, Dad?

357
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,200
I told you that some day, you'd have to
take responsibility for your actions.

358
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,320
Well, that day has come.

359
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,840
- What did you do?
- Eric, you need help.

360
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,960
So you called the police?

361
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,520
You're my dad.
You're supposed to protect me.

362
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,760
I stopped by to see
Eric's parents this morning.

363
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,200
- How are they?
- They're scared, Clark.

364
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,880
Were you ever scared of me?

365
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,320
Well...

366
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,080
...you threw a few temper tantrums
when you were little...

367
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,560
...we had some holes in the walls...

368
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,960
...but, no.

369
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,040
- You were a good kid, Clark.
- I don't think Eric's a bad kid.

370
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,600
Neither do I, he's just a teenager
who's in way over his head, that's all.

371
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,000
You know, when this first happened,
I was kind of freaked out...

372
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,440
...but now I'm kind of enjoying it.

373
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,240
I played basketball for the first time
without worrying if I'd hurt anyone.

374
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,040
I can be around Lana without
her necklace making me feel sick.

375
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,840
Even this is better than being around
the meteor rocks, any day of the week.

376
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,920
Something happened at Eric's house. The
police came but couldn't control him.

377
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,480
- I have to stop him.
- You're hurt, remember?

378
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,920
If you try to face him again,
he could kill you.

379
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,600
He has my strength.
Maybe he has my weakness too.

380
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,880
The meteor rocks?

381
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,520
No one else knows how to stop him.

382
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,320
Mom, this is who I am,
whether I have my powers or not.

383
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,080
Clark, what about a meteor rock?
It's not like we keep them laying around.

384
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,520
I know where to find one.

385
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,360
I got an urgent call
you wanted to see me?

386
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,640
- How'd you do it, Lex?
- Do what?

387
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,040
- Cadmus Labs. It's worthless.
- I know.

388
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,680
You should have done your homework
before acquiring it so recklessly.

389
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,240
Now you've left yourself open
for a hostile takeover.

390
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,960
I read the report!

391
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,720
You mean that piece of fiction
you stole off my computer?

392
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,600
Is this your idea of having it covered?

393
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,720
That's what you get for trusting family.

394
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,920
My father and I will be making an offer
on your company in the morning.

395
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,840
I'll tell him you said hello.

396
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,040
- How could you do this to me, Lex?
- You did it to yourself, Victoria.

397
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,040
You thought you could make bones
with Daddy by taking me down.

398
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,120
- It was just business.
- You call sleeping with me business?

399
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,640
I hate to think what that makes you.

400
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,640
- We could have been great together.
- I plan on being great all by myself.

401
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,960
You'd better check on your dad,
he didn't look well.

402
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,560
I was driving by, I saw the light on.
I figured it was you.

403
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,320
Are you okay?

404
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,480
I called the house earlier,
but your mom said you were asleep.

405
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,840
- I was really scared.
- I'm sorry.

406
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,720
How do you think Eric
got that strong overnight?

407
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,920
I have no idea.

408
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,640
Can you imagine waking up
one morning and having powers?

409
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,880
It's scary.

410
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,520
I guess. I mean, look at Eric,
it hasn't helped him.

411
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,280
That's true.

412
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,240
But I've still always wished I could fly.

413
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,720
Yeah, that'd be something, Lana.

414
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,600
What is it?

415
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,680
It's your necklace.

416
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,080
I never realized
how beautiful it was until now.

417
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,240
This is gonna sound really strange.

418
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,480
Could I borrow it?

419
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,240
Sure.

420
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,880
What do you need it for?

421
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,200
It's complicated.

422
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,800
Whatever happens to me,
I promise you'll get this back.

423
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,240
You're scaring me again.
What is going on?

424
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,760
Goodbye, Lana.

425
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,120
- Clark, what are you doing here?
- I was worried about Eric.

426
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,840
It's a police problem now.
Damn kid's out of control.

427
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,560
Look what he's done to the house.

428
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,960
Do you have any idea where he went?

429
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,320
He talked about getting rid of it.

430
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,240
Said that there was only
one place he could do that...

431
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,800
...whatever that means.

432
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,440
Eric!

433
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,760
Eric!

434
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,200
Eric, don't!

435
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,720
Eric!

436
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,720
You should have let me go
the first time, Clark.

437
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,360
- Would've been better than life like this.
- Eric, why'd you jump off that dam?

438
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,840
I was testing myself to see if I had
any limits. Apparently, I don't.

439
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,960
Look, you can adjust to these abilities.
You've gotta give yourself some time.

440
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,120
How do you know, Clark?

441
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,400
I'm just saying give yourself some time.

442
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,520
Oh, so in time, my parents
won't be scared of me.

443
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,360
The girl of my dreams
won't think I'm a freak.

444
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,240
- The cops won't be after me.
- I can help!

445
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,200
I don't want your help, Clark.

446
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,680
Treat me like a criminal. I'll give
them something to be scared about.

447
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,120
It's not the answer.

448
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,240
Come on, Clark.

449
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,560
If you had this power,
what would you do?

450
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,000
- I'd stop people like you.
- Nothing on this earth can stop me.

451
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,440
You're wrong.

452
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,440
We'll see about that.

453
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,720
Eric.

454
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,040
I'm so cold.

455
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,560
So cold.

456
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,720
What do you think is
gonna happen to them now?

457
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,280
Not sure.

458
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,640
Hey. They had problems
long before he had your abilities.

459
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,400
How are you feeling?

460
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,080
- Normal, for me.
- Clark.

461
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,200
Your gifts are, well, they're a part
of you, but they don't define you.

462
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,520
I know.

463
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,160
But they complicate all of our lives.

464
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,320
Seeing how destructive Eric got...

465
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,920
That just reminds me
of how special you really are.

466
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,560
That's because Eric didn't get
my two strongest gifts.

467
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,920
You and Mom.

468
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,520
Let's go home.

469
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,720
Hello, Dad, how's business?

470
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,040
Tomorrow's Planet is announcing
our takeover of Sir Harry's company.

471
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,880
- Did I merit a mention?
- Third paragraph.

472
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,560
That's what happens
when you trust your family, Lex.

473
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,400
I'm proud of you.

474
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,800
Thanks, Dad. That means
a lot coming from you.

475
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,880
Your so-called experts
were wrong about Clark Kent.

476
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,920
I saw it with my own eyes.
He's just a regular kid.

477
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,200
That's not possible.

478
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,360
- So how do you explain the accident?
- I can't...

479
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,920
...but I'm closing the book
and putting it behind me.

480
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,240
- There's something there, Lex.
- I don't care.

481
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,680
The Kents are off-limits, understand?

482
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,880
You have something for me?

483
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,960
Nice picture quality.

484
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,880
- Who initiated this little encounter?
- Who do you think?

485
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,760
- Victoria?
- Your father.

486
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,720
Hey. I was just locking up.

487
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,400
I brought your necklace back.

488
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,640
This is beautiful. Where'd you get it?

489
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,200
A friend.

490
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,800
It's made of lead armor.

491
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,560
I want you to have it.

492
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,400
I figure, that way
it can protect your memories.

493
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,000
Is this your way of telling me
I shouldn't wear my necklace?

494
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,280
I don't want it to hold you back.

495
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,960
Sometimes letting go
is the only way to move forward.

496
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,520
Are you okay?

497
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,520
You look like you've got the weight
of the world on your shoulders again.

498
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,360
Yeah, I guess I do.

499
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,240
Can I walk you home?

500
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,080
Actually, I'm meeting Whitney
at the store.

501
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,720
Rain check?

502
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,400
Rain check.

503
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,280
Good night, Lana.

504
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,600
Good night.

505
