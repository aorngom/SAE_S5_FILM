1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,560
Hold nothing back!
Leave it all on the floor!

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,680
- How much time we got?
- We've got fifteen minutes tops!

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,680
Just enough time to get in and out!

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,680
All right, let's do this thing!

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,080
Are you ready now, Clark?

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,880
Yeah. I forgot to press
the record button. Sorry.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,600
So, Mr. Luthor...

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,080
...any more secret construction
projects at LuthorCorp like Level 3?

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,920
Please, call me Lex.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,920
- Lex, are you gonna answer my question?
- Chloe.

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,840
- What?
- It's okay, Clark.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,600
"Our critics are our friends.
They show us our faults."

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,600
Benjamin Franklin.

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,760
Excuse me, Mr. Luthor...

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,920
...your father's on the phone.
- I need to get this.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,360
I'll take it in the conservatory.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,560
I look forward to resuming
our verbal judo.

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,040
- All right, boys, this is the big one!
- Yeah! Let's do it!

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
Let's go!

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,160
I wonder if he's really taking a call
or if he's just trying to avoid me?

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,640
Wow, that's really cool.

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,120
Do you think it's real?

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,320
Chloe?

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,080
Chloe.

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,920
Okay. The vault's in the wall
behind the bookcase.

26
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,800
- How do you know?
- I've got my sources.

27
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,800
- He was doing one of the housekeepers.
- Oh, yeah.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,680
- We got five minutes, let's move it!
- Let's do it!

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,400
That's it, boys, come on. It's payday!

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,280
One minute!

31
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,360
- Come on, let's go!
- I only got one arm.

32
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,360
Yeah!

33
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Time's up! Let's move it! Let's go!

34
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,800
You can't just go snooping
around someone's house.

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,120
Clark, it's a mansion.
It's designed for snooping.

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,960
Okay, fine.
We'll go and wait in the library...

37
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,600
...for Lex to officially blow us off.

38
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,760
- I'll put the camera away.
- Okay, I'm gonna go get my bag.

39
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,000
Hey, what's going on?

40
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,240
Chloe, run!

41
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,400
Move it! Let's move it!

42
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,240
Clark!

43
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,600
Chloe.

44
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,720
Clark!

45
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,640
Chloe!

46
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,440
Kenetic

47
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,840
Clark.

48
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,320
Don't worry, I brought in
the best doctors from Metropolis.

49
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,120
- Is she gonna be all right?
- Doctors aren't sure.

50
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,360
The fall was pretty bad. She broke
her left arm and has a concussion.

51
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,280
They wanna make sure
there's no brain swelling.

52
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,080
I should've gotten to her.

53
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,040
I don't mean to belabour the obvious,
Clark, but this isn't your fault.

54
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,920
I just don't know what happened.
One minute, the room is empty...

55
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,360
...and then they appear out of thin air.

56
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,120
I mean, do the police have any leads?

57
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,720
They don't think I'm the first one
that's been hit.

58
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,800
There have been over a dozen
robberies all over the county.

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,360
This gang somehow gets in and out
without busting a single lock.

60
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,760
They tried to hit the
Smallville Savings & Loan.

61
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,560
I didn't hear about that.

62
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,080
Banks don't publicize attempted robberies,
it's bad for their image.

63
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,360
If nothing was taken,
how do they know they were robbed?

64
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,920
Apparently they tripped an alarm
inside the vault.

65
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,800
Although, no one knows
how they got in there.

66
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,200
And the stuff they stole from you.
Can the police trace it?

67
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,400
I didn't report anything stolen, Clark.

68
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,920
- Why not? I saw them walk out with bags.
- I don't care about that.

69
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,280
I just want to find the people
who did this to Chloe. When I do...

70
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,480
...I promise you,
they will be dealt with accordingly.

71
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,440
- What does that mean?
- You should let me worry about it.

72
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,080
Now, why don't you go home
and get some rest?

73
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,960
Whitney.

74
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,480
Hey, Whitney, wait up.

75
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,680
Thought you're meeting me
at the hospital.

76
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,080
I'm sorry, I forgot. How's Chloe?

77
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,200
Better, but not out of the woods yet.

78
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,000
That's the thing with this town.
It'll always find a way to keep you down.

79
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,960
Whitney, what's wrong? Is it your dad?

80
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,520
No, it's nothing.
I've just got to go do inventory.

81
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,840
See you.

82
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,880
Hi, Clark. What are you doing?

83
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,200
- Trying to make myself useful.
- Hey, son...

84
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520
...we need firewood, not toothpicks.

85
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,520
I know what you guys are gonna say:
It's not my fault.

86
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,040
- Lex already told me, so did Chloe's dad.
- They're right, Clark. You did your best.

87
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,320
- Chloe could've died.
- Son...

88
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,920
...becoming an adult means
learning difficult lessons...

89
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,160
...one of which is you can't save
everybody, no matter who you are.

90
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,560
You said you felt the effects
of the meteor rocks.

91
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, I just don't know
where it was coming from.

92
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,560
Sometimes I just wish I could leave this
town and get away from the meteor rocks.

93
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm sure that you will.
You'll get that chance.

94
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,680
But running away won't solve anything.

95
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,680
Don't hang around here
feeling sorry for yourself.

96
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,040
Go. See what you can find out.

97
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,240
I had no idea I stored
so much stuff in here.

98
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,040
- Will you hand me the tape, please?
- Yeah.

99
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,720
I still can't believe
you're selling this place, Nell.

100
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,920
I can't believe your sudden interest
in the place.

101
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,080
My parents met here.
This place means a lot to me.

102
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,040
I know, Lana...

103
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,280
...but one screen can't compete
with a multiplex. And the fact is...

104
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,240
...I wanna be able
to send you to any college you want.

105
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,040
Could you tell me who the buyer is?

106
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,880
Maybe I could talk to them.
See if they'd be willing to renovate.

107
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,560
It's Lex Luthor.

108
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,960
Lex said the people who hit the
mansion tried to rob this bank.

109
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,000
I've got three words for you:
Official police investigation.

110
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,240
The police haven't done a thing.

111
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,160
There have been 12 robberies in the past
six months with the same freaky m.o.

112
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,120
No sign of entry, the jewels
and the cash just vanished.

113
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,200
Except for this place. Lex says that
they triggered an alarm inside the vault.

114
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,160
- The question is, how'd they get inside?
- I don't know.

115
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,480
Now, stop channelling Chloe and come on.

116
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,400
Oh, no, not the Kent thousand-yard stare.

117
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,680
Clark! Come on, man.

118
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,360
I know you feel bad. I do too.

119
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,040
But we're not cops.

120
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,800
Nothing. Nada.

121
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,240
Not a single sidebar. A guy has got to
miss a hundred grand in cash and jewels.

122
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,600
Not Luthor, bro.

123
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,880
There is no telling how much
jack he's got stashed in that castle.

124
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,720
Cash, jewels, art, cars, you name it!

125
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,680
If we went downstairs, we would've
found the money pit where he swims in...

126
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,720
...like that duck with the Irish accent.
- Uncle Scrooge.

127
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,720
- Yeah, yeah.
- He was Scottish, not Irish.

128
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,200
We don't have enough time. This stuff
doesn't last as long as it used to.

129
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,200
I know, I know.

130
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,560
I'm telling you, we need fresh blood.

131
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,240
- Yeah, but who can we trust?
- I don't know.

132
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,200
I think I know why Luthor
didn't file that robbery report.

133
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,320
Check this out.

134
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,440
The poster boy for Rogaine doesn't want
anyone to know he's tapped into...

135
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,120
...his daddy's computer system.

136
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,080
Maybe then we pay Luthor Junior
another visit, huh?

137
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,920
I think so.

138
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,560
I don't care.

139
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,440
If I wanted excuses, I'd call the police.

140
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,200
Yeah? Well, you're supposed to be the
best private security firm in Metropolis.

141
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,960
How'd you get in here?

142
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,440
The same way we did last time, bro.

143
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,160
- I'm calling the police.
- You didn't last time, and we know why.

144
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,800
We read the disk, Lex.

145
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
- What are you talking about?
- You're skimming money from your dad...

146
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,600
...to fund a project in Smallville.

147
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,600
That concerns a methane treatment plant.
It'll put our competitors out of business.

148
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Methane plants don't need
particle accelerators.

149
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,960
- What do you want?
- A million, cash.

150
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,160
If you try anything stupid,
even if you think a stupid thought...

151
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,680
...your disk is going to be uploaded
to the Internet...

152
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,360
...for all the world
and Big Daddy Lionel to see.

153
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,000
How do I reach you?

154
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,840
You don't. We reach you.

155
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,720
Now, turn around.

156
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,680
Wait there.

157
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,400
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

158
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,560
Hey, Whitney.

159
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,720
Whitney?

160
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,440
- Hey.
- I'm picking up a microwave for my mom.

161
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,160
You can pick it up at the back counter.

162
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,840
Is everything okay?

163
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,720
I bet you think it's just great
to live in Smallville your whole life.

164
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,240
- Take over the farm from dad.
- I'm not sure that's the life for me.

165
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,560
- Sometimes you don't have a choice.
- Whitney, you'll get out of here.

166
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,560
- You'll go further than anyone in town.
- I lost my scholarship, Kent.

167
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,760
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,800
Have you told Lana yet?

169
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,240
I am going to spend the rest of my life
in this store...

170
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,600
...develop a bad heart at fifty like my dad,
and become just another "remember him?"

171
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,480
I'm never getting out of Smallville.

172
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,880
Hey, man,
you got these sneaks in a twelve?

173
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,760
Yeah.

174
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,080
You got a problem, bro?

175
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,120
No.

176
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,280
I'll go find this.

177
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,640
Hey...

178
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,600
...aren't you Whitney Fordman?
- Yeah.

179
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,720
Wade Mahaney.

180
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,440
I saw you throw 300 yards against
Topeka last year. That was a great game.

181
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,480
I heard you were tracked
for a full ride to Kansas State.

182
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,480
- It didn't work out. Size twelve, right?
- Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

183
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,960
Man. Well, I know all about that.

184
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,360
Senior year I got sacked, blew out
my knee, had to have four operations.

185
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,680
Tough break.

186
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,600
I had a dozen schools offer me
full scholarships...

187
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,240
...and then it all went away,
just like that.

188
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,600
So, what's your plan now?

189
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,280
Don't have one. Just don't want
to do this the rest of my life.

190
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,360
I hear you. Where's the future
in that, huh? Say...

191
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,880
...we're having a party
at our place tonight.

192
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,200
Why don't you swing by.

193
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,320
I can't, I've got to close up.

194
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,680
Come by after. Knock back a brew.
Detox from this.

195
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,200
Come on, man, it'll be fun.

196
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,080
Fun!

197
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,920
I am the god of quarters.

198
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,360
Let me give you the tour, bro.
Come on.

199
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,080
- This place is awesome.
- Maybe we could bring you on, Fordman.

200
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,040
- Always use a talented guy.
- Why do you wanna help me?

201
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Guys like us got to stick together.

202
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,440
I thought my life was over after football
didn't pan out.

203
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,160
It was just beginning.

204
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,760
Trust me...

205
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,240
...it only gets better. Let me show you
where the real party is.

206
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,080
You ever been inked?

207
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,560
I'm not really into tattoos.

208
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,400
Initiation, bro.
First one's on the house.

209
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,280
I don't know, man, they're kind of forever.

210
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,320
- You wanna eat with the big dogs?
- You got to step up to the bowl.

211
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,280
This is like nothing
you've ever seen before.

212
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,960
Make you feel like a new man,
swear to God.

213
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,360
Have a seat.

214
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,280
All right.

215
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,920
Just make sure
it doesn't say "Smallville."

216
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,080
Yeah, baby!

217
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,880
No! No!

218
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,080
- Hey! Hey, come on!
- Be the truck!

219
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,000
- Be the truck! Be the truck!
- You guys are crazy!

220
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,760
No!

221
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,080
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

222
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,640
- Yeah, baby!
- Yeah!

223
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,360
- Yeah.
- Yeah! You got it!

224
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,040
Hey.

225
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,880
Your dad called
and told me you were awake.

226
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,720
You're officially my first visitor.

227
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,680
How you feeling?

228
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,960
Like a million bucks, thrown in
the washing machine and set on spin.

229
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,080
- Everyone was real worried about you.
- Yeah, I noticed.

230
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,120
Looks like Nell's flower shop's
been stripped clean.

231
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,640
I especially like the ones from Lex.

232
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,800
They make me feel like I won
the Kentucky Derby.

233
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,000
They're beautiful, Clark.
They're my favourite.

234
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,160
I...

235
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,760
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

236
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,520
For what?

237
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,160
Letting you get hurt.

238
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,760
Well, I am perturbed with you, Clark.

239
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,240
I'm also mad that you didn't put out
the Chicago Fire of 1871.

240
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,800
Or prevent the fall of the Roman Empire,
making you responsible for the Dark Ages.

241
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,640
Thanks.

242
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,480
Do you remember anything
about those guys?

243
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,160
There was one thing. The guy that
grabbed me had a tattoo on his forearm.

244
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,320
An octagon, maybe.

245
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,360
- What's going on, Clark?
- I don't know.

246
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,080
Let me do some digging.

247
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,080
Clark Kent, investigative reporter.
Has a nice ring to it.

248
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,440
- You get some rest.
- I'll try.

249
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,760
Thank you.

250
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,520
This theater means something
to a lot of people.

251
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,840
I spent every Saturday of my
childhood here, eighth row center.

252
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,360
When the lights went down
and the screen flickered on...

253
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,360
...the problems outside these doors
just disappeared.

254
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,360
It was like being transported
to a magical place.

255
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,960
That's a nice story, but why is it
so important to you really?

256
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,240
My parents met here. I guess I'm just
looking for something to hold on to.

257
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,400
I'm supposed to preserve this monument
to Lana Lang's sentimental memories.

258
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,920
That's not what I meant.

259
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,800
You're a teenager, Lana.
Mercurial doesn't do you justice.

260
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,560
Thought you might understand.
Clearly I was mistaken.

261
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,560
This is business, Lana.

262
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,200
All these stores are becoming office
spaces. This town needs a parking garage.

263
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,560
So you're going ahead with your plans.

264
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,080
You haven't given me
any reason to change my mind.

265
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,160
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a pressing matter to attend to.

266
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,280
Whitney, you have a minute?

267
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,600
I'm kind of busy.

268
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,800
Remember the guy who came in
yesterday, looking for shoes?

269
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,560
- No. A lot of guys come in here.
- Whitney, this is serious.

270
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,120
Take it easy.

271
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,280
- Where'd you get that tattoo?
- Mind your own business.

272
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,520
Look, did those guys give it to you?

273
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,720
Whitney, they're bad news.

274
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,120
You spend your time trying to steal Lana.
Now, you wanna become my Boy Scout.

275
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,480
That's not true.

276
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,800
It's tough seeing yourself the way
others see you, isn't it, Kent?

277
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,360
- Stay away from those guys.
- You're not my father, Kent.

278
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,480
Now, get the hell out of here.

279
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,680
Hey. Nell said you called.
Sounded urgent.

280
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,320
- Have you seen Whitney today?
- Yeah. I asked him what was going on.

281
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,280
He said he was out with some
new friends, blowing off steam.

282
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,800
When I tried to press him,
he got angry, so I backed off.

283
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,840
It's hard watching people you love suffer
and there's nothing you can do to help.

284
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,480
Lana, I don't know if I'm supposed to tell
you this, but Whitney lost his scholarship.

285
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,160
What?

286
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,360
Why didn't he tell me?

287
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,720
He was so close to his dream, and then
to just have it taken away like that.

288
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,480
Must hurt like hell.

289
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,560
Thanks for telling me.

290
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,200
You're a good friend.

291
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,720
I raided the Torch. I think these
are Whitney's new friends.

292
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,200
Wade Mahaney and Scott Bowman.
Class of '96.

293
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,840
- Who are these guys?
- They were Whitney, six years ago.

294
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,240
Athletes, lettered in football, baseball,
basketball. They ruled the school.

295
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,400
- What happened?
- Well, according to the Ledger...

296
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,640
...Wade got injured
and Scott started using drugs.

297
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,160
They watched their futures vanish.

298
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,040
- Do you think Whitney's in trouble?
- I don't know.

299
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,760
I tried to talk to him,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

300
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,200
He thinks that scholarship
is his only way out of here.

301
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,080
I wish he'd see himself the way I do.
There's more to him than football.

302
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,800
- He's lucky to have you.
- Yeah.

303
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,680
Big influence I am.

304
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,200
Can't seem to convince anybody
to do anything today.

305
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,880
Are you talking about the Talon?

306
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,040
I met with Lex, tried to make my case,
but he totally shot me down.

307
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,760
He said I hadn't given him
a good enough business reason.

308
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,760
Sounds kind of harsh.

309
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,280
Yeah.

310
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,960
But I think the thing that makes me
maddest, is that he's right.

311
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,640
Maybe it wasn't a rejection,
maybe it was a challenge.

312
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,280
- My first challenge is helping Whitney.
- Let me work on that.

313
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,760
Clark, why are you doing this?
Not that I don't appreciate it.

314
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,640
I couldn't stop what happened to Chloe.
There's a chance for Whitney.

315
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
You got a taste.

316
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,480
You wanna find out
what it's all about, bro?

317
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,640
Yeah. Sure, I'm in.

318
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,760
Glad you could make it, Luthor.

319
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,360
Go inside. You'll find
a walk-in meat locker.

320
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,960
Wait there.

321
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,680
Now what?

322
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,040
Hello?

323
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,880
- How did you...?
- Open the case, Lex.

324
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,440
- I want the disk first.
- The money, Lex.

325
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,400
Give us the money!

326
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,880
- What's going on?
- Shut up.

327
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,000
It's empty. He screwed us!

328
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:52,040
- Lf I brought the money, I'd never get out.
- Big mistake, rich boy.

329
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,840
I phase through your neck, I kill you.

330
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,880
- We want the damn money!
- Stop it!

331
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,400
- Give us the money!
- You never said we'd do this!

332
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,280
I said, shut up!

333
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,440
Stop it, you're killing him!

334
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,520
Wade, time is almost up, we got to blow!

335
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,960
Next time, bring the money!

336
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,800
Whitney?

337
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,400
Come on, rookie.

338
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,880
What got into you, bro?
What were you thinking?

339
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,080
- He wasn't thinking!
- I didn't sign on to kill anyone.

340
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,120
Oh, is that it, Fordman?

341
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,880
- You trying to quit?
- I'm not saying that. It's just...

342
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,120
Luthor doesn't seem like the kind of guy
that would pay up and then walk away.

343
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,320
Don't worry about Luthor,
I put the fear of God in him!

344
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,400
It's gonna be our biggest payday yet!

345
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,120
All right, all right,
all right, that's enough.

346
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,920
Homeboy's fine.

347
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,560
- Just had a case of jitters, didn't you?
- Yeah.

348
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,400
Yeah.

349
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,680
- He's gonna screw everything up!
- Look at us, bro, we are burning up!

350
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,160
We can't just keep tatting up. We need
fresh blood to keep this dream alive.

351
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,720
Now go get a brew and chill out.

352
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,320
Come on.

353
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,880
Listen, bro.

354
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,480
I went out on a limb for you just now.

355
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,960
Don't let me down again.

356
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,840
I won't.

357
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,840
And don't sweat Luthor.

358
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,320
As soon as he ponies up the cash,
I think he's gonna disappear...

359
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,400
...for a very long time.

360
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,720
Come on.

361
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,280
All right, Lex...

362
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,200
...what were you doing with those guys?

363
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,800
They were blackmailing me, Clark.

364
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,720
I went there to make a drop.

365
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,400
You're wondering if your father's
been right about me all along, aren't you?

366
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,880
They stole a computer disk
that contains confidential information.

367
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,480
- What was on it?
- Nothing illegal...

368
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,040
...but it's not something
I want in the public domain.

369
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,880
That's why you didn't want
the police involved.

370
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,920
Clark, I told you I'd handle it.

371
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,400
Question is, what were you doing there?

372
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,400
I was following Whitney.

373
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,080
He's been hanging with those guys.
I wanted to help.

374
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,800
Is this because of Chloe?

375
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,120
Clark, you can't save the world.

376
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,200
All you'll end up with is
a messiah complex and a lot of enemies.

377
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,960
I saved you, didn't I?
That turned out all right.

378
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,960
What's your next move?

379
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,640
They're gonna learn
that it doesn't pay to rob Lex Luthor.

380
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,400
What about Whitney?

381
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,040
A man is measured
by the quality of his friends.

382
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,400
If the quarterback's with them,
he'll have to face the consequences.

383
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,400
Pete?

384
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,960
We were supposed to meet at the Torch.

385
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
Yeah, well, Chloe called...

386
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,920
...and I told her what we were doing...
- So I insisted you guys come here.

387
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,120
- You should be resting.
- All this resting is driving me insane.

388
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,640
These so-called "health-care professionals"
just want me in bed eating Jell-O.

389
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,680
Those fascists.

390
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,120
I need to do this, okay?
Don't cut me out of it, please?

391
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,480
Okay.

392
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,840
So I was surfing the Net,
doing some research...

393
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,920
How'd you get online here?

394
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,080
Pete hijacked the phone line for me.

395
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,320
What have you got?

396
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,960
What if these guys are using meteorite
tattoos to speed up their metabolism?

397
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,840
I mean, their molecules
are literally moving at hyperspeed.

398
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,160
- That's how they go through solid objects?
- That's crazy.

399
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,080
Well, they're doing it.

400
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,840
It's like the ultimate rush.

401
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,840
But there's no way their bodies
can handle that kind of stress for long.

402
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,720
What are you saying will happen?

403
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,360
You take the ultimate rush,
you pay the ultimate price.

404
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,440
Nell?

405
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,840
Nell, is that you?

406
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,160
Whitney.

407
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,600
I'm in trouble, Lana.

408
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,360
I messed up.

409
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,160
I trusted the wrong guys.

410
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
I'm sorry.

411
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,680
I let you down.
I just don't know what to do.

412
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,280
It's okay. It's okay.

413
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,440
After they get the money,
they're gonna kill Lex...

414
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,400
...and probably me for betraying them.

415
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,320
- You did the right thing.
- Yeah, too little too late.

416
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,960
Where are they now?

417
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,560
Back at the loft, sleeping it off.

418
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,120
- Did you see the disk they stole from Lex?
- No.

419
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,560
But it's gotta be there.
I can sneak in and get it.

420
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,400
- It's dangerous. We should call the police.
- No cops.

421
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,040
- I'm already in enough trouble.
- Tell me where they are.

422
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,320
- I can get in and out before they wake.
- I can't let you go alone, Clark.

423
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,880
I got myself into this mess,
I gotta try and get myself out of it.

424
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,280
Empty. They must be out looking for me.

425
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,560
Well, let's find it before they come back.

426
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,960
It's not here.

427
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,000
Keep looking.
It's gotta be here somewhere.

428
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,800
I got it.

429
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,960
You really screwed up, rookie.

430
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Look, I don't know how you found
that disk, bro, but I need it back. Now.

431
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,760
Hurts, doesn't it? It feels like someone's
chewing up your insides.

432
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,680
I stay in long enough,
I could do some serious damage.

433
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,280
You're next, bro.

434
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,000
Wade, please.

435
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,320
Keep moving, rookie.

436
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,440
I know what happened to your arm
in the bank vault.

437
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,720
Occupational hazard.
We waited too long.

438
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,240
Didn't hurt. When I pulled out,
it was fused at the shoulder.

439
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,880
You can't keep doing this.
You're gonna die.

440
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,560
If you hadn't have screwed up
our retirement plan, we wouldn't have to!

441
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,520
But now...

442
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,240
...you're gonna pay.

443
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,560
- How'd you find us?
- Lana called...

444
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,720
...told me what you guys were doing.
You should've called me first.

445
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,200
- I've gotta find Whitney.
- Clark, wait.

446
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,720
I'm calling the police.

447
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,800
I thought you understood.

448
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,800
This was your chance to be on top again.

449
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,280
I thought my life was over when
I lost my scholarship, but I was wrong.

450
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,560
No. You were right, your life is over.

451
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,320
Remember your initiation, bro?
That's how you joined us.

452
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,960
Well, that's how you're gonna leave.

453
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,760
We're running out of time,
grab the remote.

454
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,800
Let him go.

455
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,160
The cops are on their way.

456
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,960
Think again, rookie.
There's only one way off this team.

457
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,720
Don't worry, I got you covered.

458
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,240
Yeah!

459
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,480
Don't move!

460
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,800
- Keep your hands up!
- Keep them up!

461
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,040
Up against the car!

462
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,520
What did you tell the police?

463
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,000
The truth.

464
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,320
Those guys broke into my house. You two
figured it out, tried to be heroes...

465
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,400
...and got in over your heads.
- What about...?

466
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,400
Walking through walls part?

467
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,160
I don't think the cops could handle
that much truth.

468
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,200
Sorry about your disk.

469
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,240
I didn't come out here for that, Clark.
I came because my friend was in trouble.

470
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,000
Thanks.

471
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,520
Just remember, boys:

472
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,200
You keep my secret, and I'll keep yours.

473
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,200
And if you don't...

474
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,680
...you'll find out you're not the only ones
who can reach through walls.

475
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,680
Move this vehicle.
We have to transport the suspects.

476
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,960
Yes, sir.

477
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,560
- Ah, the sweet smell of freedom.
- You were in the hospital, not Alcatraz.

478
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,040
You spend a week in there and you'd feel
like a prisoner too. Come on.

479
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,440
Bad food, lights out by nine and no cable?

480
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,040
I'm thinking about doing an exposé.

481
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,920
- How's Whitney, by the way?
- He's taking it one day at a time.

482
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,520
Good. All right, well, bye.

483
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,440
- Oh, sorry.
- Chloe, where are you going?

484
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm gonna do some checking
with the police.

485
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,280
None of the tattoo ink
was found at the loft...

486
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,960
...and Scott and Derek aren't
saying anything to anyone, so...

487
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,760
I smell a cover-up.

488
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,040
Chloe?

489
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,560
It's good to have you back.

490
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Thanks.

491
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,560
He's early.

492
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,040
Okay, here goes nothing.

493
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,160
It's a good plan.

494
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,920
Thanks for all your help. Wish me luck.

495
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,400
You don't need it.

496
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,800
Thanks for coming.

497
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,160
I was surprised by your call.

498
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,200
After our last meeting,
I didn't think I'd hear from you again.

499
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,960
This time I came prepared.

500
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,880
What's this?

501
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,880
My business proposal.

502
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,760
Small towns across the country
have revived their downtowns...

503
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,280
...returning them to the social centers
they once were. They didn't do this...

504
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,760
...by building cookie-cutter malls
or parking garages.

505
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,040
They did it by restoring the great
buildings that were already there...

506
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,400
...turning them into cafes,
bookstores, restaurants.

507
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,800
You want to turn the Talon
into a cafe/bookstore?

508
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,800
It could also be a venue
for local bands and arthouse movies.

509
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,760
I found out you can
register the building...

510
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,160
...as a historic landmark,
which gives you certain tax benefits.

511
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,160
Just don't ask me to explain them.

512
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,920
Who's gonna manage it?

513
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,200
Nell said she'd be interested.

514
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,400
And I can train with her after school,
and try running it myself in the summers.

515
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,320
How'd you come up with this?

516
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,800
Something Clark said.
He told me you like to challenge people.

517
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,520
Well, you've definitely risen
to the challenge.

518
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,400
So it's a deal?

519
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,240
I need to look over
everything but, yeah...

520
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,680
...it's a deal.
- Really?

521
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,760
Really.

522
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,880
I think this could be the start
of a very interesting partnership.
