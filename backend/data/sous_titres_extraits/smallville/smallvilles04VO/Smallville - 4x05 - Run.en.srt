1
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:15,421
I'm not waiting around for some damn kid

2
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,165
He's late

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,545
Your watch is fast

4
00:00:20,342 --> 00:00:23,081
Hey, say... If there's something I am
is never late

5
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:25,315
I say I'm gonna be somewhere...
I'll be there like a flash

6
00:00:26,788 --> 00:00:28,524
Nice car, man!
What is this, real leather?

7
00:00:28,765 --> 00:00:32,421
I got places to be small fry!
What do you got for me?

8
00:00:34,345 --> 00:00:36,722
I got some great stuff for you Mr Hannison

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,549
I'm talking top of the line

10
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:53,183
You've been busy

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,621
Well you know:
"idle hands, empty pockets"

12
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,730
So whatta you think?
- I give you 200$ for the lot

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,701
It's worth it 10 times that much!
- Yeah, I told you i don't handle this nickle dime crap anymore

14
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:10,428
wanna handle real score you come talk to me...
until then, you take what I give you

15
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:14,990
Maybe I should just take it all

16
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:19,944
That isn't a threat, is it kid?

17
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:41,212
Ah, geez!

18
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:46,003
Doctor said your doing great
- Yeah right before he gave me this new prescription

19
00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:52,963
The red ones at least they'll go nicely with
my pink, blue and green ones I'm already taking

20
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:56,369
I rather have more colours in the
medicine cabinet than not have you around

21
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:59,238
I just didn't wanna have to worry your mother
anymore with this stuff, that's all

22
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:01,927
Dad, we both worry about you

23
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:06,897
What you already did because of me...
- Wow! Wait a minute, I knew what the risk was, Clark...

24
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:10,760
ANd I'll take it again in a heartbeat if it meant
keeping you safe

25
00:02:12,204 --> 00:02:13,579
Didn't you and I have a game to catch?

26
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:18,077
Metropolis Sheriffs, 50 yard line...
Lex really came through this time

27
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:25,706
Look son, I understand what that friendship means to you,
but... please don't forget he had you investigated, be careful

28
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,008
Not going into this with my eyes closed

29
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:29,356
He wants another chance
to prove he's changed

30
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:31,507
Clark...

31
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,796
Dad this is my senior year, I don't want to have
to worry about Lex or Jor-El, or any of that

32
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:39,185
I just wanna lead a normal life, hang out with
my friends and play football

33
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:42,981
Alright.. why don't you go get the truck
We don't wanna miss the kick off

34
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:20,764
Dad!
Dad you're ok?

35
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,492
Yeah, I think so...

36
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:27,968
Your mother would be visiting me in the hospital
again if you hadn't pushed me outta the way

37
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:31,017
Dad it wasn't me
I saw someone who can move like I can

38
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:34,455
I couldn't believe it, he saved you

39
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:44,428
Whoever it is, he not only did he save my life,
Clark, he also stole my wallet

40
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:55,689
Somebody save me!

41
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,199
Let your warm hands break right through

42
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:05,027
Somebody save me!

43
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:11,889
I don't care how you do it

44
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:16,192
Just save...
Save...

45
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:18,213
Come on!

46
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:21,993
I've been waiting for you

47
00:04:28,154 --> 00:04:32,229
I made this whole world shine for you!

48
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:35,912
Stay!
Stay!

49
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:38,014
Come on!

50
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:47,473
Smallville Season 5
Episode 5 " RUN "

51
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:02,185
Hey! Aren't you two supposed to be at the game?

52
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:05,625
Well the tickets to the game were in my wallet

53
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:09,076
- Which was stolen, some kid swiped it
outside the medical building

54
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:11,995
Oh my god, your were robbed!
Are you alright? Did he have a gun?

55
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:14,426
No, he had a very fast pair of sneakers but...

56
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:17,167
I'm gonna call the credit card company
to report it stolen

57
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,178
Hey dad, wait!

58
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:22,823
THis kid... he was as fast as I am,
I should find out who he is

59
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:26,424
Just let me talk to Chloe, maybe she can track
down where he's been using your card

60
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,271
Come on dad, if I don't find anything by
the end of the day, then make the call

61
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:36,201
Alright, but I want you to be careful Clark,
we don't know anything about this kid

62
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:38,016
THat's why I've to find out who he is

63
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:46,752
Are you sure you're ok?
- Sweetheart I'm fine... I wish you wouldn't worry about me all the time

64
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,039
You were in a comma for 3 months Jonathan,

65
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,258
it's hard not to worry when you've been
through so much

66
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:54,339
With a lil' help from modern medicine I'm
planning to go through a whole lot more

67
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:57,501
Starting with a romantic evening
with my beautiful wife

68
00:05:58,897 --> 00:06:02,981
Maybe we could have a lil' dinner and then...
drive on down to the lake?

69
00:06:03,073 --> 00:06:04,421
I'd love that sweetheart, but I...

70
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:07,651
I'm gonna have to work late again tonite...

71
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:11,750
Running the Talon is a lot more involved than
I thought it would be but... eh...

72
00:06:12,853 --> 00:06:13,792
I'll call you later, ok?

73
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:28,449
<<The Greek Republic>>

74
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:00,324
What is that?

75
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:04,572
IT's nothing

76
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:09,468
Looks like a very large tattoo hovering over
a very provocative spot

77
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:11,738
When did you get that?
- Hum... uh... I got it.. uh...

78
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:14,267
...Before I came back from Paris

79
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:19,876
Really? Why didn't you tell me?
I could've come with you and gotten a mermaid...

80
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:22,599
or an anchor... or a mermaid holding an anchor

81
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:25,665
I didn't plan on getting it alright?
it kinda just happened

82
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,350
Tattoos don't just kinda happen...

83
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:31,421
There's usually some ink and
a fair amount of pain involved

84
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:36,106
What was I supposed to do?
Ask you for permission to get it?

85
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:37,466
Wow! Hey!

86
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:41,099
THat's not what I meant...
Why are you biting me head right off now?

87
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:42,124
- I'm not
- Yes you are

88
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:46,615
Look I just... I don't want you making
a big deal outta this

89
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,839
I don't care about the tattoo, ok?

90
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,299
But what bothers me is the fact that for some weird
reason you felt like you had to hide it from me

91
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:03,421
I've seen what keeping secrets
has done to my parents...

92
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,409
I'm not gonna end up like that

93
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,367
Jason the last thing I ever wanna do
is hurt you

94
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:18,546
But there are some things that I am... just
I'm not confortable sharing with you yet

95
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,699
I'm sorry

96
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:35,483
<< FRAGILE >>

97
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:04,735
Dude!

98
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:06,934
You lost?

99
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,482
You know, cause I guess you must
be because... this is my room

100
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,768
Technically it's my dad's since you used
his credit cards to pay for it

101
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,328
I didn't take anything from anybody

102
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:23,477
You can save the innocent act, I had a friend trace all the
charges you trying to stick on him after you stole his wallet

103
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,530
And you went through my backpack!
Man, that's invasion of privacy...

104
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:31,367
...messing with my stuff
- Your stuff? You stole all this!

105
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:34,984
Yeah?

106
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,755
Prove it

107
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:45,592
I saw you save my dad from
that truck this morning

108
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:49,555
Man, nobody sees me
when I'm doing my thing

109
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:52,341
Maybe you're not the only one
who can move like that...

110
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:57,769
Jake Garrick, Barry Allen, Wally West...
whatever your name really is...

111
00:10:58,957 --> 00:10:59,381
It's Bart

112
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:04,270
Not that it matters cause I'll be a 1000 miles
away before you can even blink

113
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,781
I don't know...
I can blink pretty fast

114
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:10,383
I'm warning you man

115
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,816
I'm gonna give my dad his wallet, and then
you and I are going to sit down for a long talk

116
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,263
Not big of a chit chat,dude

117
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:24,269
Smell you later

118
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:02,064
Dad, I found the kid who stole your wallet
but I lost him out at the docks

119
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:03,938
He just took off across the water

120
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:05,975
Uhmm, son...

121
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,034
Hi Clark

122
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,340
What took you so long?

123
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,194
Dude, I didn't think anybody else
could move like that except me,

124
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,842
because, hey... fastest man alive, right?
Yeah!

125
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:31,904
You were right up my butt, man... and

126
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,626
You know I've always wondered if there's anyone
else out there like me and it turns out...

127
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:37,347
...to be you! Jimmy Crackcorn,
fresh from the farm

128
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:41,081
What Kind of story did you spin to con my
dad out of a free meal and a bed on the couch

129
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,744
No story Clark, just the truth

130
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:44,242
And what's that?

131
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:46,328
Well.. A couple of years ago...

132
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:48,056
...there was like this accident... right

133
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:49,570
...a huge flashlight...

134
00:12:50,614 --> 00:12:52,637
and my body went into overdrive

135
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,772
And this happened in Smallville?

136
00:12:55,617 --> 00:12:56,207
No

137
00:12:57,015 --> 00:12:58,195
It's my first time here... and

138
00:12:59,402 --> 00:13:00,412
No offense dude... but

139
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,596
Hopefully the last

140
00:13:04,738 --> 00:13:07,858
I've never met anyone with powers like yours
that wasn't from around here

141
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:10,629
Yeah, well...
Maybe you should get out more

142
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,574
So, how did you get so fast?

143
00:13:16,222 --> 00:13:17,410
You had an accident too or...

144
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:21,600
I was kinda born this way...
Why are you living on the streets Bart?

145
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:25,918
What happened to your parents?

146
00:13:27,051 --> 00:13:29,697
Their son got zapped into a human
lightning bolt that's what happened

147
00:13:30,455 --> 00:13:33,610
I mean, they made this whole big deal that
everything was gonna be ok and that...

148
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:39,724
I don't know man, you should've just seen
the way they looked at me...

149
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:43,877
I could tell that...
nothing was gonna be the same...

150
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:45,964
So you ran away?

151
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:48,645
I'm...

152
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:50,926
I just didn't fit in

153
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:55,956
Man, I guess you don't have that problem...
- Oh, you'd be surprised

154
00:13:58,123 --> 00:14:00,585
I ran away once too
- Yeah, why did you come back, man?

155
00:14:00,803 --> 00:14:02,947
Mow the lawn, milk the cows?

156
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:05,475
Dude, you should be out there
with me tearing it up

157
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,803
You mean stealing everything in sight?

158
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:11,259
It's not like I really hurt anybody...

159
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:16,068
I mean I usually just swipe a lil' bling from
stiff upper crust whenever i need some cash

160
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:21,217
How much would you call "a have-not" Clark?
I take from "the haves"

161
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:22,406
Like my dad?

162
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:28,259
Look man, don't even sweat it ok?
They don't charge you if your card's stolen

163
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,563
Oh, and that makes it alright?

164
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:34,094
Look man, my friends down at suicide slums...
they sure changed me...

165
00:14:34,476 --> 00:14:38,332
So I had to boost your dad's card in order to get a
room I don't like spending the night out in the streets

166
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:40,058
Ok? Stuff happens there...

167
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,267
When I'm asleep I'm just
as slow as everybody else

168
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,799
Don't hit me with the big
cow eyes there stretch? Ok?

169
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:52,904
I could always take care of myself...
- Yeah you've done a great job so far

170
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,525
You know what man? Enough of
the poor lil' street urchin right?

171
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:02,845
Let's take a closer look at
the mysterious Clark Kent

172
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:07,524
let's see...

173
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:10,879
you like to read about
native american mythology..

174
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:17,172
you've scrolled the name "Lana"
on your notebooks

175
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:20,041
And you've one of the most
boring hobbies known to man...

176
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:23,925
Rock collecting
- I don't collect rocks...

177
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:32,492
Dude you're ok?

178
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:33,734
Put that away

179
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:35,473
I'm alergic

180
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:43,198
Man! I've heard of people sneeze around cats and dogs
and stuff but never get all weak in the knees over a rock

181
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:44,358
It's a long story

182
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:49,067
It's one I'm sure I'd love to hear
after we get back...

183
00:15:51,022 --> 00:15:51,511
Get back from where?

184
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,256
Anywhere we want

185
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,451
I mean do we have
2 super power studs here?

186
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:59,252
Why else do you think i came all over
to Smellyville looking for you man?

187
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:01,080
Let's go crank it up!
Go have some fun

188
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:03,231
Did you ever seen Florida?

189
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:13,081
<< GRAND RE-OPENING >>

190
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:19,377
Dude, man, that girl in the black bikini she was
totally checking you out

191
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:23,125
No she wasn't - Look the girl was eyeing
you like you were a snow-cone dude...

192
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:26,548
...you should've gotten her number
- I can't just walk up to a girl on the beach and get her phone number

193
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,884
Yeah, well, lucky for you...

194
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,296
I can

195
00:16:31,315 --> 00:16:33,082
She said to call her next time
you are in Miami

196
00:16:34,397 --> 00:16:36,653
I can't just go running back down to Miami
- Why not?

197
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:39,210
Because it's...
- It's what?

198
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:40,580
Too much fun Clark?

199
00:16:41,045 --> 00:16:42,796
Come on, nobody's ever died from it

200
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:46,512
What are you doing?

201
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,723
I'm eating a cookie, dude
I'm starving

202
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,396
You can't just take whatever you want
My mom runs this place

203
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:56,845
Look man, there's a line...
I don't do lines

204
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,353
What's up Kent? I thought you'd still be in
Metropolis playing detective

205
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:02,489
I thought i leave that one up to the authorities

206
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:04,281
They never whould've caught him anyway

207
00:17:05,383 --> 00:17:08,358
Chloe this is my friend Bart, he's from..
- The future

208
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:10,461
Really?
- Yeah

209
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:14,633
I ran all the way back in time to tell you that
we are still in love a 100 years from now

210
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:17,223
Bart...

211
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,263
What's your favourite kind of flower Chloe?

212
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:20,697
Uhmmm... tulips

213
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:29,284
How did you do that?
- Magic

214
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:31,925
You wanna see some more?

215
00:17:33,372 --> 00:17:34,012
Clark!

216
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:38,234
Knock it off!

217
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:43,904
Your dad called...
Is that the boy who robbed him?

218
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:47,166
Yeah, his name's Bart Allen
- Why's he here?

219
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:52,087
I think he's lonely, wants to be my friend
- Good, maybe you can talk some sense into him

220
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,340
I'm trying

221
00:17:54,011 --> 00:17:55,738
Oh, uh... Lex is looking for you sweetheart...

222
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:58,313
he asked if you'd stop by the mansion,
he said it's important

223
00:17:58,763 --> 00:18:00,204
Ok, but I probably
shouldn't leave Bart alone

224
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:07,162
I really don't think he'll notice you're gone...

225
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:18,244
I purchased this from a private collector
in St Petersburg...

226
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,968
convincing him to part with it required a few glasses
of vodka and a small fortune but it was worth it...

227
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,611
That's very nice

228
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,596
Take a closer look at the border design

229
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:35,279
Embedded glyphs, similar to the Kowaichi
symbols found in the cave

230
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:39,547
No one's spent more time down there than you

231
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:45,235
Any idea what they mean?

232
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:47,698
No

233
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:51,152
But I thought you weren't interested
in this stuff anymore

234
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:54,086
Oh, I'm still interested Clark,
just not obssessed,

235
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,839
Which is why I'm not keeping this from you

236
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:00,573
I'd like it if we could work on
this mystery together

237
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:02,282
I'd like that

238
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:06,456
So what is it?

239
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:10,874
It's the last surviving page from
a XIV century manuscript

240
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:17,962
It depicts the Grand Prince Donskov's victory over
his mortal enemy Mamaia at the battle of Kulikova

241
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:21,371
Legend has it that...

242
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:27,499
this was the only object adorning the walls of Rasputin's
chamber while he studied at the Verkhoturye Monastery

243
00:19:30,247 --> 00:19:34,591
He believed this page will reveal
a path to unimaginable power

244
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:40,636
Rasputin would stare to it for days at a time
in the attempt to penetrate its secrets

245
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:44,417
It's incredible...
- Don't

246
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:49,599
I had state of the art security installed
to protect it

247
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,977
I'm keeping it at the mansion for a few days
before it goes into the vault at Luthorcorp

248
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:04,347
Sorry Clark I have an appointment...

249
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:08,585
Why don't you swing by tomorrow and...
we'll roll up our sleeves...

250
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:11,992
Yeah

251
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:27,882
Dude, you know Lex Luthor?
- Whatta you doing here?

252
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,487
Well, Chloe shut me down,
but you know, her loss...

253
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:33,181
Man this place is awesome!

254
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,984
Man have you seen all the cool stuff?
- You were just in there?

255
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:37,857
Yeah, I just took a quick spin

256
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:42,601
Don't worry man, he won't even have a clue
- You gotta get outta here

257
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:45,745
Clark, who're you talking to?

258
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:01,327
Dad!

259
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:02,533
Hey Clark!

260
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:07,800
Just in time son, your mom's working late again
so I thought maybe we'd have guys night

261
00:21:07,953 --> 00:21:09,999
You know, catch up on the highlights
of the game we missed?

262
00:21:10,054 --> 00:21:14,855
I saw something in Lex's dad, it was a page of
an old manuscript that had krytonian symbols on it

263
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:16,665
Kryptonian symbols?

264
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:19,240
Were you able to read 'em?

265
00:21:19,332 --> 00:21:22,011
It had a message, repeated over and over:
" Look deeper"

266
00:21:22,427 --> 00:21:24,862
I used my X-ray vision and I saw
a map hidden underneath

267
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:26,575
A map?

268
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:31,349
A Map to what?

269
00:21:33,177 --> 00:21:37,168
I don't know dad, but I think it has something to do with
Jor-El, and what he said to me after he was controlling me

270
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:40,380
- I want you to leave this alone,
Clark... - No, dad... - Son!

271
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,204
You were just telling me how you'd like
to have a normal senior year, right?

272
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:48,660
Well, how does traipsing across the globe
on Jor-El's crusade fit in with that?

273
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:51,902
It doesn't, but hanging out with Bart
reminded me that I'm not normal, dad

274
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,552
Maybe it's time I stopped running
from who I really am

275
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,276
What you really are is a 17 year old boy

276
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:01,974
Sit down

277
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:05,463
Dad, it doesn't matter how old I am

278
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:09,310
Whatever Jor-El sent to me find I've a feeling
it's very powerful and dangerous,

279
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:13,318
especially if it falls into the wrong hands, and
I'm the only one who could stop that from happening

280
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,384
How?
By stealing this manuscript from Lex?

281
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,442
No, he's no idea of what he has... All I've to do
is to sneak back in there and get a better look at it

282
00:22:20,747 --> 00:22:25,068
Clark, it's a bad idea, he could see you
- I'll be in and out before he even knows I'm there

283
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:30,856
Dude!

284
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,029
Lex's place was sweet!
I mean that guy's got like 20 cars!

285
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:38,304
Man, there's no way you get that rich
playing it straight

286
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:43,244
Man, I gotta step it up a notch
because that's definitively how I wanna live

287
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:45,671
Listen, Bart, there's something I've got
to take care of, alright?

288
00:22:46,662 --> 00:22:50,610
Can I come?
- No, it's personal, but maybe we'll hang out when I get back

289
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,145
Oh dude, there's this midnight showing "Speed"
at the Min's chinese theatre...

290
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:57,701
best popcorn and Keanu rules in that one...
So d'you wanna go?

291
00:22:58,102 --> 00:23:02,401
You know it sounds great, but... just don't mention it to my dad, ok?
- Ok

292
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,284
Clark!

293
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:12,782
Man, it's been really cool hanging out
with somebody like me, you know?

294
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,134
So I gotya something,
just to say thanks for everything

295
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:27,679
It's an mp3 player. That way you can download all
your favourite tunes and listen to 'em wherever we go

296
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:31,167
Where did you get this?

297
00:23:33,392 --> 00:23:34,493
I got it for you Clark

298
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:37,573
It doesn't matter where I got it
- Yes it does Bart

299
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:42,235
You haven't been listening
to anything I've said to you.

300
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:43,946
You can't go around
stealing whatever you want

301
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:46,179
Why not?
- Because there are laws

302
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:48,135
For normal people!

303
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:52,953
And dude, why do you treat your habilities like
they're a curse? They're not man!

304
00:23:53,503 --> 00:23:54,355
THey're a gift!

305
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,924
I'm gonna use' em
- I'm not saying you shouldn't

306
00:23:58,293 --> 00:24:00,190
Just use'em to help people not hurt them

307
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:02,389
- Whom am I hurting?
The store I swiped this from?

308
00:24:02,726 --> 00:24:05,129
Cause they're insured
- That doesn't make it right

309
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:09,690
Whatever dude, I'm not sticking around
for another lecture

310
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:12,381
Whatta you gonna do?
Run away again?

311
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:15,022
You're not gonna solve all your problems
like that, Bart

312
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:17,695
Look, I'm not running away, Clark

313
00:24:19,396 --> 00:24:24,816
I'm running towards something I'm gonna have
everything I've ever dreamed of one way or another

314
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:28,354
Bart...
- Look, I thought you and I were the same but I was wrong

315
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:31,726
You are nothing like me

316
00:25:06,493 --> 00:25:07,353
Bart!

317
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:09,421
Don't Move!

318
00:25:10,736 --> 00:25:11,443
Clark?

319
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:19,918
What the hell are doing here?

320
00:25:30,547 --> 00:25:32,593
Would you like to explain what happened here?

321
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:35,120
Just came by to say hello

322
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:38,625
Next thing I know all this alarms and lights
are going off

323
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:41,492
It's a lil' late for a...

324
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:44,310
...Social call Clark...
- Yeah, I just...

325
00:25:44,941 --> 00:25:46,853
I should've called but
I just figured you'd be up

326
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:52,836
Are you sure you didn't see anyone else
when you came in?

327
00:25:54,526 --> 00:25:55,754
No, I didn't see anyone

328
00:25:58,346 --> 00:25:59,551
Then you don't know who did this?

329
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,866
No, I don't

330
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,202
I believe you

331
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:12,591
I know a real friend would never lie to me

332
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:24,457
I better go and let you take care of this

333
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,916
I'll let you in on a secret...
I'm not that worried...

334
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:36,565
You said this manuscript page
was worth a fortune

335
00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:38,701
It is

336
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:43,786
And there aren't that many fences in Metropolis
that can move such a high-end item

337
00:26:48,228 --> 00:26:52,472
If I put a reward at him, sure some fiscally
challenged citizen will point me in the right direction

338
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:55,603
D'you think that'll work?

339
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:00,020
Don't worry Clark

340
00:27:01,644 --> 00:27:05,302
Our thief is gonna learn that there's
nowhere on Earth he can run from Lex Luthor

341
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:15,863
I'd like that too, Jonathan, but I can't

342
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:18,975
Because I still have all this work to do

343
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:23,425
I'll be home as soon as I can
that's the best I can do

344
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:24,680
ok, bye

345
00:27:26,874 --> 00:27:27,841
You're working late?

346
00:27:28,852 --> 00:27:35,422
Oh god, it's like this never stops, I don't know
how you managed all this and went to school too, Lana

347
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:40,604
It wasn't easy... but I don't remember
staying this late after closing every night

348
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:43,473
Well it's easier to do this here than at home

349
00:27:46,988 --> 00:27:48,559
Is everything alright Mrs Kent?

350
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:54,426
Oh, Jonathan thinks the only reason I took
this job is to help out our finances

351
00:28:00,473 --> 00:28:03,601
I love him... so much...

352
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:06,991
But after everyhing that's happened,
all his health problems...

353
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,975
The only time I'm not worrying about
losing him is when I'm here...

354
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,033
...working

355
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,923
But if you're here all the time then...

356
00:28:17,303 --> 00:28:18,662
...you don't see him anyway

357
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,992
Isn't that like you lost him already?

358
00:28:28,654 --> 00:28:32,026
That summer in Paris's really
given you some insight, Lana

359
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:38,727
Thank you for reminding me

360
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:41,088
Reminding you of what?

361
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:45,932
That it's easier to deal with your fears
if you can share them with someone you love

362
00:28:56,453 --> 00:29:01,545
Sure, however you wanna handle it
No problem, it is my pleasure

363
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,445
well it's about time

364
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,945
- Well I had some things to take care of, maybe when
you grow up you'lll understand how men do business

365
00:29:16,826 --> 00:29:17,956
Is this grown up enough for you?

366
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:23,744
It's a start

367
00:29:43,387 --> 00:29:45,736
Mr Luthor I belive that I've something
that belongs to you

368
00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:59,018
Is this the dangerous criminal
you warned me about?

369
00:29:59,288 --> 00:30:03,157
Hey, it's not your problem
Come on, let's talk about that finder's fee

370
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:05,946
He's just a kid
Let him go

371
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,558
No

372
00:30:08,287 --> 00:30:10,346
You've no idea what that freak is capable of

373
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:13,508
If I were you I'd be more concerned
about the police right now, Hannison

374
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:19,750
What did you do?

375
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:24,917
In about 5 minutes this place will be
swarming with Metropolis P.D.

376
00:30:27,378 --> 00:30:30,623
Well ok, then I guess
we better hurry this up, uh?

377
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:32,072
Tony!

378
00:30:50,775 --> 00:30:52,236
Look at the mess you made kid!

379
00:30:55,714 --> 00:30:58,997
Let's see if you're faster than
the speed of a bullet!

380
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:12,348
You don't wanna be here!

381
00:31:18,394 --> 00:31:20,140
You still think what you do
never hurts anyone?

382
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:27,018
Lex!

383
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:29,672
Lex?

384
00:31:30,561 --> 00:31:31,679
I am sorry Clark

385
00:31:37,704 --> 00:31:38,931
This doesn't change anything

386
00:31:41,761 --> 00:31:43,739
You don't understand...
it'll kill me

387
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:48,872
You're not a murderer!
That's not who you are!

388
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:51,107
You don't know who I am!
- Yes I do

389
00:31:52,298 --> 00:31:54,203
Why did I say you saved my dad?

390
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,257
I've seen the good in you

391
00:31:57,523 --> 00:32:02,418
Bart, you gotta stop running or in the end you'll
just be alone and you don't want that, I know you don't

392
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:04,701
I know because down deep...

393
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,722
...we're the same

394
00:32:16,655 --> 00:32:17,852
I wish that was true Clark

395
00:32:46,286 --> 00:32:50,002
You've no idea of where Bart could be?
- Lex was unconscious...

396
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:53,616
I stayed with him until I heard the
police syrens then I went after Bart

397
00:32:54,775 --> 00:32:56,502
By then he could've been
halfway around the world

398
00:32:57,952 --> 00:32:59,224
I think it could be for the best, Clark

399
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,549
Dad!
- Now look, I know how much you wanted to help him about but...

400
00:33:03,457 --> 00:33:05,758
...you can't force people to change
no matter how strong you are

401
00:33:06,046 --> 00:33:09,101
He's not a bad kid, dad, he's just different,
at least he's willing to accept that

402
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:12,524
Clark, embracing your abilities and
flaunting them are 2 entirely different things

403
00:33:13,685 --> 00:33:14,307
I know

404
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:18,891
It's just sometimes there's a part of me that
wishes I could be more like him

405
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:23,684
I mean... I've spent so much time trying to hide who
I really am, I'm starting to feel like 2 separate people

406
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:28,232
Clark, I think you'd be really surprised to find
out how many normal people feel exactly the same way

407
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,887
Yes, son, everybody has secrets,
yours is just...

408
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,024
...it's just bigger than most

409
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:37,522
I better go check on Lex
- Alright, you wanna use the truck?

410
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:41,239
No, I uh...
Kinda wanna stretch my legs

411
00:33:51,775 --> 00:33:52,583
Hey!

412
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:57,376
Thought you'd be at work all day
- Well that's one of the benefits of being the boss

413
00:33:58,086 --> 00:34:03,667
I promoted Linda to assistant manager so I can take a
break and spend some time with a raggedly handsome farmer

414
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,027
Well, you 're in luck,
there just happens to be one...

415
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,584
sweating in your driveway right now

416
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:12,273
- Maybe I should get the hose
and a bucket of soap

417
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:22,492
I really missed you
- Me too

418
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:45,735
This is amazing

419
00:34:46,577 --> 00:34:48,132
When Clark first found this caves...

420
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,838
...I had no idea why was he
so obssessed with them

421
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,890
I always felt like he was keeping this secrets from
me because he was afraid of how I was going to react

422
00:34:57,906 --> 00:35:01,302
I don't wanna live like that
I don't wanna be afraid all the time

423
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,073
You don't have to be, not with me,
that's what I've been trying to tell you

424
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:07,659
Ok

425
00:35:10,753 --> 00:35:12,711
Remember the church we went to in Paris?

426
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,460
Yeah, I had to live early to make
arrangements for your birthday...

427
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:19,542
Well after you left I noticed something strange
on the tomb of Countess Thoreau

428
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:23,732
There were these symbols edged into the rock,
like the ones in this cave

429
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:25,343
How is that possible?

430
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:28,164
I don't know

431
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:33,934
And when I touched them, there was this
blinding light and then pain...

432
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:38,564
...and all I remember is waking up the next
morning to you knocking on my door

433
00:35:44,847 --> 00:35:46,142
And I had this

434
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:55,417
Ok wait a second...

435
00:35:56,048 --> 00:35:57,128
So you're saying...

436
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,197
that some strange symbols on the tomb
of a dead countess...

437
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,599
gave you a tattoo?

438
00:36:04,543 --> 00:36:05,537
You know how odd it sounds...

439
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:08,750
Why d'you think I didn't wanna tell you?

440
00:36:10,827 --> 00:36:12,073
That's why you left Paris

441
00:36:13,786 --> 00:36:15,187
I had to come back to these caves

442
00:36:16,277 --> 00:36:19,067
I had to find out why I was missing
12 hours of my life

443
00:36:23,688 --> 00:36:25,209
But all I found were more questions

444
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:35,022
It's the same as yours

445
00:36:36,072 --> 00:36:37,156
What does the symbol mean?

446
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,488
I don't know

447
00:36:42,486 --> 00:36:45,714
Jason I don't know what's happening to me
- Ok, Ok

448
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:48,891
Whatever it is...

449
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,745
...we'll figure it out together ok?

450
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:54,336
ok

451
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:10,001
Clark!

452
00:37:11,558 --> 00:37:13,227
It's good to see you keeping normal hours

453
00:37:14,285 --> 00:37:15,639
Just came by to see if you're alright

454
00:37:16,438 --> 00:37:17,889
I heard you ran into some trouble
in Metropolis..

455
00:37:18,835 --> 00:37:21,620
News travels fast
- The curse of a small town

456
00:37:24,122 --> 00:37:25,139
So, what happened?

457
00:37:25,653 --> 00:37:28,609
I decided to play cowboy
and got my spurs handed to me

458
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:31,692
To be honest I don't know why I'm not dead

459
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:35,781
THere must be somebody watching over you

460
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:37,982
In more ways than one

461
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:44,713
How did you get this back?

462
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:47,027
I didn't

463
00:37:47,755 --> 00:37:50,239
It was sitting on my desk when
I returned from the Hospital

464
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,717
Whoever took it must've had
a change of heart

465
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:54,656
I guess he did

466
00:37:56,852 --> 00:37:58,716
Look, we'll have plenty of time
to study this later...

467
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:03,344
Right now, I'm still nursing a bit of a headache
- I'm just glad you're feeling better

468
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,394
Clark

469
00:38:22,147 --> 00:38:27,224
I thought you'd like to know I had the manuscript page
examined by a team of experts as soon as it turned out

470
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,907
Do you know what they discovered?

471
00:38:34,372 --> 00:38:35,959
That I payed too much for it

472
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:42,008
Thanks for checking in on me

473
00:39:06,342 --> 00:39:07,680
Dude, your drawing sucks

474
00:39:10,824 --> 00:39:12,081
I'm sick of the hero thing

475
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:14,884
You mean like returning a
priceless artifact to its owner?

476
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:17,996
Kinda all that money would've just
slowed me down anyway

477
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:19,724
To a dead stop if I hadn't found you

478
00:39:20,271 --> 00:39:21,257
Yeah, how did you do that?

479
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,929
Whatta you? Fast? Strong? And psychic?

480
00:39:24,803 --> 00:39:25,721
I wish

481
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:31,771
I spent a whole night down at suicide slums trying to
convince someone that I had a 1000 of these to fence

482
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,422
A few guys pointed me in
the direction of Hannison

483
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:38,584
Look at you,
channelling your inner criminal

484
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:43,017
So, uh...

485
00:39:43,874 --> 00:39:44,824
whatta you gonna do now?

486
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:47,809
I don't know.
It's a big world

487
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:49,406
We gotta to check it out

488
00:39:52,911 --> 00:39:54,311
See if there's anyone else out there like us

489
00:39:54,828 --> 00:39:56,560
Maybe start like a club
or league or something

490
00:40:01,216 --> 00:40:02,331
You know you could come with me...

491
00:40:03,689 --> 00:40:04,580
...or you could stay...

492
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:07,351
You've a great life, Clark, but...

493
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:11,965
It's not mine
I've no reason to stay in Smallville

494
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:14,475
You've me

495
00:40:19,196 --> 00:40:21,076
