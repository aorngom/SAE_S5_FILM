1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,870
"SCHOOL'S OUT FOREVER!"

2
00:00:06,384 --> 00:00:07,584
Wow, can
you believe...

3
00:00:07,585 --> 00:00:09,385
that 4 years has
gone by this fast?

4
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:12,349
There you go.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,550
Ok.

6
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:15,791
"To Brendan. A
photographer who could...

7
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:17,592
always capture
the moment".

8
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:21,509
Thanks.

9
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:22,911
Sure.

10
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:25,713
I gotta run.

11
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:27,147
See ya.

12
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:28,737
Hi.
Hi.

13
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:30,137
See ya at lunch.

14
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:17,195
Hello?

15
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:28,912
Hello?

16
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,650
Is anyone in here?

17
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:55,751
Hello?

18
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:10,885
Haley?

19
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,710
Oh, thank God,

20
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,710
I don't know
what's going on,

21
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:17,311
but I think we're the
only two people in...

22
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:04,108
Oh my God!

23
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:05,227
What going on?

24
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:13,721
Help!

25
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:15,496
Help me!

26
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,571
Help!

27
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:28,216
4x21 Forever

28
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:21,901
He's obvious been thinking
about this for a while.

29
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:25,225
You have to let him make
his own decisions, Jonathan.

30
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,416
Hey.

31
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:30,417
You mind telling me why
you have a financial aid...

32
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:32,418
package for
Central Kansas?

33
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,392
That's where
I'm going to college.

34
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:38,313
What happened
to Met. U.?

35
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:40,014
What happened
to Ohio,

36
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:41,315
what happened
to Miami?

37
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:44,535
I thought I'd stay
closer to home.

38
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,379
Clark...

39
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,980
I know starting over
with new friends...

40
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:49,881
in a new city can
seem overwhelming,

41
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:50,882
but...

42
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:52,683
you can't let
that hold you back.

43
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:54,487
This is one of the most
important decisions...

44
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:56,449
you going to make
in your entire life.

45
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:57,449
You don't think
I know that?

46
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:01,255
Does Lana happen to be
going to Central Kansas?

47
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,567
I don't know where Lana's
going to school, so no..

48
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:06,168
this is not
about Lana.

49
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:07,369
Oh, so it's about us.

50
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:10,974
You don't think I can run
this farm without your help.

51
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:14,017
This is where
I'm needed.

52
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:16,800
Clark, your destiny
lies far beyond...

53
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:18,228
those corn
fields out there.

54
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:20,628
And I'm not about to let
you turn your back on that...

55
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,929
just because of us.

56
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:26,761
Now I've got a
farm to run.

57
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:32,409
Clark?

58
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:36,424
Is that really
the reason?

59
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,553
Those tests,
was really hard...

60
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,216
I know, I had formally
badly in that..

61
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:01,460
Lisa, Delia.

62
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,760
Do you guys know
what's going on?

63
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:04,219
You better
hurry Chloe,

64
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,221
or you're going to
be late for Trig.

65
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:06,223
Wait, Trig?

66
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:08,123
Guys, there's no classrooms
behind these doors!

67
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,540
Just play along.

68
00:06:09,923 --> 00:06:11,123
He's watching.

69
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:17,916
Brendan, wait!

70
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,017
Don't let the door
shut behind you..

71
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:19,858
What are you doing!?

72
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:21,658
Are you playing
along too?

73
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:22,954
Playing along?

74
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:24,755
Chloe,
I planned it all.

75
00:06:26,563 --> 00:06:27,633
You brought us here?

76
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,233
Just because it's the
last day of school,

77
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:31,234
doesn't mean it
can't last forever.

78
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,011
Brendan,
you're not serious.

79
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,167
Why would you wanna
stay stuck in high school...

80
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:37,867
when there's so
much else out there.

81
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:40,225
I thought you of all
people would understand.

82
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:43,311
You're the editor
of the torch,

83
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:45,154
prom queen,

84
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:47,104
Chloe, you had
everything in high school.

85
00:06:47,743 --> 00:06:49,543
Once you leave, all
that's going to be left...

86
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:51,244
is a lifetime of
disappointments.

87
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:55,708
But not in here.

88
00:06:58,102 --> 00:06:58,802
Brendan,

89
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:00,203
you cannot keep
us here forever.

90
00:07:00,204 --> 00:07:01,130
You have
to move on.

91
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,130
To what?

92
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:02,858
Look Chloe,

93
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:05,261
some of us didn't get into
our dream colleges like you.

94
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:07,161
When you're staring at
a pile of rejection letters,

95
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:08,563
moving on really means...

96
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:10,563
working at a local video
store for the rest of your life.

97
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,283
Oh how can you
be sure the rest of us...

98
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:14,283
are going to go
along with this?

99
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,730
Wendell?

100
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:21,157
Wendell.

101
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:22,158
Come here.

102
00:07:23,782 --> 00:07:24,782
I said come here!

103
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,330
I didn't do anything,

104
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:29,331
I swear.

105
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:31,872
Chloe was just wondering
what happens...

106
00:07:31,873 --> 00:07:33,273
when we don't
play along...

107
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:34,447
No.

108
00:07:34,448 --> 00:07:35,448
No, please.

109
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:36,752
Wendell.

110
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:37,752
No I didn't...

111
00:07:55,902 --> 00:07:56,997
It's best
if you realize...

112
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:58,997
how much better off
you are here, Chloe

113
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:03,651
I'll save a seat
for you at lunch.

114
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:27,592
What do you think?

115
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:31,778
I think it's finally
starting to hit me.

116
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,145
It's truly over, isn't it?

117
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:37,706
You know I remember
walking through those doors...

118
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:38,907
the first day of
freshman year.

119
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:42,114
Actually,

120
00:08:42,114 --> 00:08:43,814
I think you tripped.

121
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:45,765
Well I couldn't help it,
you made me nervous.

122
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:47,763
It was cute.

123
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:50,756
Who knew you'd
turn into this...

124
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:52,057
big high school
football star.

125
00:08:52,885 --> 00:08:53,785
Former,

126
00:08:53,786 --> 00:08:54,786
football star...

127
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:58,186
who's gotten used
to seeing you...

128
00:08:58,186 --> 00:09:00,186
every morning
at the lockers.

129
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,408
But I guess that's
all going to change...

130
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,909
now that you're
going off to college.

131
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:08,032
Well, I don't know
if I'm going to go.

132
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:11,971
Really?

133
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:13,272
I mean,

134
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:15,345
what do you mean,

135
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,246
you're the one that's always
dreamt of leaving this town,

136
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:18,447
ever since you
were a little girl.

137
00:09:18,448 --> 00:09:19,448
I know,

138
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:22,138
it's just that right now
I feel I've been making...

139
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:22,984
that decision
because...

140
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:25,606
it's what everyone
expects us to do.

141
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,106
If I go, I want to
make that choice...

142
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:28,507
for the right reasons.

143
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:29,854
So you're staying.

144
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:30,854
In Smallville.

145
00:09:32,094 --> 00:09:33,094
I don't know.

146
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,784
I think it would
be really hard...

147
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,792
with all of you
guys gone.

148
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:38,792
Will not all of us
will be gone.

149
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:43,908
I'm thinking of commuting
to Central Kansas.

150
00:09:48,094 --> 00:09:49,394
Then maybe I won't have
to spend any more time...

151
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:51,095
trying to figure out
how to say goodbye.

152
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:55,564
Wendall Johnson!

153
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,830
Chloe Sullivan!

154
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,083
Haley Timmins!

155
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:02,388
Delia Watkins!

156
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:04,339
I would've thought Chloe
would be the first one in line.

157
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:09,503
LuthorCorp is the legal
conservator of the cave,

158
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:11,980
we can do any excavation
work we want down there.

159
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:14,681
I'll have to call
you back.

160
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,229
I thought we had
concluded our business.

161
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:33,475
Almost..

162
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:02,871
Clark was going to take
care of that tonight.

163
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:07,564
It's nothing I can't
handle by myself.

164
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,802
I know what you're
doing Jonathan.

165
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:12,623
You can't take the place
of Clark on this farm,

166
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:13,624
no one can.

167
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:15,758
Every other farm
in the county has...

168
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,847
at least five hands
to help out.

169
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:18,847
Sweetheart,

170
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:20,749
my family managed to run
this farm for generations...

171
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,450
before Clark
came around.

172
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:25,434
I see no reason why
I can't run it by myself.

173
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:31,186
Sometimes I wonder which
one of you is more stubborn.

174
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:34,668
Why don't
I give you a clue?

175
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:44,488
When are you going to
admit that the truth is...

176
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:46,687
you and I can't run
this place alone?

177
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,942
Martha, what exactly is it
that you want me to do?

178
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:53,462
You want me to tell
our teenage son...

179
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,614
that we can't possibly survive
around here without him?

180
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,799
What kind of parents
would that make us?

181
00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:01,337
Honest ones.

182
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,759
How many times
has he asked...

183
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,060
be treated like
it to an adult?

184
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:07,236
This decision took
a lot of maturity.

185
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:08,549
Or guilt.

186
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:12,285
Martha, Clark still
feels responsible...

187
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:13,886
for my heart
problems.

188
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,966
I'm not going to
allow him to do this...

189
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:16,721
out of pity.

190
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:18,021
It's not pity,
Jonathan.

191
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,339
Clark knows
that if he leaves...

192
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,840
he can only come back
a few times a year.

193
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:25,974
And he doesn't want
one of those times...

194
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:26,975
to be your funeral.

195
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,098
Chloe?

196
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:53,637
I don't know
if Met. U.'s ready...

197
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:54,638
for the wall of weird.

198
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:56,449
She didn't get the
Torch out today.

199
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,330
Maybe the printers
aren't working.

200
00:12:58,814 --> 00:12:59,814
No.

201
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:01,425
It's not even in
its final format.

202
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:02,579
There's no way
that Chloe would...

203
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:03,279
let the last day
of school...

204
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,779
go by without giving
her final word.

205
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,303
And when was the
last time that Chloe...

206
00:13:08,303 --> 00:13:09,003
pulled an all-nighter
with a deadline,

207
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:10,703
didn't finish her latte?

208
00:13:12,845 --> 00:13:13,945
Or leave without
her lifeline?

209
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:43,651
I guess I should have
trusted my instincts.

210
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,735
I knew you were
working with Jason.

211
00:13:49,085 --> 00:13:50,685
Judging from
the fact that...

212
00:13:50,886 --> 00:13:52,286
10 minutes ago
I lost all...

213
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:53,487
feeling in my hands,

214
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:55,188
you have
a very curious...

215
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:56,189
definition of...

216
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,490
collaboration, Lex.

217
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,263
Genevieve!

218
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:09,547
and the dutiful son.

219
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:13,473
The Oedipal bond
sure has a way of...

220
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,850
flourishing when it's fed,

221
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,550
doesn't it Lex?

222
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:21,644
Lionel,

223
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:23,445
the stones may be just
another hobby for you...

224
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,446
but I didn't search
all these years...

225
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,947
just to reach
a stalemate...

226
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:29,536
You're making a
big mistake Jason.

227
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:31,258
I know she's
your mother but...

228
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:33,259
don't think for a second
she won't turn on you.

229
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:35,616
Trust me on this one.

230
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,667
Jason.

231
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,168
It's okay mother.

232
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:41,455
I don't expect them
to understand...

233
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:42,704
the meaning of
family loyalty,

234
00:14:42,704 --> 00:14:44,296
especially when the
only thing running...

235
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:46,296
through the Luthor
blood is betrayal.

236
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:50,047
Now we want the
stone you stole from us.

237
00:14:51,354 --> 00:14:52,654
Yes Lex, your father

238
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:54,155
has one of the stones.

239
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:00,487
And what do you
want from me?

240
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:01,848
I have a feeling that
he'd sooner die...

241
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:04,248
than give up
that stone.

242
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,600
But all that
might change...

243
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,690
if his own flesh
and blood...

244
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:10,291
were at stake.

245
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:14,207
You obviously don't know
my father as well as I do.

246
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:25,297
I hope for your sake...

247
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:26,298
you're wrong.

248
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,319
I've got a couple
of cappuccinos...

249
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:33,512
and a double espresso.

250
00:15:34,713 --> 00:15:35,513
Where you're..

251
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:36,831
There we go.
Thank you.

252
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:41,688
I'm impressed,
"Smallville".

253
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:43,388
Of all the seniors
skipping...

254
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:44,336
the last day of school,

255
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:45,336
I didn't expect
to see you.

256
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,660
I'm on lunch break.

257
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:49,423
Right, right,

258
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:51,154
because why would
you do anything...

259
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:53,055
like any other normal
teenager in America.

260
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:56,539
The last day of school is
a "get out of jail free" card.

261
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,400
Even my best
employee Haley...

262
00:15:58,501 --> 00:15:59,501
flaked on her
morning shift.

263
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:01,302
I'm here looking for Chloe,
have you seen her?

264
00:16:01,603 --> 00:16:03,703
After my 2 A.M. java run
to the Torch last night...

265
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:05,304
so that she could
make her deadline.

266
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:06,700
I'm guessing she's
crashed out somewhere.

267
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,500
Lois, she never
published the last issue.

268
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:10,894
It's kind of why I think
something is going on.

269
00:16:10,894 --> 00:16:11,994
Um, Clark?

270
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:14,471
Could you sign
my yearbook?

271
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:15,918
Yeah!

272
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:24,607
Is this the girl who didn't
show up to work today?

273
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,930
"Most Likely to be a
Shark's Cheerleader"?

274
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:28,919
Yeah, that's our girl.

275
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,489
Thanks.

276
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:33,038
Listen,

277
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,539
Wendall, Haley,
Chloe, and Delia.

278
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,640
They didn't pick up their
graduation robes today.

279
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,716
Not your "Most Likely
to Ditch" crowd,

280
00:16:38,716 --> 00:16:39,641
you think something's
happened to them?

281
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:40,641
I don't know.

282
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,742
Anything seem weird last
night when you left Chloe?

283
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,194
No, she was just swarming
through a pile of photos...

284
00:16:45,195 --> 00:16:46,695
with some
photographer kid.

285
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:23,711
Hi.

286
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:24,712
Hey,

287
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:26,149
Didn't mean to
scare you there.

288
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,350
It's ok.

289
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:29,664
Just wondering if you'd
sign my yearbook actually.

290
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:32,279
Sure.

291
00:17:32,872 --> 00:17:35,272
"Most Likely to be
a Cover Girl".

292
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:37,667
I think the
photographer...

293
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,667
had something
to do with this!

294
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:41,196
Thanks.

295
00:17:41,196 --> 00:17:42,896
Of course a photograph
could never...

296
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:44,497
take the place of
the real thing, right?

297
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,610
Chloe,

298
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,110
You better
get to class.

299
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:07,411
The bells going
to ring soon.

300
00:18:08,177 --> 00:18:09,177
You don't want
to be late.

301
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:12,037
I'll be right there.

302
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:18,768
Brendan!

303
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:20,909
What are you
two talking about?

304
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:23,835
We were just planning
a study session...

305
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:25,835
for Mr. Kramer's quiz.

306
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,394
I have a
surprise for you.

307
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:54,016
If you ask me,

308
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:55,916
"Most Likely to be a Cover
Girl" is selling her short.

309
00:18:57,878 --> 00:18:59,178
But at least you'll have
a friend in here with you.

310
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:14,343
Chloe, what's
going on?

311
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:16,152
Chloe,

312
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:18,186
I'm going to let you
tell Lana the rules.

313
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:21,422
Okay!
Great!

314
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:27,012
How did I end up
back in school?

315
00:19:27,436 --> 00:19:29,236
Okay, don't wig out..

316
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:30,637
We're not in school.

317
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:33,633
Why are you
acting like this?

318
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,770
He's watching.

319
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:43,863
Brendan, A.K.A.,

320
00:19:45,377 --> 00:19:47,377
Mr. Medusa's touch,

321
00:19:47,743 --> 00:19:49,243
re-created this place.

322
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:51,243
It's kind of
like a cage.

323
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:53,951
Gives new meaning
to the phrase...

324
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:56,050
"capturing the
moment", doesn't it?

325
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,250
But how...

326
00:19:58,705 --> 00:19:59,905
The last thing
I remember...

327
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:01,706
is signing his yearbook.

328
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:12,174
Lana...

329
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,375
will you sign
my yearbook?

330
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:14,376
Okay.

331
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:15,723
Look at the names.

332
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,536
I seriously doubt it's
just a coincidence...

333
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:18,864
that the slumber
party's guest list...

334
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:22,003
is all on the "most
likely to... " page.

335
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:23,003
We have
been collected!

336
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:27,945
Hey guys!

337
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,569
I told Brendan you
had a crush on him...

338
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,770
like he wanted me to.

339
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,798
What are you
guys talking about?

340
00:20:36,498 --> 00:20:37,598
Brendan wants
high school?

341
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,341
We'll give him
high school.

342
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,150
Where is...

343
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,551
the stone?

344
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:06,633
God!

345
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,192
Lionel, Lex is your son.

346
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:11,194
And despite what you
want him to believe,

347
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:13,395
I know you don't want
to watch him die.

348
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,076
Jason, darling...

349
00:21:31,852 --> 00:21:33,152
Oh, God!

350
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,933
Stop!
Stop it!

351
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:45,396
Where is it?

352
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:46,665
I gave it to Lana!

353
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,279
Lana doesn't know
anything about this.

354
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:50,716
You wouldn't have trusted
anything that valuable to her.

355
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:51,916
I gave it to her for
the same reason...

356
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:53,617
that I gave her that
map to the temple.

357
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:55,462
She is the chosen one,
and we all know that!

358
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:00,126
Jason...

359
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:03,015
I'll take care of Lana.

360
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:09,072
You promised me
you wouldn't hurt her.

361
00:22:09,514 --> 00:22:11,214
Has she ever
shown any gratitude?

362
00:22:12,512 --> 00:22:14,356
Lana has no idea
how much...

363
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:15,950
you've been
protecting her.

364
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,950
And for what?

365
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:20,195
For her to choose
Clark over you?

366
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:26,888
You know,

367
00:22:27,124 --> 00:22:29,624
I would never betray
you the way she has.

368
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:43,815
I wouldn't underestimate
her, Genevieve.

369
00:22:44,744 --> 00:22:46,344
Don't forget...

370
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:47,745
Lana Lang's ancestor...

371
00:22:47,874 --> 00:22:50,474
pledged that she would
revenge your family.

372
00:22:52,774 --> 00:22:54,774
I would leave folklore in the
past if I were you, Lionel.

373
00:22:56,788 --> 00:22:59,288
My ancestors burn
traitors at the stake.

374
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,030
Let's hope you're
not one of them.

375
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:17,921
Brendan?

376
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,690
He's got to be in here,

377
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:20,686
it's like his
second home.

378
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:23,021
Just like Chloe should
be at the Torch.

379
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:25,209
This whole
"10 Little Indians" thing,

380
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,910
it's starting to
give me the creeps.

381
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:29,788
Popular guy.

382
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:31,189
Cheerleaders,

383
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,661
alternate girls,

384
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:34,406
jocks.

385
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:35,994
Brendan knows
everyone.

386
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,240
It's sort of like
your fast track...

387
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:39,441
to the front page
of the torch.

388
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:44,449
That's a little
"Norman Bates".

389
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,709
It's everyone from the
"Most Likely... " list.

390
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:56,431
Lana?

391
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:57,852
Oh God, do you
think they're...?

392
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,853
No!

393
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,488
It seems more
like a collection,

394
00:24:01,488 --> 00:24:03,488
like he's keeping
them somewhere.

395
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:09,039
Lois, check this out.

396
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:10,937
Oh,

397
00:24:10,938 --> 00:24:11,938
thanks Clark.

398
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:20,408
It's like they're his paper
dolls, or something.

399
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:23,742
Except these
blueprints are to scale.

400
00:24:26,276 --> 00:24:28,376
Must have rebuilt this part
of the school somewhere.

401
00:24:29,523 --> 00:24:30,723
Nash Construction.

402
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:39,809
Hey!

403
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,828
It's amazing how
much material...

404
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,837
we have for tomorrow's
issue already.

405
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:44,538
Well,

406
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:46,000
I want to make sure you
have some great shots...

407
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,500
to work with.

408
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:49,366
You know,

409
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,880
it's funny.

410
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,481
Four years in
school together,

411
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:54,682
and I had no idea...

412
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:56,283
that you and Haley
were such good friends.

413
00:24:57,024 --> 00:24:58,224
Why?

414
00:24:58,225 --> 00:24:59,225
What did she tell you?

415
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:01,389
Nothing I didn't
suspect already.

416
00:25:03,357 --> 00:25:04,357
You know,

417
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:05,958
the more I
think about it,

418
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:07,087
the more I
can't believe...

419
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,888
you re-created
this whole place...

420
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:09,930
for all of us.

421
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:11,428
After I got those
rejection letters,

422
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:14,546
I realized I spend
so much time...

423
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,646
proving myself
in the end...

424
00:25:16,898 --> 00:25:18,898
and none of it
mattered on the outside.

425
00:25:19,332 --> 00:25:21,932
And we have to do
it all again if we left.

426
00:25:22,976 --> 00:25:24,176
So,

427
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:25,177
how'd you do it?

428
00:25:25,905 --> 00:25:27,205
I told my dad...

429
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:28,363
if he didn't do it,

430
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:30,164
I turned my own
annoying step-monster...

431
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:32,264
into his own
personal mannequin.

432
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:35,279
You should have seen
the look on her face,

433
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,680
it was just...

434
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:45,018
Let's go.

435
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:49,161
Please, get us
out of here!

436
00:26:03,114 --> 00:26:04,814
You shouldn't have tried
to get away, Haley.

437
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,198
I thought you felt
the same way...

438
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,349
I did about
our future.

439
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:18,249
Brendan, you can't
keep us here forever.

440
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,413
You have to let us go.

441
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:20,813
I don't think you
really want that.

442
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:23,618
I know you'll
like it here.

443
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:25,475
Or you'll end up like
your friend Haley.

444
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:47,425
I don't blame you for getting
caught up in all this Jason.

445
00:26:49,214 --> 00:26:50,914
Your mother...

446
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:53,215
she's a difficult
woman to resist.

447
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,580
Though you were
suppose to...

448
00:26:58,281 --> 00:27:00,182
get close to
Lana but..

449
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,579
What happened,
did you...

450
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,080
stray a little too far from
those apron strings?

451
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:15,024
You know, with
all your resources,

452
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:18,025
would've thought by now
you'd know that Lana...

453
00:27:18,026 --> 00:27:19,826
is nothing more than
my mother's pawn.

454
00:27:19,827 --> 00:27:20,827
Pawn?

455
00:27:21,164 --> 00:27:22,364
Well that's true but,

456
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:24,465
upon you fell
in love with.

457
00:27:25,684 --> 00:27:26,884
It must be killing
you that you've...

458
00:27:27,085 --> 00:27:28,885
sacrificed...

459
00:27:29,103 --> 00:27:30,203
your feelings for Lana...

460
00:27:30,204 --> 00:27:32,204
in exchange for some...

461
00:27:32,905 --> 00:27:34,105
maternal warmth...

462
00:27:36,305 --> 00:27:37,905
it seems you
can't do without.

463
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,520
Makes us look like the
Waltons, doesn't it?

464
00:27:57,274 --> 00:27:59,074
I'm sorry..

465
00:27:59,175 --> 00:28:00,775
Lex, I got you
involved in all this.

466
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,746
You may not
believe me but I,

467
00:28:03,747 --> 00:28:05,947
truly wish I were
here alone.

468
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:08,187
To be honest dad,

469
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,560
I'm glad you're
here with me.

470
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:13,699
Now knock that
iron out of the fire,

471
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
and get it as close to
my chair as you can.

472
00:29:25,236 --> 00:29:26,436
We have to split up.

473
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:28,779
Go!

474
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,570
Wait Lex,

475
00:30:33,571 --> 00:30:34,571
don't do this,
don't do this!

476
00:30:35,121 --> 00:30:36,621
Come on,
look at me.

477
00:30:36,722 --> 00:30:37,822
You and I, we're
not that different.

478
00:30:37,823 --> 00:30:39,059
It was never about
you and me,

479
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:39,824
it was about our
parents, please!

480
00:30:39,824 --> 00:30:40,544
Lex please!

481
00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:42,400
I always knew I had to
protect Lana from you!

482
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:43,438
But not as much as
you've been protecting...

483
00:30:43,438 --> 00:30:44,792
your best friend, huh?

484
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:45,792
Ah.. Clark?

485
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,728
Clark doesn't have
anything to do with this!

486
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:50,274
Oh you don't
believe that.

487
00:30:50,275 --> 00:30:52,275
Clark's more connected
to this than any of us.

488
00:30:52,581 --> 00:30:54,381
You just choose to ignore it.
I mean, think about it...

489
00:30:54,382 --> 00:30:56,382
the symbols burned
into the kid's barn?

490
00:30:56,383 --> 00:30:57,383
The fields?

491
00:30:59,053 --> 00:31:00,120
It's a little late and
obvious to the...

492
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,072
shifting the blame
in the 11th hour.

493
00:31:02,072 --> 00:31:04,272
Why can't you see what's
right in front of your face, Lex?

494
00:31:05,312 --> 00:31:06,112
It's Clark.

495
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:07,113
He's..

496
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
He was...

497
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:32,661
about to kill you, Lex.

498
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:37,251
Or divulge something...

499
00:31:37,252 --> 00:31:38,852
you didn't want
me to know.

500
00:31:39,674 --> 00:31:41,374
Lex, you saved my
life back there.

501
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:44,692
I was returning
the favor son.

502
00:31:45,252 --> 00:31:46,252
I had no choice.

503
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,471
I know you
have the stone.

504
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:51,858
If anything
happens to Lana...

505
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:55,473
you'll be begging for
an end like that.

506
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:11,922
How cliché,

507
00:32:11,923 --> 00:32:13,323
an abandoned
warehouse.

508
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:16,487
Oh great.

509
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:21,786
You know maybe
there's another way in...

510
00:32:21,786 --> 00:32:23,123
around the corner.

511
00:32:23,123 --> 00:32:24,323
Why don't
you go check,

512
00:32:24,324 --> 00:32:25,624
I'll see if I can find
the key for this lock.

513
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:26,697
Keys?

514
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:29,197
I highly doubt they're under
the welcome that, but...

515
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,950
you knock
yourself out.

516
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
Chloe.

517
00:33:41,863 --> 00:33:43,063
Chloe?

518
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:31,033
Brendan.

519
00:34:32,347 --> 00:34:33,282
You have to
release everybody.

520
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:35,882
I wanted you to be
a part of all this Clark.

521
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,089
But you guys...

522
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,090
you guys had no
right coming here!

523
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:41,768
You have to
let them go.

524
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:43,369
Things change.

525
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,170
No matter how much
we don't want them to.

526
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,500
We can't live in
high school forever.

527
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:49,247
You don't really
want that.

528
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:51,657
Clark...

529
00:34:52,033 --> 00:34:53,133
think about it.

530
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:55,787
She could stay
like this forever.

531
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,760
Always be with you.

532
00:34:58,116 --> 00:35:00,216
You wouldn't be afraid
if she ever left you.

533
00:35:00,404 --> 00:35:01,704
I'm not afraid of
that, Brendan.

534
00:35:02,005 --> 00:35:03,667
You should be.

535
00:35:04,219 --> 00:35:05,719
She'll leave you, Clark.

536
00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:07,892
She might never
come back.

537
00:35:08,762 --> 00:35:10,262
If you really
care about her,

538
00:35:12,315 --> 00:35:14,115
you'll do anything you
can to keep her.

539
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:16,681
Let her go!

540
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:22,436
What's...
happening...?

541
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:26,542
No! Just...
stop!

542
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:29,387
They're going
to find out...

543
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:31,088
what it's like to
lose someone...

544
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:32,689
forever.

545
00:35:35,075 --> 00:35:36,075
No!

546
00:35:59,402 --> 00:36:00,602
Clark...

547
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:11,912
Lois!

548
00:36:11,913 --> 00:36:12,913
Hey.

549
00:36:12,914 --> 00:36:13,914
My God...

550
00:36:40,353 --> 00:36:42,253
Wow, I haven't
seen you use that...

551
00:36:42,254 --> 00:36:43,854
thing in a long time,

552
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:45,807
I thought maybe
you'd outgrown it.

553
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:48,852
Dad I think..

554
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:49,853
I think..

555
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,083
Clark...

556
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,435
The time comes in
everybody's life...

557
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:01,340
when they realize...

558
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,758
their parents aren't going
to be around forever.

559
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:04,650
Dad, I...

560
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,950
Clark, I just..

561
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:09,774
I just don't want you
sacrificing your potential...

562
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:10,575
because of me.

563
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:12,176
It's not a
sacrifice dad,

564
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:14,005
it's a choice.

565
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,170
It's a really fine line,
don't you think?

566
00:37:23,728 --> 00:37:26,228
Dad, I get the feeling we
could talk about this all night,

567
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:27,229
and you're still not
going to understand.

568
00:37:28,353 --> 00:37:30,153
Oh, I understand a whole
lot more than you think.

569
00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:31,025
Right.

570
00:37:31,025 --> 00:37:32,725
That's why you came up
here to change my mind.

571
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,369
Dad, you raised me to
make my own decisions.

572
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,970
Why don't you
trust me on this?

573
00:37:43,497 --> 00:37:44,797
Because you are
a lot like me.

574
00:37:45,535 --> 00:37:47,428
I have a full ride
to Met. U. waiting...

575
00:37:47,428 --> 00:37:49,641
for me when
I graduated.

576
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:52,441
Problem is, my father
needed me on this farm.

577
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,150
So I stayed.

578
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:03,362
Dad that's a pretty big
footnote to leave out.

579
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:05,382
Why didn't
you tell me?

580
00:38:07,296 --> 00:38:08,796
I didn't want it
to weigh you down.

581
00:38:12,842 --> 00:38:15,442
As much as I loved
my father, I..

582
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,427
a part of me still resents him
for needing me that much.

583
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:22,145
I don't want you
to feel that.

584
00:38:22,283 --> 00:38:23,883
That's not the
kind of father I..

585
00:38:25,198 --> 00:38:26,298
I ever wanted to be.

586
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:35,705
Dad.

587
00:38:38,611 --> 00:38:40,611
This isn't about the
kind of father you are.

588
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,524
It's about the kind of
son I want to be.

589
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:12,546
Hey.

590
00:40:13,947 --> 00:40:14,947
Thank you.

591
00:40:16,272 --> 00:40:17,572
So I guess this
is it, huh?

592
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:22,869
It's not like we're never going
to see each other, right?

593
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:26,593
Yeah, you'll have..
summers and holidays.

594
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,085
This sucks!

595
00:40:32,992 --> 00:40:33,992
Big time.

596
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:37,584
Suddenly, all those tests
and teachers we hated.

597
00:40:37,785 --> 00:40:39,417
Seem a lot less scary than
the big question mark...

598
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,417
that's hanging out there.

599
00:40:44,028 --> 00:40:45,628
You'd think after everything
that happened to Brendan,

600
00:40:45,629 --> 00:40:48,529
it'd be a whole lot easier
to say goodbye to all this.

601
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:50,914
There's a lot here
to say goodbye to.

602
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:54,798
You know, not to go all
"psycho-sympathizer" guys,

603
00:40:54,798 --> 00:40:55,498
but I...

604
00:40:55,498 --> 00:40:57,031
can't blame Brendan
for wanting...

605
00:40:57,031 --> 00:40:58,676
to keep
everybody together.

606
00:40:58,676 --> 00:41:01,576
Although, after
that little lock-in...

607
00:41:01,577 --> 00:41:02,597
I can't think of
anything scarier...

608
00:41:02,597 --> 00:41:03,678
than being stuck
in the past...

609
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:04,678
and not moving on.

610
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,330
Wait a minute, Lana...

611
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:15,631
Did you say I'll have
summers and holidays?

612
00:41:16,104 --> 00:41:17,374
What about you?

613
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,574
I'm staying
in Smallville.

614
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,704
I thought you said
you weren't sure.

615
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:27,084
Don't you wanna see
what else is out there?

616
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,120
Well that's exactly why
I went to Paris last year,

617
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:31,121
but...

618
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,922
there's a reason that
I was drawn back home.

619
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,867
I'm just not sure that I've
explored all the possibilities...

620
00:41:37,868 --> 00:41:38,868
here.

621
00:41:53,205 --> 00:41:55,005
Maybe things won't
change much after all...
