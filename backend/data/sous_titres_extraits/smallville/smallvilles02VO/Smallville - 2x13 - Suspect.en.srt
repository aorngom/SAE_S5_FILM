1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,440
That which is done out of love
always takes place beyond good and evil.

2
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,880
Yeah. Have my helicopter ready
first thing in the morning.

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm going back to Metropolis.

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,400
No, no, I'll be alone. I suspect...

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,480
...Martha Kent is no longer
in my employ.

6
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,200
Who's there?

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,400
If this is someone's idea of a joke,
I'm not amused.

8
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,760
Is that you?

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Didn't I make it clear,
the conversation is over.

10
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,720
Jonathan Kent...

11
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,400
...put the gun down
and step out of the truck.

12
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,760
Keep your hands where I can see them.

13
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,440
Drop it.

14
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,400
Away from the vehicle, sir.

15
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Away from the vehicle!

16
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,600
Everything's gonna be fine. Just keep
your hands where we can see them.

17
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,680
Ethan.

18
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,600
- What's going on?
- Jonathan...

19
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,240
...as a friend, don't say another word
until you get yourself a lawyer.

20
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,080
You have the right to remain silent
and refuse to answer questions.

21
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,040
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

22
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,320
You have the right to consult an attorney
and to have an attorney present...

23
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,960
Dad, how are you doing?

24
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,280
I'm fine, other than a splitting headache.

25
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,320
Any word on how Lionel Luthor's doing?

26
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,080
He was rushed into surgery, Jonathan.
He may not make it.

27
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,960
How about the gun they found
in my truck?

28
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,800
The police are testing it now.
It's the same caliber Lionel was shot with.

29
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,120
Clark, that was not my gun.

30
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,720
I have no idea how it wound up
in my hands.

31
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,040
- Dad, what happened last night?
- Well, I was out running some errands.

32
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,520
I stopped by the Wild Coyote for a beer.

33
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,240
When I got in my truck,
everything started to go woozy on me.

34
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,400
How many did you have?

35
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,200
Martha, I had half a beer.

36
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,360
I promise, but...

37
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,960
...next thing I know, I'm out on the side
of Highway 91. I got...

38
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,880
...the police spotlight shining
in my face, it's raining.

39
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,280
We need to get a lawyer. I'm gonna call
my father and ask him to take your case.

40
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,320
Martha, that man has never believed
in me before. I don't see why...

41
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,440
...an attempted-murder charge
is gonna change that.

42
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,920
Well, Lana told me Henry Small
used to be a criminal attorney.

43
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,400
Well, he certainly wouldn't be
intimidated by the Luthors.

44
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,440
Sorry, Martha, but you and Clark
are gonna have to leave now.

45
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,800
Dad, no matter what it takes,
I'm gonna find out who did this.

46
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,280
Yeah.

47
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,120
I just got in from Metropolis.
Where is he?

48
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,400
In surgery. He's still in critical condition.

49
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,640
If the downstairs maid hadn't been
awakened by the shot, he'd be dead.

50
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,320
I want round-the-clock security.
Whoever shot him might still be out there.

51
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,320
You can save the concerned-son routine,
Lex. I have everything under control.

52
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,160
The loyal dog sitting watch at master's
door, secretly hoping he doesn't make it?

53
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,600
As I recall, you almost let him die once.

54
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,120
Who's to say you didn't
try to finish the job?

55
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,080
God knows, after yesterday...

56
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,640
...you'd have enough reason
to want him dead.

57
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,520
You know what I find so amusing, is you
believe my father is grooming you.

58
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,480
It's unfortunate that they already
have a suspect in custody.

59
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,680
I can't think of a person with a better
motive for killing your father than you.

60
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,600
I'm sorry about your father, Clark,
but I'm afraid I can't represent him.

61
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,720
I don't understand. Why?

62
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,160
I'm not the right man for this case.

63
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,400
From everything I know about you,
you're perfect for this case.

64
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,200
- I can make some referrals.
- They don't need a list of names.

65
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,080
They need someone they can trust.

66
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,040
I'm sorry, Lana.

67
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,720
My decision's final.

68
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,680
Just when I thought I was
getting to know him.

69
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,120
Looks like we need
to find another lawyer.

70
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,760
Clark...

71
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,360
...there's something I have to tell you.

72
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,000
I went by the mansion yesterday...

73
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,520
...to drop off the Talon's
quarterly tax bills, and...

74
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,440
...your dad was there.

75
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,600
What was he doing?

76
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,720
Yelling at Lionel Luthor.

77
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,240
No, I want you out of our lives,
once and for all.

78
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,480
You're jumping to conclusions, Mr. Kent.
It was simply a token of appreciation.

79
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,600
I think it was quite a bit more than that.

80
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,560
It's all relative, isn't it?

81
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,400
I mean, a Roger Dubuis watch
from me is equivalent...

82
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,800
...to a Whitman's Sampler from you.

83
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
Condescending son of a...

84
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,400
The worst thing that happened
to my family...

85
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,080
...was getting involved with yours.

86
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,280
I seem to recall that the benefits
to our families were mutual.

87
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,160
Are you forgetting the circumstances
of Clark's adoption?

88
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,280
You poison everything you touch.

89
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,880
This town would be better off
if you weren't in it.

90
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,520
But you're as much to blame for that
as I am, aren't you?

91
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,680
Martha was worried about that.

92
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,640
She thought you wouldn't be big enough
to let her live her own life.

93
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,880
You stay away from Martha...

94
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,840
...or I promise you, you will regret it.

95
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,080
He threatened him, Clark.

96
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
My dad told me he was running errands.
Why would he lie to me?

97
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,000
Look, the sheriff came by earlier...

98
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,720
...I told him what I just told you.

99
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,760
I didn't want to, but I couldn't lie.

100
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,880
It's okay. I mean, you know my dad
would never try to kill anybody.

101
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,400
Right?

102
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,960
He was angry, Clark, but I know him.
And there's no way.

103
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,160
Thanks.

104
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,600
Mom?

105
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,560
What's going on?

106
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,840
They have a search warrant.

107
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,920
- Martha, can I have a word with you?
- Yeah.

108
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,560
Found this watch on your bedroom floor.
Is it yours?

109
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,240
It was a gift.

110
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,680
From who?

111
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,720
Lionel Luthor.

112
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,040
"To Martha,
with deepest affection, L.L."

113
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,840
I was gonna give it back.

114
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
I knew if Jonathan saw it,
he would be furious...

115
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,080
...so I hid it in my dresser.
- Well, looks like he found it.

116
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,600
Ethan, you've known Jonathan
since high school.

117
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,400
I can't let my friendship
interfere with my job.

118
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,880
- You gotta admit, this looks like motive.
- He found a watch and smashed it.

119
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,520
That doesn't mean he's a killer.

120
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,560
He also had an argument
with Lionel yesterday.

121
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,600
- What?
- Yeah.

122
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,240
Lana was there. She saw it.

123
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,440
It was so heated, Lionel's assistant
called getting a restraining order.

124
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,280
Way I figure, he was still hot under the
collar when he got to the Wild Coyote.

125
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,280
Bartender told me he got pretty drunk.

126
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,560
Hey, Mike...

127
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,440
...why don't you give me a double shot
of that tequila?

128
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,400
Wait a minute, Dad said
he only had one beer.

129
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,120
I administered his blood-alcohol
test myself, son.

130
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,360
He was at 2.0.

131
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,920
That's quite a bit more than one beer.

132
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,200
From the sound of things,
he was really spoiling for a fight.

133
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,480
Lionel Luthor's a lying, miserable
son of a bitch.

134
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,280
You won't get any arguments here.

135
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,280
- Again.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

136
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,320
All right, then why don't you
sell me the whole bottle.

137
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,880
- I'm not supposed to do that, Jonathan.
- Come on, Mike.

138
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,280
I know we've been friends a long time.

139
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,120
Nobody's gonna know.

140
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,600
Is that you?

141
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,400
Didn't I make it clear?
The conversation is over.

142
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,640
We have eyewitnesses...

143
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,200
...who saw Jonathan's truck leaving
the mansion after they heard gunshots.

144
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,360
Forensics found powder residue
on Jonathan's hand.

145
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,400
I wish there were another explanation.

146
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,120
But now he's our only suspect.

147
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,920
What exactly are we looking for?

148
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,760
The police already checked
this whole area.

149
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,600
Yeah, we have an advantage they don't.

150
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,800
Are you doing the eye thing?

151
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,280
Hey, I need you to check
my back yard sometime.

152
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,760
I buried a jar of quarters when I was 10.
Never could find it.

153
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,680
They found my dad's truck
right about here.

154
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,800
Did you find something?

155
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,440
Yeah, it's a bullet.

156
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,120
We need to get the sheriff
out here to dig it out.

157
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,520
I don't mean to rain on
your CSI parade...

158
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,600
...but the only thing that proves
is that somebody shot a shed.

159
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,120
The sheriff said he found powder residue
on my dad's hand.

160
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,680
My dad said he'd never
seen that gun before.

161
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,800
So? What does that mean?

162
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,520
Whoever shot Lionel drugged my dad
and followed him until he pulled over.

163
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,120
If that bullet came from the gun
that shot Lionel...

164
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,840
...maybe we can convince the police
that my dad is being framed.

165
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,000
Even though we removed the bullet,
kidney damage slowed his metabolism.

166
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,880
He's in a coma.

167
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,280
What are his chances?

168
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,640
His higher brain functions
are shutting down.

169
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,920
If he doesn't regain consciousness
in the next 24 hours...

170
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,080
...he won't make it. I'm sorry.

171
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,760
Sheriff Ethan...

172
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,320
...can I talk to you for a minute?
- Excuse me, sheriff.

173
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,440
What is it, Clark?

174
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,720
I found a bullet in the shack
where you arrested my father.

175
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,200
My men went over that area
with a microscope.

176
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,120
Well, they must have missed it.

177
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,800
Someone put that gun in my dad's hand
and fired it.

178
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,920
Or he squeezed off a round while he was
parked there drinking...

179
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,120
...or it could be from a different weapon.

180
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,520
Whoever's trying to set up my dad
doesn't want you to find that bullet.

181
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,400
I don't know what it'll prove,
but I'll have it tested.

182
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,480
Sheriff, I was wondering
if we could talk.

183
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,400
My name's Dominic Santori.
I work for Lionel Luthor.

184
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,000
- Clark, would you excuse us?
- It's okay. He can stay.

185
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,160
I don't think his father shot Mr. Luthor.

186
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,400
But I'm pretty sure I know who did.

187
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,360
All right, Lex...

188
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,920
...what's so urgent that you insisted
I fly in for a face-to-face.

189
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,200
I'm missing Domingo's La Bohème.

190
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,840
Well, consider this a curtain call
on our own private opera, Dad.

191
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,000
Would you ask your Seeing Eye dog
to wait outside?

192
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,520
Anything you have to say,
you can say in front of Dominic.

193
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,480
A representative from
an offshore shell company...

194
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,880
...who bears an uncanny resemblance
to Mr. Santori here...

195
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,880
...has been quietly approaching LexCorp
employees and buying their voting shares.

196
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,120
Is that so?

197
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,200
I was under the impression
they had no intention of selling.

198
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,640
What'd you get on them?

199
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,600
Now, now, Lex, don't be a sore loser.

200
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,320
I'm just realigning your priorities.

201
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,080
Your attempt to build LexCorp
was at the expense of our mutual goals.

202
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,640
The only thing we share
is a mutual enmity.

203
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,120
This father-son reconciliation act was just
a smoke screen to buy out my company.

204
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,400
If you were ready to run LexCorp, there's
no way I could have taken it from you.

205
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,120
Look at this as an opportunity for us
to work together again, father and son.

206
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,240
When I broke away, I swore I'd
never be under your thumb again.

207
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,840
It was my hope that you'll stay
and rise to the challenge.

208
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,920
Your ego wouldn't allow it.

209
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,000
I'll fight you on this, and I'll win.

210
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,680
You better have something stronger
than words to back up those threats...

211
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,560
...because as of this moment,
you are just another employee.

212
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,000
All Lex had to do
was wait until Lionel was alone.

213
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,880
Didn't I make it clear?
The conversation is over.

214
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,640
After he shot him,
Lex could have framed Mr. Kent.

215
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,640
And then he drove his girlfriend
to Metropolis, a convenient alibi.

216
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,360
Thank you, Mr. Santori.
I'll certainly look into that.

217
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,560
Excuse me.

218
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,560
I know Lex and his dad have problems,
but it's hard to believe he'd do that.

219
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,520
Face it, Clark, in your heart...

220
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,680
...you've always known
what Lex is capable of.

221
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,320
Hey.

222
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,080
Are you okay?

223
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,320
Sometimes being an objective journalist
really sucks.

224
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,640
I can imagine.

225
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,400
I still can't believe
Henry didn't take Mr. Kent's case.

226
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,600
Okay, usually when I do this,
people seem to get really mad at me.

227
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,600
But I found it odd that your dad passed
up an opportunity to take on a Luthor...

228
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,280
...so I ran a search on his legal history.

229
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,280
And since you don't seem to be
freaking out, I guess I should continue?

230
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,600
If it helps explain why he won't
defend Mr. Kent, then I wanna know.

231
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,000
Okay, it turns out that Mr. Small was a
top white-collar criminal defense lawyer.

232
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,040
He and his firm did a lot of business
with, surprise, surprise, LuthorCorp.

233
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,600
Maybe he considered the Kent case
a conflict of interest.

234
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,440
As opposed to all the other times
he's taken on Lionel and his buddies?

235
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,520
This is interesting, though.

236
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,320
LuthorCorp filed a complaint against
Henry Small...

237
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,360
...that got him fired from his firm.

238
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,000
Okay, so that explains why
he might hate the Luthors...

239
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,600
...but it doesn't explain
why he won't take the case.

240
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,840
You know, Lana, my computer
only spits out cold, hard facts.

241
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,960
If you want explanations,
you're gonna have to go to the source.

242
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,280
I understand.

243
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,800
Very well, doctor, keep me posted.

244
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,120
Dominic told me you got in a fight
with your father before he got shot.

245
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,080
Why didn't you tell the police?

246
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,680
So now you're implying I
pulled the trigger?

247
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,520
It's not like I haven't seen you
shoot someone before.

248
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,640
Get out of here before you
say something you'll regret.

249
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,400
I'm not going anywhere,
not until I get some answers.

250
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,240
Are you trying to frame my dad?

251
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,680
After all this time, I thought you knew me
better than the average tabloid reader.

252
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,480
If you don't start trusting me,
what else am I to think?

253
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,200
Stay out of it, Clark.

254
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,400
- My dad's life is at stake here.
- So is my father's!

255
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,400
Goodbye, Clark.

256
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,320
Sweetheart...

257
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,000
...how are you holding up?

258
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,160
You know, it's funny
how being locked up can...

259
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,400
...give you time to reflect
on all the mistakes you've made.

260
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Why didn't you tell me
you had a fight with Lionel?

261
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,120
- Because I was angry.
- At me?

262
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,800
No, at myself.

263
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,080
I was jealous.

264
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,600
When I found that watch...

265
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,480
...it reminded me of all the things
I couldn't give you.

266
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,520
For the first time,
it felt like I was losing you.

267
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,440
Martha, I am so sorry.

268
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,320
For what?

269
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,040
I'm sorry for not having faith in us.

270
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,160
I'm sorry for giving in to
my own petty fears.

271
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,800
And all it takes is one...

272
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,720
...reckless moment to ruin everything.

273
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,680
Jonathan, you didn't shoot Lionel.

274
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,000
No, I didn't shoot Lionel.

275
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,040
But I...

276
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,600
I let my anger get the best of me.

277
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,200
I haven't exactly kept it a secret how
Jonathan Kent feels about the Luthors.

278
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,240
What jury could possibly
believe me now?

279
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,480
I know this place.

280
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,400
My brother came here all the time.
Word was they never checked IDs.

281
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,920
How'd they keep it open?

282
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,320
Good luck.

283
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,880
Connections.

284
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,880
Well, if someone did drug my dad, this
would have been the only place to do it.

285
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,440
I don't know what you kids heard,
but we don't serve minors in here.

286
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,440
I just want to ask a few questions.
My name's Clark Kent, Jonathan's son.

287
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,160
Jonathan.

288
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,000
Listen, I'm sorry about what happened.

289
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,200
Do you remember if he was
talking to anyone the other night?

290
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,240
He was talking to everybody,
blowing off steam.

291
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,840
Sounded like he had a major run-in
with Lionel Luthor.

292
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,440
Sheriff said he bought
a bottle of tequila from you.

293
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,160
Yeah, I wish I hadn't done it now.

294
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,680
The cops want me to testify.

295
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,040
I could lose my liquor license.

296
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,160
He never drinks more than two beers.
Did someone put something in his drink?

297
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,280
Nobody had to put anything in his drink
the way he was knocking them back.

298
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,400
Listen, I know you don't
wanna hear this...

299
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,000
...but Jonathan said he was gonna
take care of Lionel, once and for all.

300
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,720
- He'd never say that.
- I've known him since high school.

301
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,560
He's always had a temper.

302
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,960
There's no doubt in my mind he did it.

303
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,400
You're just as bad as your old man.

304
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,200
Clark, let him go, man.

305
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,240
Clark, let him go! Be cool.

306
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,320
The guy's lying. He's involved. I think
he's the one who spiked my dad's drink.

307
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,920
Clark, look, I'm on your side...

308
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,520
...but putting a bartender through
spin cycle isn't the thing to do now.

309
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,680
I know. I'm sorry.

310
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,000
Pete, look out!

311
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,600
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

312
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,640
But you must have definitely
ticked someone off.

313
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,760
Clark, I heard you had a narrow escape.

314
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,200
What do you care?

315
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,800
I think this may be connected
to my father's shooting.

316
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,200
- I warned you to stay out of this, Clark.
- Why?

317
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,280
- To control the situation?
- I'm not controlling anything.

318
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,320
I don't know who to believe anymore.

319
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,640
- Dominic made quite an impression.
- This isn't about Dominic.

320
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,000
He's asked the hospital staff
to keep me away from my father.

321
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,680
- Why do you think that is?
- Probably to protect him.

322
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,240
Or himself.

323
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,800
If my father regains consciousness,
he may be able to identify who shot him.

324
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,680
You think Dominic's involved?

325
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,880
Why would he turn against Lionel?

326
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,640
Because the decision to buy out LexCorp
affects him as much as it does me.

327
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,480
- Something stronger than words
to back up those threats, son...

328
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,080
...because as of this moment,
you are just another employee.

329
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,800
I'm going to Metropolis.

330
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,360
When I get back, I want you gone.

331
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,760
You never told me you wanted Lex back.

332
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,480
I thought it was assumed.

333
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,880
I care about this company. I can't
believe you're giving Lex another chance.

334
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,040
I gave Lex a taste of independence...

335
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,720
...to demonstrate the futility
of working against me.

336
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,200
But I always intended to bring him
back into the fold.

337
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,880
You made promises to me,
promises that I expect you to keep.

338
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,120
You've been loyal, Dominic...

339
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,120
...but Lex is blood.

340
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,120
I've worked too long to let you
take everything away from me now.

341
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,440
I forgot my keys.

342
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,920
He was angry enough
to shoot your father?

343
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,000
Seizing the reins of a billion-dollar
corporation is a powerful incentive.

344
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,320
All he needed was
someone to take the blame.

345
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,520
Why didn't you tell anyone about this?

346
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,000
My father was shot the same day he
bought my company out from under me.

347
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,760
While you were playing it close
to the vest, my father was in jail.

348
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,560
- How long would you let him stay there?
- Until I knew for sure he didn't do it.

349
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,000
Now I do.

350
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,480
Look, the shooting is related
to the buyout.

351
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,160
I needed the guilty party
to make a mistake.

352
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,760
Like trying to kill me and Pete?

353
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,440
So, what now?

354
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,640
Lana...

355
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,320
...I got your message.
What's the urgency?

356
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,880
I know about the complaint
Lionel Luthor filed against you.

357
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,960
Have you been snooping into my past?

358
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,400
I was curious to find out why you
wouldn't help one of my closest friends.

359
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,360
And that gives you the right to pry?

360
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,360
I'm your daughter. If we're gonna have
more than the same DNA in common...

361
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,560
...we have to be honest with each other.
- I didn't ask you to barge into my life.

362
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,320
Don't worry. You know,
I won't be imposing on you again.

363
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,560
- Lionel Luthor has nothing to do with this.
- I saw the complaint.

364
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:56,240
Payback after I refused to go along with
one of his ethically dubious schemes.

365
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,080
Business as usual for LuthorCorp.

366
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,440
You should have kept on digging.

367
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,560
And what would I have found?

368
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,360
Kansas v. Sutton,
a murder trial back in the early '90s.

369
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,000
I don't understand.

370
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,440
I was defense counsel, court-appointed,
which meant I didn't give a damn.

371
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,800
Five years after conviction,
his family has evidence retested...

372
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,240
...proving he was innocent.

373
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,000
So you were still able
to get him out, right?

374
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,760
By then it was too late.

375
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,600
He had been executed
three months before.

376
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,600
After that, I hung it all up.

377
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,080
Now I try to save the world
from my living room.

378
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,600
But at least I know
nobody's gonna die because of me.

379
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,200
I know you can't undo the past...

380
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,000
...but you can't hide from it, either.

381
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,640
Lana? What are you doing here?

382
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,280
Just offering some moral support.

383
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,800
Brought some reinforcements.

384
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,880
- I'd like to handle your father's case.
- Of course.

385
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,280
We need all the help we can get.
Thank you.

386
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,800
How'd you get him to change his mind?

387
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,120
We set the ground rules for our
relationship, we promised to be honest...

388
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,960
...no matter what.

389
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,640
I've got a bail hearing set this afternoon.

390
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,240
I'm sure with Jonathan's
standing in the community...

391
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,840
...we can have him out by supper.

392
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,480
I just got good news from Lex.
His dad's doing better.

393
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,360
- He's expected to regain consciousness.
- Oh, thank God.

394
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,880
Dad, and if he does,
maybe he can ID the shooter.

395
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,000
That's a big "if," given his blindness.

396
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,000
Look, we're not out of the woods yet.

397
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,160
Lex Luthor's alibi checks out,
but Dominic Santori's is flimsy.

398
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,080
That should be good news for me.

399
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,640
The bartender who could corroborate
his involvement has disappeared.

400
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,520
Now, without him, it's gonna be hard
to keep your case from going to trial.

401
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,000
Breaking and entering really necessary?

402
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,040
- I thought the police checked this out.
- Yeah.

403
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,400
They checked out the area
where my dad was arrested too.

404
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,800
I'm gonna look over here.

405
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,080
Pete!

406
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,000
Oh, man, talk about sleeping
with the fishes.

407
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,280
I think I know who shot Lionel Luthor.

408
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,240
Lex had his father
moved to another floor.

409
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,160
We put the word out
that Lionel was getting better...

410
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,240
...guessing it would draw you out.

411
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,920
Kept hoping I was wrong.

412
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,480
- What the hell?
- You went to high school with my dad.

413
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,400
So did Mike the bartender.

414
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,760
You and Mike were more than friends.
You had a business arrangement.

415
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,520
Clark, I can explain.

416
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,760
Explain how a bar with
repeated violations stays open?

417
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,400
Or how all the evidence conveniently
pointed toward my dad?

418
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,480
You found out about my dad's fight,
and it all came together.

419
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,680
Is that you?

420
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,120
Didn't I make it clear?
The conversation is over.

421
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,040
You faked my dad's blood-alcohol test...

422
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,280
...and when I started to check out
your story, you came after me.

423
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,600
My dad trusted you.
How could you do that?

424
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Don't you see, Clark?
It's not just about me.

425
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,680
It's the Luthors. They're like a cancer...

426
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,600
...destroying everything they touch.

427
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,560
The Luthors didn't kill anyone.

428
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,400
The Luthors didn't frame my dad.

429
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,680
What have I done?

430
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,320
Just wanted to make sure
your dad was doing all right.

431
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,560
He says he is.

432
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,320
You don't sound too convinced.

433
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,080
I found this in the house.

434
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,080
It's my dad's high-school yearbook.

435
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,200
Him and Ethan were in the same class.

436
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,000
"To Jonathan...

437
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,040
...a great quarterback,
a better friend, Ethan."

438
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,160
You grow up with someone,
you think you know them...

439
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,480
...but I mean, darkness like that
just doesn't come out of nowhere.

440
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,800
I'm sorry about your company.

441
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,200
What's gonna happen next?

442
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,880
My father thinks
I'll go back to work for him.

443
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,320
Will you?

444
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,960
It's hard to imagine working for a man...

445
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,600
...who can enrage four people to the point
where any of them had motive to kill him.

446
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,480
Even you.

447
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,680
You know that darkness
you were talking about?

448
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,120
I'm not sure we're born with it. People
like my father find a way to bring it out.

449
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,960
So are we okay?

450
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,200
I wish I could help you with your father.

451
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,840
I can take him.

452
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,640
Dad.

453
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,560
Son.

454
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,600
I understand you've had
a busy few days.

455
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,360
In case you hadn't heard...

456
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,760
...Ethan has been charged in the murder
of the bartender and the attempt on you.

457
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,000
It truly is a sad day in Smallville.

458
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,840
I'm sure some version of the truth
will come out sooner or later...

459
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,080
...but I was hoping to hear it
from you first.

460
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,720
The sheriff and I simply...

461
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,840
...had a misunderstanding.

462
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,760
Sheriff.

463
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,800
You have something for me?

464
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,440
These are good people who happened
to make mistakes.

465
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,880
Yes, well, we're, all of us,
only human, sheriff.

466
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,120
These particular people sit on the board
of my son's company...

467
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,600
...so they need a little incentive
to sell their voting shares to me.

468
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,240
- Goodbye, Mr. Luthor.
- I hope this will be...

469
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,480
...the beginning of a long
and profitable relationship.

470
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,280
Our arrangement
was for this one time only.

471
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:39,120
Now, did that proviso come before
or after you insisted on cash in advance?

472
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,120
I was strapped.

473
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,760
But don't think you own me.

474
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,160
I've documented your backroom deals.

475
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,240
You push me, and I just have
to make one call.

476
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,280
Would that be to your attorney?

477
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,760
He...

478
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,600
...passed along
your documented evidence.

479
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,680
Along with his best wishes.

480
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,200
You know...

481
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,440
...my reputation in Smallville is...

482
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,480
...of no importance to me...

483
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,120
...but yours...

484
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,880
...it's your lifeblood, sheriff.

485
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,800
Sheriff? That's an elected position,
isn't it?

486
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Don't threaten me, you son of a bitch.

487
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,640
Good evening, sheriff.

488
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,200
So you took an honest man
and destroyed him...

489
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,960
...and by proxy
almost ruined Jonathan Kent.

490
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,960
How does it feel, Dad,
knowing you brought this on yourself?

491
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,280
But I didn't, Lex.

492
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,520
You did...

493
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,760
...engineering your
ill-advised employee coup.

494
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,640
And you actually believe that?

495
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,840
It's all right, son.

496
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,400
I forgive you.

497
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,960
Now it's time to look to the future.

498
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,640
Together.
