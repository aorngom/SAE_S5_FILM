1
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,790
Victor, can you hear me?

2
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,195
I'm sorry for what we did to you.

3
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,790
This was all I could save.

4
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,714
Thank you.

5
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,879
They're coming.

6
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,792
You have to go.

7
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,158
Now!

8
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,032
Stop him! Aim for the shoulder!

9
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,913
Seal the building.

10
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,991
I need him alive.

11
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,510
Sweep the area.

12
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,749
I want him back in his cage.

13
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,199
I hit you at 30 miles an hour.
You should be dead.

14
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,476
Won't be the first time.

15
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,594
- Who are you?
- Nobody you want to know.

16
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,512
Trust me.

17
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,393
- At least tell me how you...
- I'm sorry about your <i>car...</i>

18
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,152
<i>...but</i> I don't have time right now.

19
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,952
I'm out of here.

20
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,600
Clark, I need your help.

21
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,635
Lana, are you okay?

22
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,950
Yeah, it's just a cut.

23
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,793
How'd you get here so fast?

24
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,520
I was at the <i>Daily Planet</i> with Chloe.
What happened?

25
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,836
I was driving down the street
to the library...

26
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,389
...when this guy ran out
in front of my car.

27
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,357
I didn't even have time to brake.

28
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,357
Clark, I hit him full-on.

29
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,557
- I'm sorry.
- No, you don't understand.

30
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,756
He didn't have a scratch on him.

31
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,235
Lana, who is this guy?

32
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,312
I don't know. He brought me here.
He wouldn't tell me his name.

33
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,034
He was acting all jumpy
like somebody was after him.

34
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,997
What does he look like?

35
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,788
- Is that who's chasing you, the police?
- You got the wrong guy.

36
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,717
My girlfriend didn't crash into you?

37
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,996
- What are you looking for?
- Just some answers.

38
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,594
You're not even hurt.
How'd you manage that?

39
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,199
Milk, does a body good.

40
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,470
Victor? Victor Stone?

41
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,638
- Met High wide receiver.
- I know you?

42
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,949
I'm clark Kent,
I played for the Smallville Crows.

43
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,397
Kent. Quarterback, I remember.

44
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,039
Some arm you got.

45
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,358
I don't play anymore.

46
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,752
Yeah, me neither.

47
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,354
That's not surprising,
since I heard you were dead.

48
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,191
Look, I'm sorry about what happened
with your girlfriend. I really am.

49
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,796
But I got places I don't wanna be
right now. Catch you later, Kent.

50
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,871
- Victor, wait...
- Let me go!

51
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,796
Kent! Kent, are you...?

52
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,077
- What the hell are you made of?
- I was just about to ask you that.

53
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,317
What are you looking at, man?

54
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,997
Hello. Who are you?

55
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,798
How did...?

56
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,519
No, I understand, but I don't think
I can raise that much.

57
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,957
All right, I'll be there.

58
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,199
Lionel.

59
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,755
I'm not too early, am I?
Didn't we say 11:30?

60
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,355
Oh, right, the conference in Topeka.

61
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,192
Come in.

62
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,832
You'll save a full day
if you take the helicopter, senator.

63
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,510
But if you think it could be
a conflict of interest...

64
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,432
...to accept a favor from LuthorCorp...

65
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,438
No, no, no.
It's just that something's come <i>up...</i>

66
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,437
<i>...and</i> I'm going to
have to reschedule.

67
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,716
What is it, Martha?

68
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,039
Is everything all right?

69
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,593
Nothing I can't handle.

70
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,036
Oh, I don't doubt that for a minute.

71
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,674
If you need a ride in the future...

72
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,676
...or anything, anything at all,
please don't hesitate.

73
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,677
Please, call me.

74
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,193
I will. Thank you.

75
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,794
Lana, hi.

76
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,871
Look, I'm sorry I had to
leave so soon...

77
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,235
<i>...but</i> victor really didn't wanna
hang around.

78
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,756
No, you should stay in Metropolis
so I can figure out what's going on.

79
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,229
Yeah, chloe's on her way
to pick you up.

80
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,277
Okay, bye.

81
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,834
Newspaper's got it wrong, huh?

82
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,754
No. They didn't.

83
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,310
We were all in the car laughing,
carrying on...

84
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,395
...then it started to snow.

85
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,033
My little sister always loved the snow.

86
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,910
My ma, my pops...

87
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,795
...my little sister.

88
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,477
I should have died with them.

89
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,155
I passed out.

90
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,116
Expected to see some angels
next time I woke up.

91
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,555
Instead I got a bunch of Cyntechnics
scientists playing Frankenstein.

92
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,870
Cyntechnics, they did this to you?

93
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,358
I wasn't the only dead guy
they pulled from an accident...

94
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,592
...just the first to survive
their experiments.

95
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,112
If it wasn't for this one doctor
that helped me escape...

96
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,430
<i>...I'd</i> be more machine than man
right now.

97
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,152
Machine?

98
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,232
You mean bionics?

99
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,073
That's what all the metal is
in your body.

100
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,679
How do you know what's in me?

101
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,477
What about that wall I tossed you into?
How come you're not even hurt?

102
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,069
You're not the only one
who drinks a lot of milk.

103
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,439
- So you bionic like me?
- No.

104
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,074
I'm just different.

105
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,879
What about your girlfriend, Lana?
She's okay with you <i>being...</i>

106
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,036
...whatever you are?

107
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,670
Lana doesn't know.

108
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,153
Neither will Katherine.

109
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,793
Who's Katherine?

110
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,031
That's my girl.

111
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,513
She's beautiful.

112
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,558
We were planning on getting married
after school.

113
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,631
Some wedding that would be now.

114
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,550
- She even know you're alive?
- No.

115
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,630
I want to see her.

116
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,030
If she knew what I am now,
what they did to me...

117
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,040
How could she ever love
a thing like me?

118
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,432
I'm really not the best person
to be asking about that.

119
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,635
It won't even matter if cyntechnics
catches up with me first.

120
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,836
I got a friend who works
at the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

121
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,036
Might be able to find out
about these guys...

122
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,156
...maybe get them off your back.

123
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,477
You'd do that for me?

124
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,550
I kind of got this thing
about being experimented on in labs.

125
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,155
Sit tight, you should be safe here.

126
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,511
I'll be back as soon as I can.

127
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,796
So on a scale from one to Taye Diggs,
where exactly are we?

128
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,110
- He's definitely up there.
- Yeah?

129
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,113
Tall, dark and bionic,
you think he likes blonds?

130
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,238
His girlfriend's a brunette. Sorry.

131
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,991
Does she know what happened to him?

132
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,718
No. He doesn't want her to know.

133
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,599
- He's afraid how she'll react.
- Well, what's he gonna <i>do...</i>

134
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,275
...keep lying to her and hope that
she doesn't notice how different he is?

135
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,917
I did some digging in cyntechnics'
backyard, and I came up with...

136
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,038
...more flowers than dirt.
- There's gotta be something.

137
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,714
Well, their main focus has become
the Machina Project.

138
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,839
It's cutting-edge prosthetics designed to
replace damaged or severed limbs.

139
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,918
What they did to Victor is more
extensive than a severed limb.

140
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,391
Who owns Cyntechnics?

141
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,231
Guess what.
It is owned by LuthorCorp.

142
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,032
We need to talk.

143
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,430
And you should work on your entrance,
Clark.

144
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,397
Bit abrupt, don't you think?

145
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,676
What do you know about Cyntechnics?

146
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,231
See, now that's exactly what I mean.

147
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,188
No small talk, no pleasantries,
just straight to the accusations.

148
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,197
I haven't accused you of anything.

149
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,916
You don't have to.
Your righteous tone says it all.

150
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,590
So, what am I supposed to have done
this time?

151
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,435
How about turning Victor Stone
into a Tin Man without his consent?

152
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,636
Victor Stone, the football player?

153
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,677
I thought I read he died in a car crash.

154
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,479
That's what cyntechnics
wanted everyone to believe.

155
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,756
Then maybe you should be
badgering Cyntechnics.

156
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,798
I am. LuthorCorp bought them out
seven months ago.

157
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,596
Clark, in the last quarter alone...

158
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,230
...LuthorCorp has sold or acquired
over a hundred small ventures.

159
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,192
You don't know your own company?

160
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,031
I'm saying
I run a multinational corporation.

161
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,478
The complexity of keeping it operating
requires me to delegate responsibilities.

162
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,392
If someone's abusing that <i>position...</i>

163
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,597
<i>...I'll</i> take the necessary steps
to rectify the situation.

164
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,556
So will I.

165
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,311
Victor?

166
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,872
Victor?

167
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,474
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

168
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,232
- Where's clark?
- He went to go talk to Lex.

169
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,512
You mean, Lex Luthor?

170
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,190
Well, it turns out that LuthorCorp
owns the company that did this to you.

171
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,550
Maybe I should go have a few words
with Luthor.

172
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,509
Lex has done things in the past
that I don't <i>like...</i>

173
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,989
<i>...but</i> I can't believe
he has any part in this.

174
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,712
He's different.

175
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,153
So am I.

176
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,915
- Only I didn't have a choice.
- Well, now you do.

177
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,636
Between what?
Being a can opener or a Cuisinart?

178
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,719
No, between telling the truth
to the woman you love or lying to her.

179
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,709
- Clark told you about Katherine?
- Yeah.

180
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,391
That's actually why I'm here.

181
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,793
She's what kept me going
all those months in that lab.

182
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,317
The thought of holding her in my arms
again.

183
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,475
- Hey, where are you going?
- To find my girl.

184
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,189
I don't know what I'm gonna tell her,
but at least I can... What the hell?

185
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,952
Victor!

186
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,791
Target acquired.

187
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,316
Lana. Are you okay?

188
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,516
Yeah, I'm okay.

189
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,350
That makes one of us.

190
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,915
No one's gonna look for us here.
Lois won't be back till tomorrow.

191
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,435
Go lie down. I'll get you a towel.

192
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,159
Kent, I'm sorry. I never meant to bring
my crazy world into your life.

193
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,629
Don't worry about it, all right?
You're safe now.

194
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,916
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Here.

195
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,913
I'm not so sure.

196
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,516
This isn't exactly something
you can just put a little duct tape on.

197
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,960
The bionics and my biology
are all connected.

198
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,591
This goop coming out of my arm,
it's from my power cell.

199
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,078
If it continues to drain like this
I'm a dead man.

200
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,399
So my probing exposé
on the increase in jaywalking can wait.

201
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,552
- We need to find this doctor.
- I don't know how much time he has.

202
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,110
I know Lex likes to play hardball,
but sending snipers into your backyard?

203
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,669
- It just doesn't seem like his style.
- Styles change.

204
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,070
When I asked him about Cyntechnics,
he was lying.

205
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,798
Maybe he was telling the truth.

206
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,873
The lead scientist, Dr. Allister Krieg,
he has a history of burning bridges.

207
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,595
He was fired from both MIT and Stanford
for using their funding to conduct...

208
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,593
...ethically challenged research.
- Think he's doing the same?

209
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,957
Luthor's obsession with scientific
advancement makes him a target.

210
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,556
Doesn't matter. What matters is finding
the guy who can save victor's life.

211
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,393
- Okay, do you have a name?
- Dr. Hong.

212
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,192
There are six Hongs with M.D.'s
in the Metropolis area...

213
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,874
<i>...and</i> I'm thinking we can cross off
the OB/G YN.

214
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,190
Bioengineer, right there.

215
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,352
There you go.

216
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,111
Dr. Hong?

217
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,274
Dr. Hong, are you there?

218
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,791
Is he dead?

219
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,959
I think you already know that answer,
Lex.

220
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,151
You think
I had something to do with this?

221
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,551
Why else would you be here?
You acted like you never heard of them.

222
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,632
I hadn't. But after you waved
the red flag, I looked into it.

223
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,076
- Do you expect me to believe that?
- Believe what you want.

224
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,790
Dr. Hong was about to
blow the whistle...

225
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,589
<i>...and</i> either he couldn't live with it
or the man in charge wouldn't let him.

226
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,911
- You talking about Allister Krieg?
- You've done your homework.

227
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,991
Look, Krieg's gone completely rogue.

228
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,835
A project that started as an effort
to allow amputees to live a normal life...

229
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,231
<i>...has</i> turned into one man's quest
to create a living machine.

230
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,274
If you know where Victor is, you need
to tell me before Krieg finds him first.

231
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,753
He's sick. He's been shot.

232
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,675
He said if he doesn't get repaired,
he may die.

233
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,394
Then bring him to me.
I have the technology.

234
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,439
- I can help Victor without involving Krieg.
- I've seen the way you help people.

235
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,072
Look, I know you have your issues
with me. I know you're angry.

236
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,875
But do you want to let our differences
get in the way of saving victor's life?

237
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,278
What happened? Did Clark find him?

238
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,314
I'm so sorry, victor.

239
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,478
Dr. Hong's dead.

240
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,151
Because of me.

241
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,833
If he hadn't... If he hadn't helped me
escape, he'd still be alive right now.

242
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,468
It's not your fault, victor.

243
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,950
You didn't choose for any of this
to happen to you.

244
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,872
I always said I should have died
with my family.

245
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,554
Guess I'll be joining them soon enough.

246
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,351
You can't say that.
You can't give up hope, okay?

247
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,189
I need to see Katherine.

248
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,758
Victor, they're still searching for you.
You can hardly walk.

249
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,388
I don't care.
I'm gonna see her before I die.

250
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,439
- Okay, let's just wait for clark.
- I'm not waiting for anybody.

251
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,718
If you had one last chance to see
the person you love, what would you do?

252
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,031
Katherine!

253
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,316
Katherine!

254
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,911
Hello, Victor.

255
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,393
- Where's Katherine?
- She's safe.

256
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,949
And she'll stay that way,
as long as you cooperate.

257
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,954
If you so much as touch her,
I swear to God...

258
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,074
I'm a doctor, victor.

259
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,028
My goal is to help people,
not to hurt them.

260
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,875
Don't play with me, doc.

261
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,393
- I wanna see her.
- You will.

262
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,031
But first you'll return to the lab,
with these gentlemen.

263
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,397
I hope you win your Nobel Prize.

264
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,873
You were right.

265
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,873
He came here like a fish to water.

266
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,636
Yeah, well, the heart has a way
of clouding one's better judgement.

267
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,595
Did you bring the money?

268
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,714
Yes. Who are you?

269
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,996
Why are you doing this?

270
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,918
Lionel.

271
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,636
What are you doing here?

272
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,836
Well, I could ask you that same question.

273
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,514
You have no idea what you just did.

274
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:16,152
I got worried, Martha. I saw that
package at your house this morning.

275
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,629
I know you don't want to
accept help from me...

276
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,076
<i>...but</i> I can't just sit back
and let you walk into trouble alone.

277
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,233
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do. I recognize the signs.

278
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,949
You're a senator. You've got
a high profile. You're in the public eye.

279
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,190
Blackmail comes with the territory.

280
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,759
So...

281
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,115
...what does one do in this position?

282
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,589
You can't give in to blackmail,
it never ends.

283
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,910
You don't understand.
There's a lot at stake.

284
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,550
- There always is. Let me help you.
- No, Lionel, I can handle it.

285
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,312
Yes, you're a very capable <i>woman...</i>

286
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,040
...but this is something
quite beyond your experience.

287
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,514
What came to you in that package
is of no interest to me.

288
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,796
My only interest is your well-being.

289
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,512
Let me take care of this for you.
Please.

290
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,189
Where's Katherine?

291
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,438
Back at home. But don't worry,
we've called off the dogs.

292
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,390
You'll be happy that
we've replaced the <i>tubing...</i>

293
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,475
...re-calibrated a few
of the servo-mechanisms.

294
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,676
Your arm is even better than before.

295
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,070
Can't wait to use it
to smash your skull in.

296
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,472
How you feeling?

297
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,391
Victor, I'm glad we managed
to get to you in time to save you.

298
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,914
You got some kind of God complex
or something?

299
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,354
I didn't ask to be saved.

300
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,919
Look, all I'm doing is giving you a future,
a chance for a normal life.

301
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,516
Normal? Half my body is straight
out of The Sharper Image catalog.

302
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,558
At a price a lot steeper
than 6 million dollars...

303
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,154
...the last thing I wanna do
is cause you more pain.

304
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,550
Then why not take back
all your fancy gadgetry?

305
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,314
Roll my sorry stump out
in a wheelbarrow for all I care.

306
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,472
You'd die without this gadgetry.

307
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,676
But I'm as eager for your freedom
as you are.

308
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,592
You just need to be patient.

309
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,714
What's that?

310
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,956
It's gonna make life easier for you.

311
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,279
What are you doing to me?

312
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,278
What am I doing?
I'm helping you be whole again.

313
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,673
Anger...

314
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,638
...despair, Ioneliness.

315
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,239
Such strong emotions can create
a rift between brain and bionics.

316
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,870
This chip will take the edge off
when necessary.

317
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,554
You're trying to turn me into a drone,
that's what.

318
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,870
- A robot.
- Vic...

319
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,355
Easy.

320
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,159
You've read too much science fiction.

321
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,552
Pacemakers,
synthetic tissues, artificial hearts.

322
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,280
The merging of man and machine
is nothing new.

323
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,278
I'll get out of your way.

324
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,317
Keep me updated.

325
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,072
I'll prep him for the implant.

326
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,636
Lana, where's victor?

327
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,155
- He left.
- What?

328
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,072
He wasn't supposed to leave.

329
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,629
He wanted to see Katherine
one last time.

330
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,032
- That's the first place they'll look.
- I tried to stop him, he wouldn't listen.

331
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,316
Do you think they brought him back
to that lab?

332
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,109
- I'm gonna go check that out.
- We should call the police.

333
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,955
These people have shot at us before.
Who knows what they're gonna...

334
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,433
Just relax, Victor.
This won't take long.

335
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,309
You want me to relax,
put away the drill.

336
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,596
When we're done, I promise you,
you'll feel like a new man.

337
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,870
Nice tackle.

338
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,077
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

339
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,996
- How did you do that, Kent?
- I can do a lot of things.

340
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,394
Clark.

341
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,551
Gonna try some small talk
first this time?

342
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,429
Like how Victor Stone
escaped from the lab?

343
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,834
I guess not.

344
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,390
That's everything that chloe and I
could find on the Machina Project.

345
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,832
Well, there's nothing here about Krieg's
renegade experiment...

346
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,912
<i>...I</i> haven't already uncovered.

347
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,518
I have no desire to harass
Victor Stone.

348
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,989
- He's suffered enough.
- Suffered because of you.

349
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,433
- Clark...
- Lex, you were there in the lab.

350
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,272
When they tried to put a chip in.

351
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,998
I was there.

352
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,390
- To stop Krieg.
- That's not what victor said.

353
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,757
Victor was under heavy anesthesia.

354
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,753
He must have misconstrued
my intentions.

355
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,593
Seems to happen a lot to you,
doesn't it?

356
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,636
You think
he would have been better off...

357
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,711
<i>...if</i> he'd died along with his family?

358
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,516
You always think
the ends justify the means.

359
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,673
What I think
is that some miracles have a price.

360
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,717
But that doesn't make them
less profound.

361
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,510
Tell Victor I hope he can move past
what happened.

362
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,353
I assure him LuthorCorp has.

363
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,720
You can let yourself out.

364
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,796
Is everything working all right?

365
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,428
I feel like a billion dollars...

366
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,354
...which probably isn't too far off.

367
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,593
You really think Luthor's gonna let that
much money walk off into the sunset?

368
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,716
I didn't give him a choice.

369
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,994
I'd say thank <i>you...</i>

370
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,753
...but the words seem too small.

371
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,995
And completely unnecessary.

372
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,151
Your mom raised you modest,
didn't she?

373
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,674
You're a hero, Kent.

374
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,713
I'm not gonna forget
how much I owe you.

375
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,956
Help someone else out
when they're in need. We'll call it even.

376
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,914
Katherine.

377
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,951
Victor?

378
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,236
What happened?

379
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,719
What did those men do to you?

380
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,314
It's a long story.

381
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,710
We got time.

382
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,958
Lionel. Come in.

383
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,398
- What happened? Did you...?
- Don't worry. It's been solved.

384
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,678
The man responsible has agreed
never to contact you again.

385
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,829
Who was he?

386
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,796
He was a police academy dropout
turned warehouse security guard.

387
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,599
He was trying to cash in
at somebody else's expense.

388
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,471
Did he tell you what this was about?

389
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,553
I didn't let him. I was only interested
in making sure he went away.

390
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,597
And he did.

391
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,751
Willingly.

392
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,277
- But there is one thing that concerns me.
- What is it?

393
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,074
You're a public figure now, senator.

394
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,878
How people perceive you is...

395
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,594
It's everything.

396
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,110
It's possible
that any association with me...

397
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,389
...with Lionel Luthor...

398
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,391
...could be dangerous
to your new career.

399
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,199
I'm not the kind of person
who turns her back on friends...

400
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,238
...because of what people think.

401
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,030
I don't know many people like you,
Martha.

402
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,035
I admire your integrity so much.

403
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,439
The state of Kansas
is lucky to have you.

404
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,519
I haven't seen that in a while.

405
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,788
I guess Victor kind of reminded me
of the glory days.

406
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,074
Why'd you quit, anyway?

407
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,789
You... You always seemed
so at peace on that field.

408
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,670
Like everything that was weighing
you down just evaporated.

409
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,031
It's just a game.

410
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,478
Clark, why do you do that?

411
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,394
Do what?

412
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,551
Hide what you're really feeling.

413
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,313
Seeing Victor and Katherine together...

414
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,869
...how in love they are...

415
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,316
...it kind of reminded me
of our glory days.

416
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,600
And you know how much I love you,
Clark.

417
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,877
But we seem to just
keep going around and around.

418
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,000
- We can't move forward.
- I know.

419
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,752
Just tell me the truth, Clark.

420
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,038
Do you still love me?

421
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,236
I've always loved you.

422
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,351
And I always will.

423
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,794
No matter what happens.

424
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,760
Your secret is safe with me...

425
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,278
...Kal-EI.

426
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,310
