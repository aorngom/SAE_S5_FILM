1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,116
Yes, Martha, I finished the proposal.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,352
And I finished all the charts for
your committee meeting.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,955
Oh, clark's in the neighborhood?
Sure, he can come pick them up.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,637
Oh, don't even mention it.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,473
Okay. Bye, Martha.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,756
Maddie, what are you doing?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,595
It's time to eat dinner, sweetheart.
You can draw later.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,755
Maddie, you know the rules.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,638
Please get back to the table.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,354
I want us to eat as a family.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,638
Look, you might not wanna talk,
but you have to listen to me.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,432
Put your book away now.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,632
Maddie, give that to me.

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,794
Maddie!

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,114
What just happened?

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,595
You did that, didn't you?

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,638
All those times I've found
broken glass...

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,910
<i>...they</i> weren't accidents.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,515
Nobody warned me about this.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,033
I think you need help.

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,395
I'm calling the foster-care agency
right now.

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,591
I can't take this anymore.

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,835
No, don't touch me.

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,513
Just, please, go to your room.

25
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,915
No!

26
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,670
I found Naomi in the kitchen.
There was glass everywhere.

27
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,952
What kind of person would commit
such a brutal crime?

28
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,839
Whoever it was, the sound
of your truck scared them off.

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,958
Well, thank you for letting her
stay with us tonight, deputy.

30
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,076
After all she's been <i>through...</i>

31
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,078
...there's no reason she should
spend the night in a shelter.

32
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,437
No problem, senator. Child Services
will come by tomorrow to check in.

33
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,158
Okay, good. Thank you.

34
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,233
It makes no sense.

35
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,834
All Naomi wanted to do was
help people.

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,592
She was a foster parent.

37
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,673
She ran a youth center before
she was my chief of staff.

38
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,316
Maddie hasn't said a word
since she got here.

39
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,678
Naomi told me she hasn't spoken
since she was 3 years old.

40
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,748
That's when her birth mother
was killed.

41
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,713
Can't blame her. She's been through
one tragedy after another.

42
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,996
And countless foster homes.

43
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,557
- I should call Lionel in London.
- Lionel?

44
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,751
Naomi used to run
his children's foundation.

45
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,353
I really should let him know.

46
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,632
- Mom, maybe you should wait.
- No, no, it'll take a minute.

47
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,315
Hey, Maddie, what you drawing?

48
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,674
You're quite the artist, aren't you?

49
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,075
You know, I'm an artist too.

50
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,831
You don't believe me?

51
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,957
All right, well, I'll just
have to prove it to you then.

52
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,038
Now, prepare yourself...

53
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,191
...because this is gonna be
a self-portrait.

54
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,079
You might not be able to tell
the difference between this...

55
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,276
...and an actual photograph.

56
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,277
As long as we had to wade through
a sea of government paperwork...

57
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,431
...at least we got to do it
over tuna rolls.

58
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,795
Well, I'm not too fond of
working in the stacks.

59
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,871
I have to admit,
I was pretty impressed...

60
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,315
...you ordered the entire meal
in fluent Japanese.

61
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,472
You could have warned me about
the squid brains though.

62
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,675
Come on, you can't fool me.
You loved it.

63
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,910
Lex, I was thinking, I don't really
feel comfortable hanging onto these.

64
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,832
Some of these are marked "classified."

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,878
You could get into a lot of trouble
even showing them to me.

66
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,750
Lana, if Milton Fine is right about
an extraterrestrial threat...

67
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,754
<i>...the</i> last thing the government's
gonna be worried about is Lana Lang.

68
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,239
Besides, you're the only one who
knows of my transgression.

69
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,391
I think I'm safe with
my fate in your hands.

70
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,916
You must really trust me.

71
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,591
Hundred percent.

72
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,270
I hope you feel the same way
about me.

73
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,997
I do.

74
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,351
Sorry, I...

75
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,957
I forgot my pencil in the library.

76
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,035
And this is
the world-famous Kent barn.

77
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,474
When I was about your age...

78
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,632
...my dad used to let me
jump in the haystacks in here.

79
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,436
Why don't you close your eyes,
turn around.

80
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,318
I got a surprise for you.

81
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,030
It'll be worth it, I promise.

82
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,594
So, what do you think?

83
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,471
You wanna give it a shot?

84
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,713
Let me guess,
you're afraid of heights?

85
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,590
I can relate.

86
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,757
You know, Maddie...

87
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,998
...you and I have a lot more
in common than you think.

88
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,230
I was an orphan too.

89
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,078
<i>Hey, boy. Good doggie.</i>

90
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,389
Looks like Shelby likes you.

91
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,709
Animals are great, aren't they?

92
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,114
They listen to you,
don't say mean things back.

93
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,150
Look, I might not be
as furry as Shelby...

94
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,270
...or wag my tail or bark,
but I promise...

95
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,472
<i>...I'll</i> never say mean things to you.

96
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,436
What's up there?

97
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,109
It's kind of like my clubhouse.

98
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,714
Oh, you're so lucky.

99
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,553
You can be lucky too, Maddie.
It's not too late.

100
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,439
- We're gonna find you a good family.
- People don't like me.

101
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,991
What? Well, those people are crazy.
I like you.

102
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,275
Is this your girlfriend?

103
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,079
Well, she used to be.
We kind of parted ways.

104
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,992
Hey, you wanna go for a horseback ride?
Just you and me?

105
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,229
Let's go.

106
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,751
You can chat up Buttercup
all you want.

107
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,151
- You have horses?
- So you can talk.

108
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,598
I knew that whole Marcel Marceau thing
was just a rumor.

109
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,512
I'm Lois.

110
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,474
She's a little shy.

111
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,997
I understand. A lot of artists are.

112
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,078
I brought crayons and a coloring book.
Maddie, check it out.

113
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,635
Go ahead.

114
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,638
Your mom called from Topeka.

115
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,598
With her chief of staff gone,
she's been in meetings all day.

116
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,193
She asked if I could help out.

117
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,398
I think we got it under control.

118
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,670
I'm the one with the little sister,
remember?

119
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,876
Okay, you ready for
a few games of hopscotch?

120
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,430
I'm a bit rusty,
but you'll be the odds-on favorite.

121
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,672
Actually, we were just about
to saddle up and hit the trails.

122
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,833
Great. Bust out the spurs. I'm game.

123
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,992
Oh, how adorable.
You wanna be alone with Clark.

124
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,994
Hey, no worries. I will be galloping
way ahead of you guys.

125
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,712
Maddie?

126
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,237
Hey, what just happened out there?

127
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,988
Did you break all those light bulbs?

128
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,914
Listen, Maddie, I understand.

129
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,595
You have powers, abilities that
normal people can't even dream of.

130
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,917
And it's okay.

131
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,836
You can trust me.
You can tell me the truth.

132
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,916
Ever since I was little,
I could break glass.

133
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,513
Yeah?

134
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,036
And when I get upset,
I can't control it.

135
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,598
Were you upset with Naomi?

136
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,753
You think I killed her?

137
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,995
Maddie, you have the power
to break glass.

138
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,754
- And the way that she died...
- I didn't do it.

139
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,799
Clark, I wasn't in the same room,
and I can't do anything through walls.

140
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,629
I liked Naomi. I would never hurt her.

141
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,753
Clark, can I talk to you
for a minute?

142
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,991
I'm gonna call the sheriff now,
before we get sliced, diced and puréed.

143
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,720
- Lois, I'm not sure she killed anybody.
- Oh, yeah?

144
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,314
So someone else with
the power to shatter glass...

145
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,708
...murdered her foster-mom?

146
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,950
Having this ability
doesn't make her a killer.

147
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,231
I always knew you were naive,
but come on.

148
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,709
Don't let her rosy cheeks
and saucer eyes sway you.

149
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,916
That girl's one step short of
the demon seed.

150
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,310
Just give me an hour.
Then we'll call the police.

151
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,040
Wait, you want me to babysit
that little glass-smasher?

152
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,237
- Does my life mean nothing to you?
- I don't think she's dangerous.

153
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,233
- Lf you're scared, I can call chloe.
- Who said I was scared?

154
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,755
- I'm not scared.
- Great. Thanks.

155
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,359
I took a peek into Maddie v an Horn's
Child Services files.

156
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,274
I hate to break it to you, but there's
more than one reference to broken glass.

157
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,830
I think Maddie's not just accident prone,
she's disaster prone.

158
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,434
Yeah, well, that doesn't prove
she's a killer.

159
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,670
If my parents hadn't
found me in that field...

160
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,751
...it could have been me in
foster care...

161
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,639
...scaring people,
being accused of crimes I didn't commit.

162
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,190
Yeah, and one of your greatest powers
is your unrelenting faith in people.

163
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,318
But I think when it comes to Maddie,
the jury's in.

164
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,639
It wasn't just a car accident
that killed her mother...

165
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,030
...it was a freak car accident.

166
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,988
Witnesses saw the front windshield
mysteriously shatter before the crash.

167
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,799
You think Maddie's responsible
for her own mother's death?

168
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,115
Well, didn't she say she was having
a hard time controlling her powers?

169
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,555
Whoever said you had to be
indoors to have fun?

170
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,598
The best times I've ever had were
way out in the boonies...

171
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,593
...as far away from breakables
as possible.

172
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,158
- Where's Shelby?
- Oh, I have no idea.

173
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,790
I'm allergic to him, and let's just say
he's not too fond of me.

174
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,998
We're gonna have a good old time.

175
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,029
We can pick flowers, or catch bugs.
Whatever floats your boat.

176
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,158
I even packed that picnic for us.

177
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,151
Granted, I'm the not
the greatest chef...

178
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,197
...but how can you screw up PB&J?

179
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,029
- Shelby?
- Hey, where you going?

180
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,797
Shelby? Shelby?

181
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,190
You can play with the pooch
when Clark gets back.

182
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,078
Now, turn around and we can...

183
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,872
Okay.

184
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,235
Now, why don't we both just ease on
out of here before one of us gets hurt?

185
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,311
Okay?

186
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,675
What do you mean, "gets hurt"?

187
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,995
- Who are you?
- Frank Colbert, Child Services.

188
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,151
What's going on here?

189
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,595
Okay, look,
I know this sounds crazy...

190
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,752
<i>...but</i> I'm trying to keep her
as far away from glass as possible.

191
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,593
Maddie, why don't you get in the car?

192
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,878
No, no. Not the car.
You don't understand.

193
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,629
I am telling you, this girl, she can
shatter glass just by looking at it.

194
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,353
Thank you for your concern.

195
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,750
Maddie, I'm gonna take you
back to the shelter...

196
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,956
...where you can be properly
taken care of.

197
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,914
<i>We spotted Milton Fine</i>
<i>at 0200 Greenwich Mean Time...</i>

198
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,674
<i>... 40 kilometers north</i>
<i>of the Somalian border.</i>

199
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,520
<i>Good news, Fine is in Myanmar.</i>

200
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,956
<i>It's 0200 GMT,</i>
<i>and we're watching him as we speak.</i>

201
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,872
Chloe.

202
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,953
I know your moral compass has
a tendency to veer off course...

203
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,759
...but taking advantage of Lana
at her most vulnerable...

204
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,876
<i>...it's</i> despicable.

205
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,994
I think your reporter's eye
is getting a little cloudy.

206
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,275
You're starting to see things
that aren't there.

207
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,791
I don't have to work for
the DWP to know...

208
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,431
...there was enough electricity in that
room to light the entire state of Kansas.

209
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,231
It's interesting how perceptive you are
about affairs of the heart...

210
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,155
...considering you've never actually
been in a serious relationship.

211
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,638
Do you really think Lana would be
remotely interested in you...

212
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,314
<i>...if</i> she wasn't swept up
in her own emotional tornado?

213
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,038
I mean, honestly.

214
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,394
I appreciate you looking out
for your friend.

215
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,473
I'd do the same.
But your concern is unwarranted.

216
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,036
We're friends, nothing more.

217
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,989
Lex, I know you're used
to getting what you want...

218
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,835
...without even thinking about
the consequences, but I promise you...

219
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,875
...if you hurt my friend,
there will be a consequence.

220
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,519
And you're looking at her.

221
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,312
Chloe.

222
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,796
I think I'm getting an inkling
why you've never had a boyfriend.

223
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,792
Trust me, for your own safety,
the girl can't be near glass.

224
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,916
I heard you the first time.

225
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,270
Will you get her belongings, please?

226
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,631
Oh, God.

227
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,078
Maddie, get out of the car!

228
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,912
Hey!

229
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,589
Stay there.

230
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,670
Lois, are you okay?

231
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,956
I've screwed up a lot,
but this ranks up there.

232
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,792
That little girl was on my watch.

233
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,598
There's nothing you could have done.

234
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,990
I should've never left you two alone.

235
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,752
Who's kidding who, Smallville?

236
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,957
If you had been there,
you would have been shredded beef.

237
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,073
Clark, she's gonna be fine.
They put out an AMBER Alert.

238
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,276
Every cop in the state is
looking for Maddie.

239
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,432
Did you get a good look at the guy?

240
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,479
Like I told the sheriff,
mid-30s, sandy blond hair...

241
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,915
...good-Iooking in that
psycho killer kind of way.

242
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,151
I just don't understand who would
wanna kidnap Maddie.

243
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,311
Considering her dangerous
disposition...

244
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,631
<i>...I'm</i> guessing somebody who's
pretty desperate to be with her.

245
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,315
Come on, Clark. Please, pick up.

246
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,357
Pick up, Clark, please.

247
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,830
Come on, Clark.
Clark, please, where are...?

248
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,230
What are you doing, princess?

249
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,958
Why are you running away from me?

250
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,712
Look, look, I'm your dad.

251
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,551
- I'm your dad.
- What?

252
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,193
With all those years locked up,
you're the only thing that kept me going.

253
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,271
I would do anything for you.

254
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,714
You killed that man.

255
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,155
- Look, I had no...
- You killed Naomi.

256
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,438
You killed my real mom, didn't you?

257
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,795
- Look...
- You did.

258
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,469
Your mother didn't want me near you.

259
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,070
She thought I was some monster.

260
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,953
I swear all I wanted
was for us to be together.

261
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,475
You like butterflies, don't you?

262
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,392
I made this for you.

263
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,071
It's okay.

264
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,674
I know this is a big change.

265
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,191
All I wanna do
is put our family back together.

266
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,870
You belong to me. Now, come on.

267
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,433
Come on.

268
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,999
I've got a surprise for you.

269
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,919
His name is Tyler McKnight...

270
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,913
...and I think he might be
Maddie v an Horn's long-Iost father.

271
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,229
What makes you say that?

272
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,312
He was Maddie's mom's sweetheart
the year before she was born.

273
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,754
But what does that prove?

274
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,831
Twelve years ago
he landed in Belle Reve...

275
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,673
...with the ability
to control all things glass.

276
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,159
So he really is Maddie's dad.

277
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,551
Which means that Maddie v an Horn's
meteor powers are second-generation.

278
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,193
Her dad was in a stained-glass workshop
when the first meteor shower hit.

279
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,432
So Maddie never met her father.
He's been locked up all her life.

280
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,717
That's what happens when you
use your powers to rob a jewelry store.

281
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,316
He got caught, the seven
five-carat diamonds he stole didn't.

282
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,954
Did he just escape?

283
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,309
He walked out.
He was a model patient.

284
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,517
- Shrinks gave him a clean bill of health.
- We have to find Maddie.

285
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,193
We don't know what this <i>guy's...</i>

286
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,954
...capable of.
- We have no idea where he's headed.

287
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,872
Where did he live
when he was arrested?

288
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,278
With his mother.

289
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,478
145 Hastings Road.

290
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,432
I can't believe they let my son out.

291
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,238
Why didn't he come and see me?

292
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,311
Probably went straight
to see his daughter.

293
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,630
Daughter?
Tyler doesn't have a daughter.

294
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,150
Her name is Maddie,
and she's 11 years old.

295
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,910
I have a granddaughter?

296
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,198
Yes, ma'am, and it's very important
that we find her. She could be in danger.

297
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,391
I've seen this before, at the Talon.

298
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,232
Isn't it beautiful?

299
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,834
He made it right before he was arrested.

300
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,519
I don't have the finished piece.

301
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,911
I had to sell it
after my husband passed away.

302
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,479
Those seven diamonds he stole...

303
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,959
...did they ever find them?

304
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,519
No.

305
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,238
I made this right before
they threw me into Belle Reve.

306
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,158
But I always knew that I'd get out.

307
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,318
We'd be together.

308
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,552
Watch this.

309
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,790
I hid these here for you, Maddie.

310
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,199
For us.

311
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,189
These are the start of our new life.

312
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,234
Take them.

313
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,599
Go on, take them.

314
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,359
No.

315
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,353
You stole them.

316
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,431
- No, I didn't.
- You stole them.

317
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,349
Please, take them.

318
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,598
Let her go.

319
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,959
Maddie?

320
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,835
- It's okay.
- Clark.

321
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,392
It's okay.

322
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,432
It's okay.

323
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,710
He'll never hurt anyone again.

324
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,679
Thanks.
Hey, what are you doing here?

325
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,559
I didn't think the <i>Daily Planet</i>
was on your weekend orbit.

326
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,553
I just got a phone call from Lex.

327
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,559
I don't understand, chloe.
Why didn't you just talk to me?

328
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,436
Look, Lana, I'm sorry.

329
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,592
After the last couple weeks
I didn't think you were <i>interested...</i>

330
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,069
...in talking about your love life.
- My love life?

331
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,710
- With Lex? You've gotta be kidding me.
- Lana, it's okay to be honest.

332
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,518
I'm not gonna burn you at the stake.

333
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,636
There is nothing
to be honest about, Chloe.

334
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,678
So I'd appreciate it if you stopped
spinning your rumor mill...

335
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,559
...before you humiliate me
any more than you already have.

336
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,470
- I understand if you wanna hurt Clark.
- What?

337
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,069
But just don't hurt yourself
in the process.

338
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,038
Lex Luthor is nothing more
than a predator.

339
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,550
Well, I don't plan on being
anybody's prey.

340
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,432
So we have nothing to worry about.

341
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,389
Now remember, the doctors
told you to take it easy.

342
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,676
So you might have to lay off
the arm wrestling.

343
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,592
My arm doesn't even hurt anymore.

344
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,149
What hurts is knowing
how badly I treated that girl.

345
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,356
I had no doubt
she was a cold-blooded killer.

346
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,632
Goes to show you, people aren't
always who you think they are.

347
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,552
I have to give you credit, Smallville.

348
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,109
Who would've known
you'd be such a natural with kids?

349
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,396
Well, Maddie's pretty special.

350
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,432
So, what happens to her now?

351
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,558
Can't be easy finding a family
willing to live without windows.

352
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,518
She gonna live with her grandmother,
who couldn't be happier.

353
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,716
She didn't even know
she had a granddaughter.

354
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,677
Wow, she must be pretty brave.

355
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,629
She's excited. Like my parents
when they adopted me.

356
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,268
They didn't worry about
their house getting destroyed.

357
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,431
Well, he had his moments.

358
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,919
Hi, Clark.

359
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,197
Since you're bedridden for a few days,
I brought you stuff to read.

360
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,713
Thank you.

361
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,714
The chief of staff for a state senator
needs to be fully informed on the issues.

362
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,036
Wait a minute.
You want me to be your chief of staff?

363
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,471
Mom, are you sure
you don't wanna think this through?

364
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,592
If it weren't for Lois, your father
wouldn't have been elected.

365
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,034
And I wouldn't be in office.

366
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,792
Besides, Lois, it's pretty <i>clear...</i>

367
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,599
...your destiny lies
far beyond a cappuccino maker.

368
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,034
What do you think?

369
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,918
Come on. Let's go.

370
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,877
Nice glasses.

371
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,479
Maddie?

372
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,234
What you doing?

373
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,834
Clark, you saved my life.

374
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,798
- I just wanted to help out.
- Maddie?

375
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,955
- Sweetie, you don't need to do that.
- Don't worry.

376
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,111
I'm used to cleaning up after myself.

377
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,918
Well, in this house, you're a guest.

378
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,595
And guests always get a double helping
of Mom's banana pancakes.

379
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,155
The way you are with her...

380
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,069
Your dad would be so proud.

381
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,714
Clark, did you ever meet
your real dad?

382
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,032
Sort of.

383
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,909
- Is he bad like mine?
- Maybe worse.

384
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,268
But just because he gave me life
doesn't mean I'm anything like him.

385
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,111
See, the thing is, Maddie...

386
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,871
...anyone can be a father...

387
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,430
...but it takes someone
very special to be a dad.

388
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,390
I wish you could've met
the man who raised me.

389
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,911
He was my real dad.

390
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,154
He would've liked you a lot.

391
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,517
Clark, could I stay here with you?

392
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,397
Maddie, you have a grandmother.

393
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,472
She's very excited
for you to come live with her.

394
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,837
I don't know her.

395
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,432
I know you.

396
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,833
Well, Maddie, it's just you're gonna
have to give it time to get to know her.

397
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,958
And...

398
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,519
Maddie?

399
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,157
Maddie, listen.

400
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,919
Maddie, I would never
let you go with anyone...

401
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,231
...who's not gonna accept you
for who you really are, okay?

402
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,111
I promise.

403
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,517
You're gonna be okay.

404
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,114
I'll make sure. Okay?

405
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,078
Hey, Mom?

406
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,515
We need another deck of cards.

407
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,791
Maddie, stay here.

408
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,071
- Mom?
- Clark.

409
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,757
You move a muscle...

410
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,634
...your mom gets her throat slashed.

411
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,557
Bring me my daughter.

412
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,077
Bring me my daughter!

413
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,593
Now!

414
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,399
Don't worry, clark.

415
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,471
I'm not gonna let him
hurt any more people.

416
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,235
Maddie, no.

417
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,278
Princess, what are you
doing to me? Don't.

418
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,597
Maddie, if you kill him,
you'll be just like him.

419
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,069
You don't have to turn into
your father.

420
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,993
Maybe I don't have a choice.

421
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,433
Just because you're his <i>child...</i>

422
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,990
<i>...does</i> not mean that you're destined
to follow in his footsteps.

423
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,675
But I don't want him
to hurt any more people.

424
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,638
I won't.

425
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,038
I promise.

426
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,915
I made a mistake, Maddie.

427
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,472
Your father has already
destroyed his life. Don't destroy yours.

428
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,758
- Maddie, I promise, I won't...
- You have too much to offer this world.

429
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,676
I'm sorry, clark.

430
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,756
It's okay. It's over now.

431
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,672
Go ahead, Maddie.
There's nothing to be scared about.

432
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,273
Yes, there is.

433
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,516
You won't be with me.

434
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,154
- I'll have no one to talk to.
- That's not true.

435
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,511
Your grandmother
can't wait to talk to you.

436
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,433
She wants to hear
every word you have to say.

437
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,156
What about my powers?

438
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,719
What if I can't control them?

439
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,391
But you can, Maddie.

440
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,119
I've seen you.

441
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,834
Just like you did
in the barn, remember?

442
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,316
You ever feel
you're gonna lose <i>control...</i>

443
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,755
...all you have to do
is pick up the phone.

444
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,832
You call me, I'll be right there
to talk you through it, okay?

445
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,510
I already miss you, Clark.

446
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,673
I miss you too.

447
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,190
Your grandmother's waiting for you.
She's gonna take good care of you.

448
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,115
I almost forgot...

449
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,834
So the good news is...

450
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,391
<i>...with</i> Lois's love for gossip, I'll always
have inside scoop at the state capital.

451
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,790
As long as she doesn't
get my mom impeached.

452
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,475
Yeah, I think that Lois
is the least of your mom's worries.

453
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,154
Have you told her about
your otherworldly suspicions...

454
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,833
...that Lionel knows your secret?

455
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,036
She's got a lot on her mind right now.

456
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,631
Hey, how's Lana?

457
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,360
Was wondering when you were
gonna bring up the L word.

458
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,272
Why don't you call her?

459
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,874
Actually, I was just trying
to give her some space.

460
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,471
Has she met anyone yet?

461
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,119
Clark, look, if you don't wanna
talk to her, that's fine. It's your choice.

462
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,716
But please don't make me
your own personal little covert spy.

463
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,958
Chloe?

464
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,671
Is there something you're not telling me?

465
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,553
No.

466
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,878
Not at all.

467
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,593
Lana.

468
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,869
Thought you were busy
explicating Shakespeare today.

469
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,793
I wanted to talk.

470
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,110
Just to set the record straight.

471
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,793
I don't think the record
could be any straighter.

472
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,758
Chloe's working on a story
where there is none.

473
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,872
Lex, our friendship means a lot to me.

474
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,474
I don't want any misunderstandings
to get in the way.

475
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,598
Lana, we're on the same page.

476
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,309
If I somehow gave you the wrong
impression the other night, I apologize.

477
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,471
You don't have to apologize
for something that didn't happen.

478
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,269
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

479
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,797
This whole thing... I mean, I can't believe
we're even having this conversation.

480
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,872
To think that there'd be anything
between us besides friendship?

481
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,553
Don't worry.

482
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,280
Talk is just a bunch of noise.

483
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,271
As long as we both
feel the same way...

484
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,476
That's all that matters.

485
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,912
You okay?

486
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,033
Look...

487
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,040
<i>...it's</i> just something that happened.
