1
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:12,663
Plan on coming up for air?

2
00:00:12,836 --> 00:00:15,236
I'm thirsty. Is that a crime?

3
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:18,431
-Come on, I'll give you a ride.
-I'm waiting for someone.

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,842
Lana Lang.

5
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:27,449
-Very original.
-I hear she's single again.

6
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:29,812
They post that on her official
stalker website?

7
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:31,248
I'm not stalking her.

8
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:34,049
No, you just have her entire schedule
memorized for fun.

9
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:36,588
That girl's got so many guys tailing her...

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,194
...she should qualify
for Secret Service protection.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,239
Hi.

12
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:53,976
Hi.

13
00:01:01,918 --> 00:01:03,408
Very smooth.

14
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:08,047
Maybe in about 1 0 years you'll actually
be able to get a complete sentence out.

15
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:10,022
I'll catch you later.

16
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:58,200
Hello?

17
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:55,387
Help! Help!

18
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:28,015
Looks like you got yourself
a pinch hitter in the hero arena.

19
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:30,625
I don't know if I'd call him a hero, Pete.

20
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:32,386
I'm just glad Lana's okay.

21
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:35,224
Yeah, I know. Have you seen her?

22
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:38,799
I'm not exactly the person
Lana wants to be around right now.

23
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,899
Keep it moving.

24
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:44,972
I still can't believe
Jake turned Swimfan on Lana.

25
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,837
Yeah, I didn't peg him as
a poolside-slasher type either.

26
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:51,811
But I don't think Jake Pollen was exactly
like your average teenager.

27
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,117
Why would you say that?

28
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:58,721
Other than the meteor rock labeled "freak"
laid next to his body?

29
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:01,584
You remember that field trip
we took down to Crater Lake...

30
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:04,352
...the one where I dropped my keys
off of the pier?

31
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:06,688
I thought you were gonna
call the Navy SEALs.

32
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:09,832
-Jake fished them out.
-Right. He was underwater for six minutes.

33
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:13,628
Unless you're David Blaine or a Himalayan
yoga master, that's impossible.

34
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:17,603
-Hey, what's with the list?
-It's just my hunches, you know....

35
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:19,674
Sort of anything that's off the charts.

36
00:05:19,843 --> 00:05:22,334
It's a purgatory before you get
to the Wall of Weird.

37
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:24,207
You have a full file of Jake?

38
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:28,781
I started suspecting a while ago
that he had amphibious abilities...

39
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:31,113
...due to the meteor-rock exposure
for a while.

40
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:33,949
You don't think you're stretching
with this one, Chloe?

41
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:38,560
I don't think Jake is the mysterious one.
I mean, don't you think it's a little strange?

42
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:42,687
Rifle-wielding commando shows up
right when Lana's getting attacked?

43
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,200
If you wanna help track down
the enigmatic vigilante...

44
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:49,361
...I would be willing to explore
the Jake angle.

45
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:55,539
That would be assuming
I actually had a job here.

46
00:05:56,713 --> 00:06:01,514
Yeah-- It was never clear about
whose choice it was for you to quit.

47
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:06,885
Look, Clark, I could say that I'm swamped
with the Daily Planet column...

48
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:10,321
...but the truth is, it would just be
really nice to have you back.

49
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,774
All right, doctor, I'll have Lex
stop by for an examination...

50
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:28,467
...by the end of the week.

51
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:32,376
All right. And Bob, thanks.

52
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:33,811
Lex.

53
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,577
Welcome back to LuthorCorp, son.

54
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:39,017
Feels like I never left.

55
00:06:39,188 --> 00:06:42,487
You'll have the office next to mine.
You've got the river view.

56
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:45,594
I appreciate the gesture,
but I'm not here to enjoy the scenery.

57
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:50,222
-I'm here to generate profits.
-Lex, you already have the job.

58
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,664
And now you've entered
the executive ranks...

59
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:55,998
...you need to fill out
some paperwork. Coffee?

60
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,705
I'm good.

61
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:05,709
-Corporate life insurance?
-Standard for all upper-level employees.

62
00:07:06,549 --> 00:07:09,040
Is $50 million standard?

63
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:12,788
Don't underestimate
your own value, my son.

64
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:18,053
You seem reluctant, Lex.
I don't understand.

65
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:20,252
It's hard not to consider
the implications...

66
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,990
...when your mortality has a dollar sign
attached to it.

67
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:29,002
Lex, I'd hoped we'd moved
beyond this distrust reflex of yours.

68
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:34,335
-It's called common sense.
-No, you're a corporate asset, Lex.

69
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,171
If something should happen to you...

70
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:39,474
...the company needs to be
compensated for its loss.

71
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:46,718
All right. That's unacceptable to you.
I understand.

72
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:51,349
You can give your security card
to Nelson on your way out.

73
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:00,731
Hey, Lana. How you doing?

74
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:03,167
Hi. I haven't seen you in a while.

75
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:05,398
I thought it might be easier that way.

76
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:07,236
Easier on whom?

77
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:13,380
I didn't come here to upset you.
I'm doing a story on Jake for the Torch.

78
00:08:14,384 --> 00:08:16,477
That's great, Clark.
What do you want to know?

79
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:18,780
You told the police he had
a friend with him...

80
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:21,253
...and I was wondering
if you could point him out.

81
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,365
-I think that's him.
-Van McNulty. Thanks.

82
00:08:33,503 --> 00:08:35,403
Glad I could be of help.

83
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:37,129
Lana.

84
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,270
Is this on or off the record?

85
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:48,845
I'm sorry I haven't stopped by.

86
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,988
Clark, I know we're not
together anymore...

87
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:56,284
...but you don't need an excuse
to come see me.

88
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:02,596
Hey. So we can rule out
the Himalayan yoga masters.

89
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:05,757
Check out what my connection
at the coroner's office gave me.

90
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:09,098
You're not gonna see any of this
in Jake's official autopsy report.

91
00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:14,439
-Believe it or not, they're gills.
-That's disgusting.

92
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,943
Personally, I find the gaping
bullet wound more disturbing.

93
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:22,012
Okay, if that shooter hadn't shown up
when he did, I'd be dead.

94
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:24,278
So forgive me if I don't have
more sympathy...

95
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:26,945
...for the gill-boy
who tried to drown me.

96
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,388
Jake was exposed to the meteor rocks.
He didn't ask for them.

97
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,393
No, just like Greg Arkin didn't ask
to become a bug-boy...

98
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:36,396
...and Tina Greer didn't ask
to become a bone-morpher.

99
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:41,560
The fact is, when they got their powers,
they went psycho and tried to kill me.

100
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:43,968
Tina even came back for seconds.

101
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:48,970
Chloe's been attacked by more
of them than me.

102
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:51,113
You remember Justin Gaines
and Sean Kelvin.

103
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,876
Yeah. One tried to psychically impale me
with farm implements...

104
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:59,453
...and the other just wanted my body heat.
Thanks for the memories.

105
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:02,284
I'm just saying a shot in the head
is more extreme.

106
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,052
What about the times that you
saved us from these people?

107
00:10:05,228 --> 00:10:07,287
What makes you so different
from the shooter?

108
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:08,987
I've never killed anyone.

109
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:13,465
Then how do you explain Tina Greer?
They found her body impaled in the alley.

110
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:15,536
What happened to her, she did to herself.

111
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:17,605
I was protecting you.

112
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:22,277
Spoken like a true vigilante.

113
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:36,921
Miss Sullivan. What a nice surprise.

114
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:40,028
Have you brought me an addendum
to your report on Clark Kent?

115
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:42,323
It's my final article for the Daily Planet.

116
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:44,261
I'm turning in my resignation today.

117
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:49,533
Our agreement is terminated.

118
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:52,265
I'm sorry. Clark's friendship
just means too much to me.

119
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:56,537
I can't say it's unexpected,
but it will be disappointing.

120
00:10:56,712 --> 00:11:00,978
I'm sorry. I guess some people are just
better at leading double lives than others.

121
00:11:01,784 --> 00:11:04,412
You misunderstand me, Miss Sullivan.

122
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:08,650
I'm not the one who's
going to be disappointed.

123
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:10,349
That'll be your father.

124
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:13,756
What does he have to do with any of this?

125
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,522
I guess he wanted to surprise you.

126
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:18,565
But your father just made
a sizable down payment...

127
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:21,134
...on a new house
overlooking the golf course.

128
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:25,437
My dad still hasn't paid off
the new water heater.

129
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:28,042
I seriously doubt he's moving us
to "brat flats."

130
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:30,907
Well, it must be his way of celebrating
his new promotion.

131
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,607
When I rewarded him for his hard work
and his dedication to LuthorCorp...

132
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:37,651
...he was just brimming with pride.

133
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:43,557
He'd be devastated if he suddenly
found himself unemployed.

134
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:47,930
-You can't do this to him.
-Yes, I can.

135
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,258
But I won't, which is why
I think we are going to enjoy...

136
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:54,528
...a long and fruitful partnership,
Miss Sullivan.

137
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:05,342
Van McNulty?

138
00:12:05,514 --> 00:12:07,379
-Hey.
-Clark Kent.

139
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:11,183
I'm sorry to hear about your friend Jake.

140
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:12,651
Thanks.

141
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:16,656
He was always chasing girls, but I still
can't believe he attacked anybody.

142
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:25,027
Police scanner. I just want to hear
when they catch Jake's killer.

143
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:27,936
I'm doing a story for the Torch.

144
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:30,902
I was wondering if you could give me
some background on Jake.

145
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:33,041
Everything I know is in the police report.

146
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:41,611
Never seen so many medals before.
Is that your dad?

147
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:45,377
Must be a real hero.

148
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:47,583
He was.

149
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:49,247
And he was a great father.

150
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:51,757
We used to do everything together.

151
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:59,663
I'm gonna be late for class.

152
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,679
Hey. Remember the rock that was tossed
next to Jake's body...

153
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:14,407
...with the word "freak" written on it?
It wasn't the first the police found.

154
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:18,417
Meet Leonard Wallace, local mechanic
gunned down two weeks ago.

155
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:20,885
Someone put a similar rock
next to his body.

156
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:22,581
Why do you think he was killed?

157
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:25,784
I can't be sure, but last month,
when my VW Bug was in the shop...

158
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:29,659
...I swear I saw his arm reach
for a wrench three feet under my car.

159
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:34,002
I started a file on him just in case he had
some sort of stretching abilities.

160
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,866
But unlike Jake,
Wallace never went psycho.

161
00:13:38,307 --> 00:13:40,673
So Lana's mystery hero isn't
out to save anyone.

162
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,276
He's hunting them.

163
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,879
Smallville's own version of a hate crime.

164
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:46,571
But why?

165
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:50,017
Revenge.

166
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:57,052
Van McNulty's father was a Marine recruiter
who was killed by Tina Greer.

167
00:13:57,393 --> 00:14:00,658
Tina's dead, so he decides
to go Terminator on the rest.

168
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:04,899
Van's fighting his own personal war.

169
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:11,101
Clark, my definition of "hike"
stopped two miles ago.

170
00:14:11,273 --> 00:14:13,571
We have to get evidence for the police.

171
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:16,177
He came here with his dad.
It'll just take a minute.

172
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:19,075
Yeah, that's what you said
when we broke into his locker...

173
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:21,239
...and his car and his house.

174
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:23,385
Jake was killed by a hunting rifle.

175
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:27,113
Like you can't find one of those
in the back window of every truck in town.

176
00:14:34,663 --> 00:14:37,723
Now, this place needs some
serious Lemon Pledge.

177
00:14:42,905 --> 00:14:45,897
All right, Clark, that's enough.
Let's go. There's nothing here.

178
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:49,841
He's pretty tight with his dad.

179
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:54,005
Clark, the last time I checked, there's
no offense in father and son bonding.

180
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:06,026
Pete, there's a serious arsenal in here.

181
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:09,426
Clark, it's a hunting cabin.
What do you expect?

182
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:44,196
What's Lex Luthor's picture doing there?

183
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,061
Pete, call the sheriff.

184
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:31,003
Lex, get down!

185
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:36,013
Someone's trying to kill him!
Get him inside!

186
00:16:36,185 --> 00:16:37,550
-Get on the perimeter.
-Go!

187
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:41,252
Move it!

188
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:42,822
Let's go!

189
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,348
You're one of them.
I saw you catch that slug.

190
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,384
It was in your hand.

191
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:15,183
What are you,
some kind of bulletproof freak?

192
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:30,036
What's wrong?

193
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:34,833
Does this stuff make you sick
or something?

194
00:17:36,612 --> 00:17:40,981
Look at you. How about a nice big bite
of meteor rock?

195
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:43,375
How's that feel?

196
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,478
Lex.

197
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:13,805
It's all right.

198
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,783
Clark.

199
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,880
How'd you know someone
was gonna try to kill me?

200
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:21,181
It's the same person
who shot Lana's attacker.

201
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:23,257
What would he want with me?

202
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:26,661
Look, I know this is gonna sound bizarre,
but this kid Van...

203
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:31,698
...he's convinced that the meteor rocks
in Smallville have altered certain people.

204
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:34,435
What do you mean by "altered"?

205
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:38,596
He thinks they've developed different
abilities than us, and he's hunting them.

206
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:41,074
Lex, he had a hit list.

207
00:18:41,243 --> 00:18:43,336
They found it in his cabin,
and you're on it.

208
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:46,879
My only abilities are playing the market
and falling for the wrong women.

209
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:48,778
He's obviously crazy.

210
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:51,842
There must be some reason he picked me.

211
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:55,882
Think about it, Clark.
Lex survived the meteor shower...

212
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:58,185
...a near-fatal car accident
and a plane crash.

213
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,488
Even he doesn't have enough money
for a guardian angel like that.

214
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:03,461
Check this out.

215
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,366
His medical records show he has a
white-blood-cell count that is off the charts.

216
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:12,940
-It's more than enough to raise an eyebrow.
-You've been keeping a file on Lex too.

217
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:15,770
Didn't you learn your lesson
about keeping secret files?

218
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:19,107
They're my own private notes.
Since when is curiosity a crime?

219
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:22,910
Since someone took your database
and turned it into a personal hit list.

220
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:26,316
Van had a printout of the same file
on his bulletin board.

221
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:32,056
Van helped network half these computers.

222
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:34,123
He must have cracked my password.

223
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:38,028
Oh, God, Clark.

224
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:40,766
This is all my fault.

225
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:45,003
Chloe, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to blame you.

226
00:19:45,174 --> 00:19:47,870
-It's not like you pulled the trigger.
-No.

227
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:51,342
I just loaded the gun and pointed it
in the right direction.

228
00:19:56,352 --> 00:19:57,944
Where is he?

229
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,578
Lex. Thank God you're all right.

230
00:20:01,757 --> 00:20:04,817
You're now covered
by my personal security.

231
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:06,392
I appreciate the gesture...

232
00:20:06,562 --> 00:20:09,588
...but I'm not gonna let some
adolescent assassin disrupt my life.

233
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:12,825
Don't take that cavalier attitude, Lex.

234
00:20:13,068 --> 00:20:17,232
I wouldn't worry about it, Dad.
I'm insured now.

235
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,510
Not yet. There's some difficulty getting
you underwritten by Lloyd's of London.

236
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:27,980
On what grounds?

237
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,278
Your tendency to attract
near-death experiences...

238
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:33,887
...has made you too great a liability.

239
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:38,190
I would think surviving would
count for something.

240
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,488
You're right. I'll get it straightened out.
Don't worry.

241
00:20:42,364 --> 00:20:43,831
Dad.

242
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:47,593
Before the meteor shower...

243
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:49,768
...was I ever sick?

244
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:56,807
When you were a child, you had asthma.
But other than that, no.

245
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:58,810
Nothing serious.

246
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:07,348
Don't you find it a little strange...

247
00:21:07,523 --> 00:21:10,788
...that I've never been sick
a day in my life since?

248
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,255
What's all this about, Lex?

249
00:21:16,131 --> 00:21:17,598
Nothing.

250
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:21,668
I obviously inherited strong genes.

251
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:36,313
Sheriff Adams, have you found Van yet?

252
00:21:36,485 --> 00:21:39,613
We're looking, but there's no reason
to think he's come back here.

253
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:43,019
I think there is. Take a look at this.

254
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:47,560
One of these people
will be Van's next target.

255
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:49,629
Are we in the psychic business now?

256
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:52,198
Just look at the first three names.

257
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:56,004
Where'd you get this?

258
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,035
A friend who believes these people...

259
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:02,609
...are linked to a certain
phenomena in Smallville.

260
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:04,676
A phenomena, huh?

261
00:22:05,747 --> 00:22:10,047
-It's a little out of my jurisdiction.
-Well, you don't have to believe it's true.

262
00:22:10,352 --> 00:22:13,617
Van McNulty does, and these people are
in a lot of danger.

263
00:22:15,457 --> 00:22:17,391
Can't hurt to be cautious.

264
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,293
How's Lex doing?

265
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:26,026
Okay. I guess.

266
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:28,692
It's not the first time
he's been in the cross hairs.

267
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:31,931
-Are they sure Van was the shooter?
-I am.

268
00:22:34,943 --> 00:22:38,504
Lana, I know he saved your life,
but I don't think that was his intention.

269
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,648
No, it was just a happy accident.

270
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:44,047
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

271
00:22:44,953 --> 00:22:48,218
Clark, I really thought I was going to die.

272
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:51,423
You've been through worse.

273
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:55,689
Because you've been there to protect me.
But I knew you weren't coming this time...

274
00:22:55,864 --> 00:22:59,698
...so when Van showed up, I was relieved
that there were others like you out there.

275
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:01,733
He's not like me.

276
00:23:01,904 --> 00:23:04,202
You have to see him for what he is.
He's a killer.

277
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:07,708
Lana, it's okay to be mad at people
who tried to hurt you.

278
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:11,312
But it's not fair to take it out on everyone
affected by the meteors.

279
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,711
It's not their fault.
No one asked to be different.

280
00:23:16,818 --> 00:23:19,912
Life would just be so much better
for everybody...

281
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:23,057
...if the meteor shower never happened.

282
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:34,600
1 97, 1 98, 1 99.

283
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,048
I've searched everywhere
from here to Metropolis.

284
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:32,481
It's like Van disappeared.

285
00:25:32,654 --> 00:25:34,849
Clark, he can't hide forever.

286
00:25:35,023 --> 00:25:38,618
Every police officer in the state's
looking for him. They'll find him.

287
00:25:38,794 --> 00:25:41,558
I just hope he doesn't find
his next target first.

288
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:45,595
Dad, do you think I'm like Van?

289
00:25:46,902 --> 00:25:49,632
Well, I think you know my answer
to that question, son.

290
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:52,296
The real question is,
do you think you're like Van?

291
00:25:52,474 --> 00:25:56,376
It's just, I've come into contact with
a lot of kryptonite-infected people...

292
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,343
...and it never ends with us
being friends or shaking hands.

293
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:04,076
I gave Lana this whole tolerance speech.

294
00:26:04,252 --> 00:26:06,243
I always assume the worst
about them too.

295
00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:17,164
There could be lots of people out there
who've been infected...

296
00:26:17,332 --> 00:26:19,425
...who lead perfectly normal lives.

297
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:22,393
They're forced to live with their secret.

298
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:25,404
And they could be using
their abilities for good too.

299
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:27,804
I'm gonna get cleaned up.

300
00:27:06,915 --> 00:27:08,177
Clark?

301
00:27:09,217 --> 00:27:10,479
Clark!

302
00:27:15,757 --> 00:27:17,384
-Dad.
-Clark.

303
00:27:17,826 --> 00:27:20,420
I got you.

304
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:22,654
Help!

305
00:27:25,901 --> 00:27:28,699
-How's that coming, sweetheart?
-I got it.

306
00:27:31,106 --> 00:27:32,505
It's okay.

307
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:34,232
It's all right. Hang in there.

308
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:36,343
It's okay. It's all right.

309
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:40,345
He's dying. The poison is
spreading so fast.

310
00:27:40,515 --> 00:27:44,144
Okay, Clark, I'm gonna....
I'm gonna get it out.

311
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:47,287
Clark, you gotta stay still, son.

312
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:49,685
Hold on, baby. Hold on.
Dad's gonna get it.

313
00:27:50,258 --> 00:27:52,453
My God. He's not breathing.

314
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:54,822
All right, hand me those.

315
00:28:00,435 --> 00:28:02,926
Don't you give up on us now, son.

316
00:28:06,107 --> 00:28:07,734
Do you have it?

317
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:09,900
Martha, it's in there so far.

318
00:28:11,112 --> 00:28:14,343
Wait a second. I think I got it.

319
00:28:14,716 --> 00:28:17,651
-Okay.
-Hold on, baby. He's got it.

320
00:28:30,532 --> 00:28:32,397
Get that thing out of here.

321
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:36,169
Clark. Come on, son.

322
00:28:39,574 --> 00:28:41,439
Come on, Clark.

323
00:29:58,553 --> 00:29:59,884
Lana.

324
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:03,150
It's me. Van.

325
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:05,816
-I'm the one who saved you.
-Yeah, I know who you are.

326
00:30:06,861 --> 00:30:10,456
They've got the roads blocked off,
and they're casing my house and my cabin.

327
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:12,725
I need you to help me get out of here.

328
00:30:13,535 --> 00:30:16,834
-Van, I think you should turn yourself in.
-To the police?

329
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:19,974
They're useless. I'm mean,
they should be protecting us.

330
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:22,473
I thought you'd understand.

331
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:25,374
You owe me, Lana. I saved your life.

332
00:30:25,547 --> 00:30:27,105
I know.

333
00:30:27,449 --> 00:30:29,747
But Lex didn't do anything to you.

334
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:31,943
I'm sorry about what happened
to your father.

335
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,748
But going after innocent people
won't bring him back.

336
00:30:34,923 --> 00:30:36,447
These freaks aren't people, Lana.

337
00:30:36,624 --> 00:30:39,286
No matter how much they seem like it.
Look at Jake.

338
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:43,761
All right, he was best friend for three years,
and I had no idea.

339
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:48,762
-And you're being fooled just like I was.
-What do you mean?

340
00:30:48,937 --> 00:30:51,804
Clark Kent is one of them.

341
00:30:54,342 --> 00:30:57,709
-Why would you say that?
-I know he seemed perfectly normal...

342
00:30:57,879 --> 00:31:01,042
...but I saw him catch a bullet, Lana.
In his bare hands.

343
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:04,508
He was a freak just like the rest of them.

344
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:07,987
What do you mean, "was"?

345
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:13,386
Well, let's just say Clark Kent
won't be able to hurt anyone now.

346
00:31:16,164 --> 00:31:18,997
-What did you do?
-I found his weakness.

347
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:22,065
I made special bullets.

348
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:25,903
No.

349
00:31:26,074 --> 00:31:28,907
That freak got exactly what he deserved.

350
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:33,706
Clark is more human
than you will ever be.

351
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:49,085
Get someone to the Kent farm, quick.
Clark Kent's been murdered.

352
00:31:50,598 --> 00:31:53,328
You were in love with that
disgusting mutant, weren't you?

353
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:56,368
You know, there's only one thing
I hate worse than a freak...

354
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:58,130
...and that's a freak-lover.

355
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:05,142
He's coming to.

356
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,279
Clark, how you feeling, son?

357
00:32:10,452 --> 00:32:12,477
-A little woozy.
-Well, you need to lie down.

358
00:32:12,654 --> 00:32:15,179
-Take it slowly.
-No, I need to find Van.

359
00:32:15,356 --> 00:32:17,950
Your wound may be healed,
but you still need to rest.

360
00:32:18,126 --> 00:32:21,459
How can I rest knowing that Van's
out there with a hit list in his hand?

361
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:25,258
Clark, this boy is not like the others.
He has kryptonite bullets.

362
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:27,298
He already tried to kill you once, son.

363
00:32:27,469 --> 00:32:31,337
-I'll not let you give him a second chance.
-I know what I'm up against now.

364
00:32:36,478 --> 00:32:38,969
Mrs. Kent, is Clark all right?

365
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:42,682
Yeah, Clark's fine. Why, sheriff?

366
00:32:45,887 --> 00:32:49,789
Well, rumors of your death have
been greatly exaggerated, Mr. Kent.

367
00:32:56,464 --> 00:32:58,295
Are you sure everything's all right?

368
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,801
Oh, yeah. It was a barbed-wire accident.

369
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:08,202
-What do you mean, rumors of my death?
-Dispatch got a call you'd been murdered.

370
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:14,244
-Who'd make a call like that?
-Beats heck out of me.

371
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:18,046
I don't appreciate crank calls,
especially in the middle of a manhunt.

372
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:20,016
-All clear at the Kent farm.
-Roger.

373
00:33:20,188 --> 00:33:21,780
Over.

374
00:33:26,494 --> 00:33:28,223
Where's your son?

375
00:33:33,868 --> 00:33:36,530
Van, I know you're listening.
You didn't get me.

376
00:33:36,704 --> 00:33:39,798
If you want to finish this, meet me
where I saw your dad's picture.

377
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:41,305
I'm on my way

378
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,211
I don't know how he survived
my first shot...

379
00:33:51,386 --> 00:33:54,048
...but we're gonna see
how he handles a whole clip.

380
00:34:10,205 --> 00:34:14,301
You may have survived one bullet,
but I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

381
00:34:14,475 --> 00:34:16,204
Lana. Let her go!

382
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:20,570
Not until she sees once and for all
that her lover-boy is a freak show.

383
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:31,757
Clark!

384
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:45,497
I told you he was a freak.

385
00:34:49,844 --> 00:34:51,505
You're the freak.

386
00:34:58,786 --> 00:35:00,549
Clark, how did you...?

387
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,020
It's all about dressing for the occasion.

388
00:35:10,265 --> 00:35:12,790
What is that? Lead?

389
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,705
You can rest a bit easier.

390
00:35:27,882 --> 00:35:29,941
Van McNulty's been taken into custody.

391
00:35:30,118 --> 00:35:31,676
He's in the psychiatric ward.

392
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:37,723
I knew Van was misguided,
but I'm not so sure he's insane.

393
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:40,618
What makes you say that?

394
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,930
Churchill once said¡G

395
00:35:44,832 --> 00:35:49,030
"Out of intense complexities,
intense simplicities emerge."

396
00:35:50,638 --> 00:35:53,004
Maybe that kid was right about me.

397
00:35:53,741 --> 00:35:57,507
-Lex, he's a fanatic.
-Oh, but Chloe Sullivan's not?

398
00:35:59,213 --> 00:36:01,738
How many times have I come
face to face with death...

399
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:05,408
...and walked away without a scratch?
I've practically lost count.

400
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:08,685
Weirder things have happened.

401
00:36:09,624 --> 00:36:12,821
I thought the reason I survived
that Porsche accident...

402
00:36:12,994 --> 00:36:15,087
...was because of you, Clark.

403
00:36:15,596 --> 00:36:17,621
Now I'm not so sure.

404
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:21,958
See, I've always tried to explain everything
by looking outside myself.

405
00:36:23,438 --> 00:36:26,999
But maybe the truth lies
inside my own physiology.

406
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:30,908
Maybe I am a freak.

407
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:47,385
Hey, Lana, is everything okay?

408
00:36:47,562 --> 00:36:50,122
I thought we established that
we didn't need a reason...

409
00:36:50,298 --> 00:36:52,061
...to come and see each other.

410
00:36:54,102 --> 00:36:57,833
I didn't get a chance to tell you,
but you really kicked ass yesterday.

411
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,436
Yeah, well, some hero I turned out to be.

412
00:37:01,776 --> 00:37:03,676
You still got shot.

413
00:37:07,582 --> 00:37:09,914
You must be pretty sore.

414
00:37:14,122 --> 00:37:15,885
It still stings a little.

415
00:37:20,928 --> 00:37:23,158
You know...

416
00:37:23,564 --> 00:37:27,591
...I believed Van for a minute
when he told me you were bulletproof.

417
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:29,366
Is that what he told you?

418
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:33,937
It was really comforting to hear.

419
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:36,906
Suddenly, everything made sense.

420
00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:38,409
The tornado.

421
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:40,672
All the times that you've been there.

422
00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:43,783
Everything I can't explain.

423
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,086
I wish the answer was that easy.

424
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,058
But I wasn't infected by the meteor rocks.

425
00:37:58,032 --> 00:37:59,897
If you were...

426
00:38:00,968 --> 00:38:02,993
...it would be okay.

427
00:38:11,913 --> 00:38:13,938
I have to get back to work.

428
00:38:17,618 --> 00:38:21,987
What I don't understand is
you're willing to walk into bullets for me...

429
00:38:22,156 --> 00:38:24,716
...but you won't share
what's going on inside.

430
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:35,830
Clark, if you don't open up to the people
that love you, you'll always be alone.

431
00:38:36,003 --> 00:38:39,336
I can't believe you want
to spend your life like that.

432
00:38:42,643 --> 00:38:45,077
I may not have a choice.

433
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:49,678
You always have a choice.

434
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,185
You hit a glitch, Miss Sullivan?

435
00:39:25,353 --> 00:39:28,345
I know a very capable
computer technician...

436
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:30,957
...who might have some familiarity
with your setup.

437
00:39:31,425 --> 00:39:33,222
How could I be so idiotic?

438
00:39:33,394 --> 00:39:36,921
You donate the computers and then
send your experts in to set them up.

439
00:39:37,098 --> 00:39:40,499
Yeah, philanthropy.
I've always prided myself on that.

440
00:39:40,668 --> 00:39:43,796
What about tampering with a high school
student's personal computer?

441
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:47,372
I think you'll find
your personal computer is on loan...

442
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:51,376
...to the school as the property
of the LuthorCorp Foundation.

443
00:39:51,846 --> 00:39:53,973
You are so low, you're subterranean.

444
00:39:54,148 --> 00:39:58,050
Clark's files aren't on this hard drive.
Do you really think I'd be that stupid?

445
00:39:58,219 --> 00:40:01,052
My interest doesn't end with Clark Kent.

446
00:40:01,222 --> 00:40:04,248
I'm intrigued by your whole body of work.

447
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:09,325
I hate to see your valuable research
evaporate into the ether...

448
00:40:09,497 --> 00:40:13,433
...but I will not allow information that
concerns my son to be made available...

449
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:17,697
...to anyone who can hack their way
into your personal files.

450
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:20,770
Mr. Luthor, I'm very sorry
about what happened to Lex.

451
00:40:20,942 --> 00:40:24,742
These files were never meant to be
seen by anyone other than me.

452
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:27,309
I warn you...

453
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:31,941
...if I ever catch you investigating
a member of my family again...

454
00:40:32,553 --> 00:40:36,284
...a computer glitch will be
the least of your problems.

455
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:43,061
Good night, Miss Sullivan.

456
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
