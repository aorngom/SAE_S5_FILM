1
00:00:01,884 --> 00:00:04,768
<i>Pentagon officials continue
to deny any security breach</i>

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,090
<i>and any responsibility
for the events of dark Thursday.</i>

3
00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:12,069
<i>Experts predicted the recovery
from dark Thursday will take years.</i>

4
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:15,897
<i>But here in metropolis, the cleanup
effort has been remarkably swift.</i>

5
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:20,817
<i>The public is stunned at how fast
rubble has been cleared from the streets.</i>

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,264
<i>This is Genevieve Sparling reporting live...</i>

7
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:27,092
You've been out again all night, haven't you ?

8
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:29,355
Can't do what I need to do in the daylight.

9
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,396
Clark, I know you want to help, but...

10
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:36,751
You can't single-handedly rebuild
everything that's been destroyed.

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,166
It's my mess, mom. I need to clean it up.

12
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:41,784
You're not responsible for what happened.

13
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:43,078
Zod is.

14
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:46,283
Zod would not have been released

15
00:00:46,427 --> 00:00:48,961
if, for once in my life, I had listened to Jor-El...

16
00:00:49,856 --> 00:00:51,663
and done what he asked me to do.

17
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:57,463
I have chores to do.

18
00:00:57,486 --> 00:00:58,211
Hey.

19
00:00:59,388 --> 00:01:00,032
Hey.

20
00:01:01,407 --> 00:01:02,551
Are you okay ?

21
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:04,682
Yeah, I’m fine.

22
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,522
Clark, wait, wait, wait.

23
00:01:08,106 --> 00:01:10,050
I’ve never seen you this worn out.

24
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,393
Even you have your limits.

25
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:14,021
The chores can wait.

26
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:14,992
I’m okay.

27
00:01:15,717 --> 00:01:17,211
Really, I’m fine.

28
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,381
"Sneeze"

29
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:40,030
For someone about to change addresses,
You're travelling pretty light.

30
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:44,103
Yeah. Well, I don't need a lot.
It's only temporary.

31
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:46,791
They think the school should
reopen by next semester.

32
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:50,063
It was nice of you to offer
me a room at the mansion.

33
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,800
I don't know what I would have done.

34
00:03:56,925 --> 00:04:01,690
Lex, if you're not okay with this and
having second thoughts, then let's talk.

35
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:07,070
There's nothing to talk about.
Everything's great.

36
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:24,150
Clark, was that the first
time you ever sneezed ?

37
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:27,900
Mm-Hmm, and the first time I’ve had a
scratchy throat with my ears all plugged up.

38
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:30,371
- 98.6.
- No fever.

39
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:33,750
I’m no doctor, but it seems
like it's just a common cold.

40
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:38,930
You're far from common, Clark. I don't
remember you ever even having the sniffles.

41
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:41,710
I’ve never pushed myself
so far into overdrive before.

42
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:45,280
You said when you were in that
zone, your powers were gone.

43
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:47,833
That means your immune system was normal.

44
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,993
You could have been exposed to something there.

45
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:52,562
Whatever it is, I’m not really that sick.

46
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:58,191
Hey. You guys are not gonna
believe what just happened to me.

47
00:04:58,225 --> 00:05:01,051
I’m out there jogging along,
minding my own business

48
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:02,631
when, out of nowhere,

49
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:06,291
a barn door comes falling from the
clear, blue sky and almost crushes me.

50
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:07,772
How does that happen ?

51
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:12,221
Maybe it fell from an airplane.

52
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:16,392
Good guess, but the only thing up there
was a severely traumatized sparrow.

53
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:22,791
Uh-Oh, does Clarky have the sniffles ?

54
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:25,731
It's just a little cold.

55
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:29,640
Well, lucky for you, I have the perfect remedy...

56
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:32,671
honey and a little bit of cayenne pepper.
Works every time.

57
00:05:32,828 --> 00:05:35,572
First you sneeze a bunch of times,
but then you're pretty much cured.

58
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:36,712
Lois, I’ll pass.

59
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:39,001
I think we're all out of cayenne, Lois.

60
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,931
No, you're not. I’m gonna whip up
a little bit of something here.

61
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:52,040
Where did your barn door go ?

62
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:55,870
It was here late last night when I came
to drop off the documents, and now it's gone.

63
00:05:57,217 --> 00:05:58,910
Look at that. It is gone.

64
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:02,382
And it's been ripped right off its hinges.

65
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:06,941
Oh, my god, that barn door.
I knew it looked familiar.

66
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,641
Now, how in the world does that happen ?

67
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:24,940
Mr. Pontius. What the
hell am I paying you for ?

68
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,091
I was followed again today.

69
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:30,662
Black range rover, edge city plates ?

70
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:34,460
I tracked it to an abandoned factory
on 5th and Hayworth.

71
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:36,213
Why are you still here ?

72
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,831
I’m on my way.

73
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:43,821
I want this taken care of
by any means necessary.

74
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:45,522
Do you understand ?

75
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:56,303
I had no idea I was moving into a fortress.

76
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:59,733
Everywhere I turn, there's another security guard.

77
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:03,992
Lana, that gentleman's not a security guard.

78
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:07,121
He's a private investigator.

79
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:12,540
Over the last few days, it's
become clear I’m being followed.

80
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:13,773
By who ?

81
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:19,891
Well, I doubt I have to look much further
than the lowest branch in the family tree, but...

82
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:23,071
- I can't be sure.
- Have you called the police ?

83
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:26,580
After breaking every law imaginable
while I was inhabited by Zod,

84
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:28,953
I don't want to go anywhere near a badge.

85
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,100
I can't trust anyone, not even my own security.

86
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:37,120
You can trust me.

87
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:41,781
Of course I can.

88
00:07:44,135 --> 00:07:45,733
And I want you to have this...

89
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:49,741
In case of an emergency.

90
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:54,072
He's the best P. I. in Metropolis.

91
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:57,660
If anything happens to me,
you need to call that number,

92
00:07:57,908 --> 00:07:59,190
Not the police.

93
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:01,572
Robert Pontius will make sure you're safe.

94
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:03,311
Lex, don't talk like that.

95
00:08:04,157 --> 00:08:06,020
I’m just being cautious.

96
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:23,190
Chloe...

97
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:25,972
How's this for a megadose of guilt money ?

98
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:29,882
Well, uh...
I’ve got bigger news.

99
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:32,390
What happened ? Is everything all right ?

100
00:08:33,886 --> 00:08:35,100
I sneezed.

101
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:38,381
And ?

102
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:40,423
And ? Chloe, that's not normal.

103
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:43,501
Clark, nothing with you is exactly normal,

104
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,613
But  I wouldn't call sneezing today's headline.

105
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,440
You don't understand. I...

106
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:49,150
I  was...

107
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:52,122
You what ?
Grab a tissue and get over it.

108
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:01,872
Gesundheit.

109
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:05,710
I tried to warn you.
I’ve come down with some sort of cold.

110
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:08,003
And become a walking air cannon.

111
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:10,322
Let's get you out of here before you blow again.

112
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:12,991
At least I was able to cover half my face that time.
This morning I...

113
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:16,112
I blew the barn door halfway across small county.

114
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,642
It almost hit Lois.

115
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:19,341
Lois, as in Lane ?

116
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:21,883
Now she's on a one-woman
crusade to find an explanation.

117
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:24,141
You know her. She won't
stop digging until she hits china.

118
00:09:24,178 --> 00:09:27,600
I’ll take care of Lois.
You just take care of that cold.

119
00:09:27,637 --> 00:09:29,361
We have enough natural
disasters around here

120
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:32,411
Without having to worry about hurricane
Clark looming off the coast.

121
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:33,250
No !

122
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,962
Just kidding.

123
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:53,122
Well, I forgot what a
concerned parent you are.

124
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,443
That's why you're having
me followed, isn't it ?

125
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:57,880
To make sure I don't destroy
the rest of the world ?

126
00:09:58,145 --> 00:10:00,681
If I were having you followed, son,

127
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:03,170
You would never know it.
I can guarantee you that.

128
00:10:03,196 --> 00:10:06,310
I hate to disappoint you, but
whatever powers I had are long gone.

129
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:09,210
So if you're looking for an encore
performance, you're out of luck.

130
00:10:09,257 --> 00:10:10,903
Elvis has left the building.

131
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:13,012
You want to find out who's stalking you ?

132
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:14,941
I suggest you concentrate

133
00:10:14,956 --> 00:10:20,103
On remembering every little
minute detail of that horrific day.

134
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:23,281
Well, I guess I should have kept a blog...

135
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:26,342
because I suffered a total memory loss.

136
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,942
Besides what Lana has told
me, those 24 hours are gone.

137
00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:34,743
The atrocities you committed...

138
00:10:34,788 --> 00:10:38,242
they could have been witnessed by anyone.
Lex, please, let me help you.

139
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:41,673
I’ve been on the receiving end of your
help before, Dad. I think I’ll pass.

140
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:50,462
Listen to me. There are some adversaries
that cannot be defeated alone !

141
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,051
Lex ! Lex !

142
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:39,981
The bear is hibernating, over.

143
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:53,433
How you doing ?

144
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,116
This is one part about being human I don't envy.

145
00:11:57,711 --> 00:11:59,204
It's not all that bad.

146
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:01,518
You can lie on the couch
all day and watch DVDs

147
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:04,363
While your mom makes some
doctor-certified chicken soup.

148
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:08,163
Mom, I can watch DVDs after
I fix the irrigation ditch.

149
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:11,673
No, your health is a lot more important
than the irrigation ditch.

150
00:12:12,318 --> 00:12:16,540
You're in uncharted waters now, Clark,
and your dad's not here to help us out, so...

151
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,392
please, you have to trust
my instincts and rest.

152
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:21,841
Okay ?

153
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:27,792
Lionel.

154
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:29,661
Is everything all right ?

155
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:30,771
Lex.

156
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:33,551
He's gone. I think he's been abducted.

157
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:37,443
Who do you think's behind it ?

158
00:12:39,118 --> 00:12:43,063
Considering what he stole from the pentagon,
my initial reaction was the, uh...

159
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:48,400
government, But after I spoke to my
contacts in Washington, I don't think so.

160
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:51,661
You have to find him, Clark.

161
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:54,931
Why ? Lex and I have nothing to
do with each other anymore.

162
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:56,703
But you and Zod do.

163
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:03,382
Lex insists he can't remember anything that
happened when he was possessed by Zod,

164
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:07,842
But he might not be honest about it.
He might remember it all.

165
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:13,101
Whoever his captors are, if they put enough
pressure on him, he could tell the truth...

166
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,272
about you.

167
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:36,022
Well, good morning, Mr. Invincible.

168
00:13:38,308 --> 00:13:39,332
Where am I ?

169
00:13:40,147 --> 00:13:43,313
In your cage, where every lab rat belongs.

170
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:46,813
Oh, and before you even try escaping,

171
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:50,872
You might want to consider you're hooked up
to enough wattage to drop an elephant.

172
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:51,863
Who are you ?

173
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:57,321
Just someone who's interested in how
you possess superhuman powers.

174
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:00,082
Powers ?

175
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:04,271
I don't know what you're talking about.

176
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:07,332
Oh, come on, Lex !

177
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:09,953
We both know you were
the one at the Pentagon,

178
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:13,073
swatting away those bullets
like they were mosquitoes...

179
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:15,573
and not even a scratch.

180
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:17,521
Yeah, see, we...

181
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,402
We saw it on the only working
satellite on dark Thursday.

182
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:25,130
So we know you have the powers.

183
00:14:25,736 --> 00:14:27,672
We kind of want to know how you got them.

184
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,262
My people are already onto you.

185
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:32,833
Your people ?

186
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:38,932
I  think that's the guy that I caught
kind of roaming around outside.

187
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:40,171
Pontius, right ?

188
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:43,252
That's the guy with the bullet in his head.

189
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,483
Enough foreplay.

190
00:14:47,735 --> 00:14:50,141
All right ? Let's get this started.

191
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,363
You're gonna tell me everything.

192
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:08,180
See, I told you. I am no chicken
little, and that is no acorn.

193
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:08,951
Whoa.

194
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:12,883
How is that even remotely conceivable ?
The Kents live miles away from here.

195
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:15,242
It's definitely weird. I’ll give you that.

196
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:19,031
But it's not "wall of weird."
It's called a microburst.

197
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:20,492
Micro what ?

198
00:15:20,526 --> 00:15:25,233
It's like a sudden, mini tornado. It happens when
there are extreme changes In the temperature.

199
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,933
It's actually not that unheard
of in the Midwest.

200
00:15:28,017 --> 00:15:31,241
It was sunny and 75. There was
nothing extreme about the weather.

201
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:35,093
Well, you might not have felt it. It was
probably in the upper atmosphere. But

202
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:39,022
there must have been some sort of
change in the barometric pressures.

203
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:42,370
Either you've been watching too much weather channel

204
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:45,510
or a year at the daily planet has
turned you into a hardened sceptic.

205
00:15:45,538 --> 00:15:48,622
It's called being realistic.
You might want to try it once in a while.

206
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:50,332
You were the one who always told me

207
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:53,360
that science can explain only a fraction
of what happens in this crazy town.

208
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:56,303
And this happens to fall into that fraction.

209
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,911
Look, Lois, I still believe in
the paranormal. Trust me.

210
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:02,540
But you have to accept the fact that
sometimes the answers you're looking for

211
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:05,693
are no further away than the front
pages of your scientific American.

212
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:19,723
What are you doing with the gun ?

213
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,571
We were specifically told not to use violence.

214
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:25,001
So  ?

215
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:28,762
I don't answer to anybody, okay ?
Especially your boss.

216
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:33,561
What I want to know is how bullets bounced
off his body like ping-pong balls.

217
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:38,062
Now, information like that is very
valuable on the open market.

218
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:41,631
You were specifically hired to...

219
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:42,703
Yeah, well, guess what ?

220
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,742
I’m an entrepreneur, okay ?

221
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:50,593
So either you join my newest venture,
or you can end up like the Pontius guy.

222
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:52,262
Your choice.

223
00:16:58,246 --> 00:16:59,011
Hey, Lex !

224
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:05,211
Hey, I was thinking. Why don't
we try a little experiment ?

225
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:06,893
What are you doing ?

226
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,122
I told you, I don't remember
any of what's happening.

227
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,953
Yeah, but it did. And I want
to see it happen again.

228
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:15,721
Please don't. No.

229
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:19,851
Oh, God !

230
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:38,122
Lois...

231
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:40,071
What are you doing here ?

232
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:43,562
I wanted to personally hand-deliver
this article to your editor.

233
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:46,093
An article ? You're a journalist now ?

234
00:17:46,488 --> 00:17:47,232
Yeah.

235
00:17:47,378 --> 00:17:50,251
Wow ! That's a lot of words.

236
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:55,833
Well, the Smallville Ledger was way too small-minded
to appreciate investigative reportage, so

237
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,342
I thought the Planet would
be the perfect publisher.

238
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:02,350
Lois, I hate to be the one
to rain on your Pulitzer parade,

239
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:06,180
But I really don't think
that a story about weather

240
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,402
Is gonna stand a chance when we're still dealing
with the aftermath of dark Thursday.

241
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:13,173
No, this story is way more
than about wild weather, okay ?

242
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,043
Not only is it an exposé
on the paranormal,

243
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:18,951
It is a story about human
triumph over adversity.

244
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:21,562
That barn door could have
chopped me in half. Read it.

245
00:18:22,198 --> 00:18:25,523
Funny, I don't remember there
being an "e" in "tornado."

246
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:29,391
- Just a little typo.
- Hmm, and the extra "h" in "weather" ?

247
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:30,912
You know what I think ?

248
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:32,902
I think that you're just a little bit jealous

249
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:36,570
That you're not the only one in the family
with a natural way with words.

250
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,722
Really ? Well, Lo, you know, you're right.

251
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:42,212
I might be jealous of you, but
words have nothing to do with it.

252
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:45,511
Fine. Forget the Daily Planet.

253
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:48,402
I don't need this stuffy,
pseudo-intellectual rag.

254
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:52,002
Out there somewhere is a newspaper
that knows a story when they see one.

255
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:53,732
Well, good luck.

256
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:54,672
Thank you.

257
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:13,681
Lana...

258
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:18,873
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?

259
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:24,532
Actually, I'm living here now.

260
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:27,631
If you're looking for Lex, he's not here.

261
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:31,433
Lex is gone missing, Lana.

262
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:33,923
I think he may have been kidnapped.

263
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:35,353
Oh, god.

264
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:40,212
Did he mentionned recent
threats against him ?

265
00:19:44,177 --> 00:19:46,993
Lana, if you got information, that
might be able to help me find him...

266
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:49,412
I don't understand Clark.

267
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,733
Why are you the leader
of the search party ?

268
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:53,560
Lana,

269
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:57,690
no matter what my differences are with
Lex, I don't want to see him get hurt.

270
00:19:58,735 --> 00:20:01,082
Or maybe you have your own reasons ?

271
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:07,653
Clark, how did you know that Lex was going to be
transformed into that monster before anyone else ?

272
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:13,492
Did  you tell Lex about this ?

273
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:16,810
Not yet.

274
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:22,543
Clark, I want an answer.

275
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:26,351
You can't keep secrets when
Lex's life is in danger.

276
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,010
If I had all the answers,
I wouldn't be here, Lana.

277
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:31,930
I just want to help find Lex.

278
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,803
Then do it.

279
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:44,682
Don't pretend you're doing it for him.

280
00:21:23,587 --> 00:21:25,451
<i>You've reached Pontius security.</i>

281
00:21:25,837 --> 00:21:27,393
<i>Leave you name and number.</i>

282
00:22:40,487 --> 00:22:41,562
<i>Pontius !</i>

283
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:44,473
<i>What the hell am I paying you for ?</i>

284
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,680
<i>I was followed again today.</i>

285
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:50,370
<i>black range Rover, Edge City plates ?</i>

286
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,090
<i>I tracked it to an abandoned factory
on 5th and Hayworth.</i>

287
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:56,471
<i>- Why are you still here ?
- I'm on my way.</i>

288
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:08,972
What is it that turns

289
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:12,712
a weak, hairless punk into
some superhuman Goliath ?

290
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,252
I honestly don't know.

291
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:17,650
Well, I honestly don't believe you.

292
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:23,960
And we know Luthor Corp conducts research
involving genetically enhanced human strength.

293
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:27,400
Now, you obviously did
something to yourself.

294
00:23:28,956 --> 00:23:29,951
What was it ?

295
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:31,290
You really want to know ?

296
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:35,782
A being from another dimension...

297
00:23:36,606 --> 00:23:38,501
actually, another planet...

298
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:41,872
inhabited my body and gave me powers.

299
00:23:43,327 --> 00:23:45,632
It sounds ridiculous, but it's true.

300
00:23:47,147 --> 00:23:50,482
When he left me, the powers went with him.

301
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:53,072
That's it.

302
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:55,552
That's all I know.

303
00:24:02,037 --> 00:24:04,742
Are you mocking me ?

304
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:09,172
Now, why would I mock a guy who just shot me ?

305
00:24:11,306 --> 00:24:13,232
You know, the first gunshot

306
00:24:13,606 --> 00:24:15,932
was a minor flesh wound, Lex.

307
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,063
But this one may sting a little more.

308
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:22,132
Do you want to keep your
new girlfriend happy ?

309
00:24:22,175 --> 00:24:23,001
All right !

310
00:24:23,526 --> 00:24:24,832
All right, you win.

311
00:24:25,486 --> 00:24:26,732
There's a serum.

312
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:30,660
It's in a lab on the 33rd floor of Luthor Corp.

313
00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:32,911
It's in the vault in the center cabinet.

314
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:36,593
The code is julian452.

315
00:24:44,755 --> 00:24:46,063
Wagner, go.

316
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:27,490
Lionel Luthor.

317
00:25:29,816 --> 00:25:32,753
All those hostile takeovers
haven't aged you a bit.

318
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:37,092
Tell me, what's your secret ?

319
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:41,292
Well, perhaps I should give
some credit to a nightly nip.

320
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:44,512
This 40-Year-Old highland scotch

321
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:48,970
Certainly helps to smooth the stress.
I vigorously recommend it.

322
00:25:49,145 --> 00:25:51,453
Welcome to Metropolis, Oliver.

323
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,823
It's a nice gesture.

324
00:25:55,098 --> 00:25:57,683
So I guess I shouldn't be
surprised, should I ?

325
00:25:58,138 --> 00:25:59,912
You've always been so generous.

326
00:26:01,035 --> 00:26:03,251
You know, Oliver, when
I read in the papers,

327
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:06,842
"Oliver queen moves to Metropolis,"
I was very curious.

328
00:26:07,007 --> 00:26:10,190
You've  made such a name
for yourself in star city.

329
00:26:10,217 --> 00:26:12,193
Why would you relocate ?

330
00:26:13,985 --> 00:26:17,123
Well... How can you resist these views ?

331
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:20,193
Not to mention the crisp,
Midwestern air.

332
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:26,592
You had a chance to touch
base with my son yet ?

333
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:28,841
Haven't had a chance.
Been meaning to.

334
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:32,983
How is old Lex doing, by the way ?
Has he finally managed to step out of your shadow ?

335
00:26:33,047 --> 00:26:35,860
Oh, he's changed a lot since your, uh...

336
00:26:36,097 --> 00:26:38,240
boarding-school days together.

337
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:40,321
Hmm. Well, we all have.

338
00:26:41,645 --> 00:26:44,710
You know what, Lionel ? You've inspired me.
I’m gonna give him a call.

339
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:47,132
Yeah. I’ll call him today.

340
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,933
You could have a hard time
reaching him. Lex, it seems,

341
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:52,630
has been abducted.

342
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,142
He's been abducted.

343
00:26:55,257 --> 00:26:56,262
My god.

344
00:26:57,206 --> 00:26:59,790
Oh. Oh, Oliv...
I remember,

345
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:03,833
in the excelsior school plays,
you were always so good.

346
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:06,111
So convincing.

347
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:11,130
Lionel, I’m involved in a lot of business
ventures, as you know. But I can assure you...

348
00:27:14,696 --> 00:27:16,503
...kidnapping is not one of them.

349
00:27:19,668 --> 00:27:23,053
I remember you have an
unpleasant history with my son.

350
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:27,552
And I know queen industries had the
only working satellite on dark Thursday.

351
00:27:27,836 --> 00:27:28,673
Hmm.

352
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:34,131
I know. I know, Oliver.
You've suffered through a lot

353
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:37,813
in your young life, but
if you have so much

354
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:41,723
as laid a hand on Lex,
the word "suffer"

355
00:27:42,555 --> 00:27:44,962
Will take on a whole
new meaning to you.

356
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,543
Sods like a threat.

357
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:57,191
Have a pleasant stay
in Metropolis, Oliver...

358
00:27:58,585 --> 00:28:00,322
...however brief it is.

359
00:28:17,455 --> 00:28:18,223
Hey.

360
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:19,163
Hey.

361
00:28:19,187 --> 00:28:21,991
I never thought I'd utter these words,
but you don't look so hot.

362
00:28:22,015 --> 00:28:23,173
I don't feel so hot.

363
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:26,991
Had to bail out of superspeed around 3rd
avenue and jogged the rest of the way.

364
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:30,013
Then take a seat. Calm down.

365
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:32,822
But if you feel even the
slightest inkling of a sneeze,

366
00:28:32,856 --> 00:28:35,772
you cover your face and ziploc it shut, okay ?

367
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:42,690
I went to Lex's mansion.

368
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:45,520
I saw Lana.

369
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:51,283
So you know about their
new domestic partnership.

370
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:56,462
It's like we don't even
know each other anymore.

371
00:28:58,085 --> 00:28:59,981
I told her about Lex. She...

372
00:29:00,395 --> 00:29:03,470
She made a phone call to someone
named Robert Pontius.

373
00:29:04,678 --> 00:29:07,143
The highest-Paid sam
spade in Metropolis ?

374
00:29:08,298 --> 00:29:10,243
Maybe Lex knew he was in trouble.

375
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,502
I want to talk to this guy
and see what he knows.

376
00:29:14,437 --> 00:29:19,643
When you escaped from the Kryptonian land
of the lost, I bet you didn't think that you'd

377
00:29:19,687 --> 00:29:23,341
be rewarded By having to save Lex Luthor
while battling a raging head cold, huh ?

378
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:26,030
Not exactly the goodbye
gift I was expecting, no.

379
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,520
I guess heroes don't get sick days.

380
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:33,643
They also don't put the world in jeopardy on an annual basis.

381
00:29:34,346 --> 00:29:35,660
I’m no hero, Chloe.

382
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,520
There it is. 515 grant street.

383
00:29:38,586 --> 00:29:39,791
Okay, let's get out of here.

384
00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:41,573
Chloe. This could be dangerous.

385
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:43,002
Yeah, especially for you.

386
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,933
You barely got here. You
need to conserve your energy.

387
00:29:48,295 --> 00:29:49,390
Oh, god.

388
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:54,851
Quick hands. You're getting good at that.

389
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,061
Chloe, it's Lana.

390
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:16,451
Whenever you get this message,
I need you to check out an address...

391
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:19,550
1024 Hayworth.
Call me.

392
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,160
Looking for Lex ?

393
00:30:30,438 --> 00:30:31,520
You okay ?

394
00:30:31,987 --> 00:30:32,852
Perfect.

395
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,960
God, and I was expecting
ceiling fans and cigarette butts.

396
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:39,393
I think this guy can afford central air.

397
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:45,482
All right, I’m a decent hacker,
but I’m not a miracle worker.

398
00:30:45,515 --> 00:30:48,833
You really don't give me enough credit
for this stuff. It's not that easy.

399
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:52,951
Chloe...

400
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,820
With these encryptions, it's gonna take
me hours to get into Lex's account.

401
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:59,660
Chloe... There's a hidden door in the wall.

402
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:04,203
Even with a stuffy nose, you still got it.

403
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,423
What's wrong ?

404
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:22,613
Guess I’m not 100%.

405
00:31:22,636 --> 00:31:26,922
Yeah, I can see that. Looks like your
batteries are running seriously low.

406
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,810
What about a sneeze ?

407
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:33,561
What about it ?

408
00:31:34,387 --> 00:31:37,923
If your sneeze could blow a barn
door 7 miles across Smallville,

409
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:40,620
I bet you anything you could
take that one out no problem.

410
00:31:40,888 --> 00:31:42,370
Chloe, I just can't force it.

411
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:43,913
Why not ? You can do anything.

412
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:45,960
Except sneeze on command.

413
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:49,482
It's a reflex, not a circus trick.

414
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:52,073
Then blow.

415
00:31:53,658 --> 00:31:55,841
- That's not funny.
- I’m not kidding.

416
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:58,390
With a sneeze like yours, that
says a lot about your lung capacity.

417
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,522
Now just take a really deep breath
and blow it out as hard as you can.

418
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:05,340
That is a steel door. It's not a birthday cake.

419
00:32:05,388 --> 00:32:08,132
I don't see anything else working.
Come on. Let's see what you got.

420
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,590
Huff, puff, and blow this door down.

421
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:41,263
Good thing you didn't have garlic today.

422
00:32:50,996 --> 00:32:55,333
Okay, so either Pontius is interested in
purchasing a used-furniture warehouse or...

423
00:32:55,368 --> 00:32:57,041
This is where he thinks Lex is.

424
00:32:57,966 --> 00:32:59,553
Taxi's leaving. Let's roll.

425
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:00,873
You're not rolling anywhere.

426
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:03,263
In my condition, I can't
guarantee your safety.

427
00:33:03,287 --> 00:33:05,511
I don't want a guarantee,
Clark. I want to help.

428
00:33:05,546 --> 00:33:07,953
Then go back to the Planet.
Wait for me there.

429
00:33:07,975 --> 00:33:09,680
Clark, I don't...

430
00:33:27,037 --> 00:33:28,963
Lex ! Lex, what have
they done to you ?!

431
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:30,640
what is she doing here ?

432
00:33:30,696 --> 00:33:33,580
Well, Lex, let's just say
That she's

433
00:33:33,838 --> 00:33:37,260
here to spend a little
quality time with you.

434
00:33:37,295 --> 00:33:39,662
Let her go. You don't need her.

435
00:33:39,696 --> 00:33:41,641
See, that's not quite true.

436
00:33:41,826 --> 00:33:43,622
Because now that we have your serum,

437
00:33:44,037 --> 00:33:46,560
We're gonna need somebody to use it on.

438
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:48,870
And, uh...

439
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:53,800
I'd say your girlfriend is as good
a guinea pig as anyone, wouldn't you ?

440
00:33:56,677 --> 00:33:58,341
Now, in case...

441
00:33:59,775 --> 00:34:02,953
this stuff really does turn you
into some kind of...

442
00:34:03,635 --> 00:34:05,381
Superchick...

443
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:09,333
Just remember there's a gun
pointed at your boyfriend's head.

444
00:34:09,376 --> 00:34:10,740
- Get away from me.
- Wait.

445
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:13,771
It won't work on her.

446
00:34:14,097 --> 00:34:16,072
The serum was tailored
for my blood chemistry.

447
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:17,140
Lex, no.

448
00:34:20,615 --> 00:34:21,333
Well...

449
00:34:24,335 --> 00:34:26,353
Then I guess it's time to

450
00:34:26,637 --> 00:34:28,852
wake the sleeping dragon, huh ?

451
00:34:36,026 --> 00:34:38,022
Get back !
Stay back.

452
00:34:47,175 --> 00:34:47,982
Bitch.

453
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:06,971
See if there's anything
to cut this fence with.

454
00:35:26,905 --> 00:35:28,261
Lex, the hatch.

455
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,463
Come on, help me !

456
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:51,561
Lana...

457
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:54,900
This is all my fault. I’m so sorry.

458
00:36:36,105 --> 00:36:37,013
Hey !

459
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:40,983
I brought something for us to do
in case the lake's too cold to swim in.

460
00:36:41,017 --> 00:36:44,671
And the great thing is we don't
have to wait for it to get windy.

461
00:36:45,005 --> 00:36:46,103
Gee, thanks ?

462
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:50,482
Come on. Doesn't it make you
wonder what else the possibilities are ?

463
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:54,451
I mean, Clark Kent airlines, non-stop to Metropolis.

464
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:58,970
Miracles really do happen. Man walked
on the moon, call waiting was created,

465
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:02,630
end Lois Lane got her first by-line
on the front page of the inquisitor.

466
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:04,691
Hey, that's great, Lo.

467
00:37:06,076 --> 00:37:08,973
I don't know how I feel
about the alien angle, but...

468
00:37:09,338 --> 00:37:14,472
I wasn't too crazy about the E. T. Spin, either,
but my editor insisted it'd help sell papers, so...

469
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:17,971
Well, let's hear it for
journalistic integrity.

470
00:37:18,396 --> 00:37:21,281
Look, I swear, you guys, when
I was writing that article,

471
00:37:21,426 --> 00:37:24,310
I don't think I’ve ever been happier in my life.

472
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:28,682
The thrill of discovery, the clacking
of keys, the scent of fresh ink.

473
00:37:29,068 --> 00:37:31,260
Yeah, I think I’ve finally
found my calling.

474
00:37:36,145 --> 00:37:38,022
Hey, how about you
come join us at the lake ?

475
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:40,511
We can celebrate your
first article with a splash.

476
00:37:42,157 --> 00:37:43,991
Have you looked up in the sky lately ?

477
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:46,801
Looks like it's gonna rain, and since
I don't like swimming in the rain,

478
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:48,371
I’ll see you guys around.

479
00:38:20,018 --> 00:38:20,870
It works.

480
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:50,642
Hey.

481
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:55,671
When I moved in, you forgot to
mention I'd be living with big brother.

482
00:38:56,158 --> 00:39:00,582
Lana, those are just security cameras to
ensure the safety of everyone on this property.

483
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,012
I see.

484
00:39:12,787 --> 00:39:16,393
Was I breaching security when
I was alone in my bedroom ?

485
00:39:16,795 --> 00:39:17,572
Lana...

486
00:39:18,587 --> 00:39:22,021
Okay, you clearly
have the wrong idea.

487
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:27,291
Those cameras are only viewed
if there's an emergency.

488
00:39:27,996 --> 00:39:30,610
I would never invade
your privacy like that.

489
00:39:30,646 --> 00:39:32,312
But you already have.

490
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:35,503
Lex...

491
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:39,341
The cameras go, or I do.

492
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:44,212
The camera in your room will
be down within the hour,

493
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:47,030
but the rest of them stay.

494
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:51,530
You're free to make other
arrangements, Lana, but...

495
00:39:51,997 --> 00:39:53,803
this is the way I live.

496
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,473
And it's not gonna change.

497
00:40:37,627 --> 00:40:39,933
Thought I made myself clear.

498
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,753
You were only to use violence
if you were in danger.

499
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:48,333
Mr. Queen, I told you.

500
00:40:48,888 --> 00:40:50,391
Block went rogue.

501
00:40:50,676 --> 00:40:53,062
I tried to stop him, but he
would have killed me, too.

502
00:40:53,246 --> 00:40:55,490
Well, we couldn't have that now, could we ?

503
00:40:56,218 --> 00:40:59,532
I guess I’m just gonna have to start
being more careful as to who I trust.

504
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:02,570
Speaking of which, how's
my old buddy Lex doing ?

505
00:41:03,157 --> 00:41:06,370
Whatever powers he had are clearly gone.

506
00:41:10,306 --> 00:41:13,720
But, sir, there was someone
else in the warehouse...

507
00:41:14,676 --> 00:41:17,271
Someone who seems
to have other abilities.

508
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:18,950
Find him.

509
00:41:25,496 --> 00:41:26,780
How about...

510
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:30,220
...Borneo ?

511
