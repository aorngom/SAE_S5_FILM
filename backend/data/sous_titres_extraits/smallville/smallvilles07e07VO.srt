1
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,500
It's good to know
I can still beat you at something.

2
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,365
Thanks for the afternoon, Clark.

3
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,000
Champagne, truffles...
It wasn't even my birthday.

4
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:30,000
Overkill?

5
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,765
No, I loved it.

6
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,510
But normally, that kind of romance
comes with a tag that says...

7
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:40,352
"sorry I wrecked your car or
I accidentally slept with your sister."

8
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,326
Well, to be honest Lana, you...

9
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,200
lately you've seemed a little distant.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,900
I guess I've been busy.

11
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,251
We finally get a chance
to make this relationship work.

12
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:54,803
It's not a big deal. I'm
just getting used to the new live.

13
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,500
Lana, I know what this is really about.

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,565
You do?

15
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,100
Between my cousin
and that crystal from Krypton,

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,465
it's been as far from a normal live
as you can get.

17
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,000
Clark, I wanted normal
I would have rethought the part...

18
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:11,400
about dating a guy
who shoots fire from his eyes.

19
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,800
If everything we've been through
was just for that...

20
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,900
was all worth it.

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,909
We should get out of here.

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,776
Clark!
Clark, are you okay?

23
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:31,296
"Somebody save me"

24
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,714
"Let your warm hands
break right through me"

25
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:40,663
"Somebody save me"

26
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:46,281
"I don't care how you do it"

27
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:51,139
"Just save me, save me"

28
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:52,954
"Come on"

29
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:56,599
"I've been waiting for you"

30
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:06,914
"I've made this whole world shine for you"

31
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:10,938
"Just save me, save me"

32
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:14,866
"Come on"

33
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,629
SMALLVILLE 7x07 "WRATH"
Subtitles subXpacio

34
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,596
Lana, you have to be careful
with this speed thing. It's a little...

35
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,678
I was moving and
everything else was frozen.

36
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,758
Clark, this is so cool. How come
you didn't tell me it was like this.

37
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,400
One of those had-to-be-there kind of things.

38
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,121
Listen Lana, it took me
a lot of time to adjust.

39
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,215
Relax, Clark. You live
with these abilities every day.

40
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,250
I think I can handle it.

41
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:44,192
Yeah, but we don't know that for sure.

42
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,263
And Lana, a human with
my abilities can be dangerous.

43
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:48,199
We have to find a way to get rid of them.

44
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:53,262
Eventually yes, but being on an equal
playing field could have its benefits.

45
00:04:53,436 --> 00:04:55,247
Like what?

46
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,506
Lana.

47
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,201
I don't think that's
such a good idea. It...

48
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,600
There's no harm in trying.

49
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,900
Lana...

50
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,618
I guess I should go out and fix the barn.

51
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,817
You're X-raying me?

52
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:26,200
My God, that's amazing!

53
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,079
You can do so much with this.

54
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:31,596
Well, let's start with you not getting so
up close and personal with my vertebrae.

55
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,000
I just wish this had happened
a long time ago.

56
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,888
I always tried to guess
what your life was like,

57
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:41,373
but there was always a part of you
that I could never get close to.

58
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,687
No matter how hard I tried
I could never really know you.

59
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,096
Not until now.

60
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,042
I've left you like ten messages.

61
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,543
We've been busy.

62
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,025
Oh that's nice, while you two have been busy
I have been practicing my cardiac arrest.

63
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,807
Are you okay?

64
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,419
Better than ever. Why?

65
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,316
I don't know, only because
there've been constant seismic tremors...

66
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,283
all around Smallville since two o'clock.

67
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,373
That was probably us.

68
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,500
What do mini-earthquakes
had to do with you guys?

69
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,900
Oh.

70
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,250
I thought you said you couldn't...

71
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:42,257
Yeah, we normally can't.

72
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,560
You guys talk about this?

73
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,400
What? It's just Chloe.

74
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,000
Awkward.

75
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,200
Oh, someone has been eating their wheaties.

76
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,918
Um, I'll go get a screwdriver.

77
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,300
Ok, I need a little explain-o.

78
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,295
There was Kryptonite and lighting
and it happened so fast...

79
00:08:18,302 --> 00:08:21,100
it's not really clear.
The transfer wasn't complete.

80
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,121
I still have my powers.

81
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,014
And now Lana does too.

82
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,523
Clark... Been here and done this
and it doesn't end well.

83
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:37,200
Hey, the last human you supped up...

84
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:39,256
became a psych 101 case study.

85
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:41,674
Yeah, but Lana is different.
We know her. It's not gonna happen.

86
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:43,851
Ok, Eric Summers was just a geek
who collected rocks...

87
00:08:43,886 --> 00:08:45,900
and then ended up in an asylum.

88
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,271
And I hate to bring this up,
but when your dad took your powers...

89
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:52,200
His heart failed.

90
00:08:52,235 --> 00:08:56,900
So, whatever extra curricular
benefits this could have...

91
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,717
they don't outweigh
what could happen to Lana.

92
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,813
Could you keep en eye on her for me?

93
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,970
Don't worry about, Clark.
I won't let Lana out of my sight.

94
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,449
I so needed this girls night out.

95
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,597
You don't have to cover
Clark asked you to babysit me.

96
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:46,637
No, he didn't.

97
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,354
Superhearing.

98
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,598
Right.

99
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,747
But, Lana...

100
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,309
I don't want to ruin your super high
or anything but you just...

101
00:09:58,444 --> 00:09:59,709
have to watch yourself.

102
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:01,209
Chloe...

103
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,159
I wish you could know how this feels.

104
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,189
It's like you can do anything.
Like nothing can hurt you.

105
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,600
Like you're untouchable.

106
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,990
I've been given a gift.

107
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,837
I can break into any locked door,
slip into any room unnoticed...

108
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:24,201
eavesdrop on any conversation.

109
00:10:24,236 --> 00:10:27,574
So are you passing on the circus
so you can go and join the KGB?

110
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,308
You're always after
the hard-to-get articles.

111
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:32,561
You can't tell me that you wouldn't use
these powers if you had them.

112
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:34,330
Yeah, but you're not a reporter.

113
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,351
I may not be,

114
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,235
but I do have a story to tell.

115
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,800
What's churning in that
head of yours Lana?

116
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,964
What am I looking at?

117
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,830
We don't really know.

118
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,400
The metallic dust, somehow liquefied.

119
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,600
On its own?

120
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,200
That dust was the last remnant
of the alien technology I have.

121
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,800
What's left of Milton Fine Ship.

122
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:26,617
Now whatever you did with it
I want it back.

123
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:30,185
I swear to you, Mr. Luthor,
you're staring at what you gave me.

124
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:31,856
This is an airtight container.

125
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,996
The sample has been under
lock and key 24 hours a day.

126
00:11:35,097 --> 00:11:37,256
Dust doesn't just turn to liquid.

127
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:39,315
It's evolving.

128
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:46,416
That metal is sentient.

129
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,476
It's alive.

130
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,800
Here.

131
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,600
It's my report
and all the data on project Scion.

132
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,263
That organism exhibits conscious behavior.

133
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,777
Without being contained by meteor rocks
and low levels of radiation,

134
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,300
the liquid has mobility.

135
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,949
It appears to want out.

136
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,856
I know you're an ethical man,
Dr. Jansen.

137
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,200
But project Scion...

138
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,724
needs to remain confidential
at any price.

139
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,275
Am I making myself clear?

140
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,315
Well, I always knew you'd make
an impression on Washington, Martha.

141
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,745
Oh, two bills in one session -
That is truly remarkable.

142
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:53,000
Congratulations.

143
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,789
Yeah, all right. Keep in touch.

144
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,400
Goodbye.

145
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,405
Thanks to your mother, Clark,
we have finally got a senator...

146
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,831
who is gonna put Kansas on the map.

147
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,469
What is it, son?

148
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,500
There's another woman
about to make her mark.

149
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,000
It's Lana.

150
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,496
There was an accident,
and she has my abilities.

151
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,838
I need to switch her back, Lionel.

152
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,195
I know it's a long shot, but I thought
if someone had technology...

153
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,331
that could reverse the effects...

154
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,058
you can get it.

155
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,800
Clark...

156
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,300
Do you realize the potential danger
we're involved with here?

157
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,700
She is not -

158
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,147
May not be the person you think she is.

159
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,283
It will take her some time
to get over what Lex did to her.

160
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:01,265
No. No, that's not it.

161
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,790
Listen, Clark...

162
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,565
Those weeks that I was missing...

163
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:12,748
after the dam broke.

164
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,123
When I was being held captive...

165
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,604
Lana was behind all that.

166
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,160
Lana's incapable
of doing something like that.

167
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,100
You sure?

168
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,415
Have you ever allowed yourself
to take a really honest look at Lana?

169
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,958
Have you?

170
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,840
If you're saying this because you think
I'm wasting my time with Lana...

171
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,151
instead of pursuing some master plan
that Jor-El set out for me,

172
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:49,184
that's my decision to make.

173
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:51,378
Yeah.

174
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,432
Samson trusted Delilah
with the secret of his strength,

175
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,500
but his trust didn’t prevent
Delilah from betraying him.

176
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,068
Lana?

177
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,800
Lana?

178
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,900
I wouldn't trust her, either.

179
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,937
- Lex.
- You can skip the...

180
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:41,990
"you're not welcome here" prologue.

181
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,200
Someone left my vault door
on the rug.

182
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,400
Now, Lana was seen walking
out of the mansion.

183
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,939
You want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

184
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,960
I wish I knew.

185
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,273
Knew why she'd steal from me or how
she seems to possess superhuman strength?

186
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:01,100
She's obviously been infected.

187
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,845
As to why she was breaking
into your mansion,

188
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:06,525
I'm sure you could answer that
question better than I could.

189
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,500
You really don't know
what Lana's after, do you?

190
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,742
She's got a lot of reasons
not to trust you.

191
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,148
Funny. I was under the impression
she'd moved on.

192
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,900
Looks like it's harder to cut
that cord than she thought.

193
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
Revenge is like an addiction.

194
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,400
I'm sure you would see it that way,

195
00:17:26,435 --> 00:17:28,317
but I think I know Lana
better than you do.

196
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:30,555
Is that why you were digging
through her things?

197
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,107
Let me guess -

198
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,768
You're the last to know
about her Isis foundation?

199
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,333
Stings, doesn't it?

200
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
You know what this is?

201
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,829
On the surface, it's a clinic
to help the inflicted.

202
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:50,943
But what she's really doing, I don't know.

203
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,642
I wouldn't expect you to understand
that some of us just want to help people.

204
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,100
If she's so aboveboard, why
didn't she tell you about it?

205
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,712
You can say what you want, Clark,
but I could see it in your eyes.

206
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:05,769
You don't trust her, either.

207
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,407
What?

208
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:24,700
I can't believe you've never
had famous franks before.

209
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:27,017
I can't believe anyone's
had famous franks.

210
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:29,700
That thing could survive
a nuclear holocaust.

211
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,100
Um... maybe next time, Lane.

212
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,202
It's just like this Frank you
don't respond to my articles...

213
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:43,027
because you
are not down with the people.

214
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:45,810
Careful with the attitude, Lane.
I'm still your boss.

215
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:49,699
Oh, I'm just quoting - From several
reputable sources, actually.

216
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh, was there a Joan Jett
audition no one told me about?

217
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,853
Miss Lang, you'll ha to speak with
my assistant about an appointment.

218
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,700
Or I can go to the assistant
to the editor at the Herald.

219
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,608
I came straight to the top.
Do you want a story or not, Mr. Gabriel?

220
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,048
I'm listening.

221
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,518
Proof that the born-again Lex Luthor
isn't as changed as he claims.

222
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,208
It a classified project -
Something called Scion.

223
00:19:18,243 --> 00:19:20,677
And he just handed over
his hard drive to you?

224
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,700
It doesn't matter where it came from.

225
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,200
The world needs to know what
kind of person Lex really is.

226
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,649
I'm not gonna settle your personal
vendetta in the pages of the Daily Planet.

227
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,186
It's news, and you know it.

228
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:35,400
We can't run a story from stolen sources.

229
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,950
Verify the facts any way you want.

230
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:40,042
You are printing that story.

231
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:42,200
Somebody better switch to decaf.

232
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,200
Then I'll take care of Lex myself.

233
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,400
Hey.

234
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,700
Hey, word of advice there, Smallville.
Don't forget flowers on Valentine's day.

235
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,692
Lana did this to you?

236
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,100
Yeah, no offense,
but your girlfriend has issues,

237
00:20:22,135 --> 00:20:24,517
not to mention an Amazonian left hook.

238
00:20:24,552 --> 00:20:26,900
She must be juiced with meteor rock.

239
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,400
Can you remind me again why I decided to
move to the mutant capital of the world?

240
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:34,700
Can we just put a moratorium
on that word, please?

241
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,697
Sorry, Miss P. C. Barometer.

242
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:40,792
I'm just hoping that Lana's only temporarily
a member of the socially challenged.

243
00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:42,900
She did this all over a story?

244
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,703
On Lex.

245
00:20:44,738 --> 00:20:47,340
I mean, I've heard of vengeful,
but the look in Lana's eyes...

246
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:49,099
made Medea look like mother Hubbard.

247
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:51,200
Lex said that Lana
broke into his safe.

248
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
But he didn't exactly let me in
on what she found.

249
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,489
It was some project named Scion,

250
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:58,142
and as soon as I'm bondo-ed back together,
I'm gonna find out what it is.

251
00:20:58,577 --> 00:21:00,520
Do you know which way
she was headed?

252
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,743
Sorry. My face was polishing
the hardwood floors.

253
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,400
Miss Lane, the doctor
will see you now.

254
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,000
See you.

255
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,450
Lana would never hurt Lois intentionally.

256
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:15,100
The longer she has these powers,
she's growing more aggressive.

257
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,200
We have to find her.

258
00:21:55,945 --> 00:21:57,652
- Oh!
- Oh!

259
00:21:57,687 --> 00:21:59,864
Let me guess.
Vera Wang?

260
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:01,991
Maybe Dolce?

261
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
This is me laughing hysterically.

262
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,900
Is the jello really that bad?

263
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,000
gut-wrenching laughter.

264
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,000
Daisies make me sneeze, but thanks.

265
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,230
Lois, what are you doing?

266
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,554
Escaping.

267
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,600
And if you even try to narc on me,
I may have to take you hostage.

268
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,481
Wow. If you're working
the fantasy angle -

269
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:29,218
Shut up.

270
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,730
You know what? You may not want to print
Lana's exposé on Lex's Scion project,

271
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:37,535
but she wouldn't have come to us
if there wasn't truth to it.

272
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,651
And when I land this story,
you'll thank me.

273
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:42,393
No, I told you, don't clash horns
with the Luthors.

274
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,800
Then I guess the claws will have to do.

275
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,500
No, I'm serious.

276
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,200
I don't want to lose my ace reporter.

277
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,500
Oh, I know what's going on here.

278
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,222
You do?

279
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,698
Look, I don't deny the little sexual tension
that's built up between us but,

280
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:10,704
honestly, what office romance
ever works out? So...

281
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,500
keep your wick in your... candle-
Or however the saying goes.

282
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
The fantasy stops here.

283
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,900
Chloe, Lana didn't pick up.

284
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,950
- Any headway on the location of Scion?
- Nada.

285
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:44,242
I mean, it's possible that Lex has
finally learned to cover his tracks.

286
00:23:44,277 --> 00:23:47,555
Or what if, for once, Lex
doesn't have anything to hide?

287
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,900
Yeah, maybe when I hit 5'10" and
Prince Harry sweeps me off my feet.

288
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Clark, Lex hasn't changed.

289
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,691
What if having these powers is
amplifying Lana's true feelings?

290
00:24:00,726 --> 00:24:02,564
Maybe this is all in her head.

291
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,032
Clark, are you pushing this theory because
you really want to believe...

292
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:12,124
 in Lex's metamorphosis or because
you're already trying to exonerate Lana?

293
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,202
Chloe, do you know what it feels like
to wonder if someone close to you...

294
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:20,447
isn't who you think?

295
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,800
Did you really just asked me
that question?

296
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:26,816
Well...

297
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,700
Look, I haven't been willing to admit it,

298
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,700
but ever since Lana came back,
she's been different.

299
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,500
There's something darker about her.

300
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,900
Lex said that
she's hiding things from me.

301
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,600
Have you heard of this Isis foundation?

302
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,342
Clark, I think there's something
you need to see.

303
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,557
I want to know if the alloy
is responding to its environment...

304
00:24:55,656 --> 00:24:58,668
or if it's being controlled
by something somewhere.

305
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,700
That's a tall order, sir.

306
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,050
Well, with all the resources
at your disposal...

307
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,300
I have confidence
you'll rise to the occasion.

308
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,100
Oh my God, Lana,
what are you doing?

309
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,100
How long is being Lana doing this?

310
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,640
She started the foundation
a few months ago.

311
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:47,408
- Months?
- She was trying to help people...

312
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:50,300
who were victimized by LuthorCorp
and their experiments.

313
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,200
Why didn't she tell me about this?

314
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
She thought you'd say
it was too dangerous.

315
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,900
She was right.

316
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,700
Look, Clark, maybe she doesn't
want you to make a big al out of it.

317
00:25:58,735 --> 00:26:01,400
Maybe she wants to help people
on her own terms.

318
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,874
Or she's secretly spying on Lex
and she doesn't want us to know...

319
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:22,300
how totally depraved she is.

320
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,500
Chloe, tell me you didn't
know anything about this.

321
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,178
Trust me, Clark, I had
no idea that there was...

322
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:32,800
a La Femme Nikita lurking behind
our little Florence Nightingale.

323
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,000
I don't see anything
about Scion in here.

324
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,000
- What is it?
- It's labeled "Lex's mobile."

325
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,700
Do you think she's bugging him?

326
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,400
Can you rewind the track?

327
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
My god, Lana, what are you doing?

328
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,837
Where's Scion?

329
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,400
Pier number 4.

330
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,300
Pier number 4.

331
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,700
If I lose any more patience, Lex
you won't be around to see it.

332
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,200
I told you
I don't have anything to hide.

333
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,300
This is project Scion.

334
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,280
You can see for yourself.
The password is 51805.

335
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,400
That's the date of the last meteor shower.

336
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You're tracking aliens?

337
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,300
You said you stopped
looking into this.

338
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,950
If you don't stop,
more people will die.

339
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:49,742
Lana, there's a reason for everything
that has happened to me.

340
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:53,288
Don't you see? My miraculous rescue
from the river, the spacecrafts,

341
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:56,291
those creatures who landed
with the meteors - It's not a coincidence.

342
00:27:56,311 --> 00:28:00,701
You're right, because your hunger for
power landed you in the middle of it all.

343
00:28:00,736 --> 00:28:02,470
There's a reason
you came to me a not Clark.

344
00:28:02,505 --> 00:28:04,445
- You trusted me.
- That's all over.

345
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,500
Is it?

346
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,607
Then why have you been trailing me, spying
on me, stalking every move that I make?

347
00:28:09,642 --> 00:28:12,094
Because the world should know
what a liar you are.

348
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,500
I will dig up every track you
have buried until it kills me.

349
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,300
I won't let you hurt anyone else.

350
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:19,454
And I haven't, have I?

351
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,400
Lana, I'm trying to save people.

352
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,400
We started this together.

353
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,899
Those creatures -

354
00:28:29,948 --> 00:28:31,973
They were only the first.

355
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,600
There will be more.

356
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,200
Project Scion might be our only hope.

357
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,900
So, you've appointed yourself
prophet of the alien invasion.

358
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,758
It wasn't until Saint Paul was struck blind
by lightning on the road to Damascus...

359
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,654
that he saw his higher calling.

360
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,000
I want the world to know you
as well as I do.

361
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Saving the world
isn't in your nature, Lex.

362
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:58,600
What are you really up to?

363
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,068
Lana, wait.

364
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,100
Killing me would almost be a release.

365
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:08,600
The only person who would
really suffer is you.

366
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,750
From guilt?
I think I'll get over it.

367
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:14,600
From knowing that Clark would never
look at you the same way again.

368
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,900
He's not like us, Lana.

369
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,400
You might not want to admit it,
but we understand each other.

370
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,800
We understand doing
whatever it takes to survive.

371
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,200
You can't kill me, Lana.

372
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,900
You'd lose Clark forever.

373
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,639
Lana!

374
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,600
- You have to stop.
- I can't.

375
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,700
I have to take care
of your unfinished business.

376
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:02,267
- I'll take care of Lex.
- No, you won't!

377
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,500
You're too afraid
to get blood on your hands.

378
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,400
Taking people's lives
is not our choice to make.

379
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,193
And how many people would still
be alive if you had had the guts...

380
00:30:10,228 --> 00:30:12,300
to get rid of Lex a long time ago?

381
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,000
Lana, I'm taking Lex out of here.

382
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:47,104
You can do anything, and all you've
done is hide out on some farm.

383
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:49,634
I protected the people
I care about.

384
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,800
At least, I've tried to.

385
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,956
Don't worry, sir. It's been taken care of.

386
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,000
I give you my word.

387
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,500
You're busy?

388
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,658
Actually, yes.

389
00:32:12,693 --> 00:32:14,242
- I was just...
- Oh, please.

390
00:32:14,477 --> 00:32:16,386
Online poker doesn't count.

391
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh, busted.

392
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,800
What can I do for you?

393
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,282
I hit the pavement
about Lana's story on Lex,

394
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:25,171
but all I found
was a new pizza place.

395
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:27,863
And without the hard drive,
there wasn't much of a piece.

396
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:30,200
So, I was right.

397
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,100
Say I was right.

398
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,200
You were dipping your toes
in the correct vicinity.

399
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,659
Well if that's all, Miss Lane,
I should get back to my royal flush.

400
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,200
Actually, it's not.

401
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,300
I think we should talk about
what happened in the elevator.

402
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,501
I'm glad that I got that out my chest.

403
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,015
Wow.

404
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,474
If news of that spread
through the mail room,

405
00:33:19,535 --> 00:33:21,900
I could have my nameplate
on your door by tomorrow.

406
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,700
That's sexual harassment.

407
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,641
But that wasn't.

408
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,100
Well, that's a new twist.

409
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,250
Lana's sending you
to do her apologies for her?

410
00:34:01,585 --> 00:34:03,343
Especially after today.

411
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,185
Whatever infected Lana's gone now.
She's back to normal.

412
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,000
I came here to find out if you're
pressing charges against her.

413
00:34:09,035 --> 00:34:11,200
For breaking in or almost killing me?

414
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,416
Lex, I know, in your world,
nothing comes without payback...

415
00:34:16,651 --> 00:34:18,597
so, what are you gonna do to her?

416
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,200
Nothing.

417
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
You'd never let her just walk away.

418
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,700
You know, the ironic part of all this...

419
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,600
is I'm the one who ended up
with something I wanted.

420
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,700
Lana still has feelings for me.

421
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,998
Don't flatter yourself, Lex.
Those powers made her obsessed.

422
00:34:43,277 --> 00:34:44,622
Exactly,

423
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,400
and passion like that
doesn't come out of the blue.

424
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,700
What do you think is stronger,
Clark -

425
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,900
her hatred for me
or her affection for you?

426
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:57,740
She was angry.
But, eventually, she'll move on.

427
00:34:57,775 --> 00:34:59,546
Don't hold your breath.

428
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,400
the funny thing about obsession is
it outlives everything...

429
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,433
even love.

430
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,799
Lana never would have done anything
like this before she'd been with you.

431
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,400
Well, I wish I could take
all the credit, but...

432
00:35:17,435 --> 00:35:20,500
I wasn't the first person
to teach her about betrayal,

433
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,300
now, was I?

434
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,800
it's hard to face
what you've created, isn't it?

435
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,800
I didn't realize
big sister was watching.

436
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,100
I guess Lex cut me off.

437
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,729
It wasn't Lex.

438
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,926
After everything he's done,
I have a right to protect myself.

439
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,100
It would have been nice to know about
the impressive operation you're running.

440
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,490
I'm sorry that I lied.

441
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,900
I didn't think that you would understand
if you saw the whole picture.

442
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,300
Well, it's in crystal-clear H. D. now.

443
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,100
Isis seemed to make a lot of sense when
I thought you were just out to help people.

444
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,232
In textbook talk, Isis is the goddess
of love and life and healing.

445
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,742
she even marched to the ends of the earth
to help jump-start the man she loved.

446
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,000
I want Clark to have that kind
of loyalty in his life.

447
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,500
but I'm just not sure it's from you.

448
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,900
I would do anything for Clark.

449
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,700
Even kill.

450
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,100
What a lucky guy.

451
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,656
What the textbook left out is that Isis
is also the goddess of the underworld.

452
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,700
She's responsible for bringing
the great god Ra to his knees.

453
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,300
You believe that
I would do that to Clark.

454
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,900
Not intentionally.

455
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,800
But I realize now
that you're capable of it.

456
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,500
You should just know that
I'm not gonna let that happen.

457
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,694
There's no way to trace
where the alloy disappeared to?

458
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:50,588
Mr. Luthor, I don't need to remind you
that the properties of that substance...

459
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:52,835
weren't exactly conventional.

460
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,020
We just barely started to study it.

461
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,400
Well, unless you're ready for a front-row
seat to the apocalypse, I suggest we find it.

462
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,493
Sir.

463
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,500
I went to see Lex,

464
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,000
he's not gonna press any charges.

465
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,553
if it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't
know Lex was still tracking Kryptonians.

466
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,000
at least one good thing
came out of the mess I made.

467
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,700
I wish you wouldn't look at me
like you hadn't seen me before.

468
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,500
I guess I'm just trying to
find a part of you I recognize.

469
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,500
Clark, it was the powers.

470
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
you have to know
that I would never hurt you.

471
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,791
Even before you had the powers,
Lana, you kidnapped Lionel.

472
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
Yes.

473
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,500
But he threatened to kill you.

474
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,100
I was trying to save your life.

475
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
And that justifies everything?

476
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I'm not going to apologize for going to
extremes to protect the person that I love.

477
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,000
You sound like Lex.

478
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,000
I sound like you.

479
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,800
You can't tell me that you haven't crossed
the moral line in order to save somebody.

480
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,950
These last few weeks have been
so great with you, I just-

481
00:40:12,385 --> 00:40:14,400
I didn't want to look below the surface.

482
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,981
Clark, I'm sorry. I wanted to be honest
with you about the Isis foundation but...

483
00:40:19,152 --> 00:40:21,400
That's never been a part
of our relationship.

484
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,700
But I guess it's my fault.

485
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:31,496
I didn't trust you years ago, and now,
for some reason, you can't trust me.

486
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,000
We will find our way back
from this.

487
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,500
Will we?

488
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,698
Lana, I can live with you changing.

489
00:40:40,764 --> 00:40:43,700
I just need to accept the fact
that I'm responsible for it.

490
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,372
Don't do that.

491
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,500
Do what?

492
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,400
Take all the blame so that you don't
taint the image of me that you created.

493
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,341
I have to live with the
decisions that I've made.

494
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,000
I just need to know that you
love me...

495
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,200
no matter what.
