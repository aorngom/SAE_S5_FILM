1
00:00:02,193 --> 00:00:02,925
Right.

2
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:05,429
Mr. Yamagochi is on its way up now
with his lovely wife.

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,508
As you know, he's thinking of
investing in those, and if he does,

4
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:10,486
it'll be the best thing that happened
to this company

5
00:00:10,553 --> 00:00:13,214
since old Gladys the cook
burned down the canteen.

6
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:16,444
She wasn't a bad cook.

7
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:19,323
Are you having a laugh?
Is she having a laugh?

8
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, be fair, Ray.
She wasn't that bad.

9
00:00:26,087 --> 00:00:28,364
We all loved her milky puddings.

10
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:30,708
Not when they dragged
in the mash, we didn't.

11
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:35,483
Now, I don't want any of you two
mucking things up for me,

12
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:37,354
<i>Prepared the traditional
japanese cuisine, have you?</i>

13
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:38,507
<i>- Yes, it's here!
- Right.</i>

14
00:00:38,562 --> 00:00:41,334
<i>But I'm still not sure you should have
let Gobbler organise

15
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:43,151
the traditional japanese entertainment.

16
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:44,649
<i>- Why, what's he planning?
- Well...</i>

17
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,394
No time, here they come.

18
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:53,693
This is Rita, and my team.

19
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,205
We prepared some
traditional japanese cuisine.

20
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:58,450
Welcome.
I hope you like it.

21
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:04,083
Lovely.

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,626
Well done, Rita.

23
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:08,062
And now, for your delectation,
may I present...

24
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:12,201
Gobbler and Kimberley with some
traditional japanese entertainment.

25
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:16,167
What the f...

26
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:21,832
Chin-Chine-China man
milked a cow, didn't know how,

27
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:24,356
Chin-Chang-China man
poured the wrong tea !

28
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:27,134
Chin-Chang-China man
covered in shit!

29
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:40,062
I'm all done covered in...

30
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,979
shiiiit!

31
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,423
What do you think?

32
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:55,380
Is he having a laugh?

33
00:02:28,642 --> 00:02:29,895
It's bad.

34
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:31,892
It's not bad, is it?

35
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,435
- It is.
- No, no.

36
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:35,717
Bad suggests that
it's evil or something.

37
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:37,732
It's not...
It's poor.

38
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:39,013
It's... rubbish.

39
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,091
It's shit.
It's a shit sitcom.

40
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,224
- It's a shitcom!
- Oh, we've sorted that out.

41
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:45,034
Thanks very much,
that's the career I love.

42
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:46,972
That's what one of the reviewers said.

43
00:02:48,677 --> 00:02:50,778
I shouldn't... No.
I shouldn't be joking about it. It's not...

44
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,009
What are the reviews like?

45
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:53,760
If I was being kind I'd say
it was a mixed bag.

46
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:56,247
- Let me have a look. Let me see it.
- Really?

47
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:57,377
Barry?

48
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,894
Can you bring
some of the reviews in?

49
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:01,430
Where is he gone ?

50
00:03:01,543 --> 00:03:03,396
Got to do something
with his mornings hasn't he?

51
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:05,250
- Found another one.
- Oh, have you?

52
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,980
"Perhaps it's unfair to judge a sitcom
on its first episode,"

53
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:12,595
"but when a TV programme makes you
wanna gouge out you own eyes

54
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,058
rather than watch
one more minute,"

55
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:15,819
"you know it's probably not
your cup of tea."

56
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,645
- God, pop he in the scrapbook.
- No, don't pop he in the scrapbook.

57
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:21,588
Put good ones
in the scrapbook.

58
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,407
What good ones?

59
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:25,055
There's no good ones.

60
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,771
Best one was the Telegraph.

61
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:29,205
- What'd they say?
- They didn't review it.

62
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,465
See you later, B.

63
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:34,856
Career's over.

64
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,419
No, because despite what they say,
the viewing figures are really good:

65
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:38,524
6,2 million.

66
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:41,028
6 million people
watched it last night?

67
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:42,961
And yet none of these liked it.

68
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,399
These people know
about comedy, don't they?

69
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:46,594
They know what they're talking about
with the general public.

70
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:50,779
You said: "If you get your own show,
the offers'll come flooding in."

71
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:52,375
You said the phone
would never stop ringing.

72
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:54,231
Have you had any phone calls at all?

73
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,501
Oh no, what am I talking about.
Sky called.

74
00:03:58,932 --> 00:04:00,701
They say they can put
your dish up Thursday.

75
00:04:15,562 --> 00:04:16,356
<i>Hello?</i>

76
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,745
What're you doing?

77
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:20,196
I'm actually flipping
through the phonebook.

78
00:04:20,355 --> 00:04:23,579
And I'm pointing my finger
on a random page,

79
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:26,276
to see what my name could be
if I wanted to change it.

80
00:04:26,423 --> 00:04:28,718
- <i>What've you got?</i>
- P.B. Grout.

81
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:31,480
Good.
As long as you're filling your days.

82
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:34,404
C.T. Panchanagonanau.

83
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,153
I don't look like
a Panchananagonahau.

84
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:41,395
- You hungry?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

85
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:43,401
- Greasy Spoon?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

86
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:46,051
- Where am I meeting you?
- Garage in ten minutes?

87
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,960
- <i>D'you wanna hear one more?</i>
- Oh, go on.

88
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:50,485
<i>T.P. Ronns...</i>

89
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:00,884
- You're moving in here?
- Yeah.

90
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:03,247
Oh, good. I mean...
Do you want a hand?

91
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,242
- No, I'm fine.
- Phew.

92
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,367
I'm Andy by the way.
I live here, obviously.

93
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:09,677
I live on the second floor, 21.

94
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:11,597
I'm Kathy.
Nice to meet you.

95
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:15,102
- Welcome to the building.
- Thanks.

96
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:17,388
It's nice to see someone under 40.

97
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:20,948
I thought I'd moved into
an old people's home.

98
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:23,148
There are some elders in there,
some maybe in their forties, but...

99
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:24,669
they're quiet.
The old telly there.

100
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,643
- Watch a lot of telly?
- I don't.

101
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:30,408
So last night, BBC1, no?

102
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:32,285
Good stuff on.

103
00:05:36,307 --> 00:05:38,788
Well, if you need someone
to show you around at all...

104
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:41,194
Thanks, that'd be nice.

105
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:42,790
Alright, see you later.

106
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:50,512
I saw it last night.

107
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:52,735
- And?
- Yeah, it was good.

108
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:54,374
Are you just saying that?

109
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,539
No.

110
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:58,754
Too long a pause.
If you're gonna lie, lie well.

111
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:00,425
Bits of it were funny.

112
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:02,194
Doesn't count.
You laugh for anything.

113
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:03,047
What?

114
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,894
I found you laughing just half once,
and I said "What're you laughing at?",

115
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,407
and you said "My toes".
- Oh yeah?

116
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:10,942
They are funny, though.
The way they waggle.

117
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,067
It's <i>you</i> that's making them waggle.

118
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:14,642
- Spare any change?
- Sorry, mate.

119
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:16,013
- Have a nice day.
- Cheers.

120
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:17,663
Good luck with the show, Andy.

121
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,874
Cheers.
How does he know who I am?

122
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:21,654
Where does he watch the show?
Through Dixen's window?

123
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:23,251
You've been in all the magazines.

124
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:25,613
- Oh, he reads "Heat", does he?
- Everybody reads "Heat".

125
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:27,441
Everybody reads "Heat".

126
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:29,080
Now I'll have to start
giving money to the homeless.

127
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:29,781
Why?

128
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:31,961
'Cause I don't want people to say
"Andy Millman hates the poor".

129
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:33,781
You don't just hate the poor.
You hate everyone.

130
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,563
That's why it's so unfair.

131
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:42,066
Sorry, I've only got like...
8p and change, or a 20...

132
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,771
- Give him the 20.
- He said change.

133
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:45,550
- Yeah, whatever.
- Cheers.

134
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:47,826
Your TV show is doing alright,
though, is it?

135
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:49,768
Good.

136
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:51,785
Pay well?

137
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:58,538
Have you got anything else?
You've got a quid?

138
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,823
You haven't got a 10
and a 5, have you?

139
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,473
- Haven't.
- Of course, he's homeless!

140
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:10,760
I know he's homeless,
I'm not blind.

141
00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:19,825
Twenty.

142
00:07:20,537 --> 00:07:21,799
It's nothing.

143
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:24,518
Is that the most
you've ever been given?

144
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:27,237
- One bloke gave me 50 once.
- That is mental.

145
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,685
He must have been a pervert.

146
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:31,519
20 quid, though.

147
00:07:31,595 --> 00:07:34,604
'Cause your average is probably,
what, 20p or something.

148
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:39,102
I do come past here
quite a lot, so...

149
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:41,842
We count that as a few goes,
can't do that every day.

150
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:44,593
Says... I don't know,
3 months of leaving me alone.

151
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:45,952
- "Leaving you alone"?
- No.

152
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:48,346
If you're gonna have this attitude,
I don't want it.

153
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:51,226
- Seriously, take it back.
- I'm just saying I couldn't do that...

154
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:58,902
What will you say
to people about this?

155
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,117
I'll probably say:
"Don't ask Andy Millman for money,"

156
00:08:02,193 --> 00:08:03,822
"cause he'd only
give it to you begrudgingly".

157
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:04,965
No, say...

158
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:08,200
that I offered you 20,
the second most you've ever been given,

159
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,733
then I insulted you and...

160
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:12,171
And you made me take it back,
but mention the 20.

161
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,416
In any anecdotes
slagging me off.

162
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,186
Just take it, it's fine.

163
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:23,433
Nice aftershave, by the way.

164
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:25,691
- Cheers.
- What is it?

165
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:27,292
Calvin Klein.

166
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,916
Apparently, Vernon Kay uses that.

167
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,983
Ok, cheers.

168
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:39,469
Why are we walking back this way?
This is the way we came!

169
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,520
Now we gotta go past him again.
You...

170
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:47,031
- See you later.
- Yep.

171
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:55,206
- We walked too fast.
- <i>You</i> did.

172
00:08:57,173 --> 00:08:59,045
She's moving into my block.

173
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:01,329
I spoke to her earlier,
I was getting a vibe.

174
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:02,775
I'm gonna go and talk to her.

175
00:09:02,857 --> 00:09:05,623
You come over, okay?
Just ask for an autograph.

176
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,665
Yeah and just tell about how you think
I'm the most amazing actor on TV.

177
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:11,086
You don't have the right to use
your new powers for evil.

178
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:13,949
- You gotta use what you can.
- Fair enough.

179
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,314
Hello.
Need any help here?

180
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:23,634
Thank you.
Big strong man's just what I need.

181
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:24,748
Will I do ?

182
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,015
Excuse me.
You Andy Millman?

183
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,438
Star of the new sitcom
"When the whistle blows"?

184
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:32,722
- Can I get an autograph, please?
- No worries.

185
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:35,530
- Who is it to?
- Me.

186
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,649
Yeah, but I don't know
your name, do I?

187
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:39,617
Maggie.

188
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,357
Can I just say... that I think you're
the most amazing comedy actor on TV?

189
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:48,296
Ah, not amazing.

190
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,705
But that's what you told me to say.

191
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:57,221
Did he ask you
to come over and say that?

192
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:02,932
I don't know.

193
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:05,533
You don't know
if he asked you to say it?

194
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:08,890
No, I don't know.

195
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,308
- Are you friends?
- Are <i>we</i> friends?

196
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:15,552
- Unlikely.
- Well...

197
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,313
- We have met.
- Have we?

198
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:23,699
Changed a bit. Hello.
Were you...

199
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,488
You used to...

200
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:28,584
These are not gonna move themselves.

201
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:32,878
See you later.

202
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:40,953
Andy, am I coming with you?

203
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:50,379
You're still thinking
about the reviews?

204
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:53,063
Yes, the terrible, terrible reviews.

205
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:54,920
Think about the good ones.

206
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:59,573
What am I gonna do now?
I'll never get over this.

207
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:02,676
I'll just spend years and years
trying to claw back credibility

208
00:11:02,758 --> 00:11:07,575
by doing anything, just popping up
in bad films and charity events.

209
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:09,859
Just begging forgiveness.

210
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:12,831
They'd forgive you
if you did "Celebrity Fit Club".

211
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:15,225
Brilliant! What else?
What else am I gonna do?

212
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:17,964
- "Celebrity Love Island"?
- Why would I do a show

213
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:21,680
that when I watched it,
I was praying for a tsunami?

214
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:25,602
Do we just go to the pub?

215
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,026
That's the beginning.

216
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,390
"Depressed TV star
drinks himself to death".

217
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,783
Oh, don't be daft.

218
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:34,265
You're not a star, and being fat
will kill you before the drink does.

219
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:36,342
Are you sure
you come to the pub?

220
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:38,524
You're not minding the phones
with the Samaritans tonight?

221
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:40,767
No? Okay, pub it is, then.

222
00:11:43,684 --> 00:11:45,157
Here's one.

223
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:48,102
Who would you rather fight
and have a decent chance of winning?

224
00:11:48,184 --> 00:11:50,744
Big fat hairy
silver back gorilla...

225
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:52,931
or Thomson's gazelle?

226
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:54,515
Well, the gazelle.

227
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,232
I know, but you'd have to
catch it first, 'cause they're like...

228
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,562
I wouldn't catch it. I turned up
for the fight, it ran away, I win.

229
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:02,434
- Not my problem.
- Oi, oi.

230
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:04,704
Don't look at me like that.
Little bit of good news here.

231
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,053
- Are you sure?
- Oi.

232
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,879
Barry and I were scouring the Internet
and found a glowing review of your sitcom.

233
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:11,393
- Really?
- Listen to this.

234
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,883
"This charming story of
loveable larger than life characters

235
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,961
will please all the family."

236
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,846
"This is a delightful woodland romp

237
00:12:17,943 --> 00:12:21,025
with many of the best scenes
featuring the roly-poly toad."

238
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:22,939
Give me that.

239
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:26,159
This is a review of
"Wind in the Willows".

240
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:29,847
What's your called then?
Oh, "When the wind blows". Whistle.

241
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:31,898
I said that was
a picture of a frog, didn't I?

242
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:34,210
- Got the same throat.
- I know, yeah.

243
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:36,329
You can see
where we went wrong.

244
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:39,012
I'm gonna get a drink.

245
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,600
Have a look.
There's a ringer.

246
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:43,224
Oh, yeah.

247
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,824
- Except he's green.
- Who, Andy?

248
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:47,132
The frog.

249
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:55,681
God, it's you.

250
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:01,048
- What're you doing here?
- Just having a drink.

251
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,305
So are we!
Amazing.

252
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:06,511
Do you live near here?
Where?

253
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:08,575
- Just...
- What street?

254
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:10,708
Well, doesn't matter, does it?
Just locally.

255
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,803
- I love your show.
- Oh, good.

256
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:16,213
The wig, the glasses,
the catch phrase.

257
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:17,602
- Brilliant.
- Thanks.

258
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:19,116
Everything about it.

259
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:22,790
The wig, the glasses,
the catch phrase... Brilliant.

260
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,840
It's become a quite
catch phrase itself.

261
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:28,364
Ooh, wig.

262
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,758
Glasses, catch phrase.

263
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:32,327
- Brilliant?
- Yeah.

264
00:13:32,657 --> 00:13:34,391
- Can I take a picture?
- Yeah.

265
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:39,097
- You got the wig with you?
- No.

266
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,684
Do the face.
Do the face.

267
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:46,033
Look at him!

268
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:49,033
It works even without
the wig and the glasses.

269
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,867
- Can you do the catch phrase?
- I'd rather not.

270
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,467
- Do the catch phrase!
- No, I'm just saying...

271
00:13:55,322 --> 00:13:57,163
- Just do the catch phrase !
- Okay, okay.

272
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,665
- Are you having a laugh?
- Do it properly.

273
00:14:02,721 --> 00:14:04,720
- I love everything about it.
- Cheers.

274
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:07,917
The wig, the glasses,
the catch phrase...

275
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:10,806
- Can I call my mate Pete?
- Why not?

276
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,655
Can't call the barman
as well, can you?

277
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:16,532
His number.

278
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,439
Pete, what's your favourite
catch phrase?

279
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:24,026
He's only here!

280
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:26,090
Yeah!

281
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,622
Speak to him.

282
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,860
Oi, Pete, how've you been, mate?

283
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:35,929
Yeah? He likes that as well.

284
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:37,856
I don't have the wig with me, no.

285
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:40,883
Oh, Pete, I've got to go, mate.
Because...

286
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:43,332
Life's too short.
Okay ? Yeah. See ya.

287
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:47,750
That's actually him, yeah.

288
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,750
- Come  down. Bring Ralph and Walnut.
- Oh, that's me.

289
00:14:50,915 --> 00:14:53,791
Then tell Count Fuckulla.
Yeah, he loves him.

290
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:56,668
Oh, I'll go get him.
Quick quick quick, Jilly.

291
00:14:58,388 --> 00:15:00,582
- Forget it. Drink up. We're going.
- Why?

292
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:03,514
I've just been spotted by
someone from The Hills Have Eyes.

293
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,509
Hello!

294
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:09,293
Alright, mate. How's it going?
Darren Lamb, agent. Nice to meet you.

295
00:15:09,527 --> 00:15:11,784
That's my girlfriend Jilly.

296
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:13,779
I recognise you.

297
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:15,706
Yes, possibly.

298
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:17,991
You did my mom's guttering,
didn't you?

299
00:15:18,224 --> 00:15:19,945
Maybe. Where does she live?

300
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:21,795
Houndel Court opposite the BP garage.

301
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:24,107
You didn't tell me anything about this.
How much did you get paid?

302
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,744
- Not much.
- 200 quid.

303
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,877
Mom said he did such a good job
she gave him a 20 pound tip.

304
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:29,790
- 220 quid?
- I don't have to tell you everything.

305
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:30,781
No, you don't.

306
00:15:30,877 --> 00:15:33,230
Although you're happy to tell me
when you're sleeping in your car,

307
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:35,267
and you need somewhere to have a bath,
then you can't keep your mouth shut.

308
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:36,506
But this, you're keeping shtum about.

309
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,821
You're supposed to be my agent
for acting, not bloody artexing.

310
00:15:38,882 --> 00:15:40,800
Rumbled! He said guttering.
Now it's artexing!

311
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:44,164
What else are you keeping from me?
I'm appalled, this is scandalous, Barry!

312
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:46,105
Such a slap in the face!

313
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:47,687
Do you do roofing ?

314
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:50,412
- Do you need some roofing ?
- It's too dangerous. I'm not...

315
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:52,064
Oh I'm sorry,
you're turning down work now are you?

316
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:54,022
Sorry, it seems that
beggars can be choosers.

317
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:55,243
My mistake.

318
00:15:55,394 --> 00:15:56,853
Unbelievable.

319
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,041
How much was it, 220?

320
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,985
Right, you owe me 27,50£.

321
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,201
- I'll give you a cheque.
- Yeah, if you must.

322
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,793
I'll tell you this.
If you like his show, you'll love this.

323
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:09,788
Have a look at that.

324
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,935
- Just regular.
- Turn it the other way.

325
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:13,725
- Boobs!
- Good.

326
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:16,188
- How did you do that?
- It's just numbers.

327
00:16:16,312 --> 00:16:17,725
- What numbers?
- 58008.

328
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:18,416
Boobs!

329
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:21,403
Judy, look. Look at those.

330
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:24,326
Let me have a wee look!

331
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:27,430
Boobs!

332
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:30,293
You gotta get used to this, mate.

333
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,655
- He's doing my head in.
- I know.

334
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,858
They see you on telly,
and they all wanna be your best mate.

335
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,793
When I was in EastEnders,
we used to go to a place called Castro's.

336
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:39,690
Quiet, and they treat you well
if they recognise you.

337
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:41,592
- Let's go there.
- Yeah alright.

338
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:45,163
Cheers, mate.
Oi, oi.

339
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,480
Boing!

340
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:49,071
If it does, whose fault's that?

341
00:16:49,153 --> 00:16:50,927
Let's not talk about business
in front of a couple of...

342
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,680
- ...nobodies, no disrespect.
- Unbelievable.

343
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:57,121
I'm already annoyed with you.
Give it back now.

344
00:16:57,788 --> 00:17:01,050
Anyway... Give me your number
and we'll meet up again!

345
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:03,981
Don't... touch me.

346
00:17:12,513 --> 00:17:13,779
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

347
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,655
I used to come a lot a few years ago,
I don't know if you remember.

348
00:17:16,724 --> 00:17:17,935
Oh, yes, hi!

349
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:20,164
Greg's in there.

350
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:21,320
We don't have to speak to him.

351
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,269
Like he's not gonna
come over and gloat.

352
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:25,228
- Fat smug face.
- We're here now, shhh...

353
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:27,684
- It's fine, just gotta sign here.
- Okay.

354
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:31,603
Oh, hello.
Hi, welcome.

355
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:33,420
- I enjoyed the show last night.
- Really?

356
00:17:33,816 --> 00:17:36,568
Mark, can you get Mr Millman
to the VIP area?

357
00:17:36,646 --> 00:17:38,518
- Thanks very much.
- No need to sign in, that's fine.

358
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:40,235
- Cheers.
- Ok, enjoy, good.

359
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,997
Andy Millman!

360
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:50,309
I can't stop, mate,
I'm going to the VIP area.

361
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:55,304
- Take a seat.
- Cheers.

362
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:59,928
More like it.
Thanks very much.

363
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,529
Can I get you anything to drink?

364
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:04,483
Some champagne?

365
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:07,038
Can you get us
a bottle of champagne, please?

366
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:11,318
Finally, a little bit of respect!

367
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,382
Oh, god. David Bowie.

368
00:18:17,374 --> 00:18:20,360
Oh, my god. Unbelievable.
Don't look.

369
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:23,195
Sorry man,
I have to ask you to leave.

370
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:25,727
- You've just put us here.
- David Bowie's here.

371
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:28,837
I know, but it's just...
That's really embarrassing.

372
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:39,749
- Ah, quick sit down?
- At least <i>I</i> had a sit down.

373
00:18:39,804 --> 00:18:42,419
Quick little sit-down,
energy, back into it.

374
00:18:42,502 --> 00:18:43,960
- How's it going?
- Brilliant. You?

375
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:47,318
Excellent.
Doing Chekhov, at the Windham.

376
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:51,474
just been nominated for
an Olivier Award, so...

377
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,942
- How's your sitcom going?
- Brilliant. Ratings up, brilliant.

378
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,996
- The reviews, very harsh.
- I don't read reviews, don't bother.

379
00:18:58,106 --> 00:18:59,978
I think I've got one here, actually.

380
00:19:00,268 --> 00:19:01,575
Can you just hold that?

381
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:07,602
- I've been meaning to throw it away.
- Throw it away, then.

382
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:10,506
"When the Whistle Blows."

383
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:13,657
"As I watched this abysmal
time-old comedy,

384
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,575
I found myself expecting
someone to shout "I'm free"

385
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,450
and for Andy Millman to exclaim:
"Mmh, Betty..."

386
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:24,129
"The cats just shat out
the worst sitcom of all time."

387
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:29,592
Don't really care about his opinion.

388
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:31,588
If I wanted an opinion,
it wouldn't be a snotty reviewer,

389
00:19:31,643 --> 00:19:33,446
it would be the people that count.
The man on the street.

390
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:36,748
- Yeah, he gave him 20 quid earlier.
- Not that specific man on the street.

391
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,881
If you wanna chase ratings,
that's great.

392
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:42,569
I'd rather win the respect of my peers
than get big ratings and everything.

393
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:44,853
Both. Getting both. Anyway.
Always nice to see you mate.

394
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:46,849
- You having a laugh?
- Alright, mate.

395
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,945
- Sitcom's shit, mate.
- Oh he's changed his tune? Why...

396
00:19:50,013 --> 00:19:52,049
The man in the street. So fickle.

397
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:55,104
- No, he didn't have a bald head.
- No, not that specific... man.

398
00:19:55,214 --> 00:19:57,650
- Does that happen a lot?
- Never, it's all good, usually.

399
00:19:57,726 --> 00:19:59,749
I'll tell you who's not
having a laugh: the public.

400
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,414
- Well, they are.
- It's just rude.

401
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:03,326
Not rude, stupid, ignorant.

402
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:05,033
To say that.

403
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:09,450
- That was just a little ant.
- It's just social rudeness.

404
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:22,249
Barry. Don't look right away.
There's a couple of birds over there.

405
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:24,781
Without drinks.
You know what to do.

406
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:26,281
Oh, yes.

407
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,377
Excuse me. There's a couple
of girls over there, not drinking.

408
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,060
So you should tell the two of them
to buy something or get out.

409
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,565
No, sorry, that's a mistake.

410
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:36,588
What I meant was,
we can buy them some drinks.

411
00:20:36,698 --> 00:20:38,199
That's an in isn't it,
to start a conversation.

412
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:40,414
Thought you were worried they would take
valuable space and costing him money.

413
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:41,611
Why? It's not my concern!

414
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,571
The man is running a business!
The overheads are probably extortionate.

415
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,628
But he makes
a lot of money on food.

416
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:48,060
There's 20 pubs a day
closing down in this country,

417
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:49,852
and it's due to people like that.
Alright?

418
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:52,004
What, and you're suddenly an expert,
are you on that?

419
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:55,343
- Why it's your concern, is what I...
- Leave it.

420
00:20:59,528 --> 00:21:02,389
Ladies, pardon us.
Can I just introduce myself?

421
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:05,694
Darren Lamb, agent to the TV actor
Andy Millman, star of the sitcom...

422
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:07,507
"When the Wind Blows".
"Whistle". Thank you.

423
00:21:07,617 --> 00:21:10,676
And do you remember this guy?
It's only Barry, of EastEnders.

424
00:21:10,984 --> 00:21:12,945
Oh, yeah?
How's it going?

425
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:15,498
Not so good, actually.
Things aren't quite panning out...

426
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,286
Let's not bring the mood down.

427
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,779
A couple of sorts like this,
you're up for it?

428
00:21:18,864 --> 00:21:20,233
What d'you mean, "up for it"?

429
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:21,943
You're out in a bar,
no guys with you...

430
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:24,055
You meet a couple of players like us...
Ships in the night.

431
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:26,109
Let's get down to business.
Who wants Barry of Eastenders?

432
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,792
Neither of us.

433
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:28,153
Alright Barry,
you're out in the cold mate.

434
00:21:28,224 --> 00:21:30,110
It's the story of my life.
My house was repossessed last night

435
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:32,281
Don't bring the mood down, ruin it.
Again, I'm still in the frame.

436
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:34,624
Who wants Barry to walk her home,
while the other one comes homes with me?

437
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:35,673
Neither of us.

438
00:21:35,821 --> 00:21:37,535
Final scenario.
Listen to this, right?

439
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:38,780
Neither of you's interested in Barry,

440
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:40,698
so obviously I choose the fit one,
no disrespect to you.

441
00:21:40,748 --> 00:21:43,831
We all go back to mine, Barry keeps talking
to you while she and I get down to it.

442
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:46,964
It'll take, I swear to God, 10 minutes max.
I can get everything done in that time.

443
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:48,876
Then you get a cab fare,
anywhere you wanna go...

444
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:51,305
Up to say a maximum value of 15£.

445
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:53,524
Or you could walk home,
pocket the cash...

446
00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:55,338
you've made a sweet profit.
So it's up to you.

447
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:57,063
No? Alright Bar, forget it, mate.

448
00:21:57,114 --> 00:21:59,050
Always know when to cut
your losses. Let's go.

449
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,697
I mean, he was actually
a qualified surgeon, if I'm not wrong.

450
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,830
And he used to sing
at the operating theatre.

451
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:10,852
That's where he got his first start,

452
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:13,257
because one of the patients
he was operating on

453
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:16,797
was and A & R man from Decca Records.
You oughta know Decca.

454
00:22:17,092 --> 00:22:20,484
Sorry. It's a bit of a hustle there,
can we just pop us down there?

455
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:23,185
Not really, this is the VIP section.
Can you step away from the rope please?

456
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:25,578
No, I was in there a minute ago.
I was a VIP a minute. What happened?

457
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:28,218
There's nothing I can do, sir.
Can you step away from the...

458
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,716
Come on, I've got more in common
with David Bowie than this rabble.

459
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:37,628
How do you work that out ?

460
00:22:37,677 --> 00:22:40,329
We're both entertainers, we've both
done something with our lives.

461
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:42,672
I don't think you can equate
yourself with David Bowie.

462
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,122
He's one of the several artists
of the last 35 years

463
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,284
doing work tantamount to genius.

464
00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:51,255
Whereas you've just made
a camp catch-phrase-based comedy.

465
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,167
I just got a bad review
of the bouncer.

466
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:55,165
- No, I just know what i like.
- Yeah? Do you like money?

467
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:57,471
- Sorry?
- Do you like money? 20 quid?

468
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:00,123
Sorry, you're trying to bribe me
to sit next to David Bowie, now?

469
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,649
I give you 20 quid
to sit there in the spare seats.

470
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:08,214
- Fifty.
- Fifty quid?

471
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:11,889
Let's see it.

472
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,093
You got a ten?
I've only got twenties.

473
00:23:18,204 --> 00:23:19,721
That's either forty or sixty, then.

474
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,361
Sixty, then.

475
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:25,814
That's for both of us.

476
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:32,499
Go and get a drink,
I haven't got any money now.

477
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:34,879
- What're you doing in there?
- VIP area.

478
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:36,409
Can we come in?
Cause we're getting no action out here.

479
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:38,789
- It's a wasteland.
- You're on your own. Not made of money.

480
00:23:41,317 --> 00:23:44,585
It's the same seat! It's actually
the same seat for 60 quid.

481
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:46,620
You paid 60 quid to go in here?
You should've let me negotiate.

482
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:47,829
Your show's shit, mate!

483
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:50,641
They can still see me. There should be
an actual barrier or something.

484
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:53,089
Let's go sit next to David Bowie.
He's not getting any hassle.

485
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:55,445
- We can't just sit next to...
- Come on, we just go and speak to him.

486
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:57,504
- I don't know.
- Excuse me.

487
00:24:01,118 --> 00:24:04,140
Mr Bowie, can I just say that...
we're both very big fans...

488
00:24:04,214 --> 00:24:06,348
I can't hear you love,
come over here.

489
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,567
I'll chat with you later.

490
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,381
Thank you.

491
00:24:14,316 --> 00:24:17,720
We were just saying that...
I'm an entertainer, too.

492
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:19,372
- What do you do?
- I'm in a sitcom.

493
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:21,703
It's called "When the Whistle Blows".
Have you seen it?

494
00:24:21,765 --> 00:24:23,578
I haven't, no.
Is it any good?

495
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:25,390
No, it's shit!

496
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:28,066
Just riff-raff everywhere.

497
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,274
Not going down to well, eh?

498
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:33,086
It's getting six million viewers.
I mean it's...

499
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,193
It's not exactly what I meant it to be,
cause the BBC have interfered, and...

500
00:24:37,316 --> 00:24:41,016
So I chased ratings
and waited lowest common denominator...

501
00:24:41,164 --> 00:24:43,199
The catch-phrase isn't...
Wigs and...

502
00:24:43,335 --> 00:24:45,431
I think I've sold out, to be honest.

503
00:24:45,937 --> 00:24:47,812
It's difficult, you know, when they...

504
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,785
To keep your integrity
when you're going for that first...

505
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:52,856
<i>Little fat man who sold his soul</i>

506
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:53,781
The little...?

507
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,938
<i>Little fat man who sold his dream</i>

508
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:02,242
<i>Chubby little loser</i>

509
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:08,371
<i>Chubby little loser</i>

510
00:25:08,446 --> 00:25:10,604
<i>National joke</i>

511
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:13,218
No, not "chubby little loser".

512
00:25:14,161 --> 00:25:16,775
<i>Pathetic little fat man</i>

513
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:19,166
<i>No one's bloody laughing</i>

514
00:25:19,245 --> 00:25:21,747
<i>The clown that no one laughs at</i>

515
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:24,785
<i>They all just wish he died</i>

516
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,552
<i>He's so depressed at being useless</i>

517
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:32,749
- <i>The fat man takes his own life</i>
- No, no.

518
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:36,237
<i>He's so depressed at being hated</i>

519
00:25:36,316 --> 00:25:38,543
<i>Fatty takes his own life</i>

520
00:25:38,598 --> 00:25:40,358
- Fatty? Fatso?
- Fatso. I think...

521
00:25:40,397 --> 00:25:41,944
Yeah, let's go with fatso.

522
00:25:42,181 --> 00:25:44,423
<i>Fatso takes his own life</i>

523
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:47,295
<i>He blows his bloated face off</i>

524
00:25:47,366 --> 00:25:48,227
No.

525
00:25:48,763 --> 00:25:51,699
<i>He blows his stupid brains out</i>

526
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:53,767
But the twat probably miss!

527
00:25:53,806 --> 00:25:56,750
- Yes, Linda, I like that.
- Yes, so do I. It's brilliant, Linda.

528
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:01,280
<i>He sold his soul for a shot at fame</i>

529
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:04,926
<i>Catch phrase and wig
And the jokes are lame</i>

530
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:07,043
<i>He's got no style</i>

531
00:26:07,114 --> 00:26:09,135
<i>He's got no grace</i>

532
00:26:09,182 --> 00:26:13,081
<i>He's banal and facile.
He's a fat waste of space</i>

533
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:15,646
Yeah, yeah.
Everybody, sing that last line.

534
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:17,279
One, two, three

535
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:21,518
<i>He's banal and facile.
He's a fat waste of space</i>

536
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:25,488
<i>See his pug-nosed face.</i>

537
00:26:26,025 --> 00:26:29,782
<i>Pug, pug
Pug, pug...</i> Again.

538
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:33,728
<i>See his pug-nosed face</i>

539
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:54,233
<i>Little fat man</i>

540
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,922
<i>with the pug-nosed face</i>

541
00:26:59,795 --> 00:27:01,817
<i>He's a little fat man</i>

542
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,817
- What'd you have for tea?
- Turkey.

543
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:14,272
What else?

544
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:15,591
Turkey.

545
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:21,783
A pint of Foster's.

546
00:27:21,894 --> 00:27:24,385
Hi, a pint of Foster's
and a dry white wine.

547
00:27:28,286 --> 00:27:29,751
He's put some weight on.

548
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,308
5.80? You having a laugh?

549
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:35,848
It's him, it's him!
It's Andy Millman!

550
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:40,189
- How's it going?
- This is Ralph.

551
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:41,990
Walnut.

552
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:44,456
And this is Count Fuckulla.

553
00:27:44,518 --> 00:27:45,986
Oh hey,
why do they call you that?

554
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,416
Cause if I see something,
I've got to fuck it.

555
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:49,957
I never stop.

556
00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:53,053
He never stops.

557
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:54,434
He never stops.

558
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:56,000
Oh, yes, sure.

559
00:27:57,808 --> 00:27:59,501
Get picture?

560
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:02,576
Here, here.
"I don't get it."

561
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,262
It's Gobler!
