1
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:16,571
- Why did you do that?
- It's called acting.

2
00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:18,729
Why did you have to be quite so rough?

3
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,856
Strange, that's what a bird
said to me last night.

4
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,771
25 years old, absolutely gorgeous.

5
00:00:28,418 --> 00:00:31,535
We did it five times. Nearly wore me out.

6
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:35,247
By the end of it...
bollocks like a bulldog, I tell you.

7
00:00:40,737 --> 00:00:43,968
Cut! That's good, print that,
move to the next one. Mike.

8
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:47,208
Richard, that's exactly what I was talking
about with the smoke, thank you.

9
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,855
Right. I want to go in tighter, all right.

10
00:00:48,937 --> 00:00:50,450
- Did you see me?
- It was brilliant.

11
00:00:50,537 --> 00:00:52,094
You'll get more money for that.

12
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:53,655
- Do I?
- It's a direction, yeah?

13
00:00:53,736 --> 00:00:55,089
- Yes.
- You get more money.

14
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:57,326
- Excellent.
- It's called supplementary performance fee.

15
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,895
- Talk to the production manager.
- Brilliant.

16
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,285
- Am I going to sort everyone's life out?
- Here we go.

17
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:03,970
Talk to the production manager
and you'll get a few extra quid.

18
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:05,774
God knows you could do with it.

19
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:08,972
- These aren't my clothes.
- You could have fooled me.

20
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:26,005
Hey, guys.
Guys, people, can we gather around, please?

21
00:01:26,094 --> 00:01:27,447
Guys.

22
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:35,013
This is Goran,
this is the man whose story we're making.

23
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:43,570
Okay, he's the reason we're gathered here,
to share his story with the world.

24
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:47,371
A lot of you might be thinking
why am I making this movie.

25
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:52,162
Sure, you guys look at me as one of
the world's most successful comedy actors.

26
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:53,890
What does that mean?

27
00:01:53,972 --> 00:01:57,442
I mean, yeah, I make Along Came Polly
and it opens to $32 million.

28
00:01:57,532 --> 00:02:01,161
One of the biggest Martin Luther King Junior
birthday holiday opening weekends ever.

29
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:03,322
Goes on to gross 170 million worldwide.

30
00:02:03,412 --> 00:02:05,242
Meet the Parents, double that.

31
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:10,883
But what does the money and the success
mean in real terms?

32
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:14,760
If I find a little orphan child in a war zone...

33
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:17,562
hiding in a burnt out building,

34
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:21,768
his parents murdered,
persecuted for his race,

35
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,205
his religion, what am I going to do?

36
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,286
Pop on Dodgeball on DVD?

37
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,644
It's a funny film.

38
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,164
Thanks and I can put on Dodgeball

39
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,241
and he's going to laugh for an hour
and 32 minutes.

40
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:38,322
You know, escape reality for a while,
but what happens when the film finishes?

41
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:41,201
Back to reality.

42
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:44,361
Still an orphan, still living with fear.

43
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,167
How do I help him, hm?

44
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:48,798
Put on Dodgeball again?

45
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:52,403
Sure he's going to laugh again,
he'll see things he didn't see the first time,

46
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:56,720
it's layered, it was made like that,
but this can't go on indefinitely, all right?

47
00:02:56,808 --> 00:03:00,596
At a certain point, you know, after the fifth,
sixth, seventh viewing,

48
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:03,884
he's still laughing,

49
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:07,278
but it's not getting
to the root of the problem, okay?

50
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,476
How do I help him?

51
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:12,356
Make Dodgeball 2?

52
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,403
Make this movie.

53
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:17,604
Make people think. Change attitudes.

54
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:22,559
So, think on that
while you're sipping on your frappuccinos.

55
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:26,195
- And what are we doing? Mike?
- Let's have a break.

56
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:28,959
Break time, okay, good.
Thank you, thank you very much.

57
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:31,514
Thanks, everyone.
Back at quarter past, thank you.

58
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:45,076
And I want you to just be coming
straight in, without...

59
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:48,076
There shouldn't be a delay
between when the grenade has gone off

60
00:03:48,164 --> 00:03:49,995
and when you guys come around.

61
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:53,599
Ben, is it possible, please, more smoke?

62
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:55,356
- Was there more smoke?
- Yes.

63
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,912
Okay, can I get more smoke, please!

64
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,676
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

65
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:02,755
All right, guys, now while
we have the smoke, can you come around...

66
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,515
- Also...
... charging right... Yeah.

67
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:06,673
The Coke, it's not cold.

68
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:10,233
Sorry, okay,
just kill the smoke for a second. What?

69
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:11,881
My Coke is not cold.

70
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:13,555
- Your Coke's not cold?
- No.

71
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:15,918
- Okay, all right. Mike?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,114
Can we get him a cold Coke? Okay?

73
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:21,392
Make sure his Coke is always cold, okay.

74
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:23,552
Look at that, he gets anything he wants.

75
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:25,872
I know,
but he's been through a lot, hasn't he?

76
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:27,520
I know he's been through a lot,

77
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:30,196
but they're making a film,
he's not a competition winner.

78
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:32,112
That's where the real power lies here.

79
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:36,592
- I think he's quite attractive actually.
- Forget it, I know what you're thinking.

80
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:39,195
Never get involved with a man
whose wife's been murdered.

81
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:40,760
That's awful. Why?

82
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:43,230
Well, for one,
he's not going to be a barrel of laughs.

83
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:46,869
Two, you can't compete with her. It's not
like the marriage started going downhill

84
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,474
and she was boozing and sleeping around,
do you know what I mean?

85
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,471
She was taken from him
at the peak of their love.

86
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,269
She's gone out on a high,
she's like Marilyn Monroe or Jimmy Dean,

87
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,716
Never get involved with a man
whose wife's been murdered. Rule one.

88
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,790
Choose someone else.

89
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,949
Well, who then?

90
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,916
It's as easy as that, isn't it, to you?

91
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:10,437
Yeah come in, just one second.

92
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,828
I think maybe I'm owed some money.

93
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:15,557
Some supplementary performance money
or something, I think?

94
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:18,072
Right, give me one second.

95
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:20,627
Hi.

96
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:23,753
Hi.

97
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:25,476
How can I help?

98
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,914
Yes, the thing, the supplementary acting fee.

99
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:31,636
Right, I'll have to check
with the first AD really.

100
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:34,277
- Let me get your details up.
- Okay.

101
00:05:34,357 --> 00:05:36,632
- What's your name?
- Maggie Jacobs.

102
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:39,185
- Just take a seat, Maggie.
- Thank you.

103
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:54,226
I hope your wife doesn't catch me
on your sofa.

104
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:55,715
Or your girlfriend.

105
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:57,832
- I'm not married.
- Or your girlfriend.

106
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:00,345
I haven't got a girlfriend.

107
00:06:00,915 --> 00:06:03,793
- Or I suppose your boyfriend.
- I'm not gay.

108
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,435
I should be worried
your husband catches you in here.

109
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:10,985
I'm not married and I don't have a boyfriend
and I'm not a lesbian.

110
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:13,111
I'm all done, available.

111
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:27,267
Hello.

112
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:31,221
Erm, you get on well with Ben.

113
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:34,669
I wondered if you could sort of, like,
have a word with him about me

114
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:38,672
because I'm a proper actor,
I'm an extra in this but I've done, you know...

115
00:06:39,593 --> 00:06:41,470
lines...

116
00:06:41,553 --> 00:06:42,985
You okay?

117
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:45,466
Yeah.

118
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:47,110
What you got there?

119
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:49,581
My wife, pictures of my wife.

120
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:52,503
I heard about that, yeah, sorry.

121
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:56,665
- Memories. Wonderful love.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:59,700
This is her, very beautiful.

123
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,985
She is.

124
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:05,223
Our first holiday.
Here she is with my son, one year old.

125
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:07,541
- Nice boy.
- Nice no more.

126
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:09,906
Dead. Dead boy.

127
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,302
My wife again.

128
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,745
Oh, I shouldn't look at that.
Was she sunbathing?

129
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,060
No, she is dead.

130
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,300
- Lying in the street.
- Oh, I see now.

131
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,108
- Dead.
- Yeah, yes.

132
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:30,546
- Why did you take...
- Why did I take photograph of her?

133
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:33,223
To show the world what must be shown.

134
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:36,028
This is why I want film to be made
by Ben Stiller.

135
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:37,667
Ben Stiller of Zoolander, sure.

136
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,626
You look. Dead, naked.

137
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,824
- Yeah.
- You look.

138
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:44,059
I am, but I'm only looking
at her dead naked face.

139
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:49,064
Where did you get these developed?

140
00:07:49,148 --> 00:07:50,501
My cousin.

141
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:53,944
I was going to say, it's not the sort of thing
you pop into Boots with.

142
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,063
Boots?

143
00:07:55,148 --> 00:07:59,504
Oh, it's a chain of chemists,
high street pharmacy.

144
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:02,420
They don't just do pharmacy now,
they do everything.

145
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:07,058
They do gifts, sandwiches,
weight watchers, smoothies, things like that.

146
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:09,536
We don't have Boots.

147
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:13,739
You missed a trick. True Print give you a
free film when you get something developed.

148
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,418
So you're a mug.

149
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:19,579
Anyway, if you could put a word in to Ben
to get me a line...

150
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:23,619
in this...

151
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:31,544
I'll catch you later.

152
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:39,344
He's got photos and everything.

153
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:41,494
- That's not going to help, is it?
- No.

154
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:44,735
What worries me is I can't push it,
can't go up to him and remind him,

155
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,294
"Sorry to interrupt you again when you're
thinking of your slaughtered loved ones

156
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:51,501
"but that line, have you done anything
about it?" Do you know what I mean?

157
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:54,144
Might seem a wee bit insensitive, eh?

158
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:56,179
Yeah, it could do.

159
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:59,221
- Oh, be warned, Jackie Greer's on the prowl.
- Why?

160
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:01,817
- She's having a birthday do.
- Forget it, I'm not going.

161
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:04,178
- I'm not going if you're not going.
- Don't go, then.

162
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:07,175
No, but I can't not go
because she's always really nice to me.

163
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:09,935
- Well, have an excuse ready.
- Like what?

164
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:14,018
My standard is,
"Oh, my sister's coming down to stay. "

165
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:16,696
I find out exactly when it is, though.
I go, "When is it?"

166
00:09:16,782 --> 00:09:18,261
"This Saturday. "
"This Saturday?

167
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:20,333
"I can't, my sister's coming down. "

168
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:22,697
You're gutted,
you'd loved to have gone but family...

169
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:27,650
Oh, hello, you two.
I like your hair like that. Isn't she beautiful?

170
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:30,256
Now listen up, no excuses.

171
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:34,698
My birthday this week, I'm having
birthday drinks. I'm 21 again.

172
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:38,968
And I command you both to be there
and I won't take no for an answer.

173
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,129
Okay.

174
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,575
- My sister's...
- When is it?

175
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,369
- When is it?
- Friday, after we wrap. It's only local.

176
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,853
- This Friday?
- This Friday?

177
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,929
Yeah, Friday.

178
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,012
Oh, no, I can't do this Friday,
my sister is coming down.

179
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:56,137
Well, bring her along, I'd love to meet her.

180
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,651
Okay, I'll bring her along.

181
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:02,491
- Well, you can't bring her along.
- No.

182
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:04,410
- You can't actually physically bring...
- Why?

183
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:08,252
You haven't got a sister, you're confused.
My sister's coming down.

184
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:09,612
I just got confused.

185
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:11,529
- So you can come?
- Yes, I can come.

186
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:14,894
- And you, darling?
- As she said, my sister's coming down, so...

187
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:16,809
And as I said, bring her along.

188
00:10:16,898 --> 00:10:19,537
But what she didn't say was
she's coming down because she's ill.

189
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:20,846
Oh, brilliant.

190
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:23,497
- God, is it serious?
- We're not sure.

191
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:26,011
- Well, send her my love.
- I will.

192
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:28,093
- But I will see you there?
- Definitely.

193
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:30,486
- Yes, I've got no excuses.
- Yeah.

194
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:33,617
See you later.
Bye.

195
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:35,176
Brilliant.

196
00:10:35,257 --> 00:10:37,372
- Oh, my God, you're coming.
- No, I'm not.

197
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:40,687
I've got to be punished because you
didn't think on your feet quickly enough?

198
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:43,244
- I can't go on my own.
- I can't go at all.

199
00:10:43,336 --> 00:10:46,009
- What if my sister died?
- What's she got?

200
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:49,732
I haven't got a sister.

201
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,932
- You haven't got a sister?
- No, I made it up, an excuse.

202
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:55,691
Reading a little magazine there, are you?

203
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:57,731
- Yes.
- Do you understand it?

204
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:00,894
Would you rather have all your food
too salty or too sweet?

205
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:03,250
Doesn't matter if it's too anything.
It's rubbish, isn't it?

206
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,973
You see, I would have too salty.

207
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:07,648
No, it'd be rubbish.
If it's too salty, it'd be rubbish.

208
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,008
Yeah, but I like savoury things.

209
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:11,403
But you said too salty,
which means it's horrible.

210
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:13,769
- I like crisps.
- Don't ask me any more questions.

211
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:16,163
- Hello, again.
Hey, hello.

212
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,324
- This is my friend Andy.
- Hi.

213
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:20,132
Hiya. Jon.

214
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:23,011
- What are you doing here?
- I'm just having lunch.

215
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:26,927
- That's what we're doing, isn't it?
- Yeah, just letting it cool down here, though.

216
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:29,368
Having a bit of lunch
just before we go back to work.

217
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:32,331
- Are you having to work late tonight, then?
- No, not tonight.

218
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:36,200
I'm going to a drinks do. I don't know
if you know, it's Jackie Greer's birthday.

219
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:40,126
Oh, my God, I'm going! I'm already going.
Oh, spooky.

220
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:42,248
I'm sure you're welcome
to come along as well.

221
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:44,323
I can't, I'm doing anything else.

222
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,290
So do you know Jackie Greer very well,
good friends?

223
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:50,886
Not really, no. The producer's going down
so he sort of asked us to go along.

224
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:53,607
- You know, team bonding or whatever.
- The producer of this?

225
00:11:53,642 --> 00:11:57,637
Yeah, Martin the producer. He's going to
be there. He knows Jackie from years back.

226
00:11:57,724 --> 00:12:01,604
Yeah, I'll probably move stuff around.
I might as well come down for a couple of...

227
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:05,839
Yeah? Okay, we'll see you later on then
for a drink and a bit of a laugh, eh?

228
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:07,280
That'd be great, yeah.

229
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:11,567
Yeah, well I'd better get this down me.
Line my stomach. Coq au vin.

230
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:15,563
- Sounds a bit rude, doesn't it?
- Not really.

231
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,209
What have you gone for?

232
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,763
Oh, boring.
Just three bean salad, spinach and smoothie.

233
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:24,927
- I'm on a high fibre diet.
- Oh. No bowel cancer for you, then.

234
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:28,893
Hopefully not, no.

235
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:32,097
- Okay. See you later.
- See you later, bye.

236
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:33,496
Bye.

237
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,375
- "No bowel cancer for you, then?"
- All right.

238
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:38,211
Classic. That's really funny.

239
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:45,820
- Hi.
- Hello.

240
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:47,541
- You all right?
- Yes.

241
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:50,092
- You're not going to...
- No, no, I'm good.

242
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:53,734
- Good. Well, I got you a gift.
- Why?

243
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:57,137
Just to say thanks for being part
of this amazing project, you know.

244
00:12:57,227 --> 00:12:58,785
Oh, thank you very much.

245
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:02,657
And to thank you for the line you said
you'd get me, do you remember?

246
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,980
- Did I?
- Yeah, you probably don't remember

247
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,869
because you were crying
about your dead family and stuff.

248
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:10,102
But you said you'd ask Ben for a line.

249
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:13,105
Are you going to ask Ben for a line?

250
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,503
Yes, I can do that.

251
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,825
I didn't know what to get you,
got you vouchers.

252
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:19,587
- Vouchers?
- Yeah.

253
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,792
Fifteen quids' worth.

254
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:24,107
- It's like money?
- It's exactly like money

255
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:26,553
but you can only spend it at Top Shop.

256
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:29,949
So, you'll ask Ben, yeah?

257
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,308
Yeah.

258
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,790
Brilliant. Fifteen quid.

259
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,759
See you later.

260
00:13:47,806 --> 00:13:49,286
Cut! Cut!

261
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:53,159
Why is he laughing?
Why are you laughing, hm?

262
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,560
- I tripped up.
- What's so funny?

263
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,322
I tripped up.

264
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,882
Okay. All right, do you think this is funny?

265
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:04,164
You think war is funny?

266
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:07,087
Do you think genocide is funny? Huh?

267
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,845
Are you his mum? Yeah. Let me ask you this.

268
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:13,008
Do you think this'll be funny?
If I shot your mother right now?

269
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:15,452
If I shot your mummy in the face,
would that make you laugh?

270
00:14:15,537 --> 00:14:17,290
Do you think that would be funny?

271
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:20,849
If I blew your mother's face off now,
would that make you laugh?

272
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:23,818
Okay, so maybe you should think
of that next time you trip, okay?

273
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,937
Let's do it right now, let's go.

274
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:30,259
Still rolling.
- And the atrocities continue.

275
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:32,697
And action!

276
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:34,696
It's so itchy, this.

277
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:52,706
Maggie and Andy.
- Hi.

278
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:58,427
- Is that for me?
- Yes.

279
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:01,791
Thank you so much. I wasn't expecting you,
I thought your sister was ill.

280
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,913
Yes, but it turned out to be
not as serious as we first thought.

281
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:07,716
So, yeah, women's problems.

282
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:11,511
Typical, quite a build up.
I had to get out of the house in the end.

283
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:15,958
I thought she was gonna have my face off.
A Rottweiler with lipstick.

284
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,759
Busy, though.

285
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:20,351
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

286
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:22,798
Someone said the producer was coming.
Is that...

287
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:25,000
It's Martin, he's over there.

288
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:26,803
- Oh, okay.
- You look gorgeous.

289
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,923
Look at you, I wouldn't have thought
to put that with that...

290
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:42,000
...and that's the same problem we've got...

291
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:43,805
Hello!

292
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:46,008
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

293
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:48,687
No, it was Elaine's idea originally.

294
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:51,242
He says that every time,
but it was both of us.

295
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:55,488
It's usually true. Anyway,
it's modern retellings of the old stories

296
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:57,454
and we're going to make several of them.

297
00:15:57,537 --> 00:16:00,052
It's going to be a little bit like
Kieslowski's Decalogue.

298
00:16:00,138 --> 00:16:01,617
- Have you see those?
- Yes.

299
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:05,932
Well, you know there's that one character,
the Watcher, and it's a fantastic character.

300
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,251
Have you read that
Kieslowski on Kieslowski book?

301
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:09,535
No, I haven't.

302
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:12,933
He wrote later that he was so upset
that he left him out of two of the films

303
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:14,741
'cause he really wished he was...

304
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:17,099
It's his fault, should've...

305
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:21,536
Do you want a drink?
I'm a friend of Jackie's. My round.

306
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:24,664
- Oh, great, we're on champagne.
- Three glasses of champagne.

307
00:16:24,747 --> 00:16:28,139
- Oh, just get a bottle.
- Yes, definitely.

308
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,618
Anyway, so...

309
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:35,901
What do you mean,
why have you not seen me around?

310
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:37,141
I've gone red.

311
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:39,701
Have you done other productions?
Are you an actress?

312
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:42,024
- No.
- Oh, you look like you should be an actress.

313
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:43,867
- Costume dramas or something like that.
- Yeah?

314
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:48,993
I'd imagine it'll be seconds...

315
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:03,834
Hi. Andy.

316
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,720
Oh, Andy, yeah. Oh, cheers.

317
00:17:05,803 --> 00:17:06,839
Cheers.

318
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:11,396
Just thinking what you and Ben
are doing in this film, wonderful,

319
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:13,556
it moved me, so...

320
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:15,205
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

321
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:18,166
Can I ask you something?
What was your inspiration?

322
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:20,319
Well, obviously the story.

323
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:21,637
Oh, yeah.

324
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:23,925
In film terms. Probably something like the...

325
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,729
- Are you a film buff?
- I adore films.

326
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,610
Well, I'll tell you what I re-watched
when we were planning this.

327
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:29,681
Oh, please do.

328
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:32,334
Andrzej Wajda's War Trilogy.
They're extraordinary, aren't they?

329
00:17:32,414 --> 00:17:33,529
Yeah.

330
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:38,087
Ben's been watching them, particularly in
relation to battle scenes, a lot of Kurosawa.

331
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:39,689
Oh, okay.

332
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:43,248
Yeah, particularly in relation
to the kineticism of the mise en scène.

333
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:45,773
In the film. Yeah, I see.

334
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:47,292
You a fan? Generally?

335
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:48,972
- Yes.
- Of Japanese cinema?

336
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,938
- Oh, definitely.
- Oh, well.

337
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:53,334
Kurosawa's obviously a master.

338
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:54,696
Yeah, he's number one.

339
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,092
I suppose on a personal level,
I'm more a fan of Ozu.

340
00:17:57,183 --> 00:18:00,939
Me, too, but I think they're both,
they're both big boys.

341
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:04,177
- The aesthetics are completely different.
- Chalk and cheese, but...

342
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:07,816
- He tends to knock the camera off.
- And the other one just lets it on.

343
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:10,217
It was Elaine actually
who turned me on to Ozu.

344
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:12,539
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, I wasn't really a fan before.

345
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:13,983
Really?

346
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,183
No, I'm sure you've found this.

347
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:18,627
You say to someone, "Do you like
Japanese cinema?" and they say,

348
00:18:18,712 --> 00:18:20,111
"No, can't get into it, boring. "

349
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:22,263
And you say,
"Well, do you like the Magnificent Seven?"

350
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:24,231
- And they say, "Yes. "
- Yeah, they like that.

351
00:18:24,314 --> 00:18:27,466
And you think, well,
it's a remake of the Seven Samurai.

352
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:30,309
Yeah, yeah, course it is.
What, they didn't know that?

353
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:32,752
- No.
- Seven's the clue. Can't just make that up.

354
00:18:32,837 --> 00:18:35,671
No, it really upsets me.
I want everyone to love the Seven Samurai.

355
00:18:35,758 --> 00:18:40,470
I love all the number films, really.
Seven Samurai, Ocean's Eleven, Dirty Dozen.

356
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,359
Which is about as many as I think
you can have on screen at once.

357
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:45,956
- But seven is perfect for me.
- Apologies for this,

358
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,637
but I don't really recognise you.
What are you doing?

359
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:53,355
I'm an actor, yeah. Although at the moment,
I'm concentrating more on background work,

360
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:56,836
looking out towards getting a speaking role.
In anything.

361
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:59,886
- Andy, sorry to interrupt.
- Not at all.

362
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:01,401
Listen, can I have a quick word?

363
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:03,559
- Not now, I'm a little bit busy.
- Two minutes.

364
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:06,722
- I'm in the middle...
- Don't mind us. We'll be here.

365
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,642
Yeah? Okay, all right.

366
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:15,812
I just wanted to let you know that
Jon's going on somewhere else

367
00:19:15,894 --> 00:19:17,532
- and he's asked me to go with him.
- Fine.

368
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,813
I wanted to let you know
because it was me who dragged you here.

369
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:23,286
You'd be all annoyed
because I'd disappeared...

370
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:24,890
I'm fine, I'm chatting.

371
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:26,889
- He's nice.
- He is, yes.

372
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:31,090
- Foot doesn't bother you?
- Eh?

373
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,900
I know you're a deeply shallow person,
I thought the foot would be a problem.

374
00:19:33,981 --> 00:19:35,050
What do you mean?

375
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:39,022
He's got one leg shorter than the other, look.
He's wearing one of them big shoes.

376
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:41,664
- Oh, my God.
- You didn't notice that?

377
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:44,134
Well, no, it was under the table, wasn't it?

378
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,660
- Yes. Must have been a big table.
- No, don't.

379
00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:48,384
- What?
- I didn't see.

380
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:52,143
Oh, look at him. He's a lovely man.
He's funny, he's attractive.

381
00:19:52,228 --> 00:19:55,027
Look at him, everybody loves him,
life and soul of the party.

382
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:57,704
- Certainly the sole.
- Oh, come on.

383
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,261
If you're above it. If you don't mind
being known as Maggie, "Who's Maggie?"

384
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:04,504
"Maggie, the girl who goes out with
the fellow with the big shoe," that's fine.

385
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:06,504
But they can do something
about it now, can't they?

386
00:20:06,593 --> 00:20:09,108
- No.
- Some doctor in China or something.

387
00:20:09,194 --> 00:20:12,711
No, it's weird, that's the one thing
they can't do anything about.

388
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:16,073
They can give you a new face, new heart,
new lungs, new liver, new anything,

389
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:17,591
but if you go to a doctor and you say,

390
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:19,874
"Doc, I've got one leg
slightly shorter than the other,"

391
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,597
doesn't matter if you got a million pounds,

392
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,469
they can send you to Switzerland and
all you're coming home with is a big shoe.

393
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:28,520
- Stop it.
- That's fine, if it's not a problem for you.

394
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,117
I'm not so shallow
that I can't see beyond his big foot.

395
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:34,002
I know you,
you'll get involved and it will be a problem.

396
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:36,235
All I'm saying is this,
don't rush off with him tonight.

397
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:39,204
Sleep on it, if it's not a problem tomorrow,
give him a call.

398
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:42,757
- In the morning?
- Absolutely, why rush into it now? He's here.

399
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:46,165
- Hey.
- Hi.

400
00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:48,366
I'm ready to get going if you are.

401
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,406
Now? Right now?

402
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:54,287
Er... I don't think I can go right now.

403
00:20:55,372 --> 00:20:57,648
Oh, right. You said you fancied it just then.

404
00:20:57,733 --> 00:20:59,964
Yeah, but he just reminded me of something.

405
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:03,365
- Yeah, I just reminded her.
- I don't think I can go.

406
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:07,735
Is it... Is it the leg?

407
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,213
Hm?

408
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:14,891
Is it the fact that I've got one leg
shorter than the other?

409
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:18,697
- I hadn't noticed.
- You hadn't noticed?

410
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:20,056
I hadn't.

411
00:21:24,464 --> 00:21:28,299
- You hadn't noticed that?
- Oh! No.

412
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:31,538
- I hadn't. God, it's a big clumpy one.
- Don't say clumpy.

413
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:35,587
- It's like a big Herman Munster.
- Oh! Don't say...

414
00:21:36,388 --> 00:21:38,505
- Er...
- Oh, that's...

415
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,229
Do these come in any other styles?

416
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,990
Do you have to buy a pair
and throw one away?

417
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:49,065
It's been good talking to you.

418
00:21:49,153 --> 00:21:51,907
- Just interested because...
- I've never seen a live one.

419
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:54,270
Maybe I can phone you tomorrow.

420
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:58,145
No. No, don't worry about it.
You've shown your true colours.

421
00:22:00,678 --> 00:22:04,228
- That was you.
- It wasn't my fault. How was it my fault?

422
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,912
That poor man.

423
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,038
All his life he's had to deal with people
that are so shallow

424
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:13,639
that they can't see beyond his foot thing
and he's going to think I'm like that.

425
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:14,951
You are.

426
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,274
I don't want him to know that.

427
00:22:17,364 --> 00:22:20,722
- Well, don't say Herman Munster then.
- Well, it just slipped out.

428
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,558
Herman Munster just slipped out?

429
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,050
Bit more room.

430
00:22:35,091 --> 00:22:38,722
We were having a conversation earlier
about films, weren't we?

431
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:40,371
You'd have hated it.

432
00:22:40,453 --> 00:22:44,926
I was going to ask you about this film.
Are there any parts left to cast?

433
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:48,292
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Oh, that's a shame.

434
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:51,295
- Jon seemed quite upset.
- Was he?

435
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:54,617
I thought you were getting on with him.
You seemed to be.

436
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:55,893
Yeah, we were.

437
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:58,210
But you don't want to see him
because of his foot?

438
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,577
- I didn't say that.
- But it is though, isn't it?

439
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:04,130
Well, it's her private life, innit?

440
00:23:04,222 --> 00:23:08,695
Yeah, I'm just saying that I think it's a shame
that she obviously goes through life

441
00:23:08,824 --> 00:23:10,975
not liking anyone that's different than her.

442
00:23:11,065 --> 00:23:12,704
That's not true.

443
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:16,702
She's gets on with anyone,
tall, thin, black, white, yellow.

444
00:23:16,787 --> 00:23:18,585
She's not prejudiced.

445
00:23:19,348 --> 00:23:21,658
- Who's yellow?
- What?

446
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:27,505
Well, you were just listing racial types,
black, white... Who's yellow?

447
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:38,232
- That's what we call the Chinese sometimes.
- Oh, do we?

448
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,912
The Chinese? Well, one, I'm American

449
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:45,918
and two, my parents are Japanese,
not Chinese.

450
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:48,069
Oh, yes, Japanese, Chinese I wasn't...

451
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,473
What do you mean, Japanese, Chinese?
Both the same to you, are they?

452
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:55,520
Well, don't make me sound like a racist,
I don't happen to know

453
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,117
the intricate differences
between Japanese and Chinese people.

454
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,081
There's that thing
that they teach you at school.

455
00:24:00,164 --> 00:24:01,200
No.

456
00:24:01,285 --> 00:24:04,323
Chinese, Japanese, dirty knees,
what are these?

457
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:09,802
- Do you remember it?
- Yeah, it rings a bell.

458
00:24:09,888 --> 00:24:12,084
- Okay? That's us.
- Yeah.

459
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:13,921
Cheers, good night.

460
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,405
- Are we going?
- Yeah. Do you know why?

461
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:18,890
- No.
- Guess.

462
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:20,963
- Because of the foot.
- No.

463
00:24:27,895 --> 00:24:29,807
- I know the first...
- Then we've got the second one.

464
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:34,095
Okay, I don't need to hear, you know,
the story of how we got to this point.

465
00:24:34,177 --> 00:24:37,808
I know what point we're at, I'm just
wondering when we can actually shoot it.

466
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,179
- Hey.
- Hi.

467
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,579
- Good news.
- Yeah?

468
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,891
- I got you line.
- Really?

469
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:47,737
I talk to Ben, he say, here, you see.
Journalist Two.

470
00:24:47,823 --> 00:24:50,577
"Don't go down there!
There are snipers down there. "

471
00:24:50,664 --> 00:24:53,259
Don't go down there!
There are snipers down there.

472
00:24:53,345 --> 00:24:55,337
- What you doing?
- The accent. I was gonna...

473
00:24:55,426 --> 00:24:58,737
- Don't.
- I won't do the accent. That's brilliant.

474
00:24:58,827 --> 00:25:00,625
- Okay.
- Excellent.

475
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:01,743
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

476
00:25:01,828 --> 00:25:05,219
Hold on. Sorry, there's two journalists here.
Journalist One and Journalist Two.

477
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:07,619
I'm Journalist Two,
but Journalist One's got all the lines.

478
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,421
Look, him, him, him, me, snipers.
Him, him, him.

479
00:25:11,632 --> 00:25:13,908
I think I should do Journalist Two, you know.

480
00:25:13,993 --> 00:25:16,064
I think someone else already doing that.

481
00:25:16,154 --> 00:25:19,670
- I know, but we could swap. I'd be better.
- I got you a line.

482
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:22,509
I know, but remember the vouchers.
I got you the vouchers, didn't I?

483
00:25:22,596 --> 00:25:23,916
I put them towards this top.

484
00:25:23,997 --> 00:25:25,749
- Brilliant. Doesn't that look good?
- Nice.

485
00:25:25,837 --> 00:25:29,070
Looks really good. Have a word
and see if I could do Journalist Two.

486
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,478
He's busy.

487
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,873
Yeah, but he's always busy. Just get
a quiet moment when he's not so busy.

488
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:38,079
Kelvin, go back to one on this,
we've got to work this out.

489
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,596
- Ivan, when you come...
- Igor.

490
00:25:39,683 --> 00:25:40,877
- What?
- Igor.

491
00:25:40,963 --> 00:25:43,603
Igor, okay, when you knock her down,
don't ask her to come down.

492
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:45,277
You smack her in the back of the head

493
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:47,755
and then you come here
and you jam it into her mouth.

494
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,280
You can't put your hand up, okay?

495
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:52,121
Boom, you jam her in the mouth,
break her jaw on the first one.

496
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,199
Second one nose, okay. Her jaw's broken,

497
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:56,484
she's swallowed her teeth,
blood's coming out, all right?

498
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:59,243
Then you smack her again across the side,
breaking the neck.

499
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,605
All right, can we do this again, please?

500
00:26:00,691 --> 00:26:02,887
- Go and get him now.
- Okay, I try.

501
00:26:03,932 --> 00:26:05,446
Ben.
- Yeah.

502
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:08,492
I need to swap the lines.

503
00:26:08,574 --> 00:26:10,691
What do you mean,
you need to swap the lines?

504
00:26:10,775 --> 00:26:12,528
For my friend. He wants to...

505
00:26:12,616 --> 00:26:14,766
Your friend? No, no, I gave your friend a line.

506
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:18,214
Yes, but I want him to have more.

507
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:20,449
You want him to have more?

508
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:23,259
- You want him to have more lines?
- Yes.

509
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,129
I don't understand, are you directing
the movie or am I directing the movie?

510
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:31,580
No, but this is my story.
My memories, my tribute to my dead wife.

511
00:26:34,104 --> 00:26:38,098
Would you stop going on
about your fucking dead wife?

512
00:26:45,268 --> 00:26:48,067
All right, let's do another rehearsal.
Right away, please.

513
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:49,424
Ben.

514
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,868
That was a wee bit much.

515
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,305
Ben?

516
00:26:54,392 --> 00:26:56,543
I'm sorry, what's your name?

517
00:26:57,353 --> 00:27:00,824
Oh, wait a minute, I remember.
I don't give a shit.

518
00:27:01,635 --> 00:27:03,432
- Get out of my face.
- All right.

519
00:27:03,515 --> 00:27:07,146
Don't have a go at her,
she was just worried about Goran.

520
00:27:07,997 --> 00:27:09,317
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

521
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:11,548
What's that? Who?

522
00:27:11,638 --> 00:27:13,914
- Nobody.
- That's right, nobody.

523
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,478
Yeah, and who am I?

524
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:20,875
It's either Starsky or Hutch,
I can never remember.

525
00:27:22,003 --> 00:27:25,280
- Was that supposed to be funny?
- You tell me, you were in it.

526
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:26,877
- Get off my set.
- Okay.

527
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:28,683
Get off my set.

528
00:27:29,806 --> 00:27:31,398
Hey, hey, question.

529
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:34,365
Do you know how much Meet the Fockers
made in its opening weekend?

530
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:36,882
- No.
- No, you don't, do you?

531
00:27:36,968 --> 00:27:38,960
What do you think?

532
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:40,961
- Don't know.
- Take a wild guess.

533
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,165
Twenty million?

534
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,723
Way off. Double it, add six.
46, three days. 70 million, five days.

535
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:49,122
500 million worldwide.

536
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,604
Number one movie in India right now.

537
00:27:51,694 --> 00:27:53,492
Well done. Bye, nerd.

538
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:55,528
- Oh, I'm a nerd?
- Yeah.

539
00:27:55,616 --> 00:27:56,890
I'm a nerd.

540
00:27:56,976 --> 00:28:00,687
I've kissed Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore.

541
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:03,167
I slapped Jennifer Aniston's butt.

542
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:05,170
- In films.
- It still counts.

543
00:28:12,702 --> 00:28:14,421
It still counts.

544
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:20,417
It still counts. I did it, I actually did it.
