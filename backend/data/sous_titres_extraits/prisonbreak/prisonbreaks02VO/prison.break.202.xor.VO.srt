00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,030
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,011
A very credible witness
has just come forward,

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,546
and he's willing to testify.

4
00:00:05,643 --> 00:00:08,301
He'll corroborate everything
you've said about this conspiracy.

5
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:09,553
Who?

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,360
How much do you know
about Sona, Mr. Kim?

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,141
Only what I've been given clearance on.

8
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:18,670
There's been a, uh,
change in strategy.

9
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,406
How much further would I have to go?

10
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:22,044
For this, you only have to go to Panama.

11
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:23,756
I didn't know you'd be here.

12
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,299
You e-mailed me. You said
T-Bag was here. It's on the Web site.

13
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:27,493
I didn't write anything.

14
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:29,339
This is looking more
and more like a setup.

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,041
He's got Maricruz
locked away somewhere.

16
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:33,313
You're gonna help him get the money
or she's dead.

17
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:35,100
Freeze, Bagwell!

18
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:40,660
Theodore Bagwell--he's the one you want
for that dead chick in there.

19
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,430
Sucre, you'd better pull it together.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,257
Go get the money, please.

21
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:50,631
Who are you fooling?

22
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:53,060
You ain't going to kill me,
Mr. Michelangelo.

23
00:00:53,562 --> 00:00:54,900
You ain't got it in you.

24
00:00:59,654 --> 00:01:00,662
Hello, Michael.

25
00:01:00,778 --> 00:01:01,860
<i>What do you want, Alex?</i>

26
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:04,157
Bring me the money, bring me the boat.

27
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:05,560
You are out of your mind.

28
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,119
We both have something
the other person needs.

29
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:09,728
<i>Your brother for your plan.</i>

30
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:11,760
Five minutes. That's all you have.

31
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:24,465
<i>I didn't kill that man.</i>

32
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:27,041
<i>I'm getting you out of here.</i>

33
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:28,972
<i>I've got three weeks.</i>

34
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:30,730
<i>Just have a little faith.</i>

35
00:01:33,224 --> 00:01:34,600
<i>I did everything I could.</i>

36
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,339
I know you did.

37
00:01:53,077 --> 00:01:54,156
<i>Chiclet?</i>

38
00:01:56,343 --> 00:01:58,423
Soda? Beer, my friend?

39
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,005
Spleef? Magic mushrooms?

40
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:04,969
Burst your brains,
split it wide open.

41
00:02:05,624 --> 00:02:07,030
I'm your man, man.

42
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:09,392
Magic Mystery Tour
right here in this box.

43
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:11,475
And if I don't got it,
I can get it.

44
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:14,971
Beat it.

45
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:21,906
<i>So you gonna do the right thing?</i>

46
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:25,284
Right for who, Alex?

47
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:27,163
<i>You lost, Michael.</i>

48
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,317
That's what you've done here.

49
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,114
And you're gonna lose a whole lot more,

50
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:33,580
unless you tell me right here
and right now

51
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,220
you're gonna bring me the money,

52
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:36,613
you're gonna bring me the boat.

53
00:02:36,987 --> 00:02:38,432
And you'll just let my brother go?

54
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:40,961
Yeah.

55
00:02:41,134 --> 00:02:42,675
<i>Just like you let Tweener go.</i>

56
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:44,830
And Abruzzi...

57
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,634
and Haywire.

58
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:48,300
Things are different now.

59
00:02:48,897 --> 00:02:49,899
Really?

60
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:51,826
<i>Yeah. The people
I was working for,</i>

61
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,146
they kind of...

62
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,465
sold me down the river.

63
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:58,271
Now I just want to go out to sea.

64
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,684
That's funny,
I'll have to remember that one.

65
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:02,730
I face more prison time than you.

66
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:05,517
I sort of jumped ahead of you

67
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,226
a few spots on the public enemy list.

68
00:03:07,894 --> 00:03:10,167
You're my way to freedom,
Michael, and I'm yours.

69
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:12,522
<i>We both know
what the other one's capable of.</i>

70
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:14,459
<i>So let's treat each other
with a little respect.</i>

71
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,528
<i>No games. No nothing.</i>

72
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:18,060
Just two guys doing each other a favor.

73
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:19,667
<i>What do you say?</i>

74
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,230
Where are you?

75
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,882
Mira Flores shipping docks,
just outside of Panama City.

76
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:30,160
It's a big warehouse
right on the water.

77
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:31,900
That's a long ways.

78
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:34,491
It'll take me at least 24 hours
to get there.

79
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:36,800
Well, then, I'd get moving.

80
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:42,500
How's it feel being on the run?

81
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,718
I'll survive.

82
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:46,492
Not if they catch you.

83
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:48,160
They'll send you to the chair.

84
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,530
You think that's ironic?

85
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:53,675
Think it'd be justice.

86
00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:55,638
Mr. Kim, Alex Mahone.

87
00:03:57,288 --> 00:03:58,290
Call me.

88
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:01,630
Justice will be served.

89
00:04:04,806 --> 00:04:06,279
What I'm about to divulge to you

90
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:08,215
will in all likelihood get me killed.

91
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:12,430
- Actually, I guarantee it.
- Then why are you doing it?

92
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:16,640
Because this was supposed
to be about country,

93
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:17,685
about loyalty,

94
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,230
about what's right, but it wasn't.

95
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,081
Because...

96
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:25,548
I wronged people
who should not have been wronged.

97
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:33,627
Those orders were given
by Caroline Reynolds,

98
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,730
who was Vice President at the time.

99
00:04:36,295 --> 00:04:39,204
Acting on those orders,
I planted evidence...

100
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,781
I procured a body,

101
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:43,745
I lured Lincoln Burrows

102
00:04:43,822 --> 00:04:45,719
into that parking garage that evening

103
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,730
under the auspices of a different hit.

104
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:53,800
From the ground up, we framed him.

105
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,567
Perfect.

106
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,510
So, Lincoln Burrows gets executed,

107
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:02,227
people forget about Terrence Steadman,

108
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:04,600
the controversy surrounded him
and the presidency.

109
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:06,554
And nobody ever knows about...

110
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:07,930
The Company.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,338
Ah, yes, which is a shadowy
cabal

112
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:13,553
of corporations
that pretty much influence

113
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,565
everything that happens
in this country.

114
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,053
But I fail to see
how any of this is relevant

115
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,038
to Sara Tancredi
and the fact that she aided and abetted,

116
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:22,283
that she jumped bail...

117
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:24,293
She did so
because she feared for her life,

118
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,660
which was appropriate,

119
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:27,800
'cause I had orders to kill her.

120
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:59,016
Are you still
in the magic business?

121
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,605
- What's your name?
- Chaco.

122
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:06,500
It's all here.

123
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,400
Everything Mr. Kellerman said
is corroborated in these documents.

124
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,115
In light of this evidence,

125
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:14,106
my question, I guess,
to you is whether

126
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:16,327
your time and resources are best spent

127
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:18,330
in pursuing charges
against Dr. Tancredi.

128
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:23,930
My office will drop all charges,
effective immediately.

129
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:26,852
But, Your Honor,

130
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,752
I would like to devote my time
and attention

131
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:32,090
in prosecuting this man, Mr. Kellerman.

132
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:34,025
Officer.

133
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:43,300
I literally don't even know
what to say to you.

134
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,264
It was good knowing you, Sara.

135
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:57,578
Where are we?

136
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:59,036
<i>I'm in Panama. Nice place.</i>

137
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,677
Good weather. Cool breeze.

138
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:03,850
Where are we with the brothers?

139
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:06,055
When you get them where they need to be,

140
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:08,062
I want to come there,
for visual confirmation.

141
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,548
<i>Then I suggest you get on a plane,</i>

142
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:10,899
because by the time you get here,

143
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,500
I will have Scofield and Burrows
where you want them.

144
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,951
And then this whole thing is over.

145
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,042
Sara, it's me.

146
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,835
It's a strange thing...

147
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:36,080
leaving a message for someone
you know is never gonna get it.

148
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:40,760
I can only assume the worst, so...

149
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,259
this will be the last message
I leave for you.

150
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:48,960
I just wanted you to know
that I made it.

151
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:53,660
But it's no good without you.

152
00:07:58,508 --> 00:07:59,960
Anyway, you remember when I...

153
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:02,286
Remember when I told you about those...

154
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:06,160
50-cent beers in Baja at happy hour?

155
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,160
They're even cheaper down here.

156
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:12,314
If by some miracle, you do get this...

157
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,230
I need you to listen close.

158
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,357
I suggest we get you out of here.

159
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:25,992
It's going to be a media circus outside.
It'll only get bigger.

160
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,092
Let's go.

161
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,711
Sure.

162
00:08:30,212 --> 00:08:32,807
<i>Larger, unexpected fireworks

163
00:08:32,897 --> 00:08:35,418
<i>of Dr. Sara Tancredi in Chicago today.</i>

164
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:37,360
<i>New testimony has implicated</i>

165
00:08:37,398 --> 00:08:40,200
<i>that former President Reynolds
was complicit</i>

166
00:08:40,257 --> 00:08:41,442
<i>in the falsification of...</i>

167
00:08:41,517 --> 00:08:43,616
<i>of her brother Terrence Steadmand's
death.</i>

<i>The fallout from all this</i>

169
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,060
purported killer, Lincoln Burrows

170
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,159
who has led the country
on a nationwide manhunt

171
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,397
will be exonerated of all charges

172
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:54,891
effective immediately.

173
00:08:56,622 --> 00:08:58,730
Oh, my God, Bruce,
Lincoln's a free man.

00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:36,360
Michael left me a message.

176
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,500
Okay... my God.

177
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:42,783
He doesn't know.
He's still planning on running.

178
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:48,133
Come on, Michael, come on, come on.

179
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:51,794
Let me do the introduction.

180
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:54,098
All right, but I'll do the talking.

181
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:02,540
Okay, I got to go to him.

182
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,099
What that, about 3,000 miles, Sara?

183
00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:06,134
It is. So we're gonna have
to swing by my hotel

184
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:08,060
then you're gonna have
to get me to the airport,

185
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:10,210
because he gotta know
he doesn't have to run anymore.

186
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:11,992
What he's doing now
is gonna get him killed.

187
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:18,524
The stars are finally aligning, sir.

188
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:22,063
Mahone's got Burrows.
Scofield's on his way.

189
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:25,619
I will make it happen.

190
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:27,286
I'm going down there myself.

191
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:35,502
I... assume we both know
which one that is.

192
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:41,818
I will call you

193
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,292
when I get down there.

194
00:10:58,081 --> 00:10:59,203
I just...

195
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:01,531
I want you to listen really close, okay?

196
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:03,248
<i>Alex, Alex, slow down.</i>

197
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:04,538
Okay, okay.

198
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:06,644
We talked about getting back together,

199
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:07,833
about giving it another shot.

200
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:10,474
Yes, and I said that maybe we could.

201
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:15,976
What about Colombia?

202
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:17,506
Cartegena?

203
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:21,184
- Go there?
- <i>You got summer break coming up,
no?</i>

204
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,001
- <i>Same with Cam.</i>
- Yeah...

205
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,693
- <i>but...</i>
- I'm not far from there right now,

206
00:11:25,924 --> 00:11:28,076
and I was thinking
that why not just stick around

207
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:29,314
and have you guys come down?

208
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:31,426
You always wanted to go, didn't you?

209
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:33,126
Visit the homeland?

210
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes, but you didn't.

211
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,944
Yeah, but I do now.

212
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,557
Yeah!

213
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,527
I mean, I suppose
we can maybe do two weeks

214
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:47,572
<i>- at the end of the summer...</i>
- Is that a yes? That's a yes, right?

215
00:11:48,171 --> 00:11:51,500
Come on, great coffee, great beaches,
wildlife parks for Cam.

216
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,183
Look,

217
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:57,202
it might not work out. You've got
to be prepared for that, okay?

218
00:11:57,862 --> 00:11:59,793
It can't be like it was before.

219
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:03,836
It will never be like before.

220
00:12:04,546 --> 00:12:06,626
I know what's important now.
I know what matters.

221
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:10,414
<i>Well, I guess I could...
I could look online.</i>

222
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:12,401
<i>I don't know, I should go.</i>

223
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:13,905
Just come be with me, Pam.

224
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:16,075
<i>Be with me.</i>

225
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:35,861
You've got nothing to worry about, okay?

226
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:37,973
It's you I'm marrying.

227
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:42,305
Senor Gonzalez...

228
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:17,958
<i>U.S. Embassy operator.</i>

229
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:19,956
I'm looking for a friend.

230
00:13:20,286 --> 00:13:21,804
A missing American friend.

231
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:23,905
He could be in the hospital.

232
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:25,563
Could be in jail.

233
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:27,214
<i>What's the name?</i>

234
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:29,775
Bellick...

235
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,947
Brad Bellick.

236
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,879
Hey, do I get to call my lawyer or what?

237
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:39,968
What are you savages down here?

238
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:42,727
I get to call my lawyer or something.

239
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:45,461
Freakin' banana benders.

240
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:58,136
Finally. That's him!

241
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,959
That's the guy!
He's the one who killed that girl.

242
00:14:00,992 --> 00:14:02,312
Good job, damn it!

243
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:08,375
Aren't you going to release me now?

244
00:14:15,264 --> 00:14:16,267
You're busted.

245
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:17,303
Am I?

246
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:21,231
Where's the money?

247
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:23,142
Pretty boy's got it.

248
00:14:23,273 --> 00:14:25,263
He's out there with a royal flush

249
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,653
and you're in here
with a busted straight.

250
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:29,090
Hardly seems right, does it?

251
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:30,953
Your hand don't look much better.

252
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,606
Maybe I got an ace up my sleeve.

253
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:35,173
You know something I don't?

254
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:39,716
You should rest your leg, boss.

255
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:10,106
I was told we could make a deal.

256
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:12,760
You're a long way from home, boy.

257
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,263
Ain't no deal for you here.

258
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:16,506
You haven't heard what I have to offer.

259
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,121
Guy looking like you do...

260
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:23,427
coming here...

261
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:26,234
the only think you're offering
is jail time.

262
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,603
I'm not a cop.

263
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,318
Check online.

264
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:42,674
Type in "Michael Scofield."

265
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:44,804
That means nothing to me.

266
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:46,626
Could mean 100 grand.

267
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:01,647
This takes longer than 30 seconds,
you're in the canal.

268
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:04,178
Bait...

269
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,376
for the catfish.

270
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:20,265
You just gave me a 100,000 reasons

271
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:22,706
- to turn you in.
- That's true.

272
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:26,335
I guess I'll just have
to give you a few more not to.

273
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:35,273
You know I'm innocent.

274
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:38,020
- Yeah, probably.
- And yet you don't care.

275
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:41,080
I don't care about anything other
than getting my life back, no.

276
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:43,033
Your wife know who you really are?

277
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:45,112
Yeah, you know how it is.

278
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:47,903
Good men doing bad things
because of circumstance.

279
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:50,736
I'd call her back if I were you.

280
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:52,802
Tell her to forget you were ever born.

281
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,824
You would, would you?

282
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:57,589
Stop the cancer from your life
spreading to theirs.

283
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,815
Cancer of my life...

284
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,359
I wouldn't be begging her to meet me

285
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:06,854
in this third world dump
if it weren't for you and your life.

286
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:08,559
There's no way out of this.

287
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,112
For you...

288
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:11,725
or for any of us.

289
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,035
For me there is.

290
00:17:18,534 --> 00:17:19,754
For me there is.

291
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:27,684
How much of it have you spent?

292
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,250
100,000...

293
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:33,554
200,000. Of course, here,
it'd be more like a million.

294
00:17:33,644 --> 00:17:36,341
Be Louis XIV on a sum like that.

295
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:38,279
The Sun King of Panama.

296
00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:40,825
You ain't gonna be seeing much sun now.

297
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,237
I don't know.

298
00:17:45,953 --> 00:17:47,685
You know, Bagwell,

299
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:49,879
out of all the guys,

300
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:53,655
all eight of 'em, you were the guy
I was hoping would go down

301
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,510
in a blaze of gunfire.

302
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:58,097
Why don't you give me your best shot.
Finish the job.

303
00:17:58,471 --> 00:17:59,774
Maybe I will.

304
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:06,285
That Siamese cat smile
just makes me want

305
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,856
to open you up that much more.

306
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,745
It's Cheshire.

307
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:11,634
Cheshire cat smile.

308
00:18:12,904 --> 00:18:13,907
<i>Señor</i> Bellick?

309
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:16,875
I'm free?

310
00:18:25,077 --> 00:18:26,827
What the hell's this?

311
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,446
Hey, wait... wait a minute!

312
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,725
What about him?

313
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,535
He's the one that did it!

314
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:35,939
<i>"Buena suerte,"</i> what's that mean?

315
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:40,922
- <i>Buena suerte?</i>- Good luck.

316
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:13,101
Where is she, Bellick?

317
00:19:14,357 --> 00:19:15,560
Where is she?

318
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:23,431
Where's Maricruz?

319
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:26,834
You wanna know where she is?
Find a way to get me out of this!

320
00:19:27,347 --> 00:19:28,874
Get me out of here!

321
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:31,590
Sucre, get me out of this !
Get me out!

322
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,488
Michael, that's a beautiful boat.

323
00:21:00,515 --> 00:21:03,148
Just promise me you'll change
the name when you take it.

324
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:05,396
I don't think my mother
would have approved of you.

325
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,578
Consider it done.

326
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:07,832
Come on.

327
00:21:08,182 --> 00:21:09,185
Uncuff me.

328
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:10,365
No, not yet.

329
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,716
So is this the part
where you go back on your word?

330
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:14,438
Hands up. Hands up.

331
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,388
And as of now,

332
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,729
they want you alive.

333
00:21:24,312 --> 00:21:25,315
Why?

334
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,715
That's a good question.

335
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:31,690
Figure it out someday on your own time.
Where's the money?

336
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,216
Cut him loose.

337
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,659
Come on, Alex, you already got the boat.

338
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:37,758
Show a little good faith.

339
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:38,786
The money.

340
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:40,582
I want...

341
00:21:43,707 --> 00:21:45,472
-  Yeah.
- <i>I'm here. Where are you?</i>

342
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,731
I'm inside the warehouse.

343
00:21:49,354 --> 00:21:50,360
I'll be right there.

344
00:21:57,162 --> 00:21:58,165
Here we go.

345
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:02,644
Hello. <i>Hola.</i>

346
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,006
- You speak English?
- <i>Yes, sir. Can I help you?</i>

347
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:08,410
Yes, yes. Mira Flores Docks.

348
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,709
<i>Is everything alright?</i>
- Yes.

349
00:22:09,826 --> 00:22:10,845
There's been a murder.

350
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:11,879
<i>Are you in distress?</i>

351
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,402
A well-dressed Asian man's
just been shot by two Americans.

352
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:16,623
- <i>We'll send a car right away, sir.</i>
- Yes, come.

353
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,616
So you kill him and frame us.

354
00:22:23,746 --> 00:22:24,749
Why?

355
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:27,761
So everyone

356
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,483
will leave me

357
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:30,981
alone!

358
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:33,106
'Cause that's all I want.

359
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:35,317
That... and the money.

360
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:37,213
It's not gonna happen, Alex.

361
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,389
- Let him go.
- Give me the money.

362
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:41,115
- Let him go.
- Give me the money!

363
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,676
I am dumbfounded.

364
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,217
Don't be shy.

365
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,920
They're all yours.

366
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:11,500
You said you'd have them
right where we wanted them.

367
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:13,169
This isn't right where we want them.

368
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:15,152
Well...

369
00:23:15,587 --> 00:23:17,241
That's your job now.

370
00:23:19,168 --> 00:23:20,773
This is as far as I go.

371
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:23,903
Or is it something else?

372
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:26,688
Another reason we're all here.

373
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:28,376
Like that.

374
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:32,164
- Like a double-cross.
- Yeah.

375
00:23:32,165 --> 00:23:34,017
Just like that. Say good-bye.

376
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:38,207
Like minds think alike!

377
00:23:38,892 --> 00:23:40,079
Hey, Alex!

378
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:08,728
Once seated, your four-piece
will be mounted to the floor mount.

379
00:25:08,943 --> 00:25:10,932
During transport,
do not speak to either I...

380
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:12,135
I know the drill.

381
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:17,251
Get in.

382
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:42,684
So, what do we got, another 30 minutes?

383
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:44,595
Yeah, something like that.

384
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:46,199
Why didn't you take the freeway?

385
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:47,453
Rush hour.

386
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:51,815
- Hell.
- What?

387
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:53,833
The engine light just came on.

388
00:25:54,034 --> 00:25:56,090
It just got serviced at motor pool.

389
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,369
We'd better pull over just to make sure.

390
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:16,253
All right, I'll check it out.

391
00:26:24,714 --> 00:26:27,037
In the French Resistance,
it was considered a high honor

392
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,485
to face a Nazi firing squad.

393
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:31,229
- I thought I told you to be quiet.
- Meant, you did your job.

394
00:26:32,548 --> 00:26:35,180
The highest honor was to smile
when they shot you.

395
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:39,518
Took you long enough.

396
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:54,537
Lake Gatun, Eastern Canal,

397
00:26:54,637 --> 00:26:56,074
approaches to Cartagena.

398
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:57,394
$27.50

399
00:26:57,762 --> 00:26:59,318
What's that crossing take?

400
00:26:59,537 --> 00:27:02,478
Two days if you're under
full sail all the time.

401
00:27:02,645 --> 00:27:05,092
Good time of you to be down here.
No storms, nothing.

402
00:27:05,245 --> 00:27:06,615
Had enough storms recently.

403
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,991
Enjoy it. It's a beautiful crossing.

404
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:11,245
I plan to.

405
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:12,314
This boat here,

406
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:13,517
who's it belong to?

407
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:15,298
<i>Señor?</i>

408
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:18,034
We got a call that this boat
was used in some illegal trafficking.

409
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:21,534
It's the wrong boat, pal.
You can check it if you want to, but...

410
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:24,736
- Hey, you can't just...
- This is Panama, friend.

411
00:27:25,431 --> 00:27:26,985
Get acquainted with the law, huh?

412
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:31,869
I...

413
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,067
Yes, I definitely think
you need to get acquainted.

414
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:39,268
Chico!

415
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,767
You think they got him?

416
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:54,967
It's a pretty singular boat.

417
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:57,267
That's a lot of coke
to be carrying around.

418
00:27:57,334 --> 00:27:58,480
If you're at the helm, man...

419
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:00,798
You'll doing some serious time.
Ten years minimum.

420
00:28:00,898 --> 00:28:01,901
Yeah, you would.

421
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:03,335
We lost the boat.

422
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:06,036
At least we got the dead man's money.

423
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,813
It's our ticket
to the rest of our lives,

424
00:28:07,863 --> 00:28:10,067
minus what I'm sending
Westmoreland's daughter.

425
00:28:10,748 --> 00:28:11,751
Hey.

426
00:28:13,466 --> 00:28:14,536
You showed up.

427
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:15,785
We had a deal.

428
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,373
This is my brother.

429
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:19,267
- Hey.
- This way.

430
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:22,933
So we get out of here,

431
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:24,304
and we never look back.

432
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:26,234
We never look back.

433
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,318
I want to thank you, Michael,
for everything.

434
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:38,467
You're welcome.

435
00:28:41,024 --> 00:28:43,467
It's the best I could do
with the money you gave me.

436
00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:45,670
That'll work.

437
00:28:52,592 --> 00:28:53,611
She's very pretty.

438
00:28:53,845 --> 00:28:55,552
She'll get us where we need to go,
right?

439
00:28:56,165 --> 00:28:57,317
Not the boat, señor.

440
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:24,252
So, I got your message.

441
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:27,985
Thank God, I found you guys.

442
00:29:31,513 --> 00:29:33,001
"Thank God" is right.

443
00:29:33,247 --> 00:29:34,902
Michael, Lincoln's free.

444
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:36,893
What?

445
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,663
It's all over the news.

446
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,626
Paul Kellerman came forward.

447
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:46,067
And he had... everything documented
and he made a full confession.

448
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:47,902
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

449
00:29:49,556 --> 00:29:51,813
- Everything?
- Everything, all charges.

450
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:04,567
What...

451
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,188
- No more...
- You don't have to run anymore.

452
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:13,100
What about Michael?

453
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:17,723
A friend of my father's
getting into it, but...

454
00:30:18,676 --> 00:30:20,857
he's pretty confident
that under the circumstances,

455
00:30:20,858 --> 00:30:22,564
nobody's going to pursue you on this.

456
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,371
I need a drink.

457
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:32,853
I'll go see what I can find.

458
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,349
Here.

459
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:55,419
Help me out of this.

460
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:03,037
We did it, Linc.

461
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:07,897
- We did it.
- Yeah.

462
00:31:11,268 --> 00:31:12,405
You almost did it.

463
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:20,899
You want the money?

464
00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:24,446
Take the money.

465
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,533
Take it.

466
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:28,186
You think this is about the money?

467
00:31:31,161 --> 00:31:33,072
Pocket change like five million?

468
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,417
Then what is it about?

469
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:36,250
My brother's been exonerated.

470
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:37,813
The President stepped down.

471
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,919
We're not a threat anymore. It's over.

472
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,501
You may be done with us,

473
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:44,790
but that doesn't mean
we're done with you.

474
00:31:44,841 --> 00:31:46,261
The police are on their way.

475
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:47,911
It started with me.

476
00:31:48,964 --> 00:31:50,134
Let my brother go.

477
00:31:50,318 --> 00:31:51,555
That's sweet.

478
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,463
That's sweet.
You don't hear that much anymore,

479
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,502
that sort of fidelity in families.

480
00:31:57,008 --> 00:31:59,636
Two brothers that'll go
to the ends of the earth for each other.

481
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,230
Too bad only one of you survive.

482
00:32:03,815 --> 00:32:04,818
Don't!

483
00:32:17,063 --> 00:32:18,116
We got to go.

484
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:37,459
My men are ordered to fire

485
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:39,768
if you don't come out of there
with your hands first.

486
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:41,556
Come on, come on.

487
00:33:45,718 --> 00:33:49,432
Murder is not something that we take
lightly here on Panamanian soil.

488
00:33:50,402 --> 00:33:53,457
So come on out of there,
and there will be no more death.

489
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:54,944
Michael, I took a man's life.

490
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:57,985
Don't think about that now.

491
00:33:58,729 --> 00:34:00,617
You and I have got a date, remember?

492
00:34:01,185 --> 00:34:03,825
Two limes and a couple of beers,
don't forget that.

493
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,480
This is your last warning!

494
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:07,499
Give me the gun.

495
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:12,279
I took a man's life.

496
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:16,023
We're going to walk out of here
together,

497
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:18,953
and we'll tell them
exactly what happened.

498
00:34:21,151 --> 00:34:23,447
Look at me, look at me.

499
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,578
Then we're going to tell them
what happened.

500
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,728
- Okay.
- We'll explain everything.

501
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:32,525
And I'm going to do whatever I can
to help you.

502
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:34,982
Okay?

503
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:36,735
Yeah.

504
00:34:40,063 --> 00:34:41,367
Now give me the gun.

505
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:44,024
Here.

506
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,432
I love you.

507
00:35:02,445 --> 00:35:03,916
I love you, too, Sarah.

508
00:35:19,997 --> 00:35:21,333
- Okay.
- You all right?

509
00:35:21,383 --> 00:35:23,534
- All right.
- Yeah.

510
00:35:23,594 --> 00:35:24,597
Come on.

511
00:35:30,415 --> 00:35:31,418
Don't move!

512
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:33,501
I'll shoot!

513
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:36,004
- Michael, what are you doing?
- Nobody moves!

514
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:37,074
Nobody!

515
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:41,134
You sacrificed everything for me once...

516
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:43,400
No! Don't move!

517
00:35:43,451 --> 00:35:45,089
No, I can't let you do this.

518
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,167
Now it's time to say thank you.

519
00:35:49,492 --> 00:35:51,418
It was me! It was me!

520
00:35:51,753 --> 00:35:52,755
I did it!

521
00:35:52,756 --> 00:35:54,967
He's done nothing wrong! He's innocent !

522
00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:57,244
- It was me!
- He's done nothing!

523
00:35:57,261 --> 00:35:58,613
- Please!
- I did it!

524
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,907
It was me.

525
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,614
He hasn't shot anybody,
he hasn't hurt anybody, please! Michael!

526
00:36:03,266 --> 00:36:04,634
Michael, tell them the truth!

527
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,719
He's done nothing wrong!

528
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:36,819
Hey, it's me.

529
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:39,017
Getting impatient.

530
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,621
Reminds me of when we were in college.

531
00:36:43,465 --> 00:36:44,800
Did you buy the tickets yet?

532
00:36:45,531 --> 00:36:47,152
<i>No, I'm still looking.</i>

533
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:49,301
Don't.

534
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:51,604
What?

535
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:53,595
Forget about them.

536
00:36:56,888 --> 00:36:58,308
Forget I ever existed.

537
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:24,002
Excuse me.

538
00:37:24,218 --> 00:37:25,170
Do you speak English?

539
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:26,466
- Yes, can I help you?
- Yeah.

540
00:37:26,483 --> 00:37:27,870
I'm looking for a woman, Sarah Tancredi.

541
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:31,607
She was brought in to give her statement
and then released. You just missed her.

542
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,094
I thought you'd never show up.

543
00:38:26,051 --> 00:38:27,634
When am I getting out of here?

544
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,419
That's the thing.

545
00:38:29,897 --> 00:38:31,385
There's been a hiccup.

546
00:38:32,698 --> 00:38:34,153
A hiccup...

547
00:38:34,988 --> 00:38:36,275
Look, you got me...

548
00:38:36,743 --> 00:38:39,033
You got me fair and square
in Mexico, alright.

549
00:38:39,676 --> 00:38:41,334
I did what you wanted me to do.

550
00:38:41,398 --> 00:38:43,487
Now it's time to cut me loose
just like we agreed.

551
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,393
Getting caught wasn't part
of the agreement.

552
00:38:45,394 --> 00:38:47,665
I got caught running your setup,

553
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,604
being your bait.

554
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:53,036
Now I got you Scofield down here.
I got you what you wanted!

555
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,620
You got caught, Bagwell.

556
00:38:59,793 --> 00:39:00,879
Where you going?

557
00:39:03,787 --> 00:39:07,867
I got you what you want!
I got them boys down here!

558
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:10,085
I did what you told me to do!

559
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:12,536
Do you hear me?

560
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:14,625
I did what you told me to do!

561
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:17,085
I did what you told me!

562
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:29,666
This is as far as I go.

563
00:40:55,564 --> 00:40:56,566
General...

564
00:41:00,046 --> 00:41:02,118
I trust this is a safe place to speak.

565
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:04,634
It's Scofield.

566
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:06,849
They got him.

567
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,478
Scofield back in the penn.

568
00:41:48,648 --> 00:41:51,768
Got to be honest, we didn't think
we'd see it happen.

569
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,768
You know he's gonna break out.

570
00:41:56,353 --> 00:41:57,707
It's in his blood.

571
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:01,568
That's exactly what we want him to do.
