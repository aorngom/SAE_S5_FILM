00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:01,800
Previously on <i>Prison Break...</i>

2
00:00:01,915 --> 00:00:02,967
So where to, man.

3
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:04,526
Anywhere we want.

4
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:08,838
I'm not the brother you remember.

5
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:12,092
I've changed.
And I am gonna do something

6
00:00:12,337 --> 00:00:15,013
that a lot of people
are gonna think is horrible.

7
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:18,583
And you just remember
the brother you grew up with.

8
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:21,141
She's not here.

9
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:25,176
- Yeah?
- Sara, the ship is leaving.

10
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:27,346
I'm already on board.

11
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,083
<i>Love you.</i>

12
00:00:31,977 --> 00:00:33,800
Why are you telling me this now ?

13
00:00:33,977 --> 00:00:35,855
If I had to it all over again,

14
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:38,723
I'd do it different, you know ?

15
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:42,451
Collar bone and rotator cuff.

16
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,323
Six inches to the right, you're dead.

17
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:46,200
You've come so far.

18
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:48,556
- How much further would I've to go?
- Well you're lucky.

19
00:00:48,557 --> 00:00:50,166
For this you only have to go to Panama.

20
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,200
- He found him.
- Where ?

21
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:55,200
He just boarded a plane to Panama City.

22
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:56,782
What the hell's he doing in Panama ?

23
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:57,994
You like wigs ?

24
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:02,400
For the right money, I like anything.

25
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,310
What about the goldfinch thing ?

26
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:10,832
There is a message from Sucre.

27
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:12,700
Still running, huh ?

28
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:14,300
Says the Bag still has the bag.

29
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:16,700
"He's in Panama City
at the Fin Del Camino Hotel.

30
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,329
"If you're there and want to help
put that bird back in the cage,

31
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,000
"let me know. Sucre."

32
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:22,229
See you soon.

33
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:11,290
One thing's for sure, you're just
as pretty as advertised. Prettier, even.

34
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:13,535
You got to help me, please.

35
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,864
You say a word,
I'm gonna cut your throat out !

36
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,320
- Pam, it's me.
<i>- Cam's napping.</i>

37
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:56,400
Yeah ? How's he doing ?

38
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:59,116
<i>Good, it was his first day
back at school.</i>

39
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:01,585
- That's great.
- Where are you ?

40
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:04,993
I'm, out of the country.

41
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:06,800
<i>Is everything all right ?</i>

42
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:10,000
Remember how I always said
that the day would come...

43
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:12,037
... and I'd be done ?

44
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,956
Leave the Bureau and...
never look back?

45
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:17,335
<i>Yes.</i>

46
00:05:17,804 --> 00:05:18,818
<i>Today's that day.</i>

47
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:21,700
I have one more thing to do,

48
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:22,961
and once I do it,

49
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,438
everything is going to fall into place.

50
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:28,094
And I, I'll be done.

51
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:30,300
<i>I hope you mean it.</i>

52
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:34,700
If I didn't have this job
hanging over me anymore,

53
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:37,466
if I were free...

54
00:05:39,385 --> 00:05:41,010
I need to know.

55
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:44,472
<i>I'm not saying no.</i>

56
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:50,985
I will make this right, I swear to God.

57
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,023
And you and me and Cam...

58
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:56,603
<i>I have to go.</i>

59
00:05:57,901 --> 00:05:59,702
I never stopped loving you, Pam...

60
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,571
- ever.
- <i>Just be safe, Alex.</i>

61
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:12,719
You're in position ?

62
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,758
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- I'll be there in ten minutes.

63
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:16,057
Got it.

64
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:20,360
Anyway...

65
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:55,413
What's wrong ?

66
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:02,553
Come on. Move in.

67
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:09,794
I love it.

68
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:13,282
Mr. Above It All
down here trying to sniff out

69
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:15,714
that $5 million just like
the rest of us riff-raff.

70
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,410
See ? You ain't no better
than me.

71
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,426
I want T-Bag locked up.
It's the only reason I'm here.

72
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:23,211
Dudley Freakin' Do-Right ?

73
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,753
- I didn't know you were gonna be here.
- What are you talking about ?

74
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:29,335
You e-mailed me. You said
T-Bag was here. It's on the Web site.

75
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:32,631
What ? No. I didn't write anything
on the Web site...

76
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:34,183
to you or anybody else.

77
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:35,496
Is T-Bag in that hotel ?

78
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,774
Yeah, a couple feds staking it
out across the street.

79
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:43,091
Well, you're gonna help us get it then.

80
00:07:43,092 --> 00:07:44,800
Maybe you missed the part
about the feds.

81
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:48,300
I don't care. I didn't travel
2,000 miles down the diarrhea trail

82
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:51,200
to get to this backward-ass country
to not get my $5 million !

83
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:52,301
Well, that's too bad

84
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:54,906
'cause this is looking more and more
like a setup.

85
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:58,221
Well, then get that little college boy
brain of yours to work then.

86
00:07:58,315 --> 00:07:59,700
And if you don't think I'm serious,

87
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:03,046
just ask your old cellie here
what length I'll go to.

88
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:06,104
He's got Maricruz locked away somewhere.

89
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:10,017
You're gonna help him get the money
or she's dead.

90
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:14,311
Yeah, I'm a big jerk, Scofield.
Shame on me.

91
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:19,177
I'm in no position
to ask you for anything.

92
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,663
I need your help, <i>papi,</i>

93
00:08:25,301 --> 00:08:26,332
I do.

94
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:30,817
Are you in

95
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:32,498
or what ?

96
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,613
Subtitles : www.swsub.com

97
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:07,213
Get the gun off me.

98
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:11,700
- I asked you a question.
- I said get the gun off me or I walk.

99
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:19,545
All right, you'll get your $5 million.

100
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,169
You get Maricruz,

101
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:23,216
and I get T-Bag.

102
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:24,546
Win, win, win.

103
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:26,475
But you got to do exactly what I say.

104
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:30,987
Thank you, bro.

105
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:37,601
All right, Einstein, what you thinking ?

106
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:44,600
<i>And it's the third day of testimony
in the trial of Dr. Sara Tancredi,</i>

107
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:46,891
<i>daughter of the late governor
Frank Tancredi.</i>

108
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:50,179
<i>So far, pundits feel the prosecution
is well on its way</i>

109
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:53,900
to meeting its burden of proof
and getting a conviction on all counts.

110
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:56,000
Defense counsel, you may proceed.

111
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:59,500
Your Honor,
at this time I ask this tape be marked

112
00:09:59,593 --> 00:10:00,700
"Defense Exhibit'D.'"

113
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:04,237
Objection. Your Honor,
this tape is the very propaganda

114
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:07,700
that M. Scofield and L. Burrows
released to the media

115
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:09,495
that was summarily debunked.

116
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:12,529
- The jury still has a right to hear it.
- The tape is hearsay.

117
00:10:12,576 --> 00:10:15,811
- Unavailable witness exception.
- The witness is only unavailable

118
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:17,500
because he's a fugitive on the run.

119
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:19,100
Be that as it may,

120
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:22,099
his statement on this tape exonerates
Dr. Tancredi.

121
00:10:22,465 --> 00:10:23,487
Your Honor...

122
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,809
The tape is allowed.

123
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,500
The State's objection
will be noted in the record.

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,500
<i>Much blame has been placed
on another innocent person</i>

125
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,256
<i>Dr. Sara Tancredi.</i>

126
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,100
<i>She had nothing to do with our escape.</i>

127
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,631
<i>Sara, if you're listening,</i>

128
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:43,700
<i>I know I can't ask you
for another chance,</i>

129
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,300
<i>I only hope by now you've found
your safe haven.</i>

130
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,196
<i>The trial of the late
Governor Tancredi's daughter,</i>

131
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,315
<i>Dr. Sara Tancredi continues</i>

132
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:53,737
<i>today in Cook County.</i>

133
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,100
<i>Dr. Tancredi, whose medical license
has been suspended</i>

134
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:58,500
<i>pending the outcome of the trial,</i>

135
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
<i>is facing multiple counts
ranging from aiding...</i>

136
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,365
I'm gonna kill him.

137
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,765
And go right back to prison.

138
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,565
I don't care.
Once we get the money

139
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,864
and he tells me where Maricruz is,
I'm gonna kill him.

140
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,800
If you find Maricruz
you're going to marry Maricruz

141
00:12:19,835 --> 00:12:21,365
and live happily ever after.

142
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,900
Yeah, after I sink a knife
in Bellick's chest.

143
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,700
Bellick and T-Bag will get theirs,
trust me.

144
00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:29,029
Didn't Fox River teach you anything,
man?

145
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:31,100
'Cause the same rules apply out here.

146
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,300
It doesn't make a difference
if you're guilty or innocent.

147
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,400
It's who survives.

148
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,689
You're not that guy.

149
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:40,190
That son of a bitch took my girl,
locked her up somewhere.

150
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,600
I am that guy now, Michael.

151
00:12:42,246 --> 00:12:43,249
Look at me.

152
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,000
The only reason I'm not five miles away
from here right now

153
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:48,620
is because I want to help you
find Maricruz, not kill Bellick.

154
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:51,600
And if that's your game, I'm gone.

155
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,100
Believe me, I understand
the impulse to pull the trigger.

156
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,100
But if we lose ourselves,
we lose everything.

157
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:11,600
It's been a week.

158
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:13,700
I don't know where she is.

159
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,000
- I'm scared.
- We'll find her.

160
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
We'll find her.

161
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,710
What the hell's this?

162
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,165
Now, if you start acting like a cowboy

163
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,600
this whole thing's going south
real fast, remember that.

164
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Here we go.

165
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,025
You're not going to like
how this ends, Lincoln.

166
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,900
I'm giving you a chance.

167
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:17,952
Right now.

168
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,800
Just... back away,
all right?

169
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,801
Just back away.

170
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,900
The son of a bitch, you killed my dad?

171
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,901
You're done.

172
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:57,949
Those bullet holes don't heal too good,
do they, Mahone?

173
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,100
Toss me the handcuffs.

174
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,700
Hand them over or I swear to God

175
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:06,200
I'll blow your head clean off.

176
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,807
Americans?

177
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:36,065
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank, God.

178
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,500
Do you know
where the Cathedral Guadalupe is?

179
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,817
Never heard of it.

180
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:42,529
I was supposed to meet my old lady
half an hour ago.

181
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,987
- That's great.
- You can't miss it,

182
00:17:43,988 --> 00:17:44,999
but I missed it.

183
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,065
I was wondering you had

184
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,815
maybe a travel guide
or something on you?

185
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,692
Why don't you just keep on walking, pal?

186
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,000
Well, excuse me for thinking
I could ask for a little help

187
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:54,200
from some fellow Americans.

188
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:55,254
Listen, beat it.

189
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,524
So how we doing gentlemen?

190
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,101
Sucre, the gun.

191
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,210
Come on.

192
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Get in the alley.

193
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,200
It is a global problem.

194
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,400
48% of North American lakes
are eutrophic.

195
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:55,900
It's 53% in Europe...

196
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:57,100
- Kristine.
- Yeah?

197
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
It's your brother, Paul.

198
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
What, what's going on?

199
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,301
Hello.

200
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:09,273
He's in this building right here.
We got to move.

201
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,814
Let's see your I.D.

202
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,410
Feds?

203
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,300
No, if these guys were,
they'd be after T-Bag.

204
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:22,434
You guys Company?

205
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,800
Come on, Sucre,
let's wrap these numb nuts up.

206
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,222
What are you guys doing here?
What do you want?

207
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,500
I don't like this. Something's up.

208
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,800
Come on, Sucre, let's move it.

209
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
Now, let's go, come on.

210
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,700
Let's go, Michael.

211
00:21:19,132 --> 00:21:21,000
We know you're in here, Bagwell!

212
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Three to one...

213
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,700
do the math.

214
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,200
Okay, okay,

215
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,809
I don't want any trouble.

216
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:56,470
Slide the gun over.

217
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,039
We can work something out, boys.

218
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,543
Slide the gun over.

219
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:17,280
Where's the money?

220
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,615
Who called the cops?

221
00:22:26,808 --> 00:22:28,199
You got three seconds, hillbilly.

222
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:29,287
One...

223
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:30,290
In there!

224
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,510
Get it.

225
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,300
<i>You</i> want it, <i>you</i> get it.

226
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,700
We don't have time for this, Bellick.

227
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,800
Nothing stupid now.

228
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,900
You're not playing a game.

229
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,100
Open it.

230
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,500
Sucre, move your ass!

231
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,600
Freeze, Bagwell!

232
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Get the money!

233
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,500
You want the girl, get the money!

234
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,409
Don't.

235
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
Don't.

236
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,700
We can work something out.

237
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Move.

238
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,634
Sucre, come on.

239
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,910
Theodore Bagwell, he's the one you want
for that dead chick in there.

240
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,800
Anybody speak English?

241
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
I didn't do it!

242
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,300
I swear to God I didn't do it!

243
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,800
No, please, please!

244
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,609
We can do a little divvying right here,
then we'll go

245
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,000
- our separate ways.
- Sucre, I want you to get us a car.

246
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,100
What's going on? What's the plan?

247
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,500
I said, get us a car.

248
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,700
Looks like you've made
some friends lately.

249
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,100
I don't follow.

250
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
That little set-up back there,

251
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,100
just a little out of your league.

252
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,100
Looked almost professional.

253
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,400
Let's say that's the case.

254
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,500
What's it worth to you to find out?

255
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,600
Because I <i>am</i>

256
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,400
in possession of some information

257
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,800
that you might need, pretty.

258
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,300
Okay. Tell me what you know.

259
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,300
Maybe I'll let you walk...

260
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,700
without the money.

261
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,900
Yeah?

262
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,300
Yeah.

263
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,261
You're gonna let me
traipse on out of here?

264
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,600
Depends on the information.

265
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,600
Who's pulling your strings?

266
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,900
You know, I got a hunch you're speaking
with a forked tongue, pretty.

267
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,200
So I'm gonna tell you what,
we go someplace public

268
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,800
with a car waiting for me to leave,
and <i>then...</i>

269
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,400
then I'll tell you. Deal?

270
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
Oh, my God.

271
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,000
That is only the second time...

272
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,100
a weapon has ever jammed on me.

273
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,500
First time was during training
for Gulf One.

274
00:26:32,862 --> 00:26:34,775
As soon as it happened,
the commanding officer,

275
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,100
he got in my face and he said,

276
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,000
"Son, a weapon jam on the battlefield,

277
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,900
you might as well call that suicide."

278
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,500
Kristine, I've...

279
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,300
done things...

280
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,100
Damn.

281
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,605
Damn.

282
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:28,100
I love you, Paul,
whatever it is that got you here.

283
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,700
And there's a way out, believe me.

284
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
My...

285
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,500
My entire adult life,

286
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,500
I've followed orders...

287
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,800
uh, and I did terrible things,

288
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
because I thought
they were right, and...

289
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,300
it turns out I did those things
in service of nothing.

290
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,600
So that's what I'm left with... Nothing.

291
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,400
You have me.

292
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah, okay.

293
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,900
And you have a clean slate.

294
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,800
Anything.

295
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,300
Everything.

296
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,700
It's available to you
starting right now.

297
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,000
- The things I've done, Kristine...
- Undo them.

298
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,400
There's always a way.

299
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Maybe that gun jammed for a reason.

300
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,610
Come here.

301
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,600
Don't let your pride
get in the way now, pretty.

302
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,806
Save it.

303
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,389
Locking me up ain't gonna help
your situation none.

304
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,911
I <i>have</i> information.

305
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
What's the plan?

306
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:01,030
We're gonna take him to the embassy,

307
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:03,152
we're gonna make sure he's deported,

308
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,338
then we'll go looking for Bellick,
all right?

309
00:29:06,637 --> 00:29:07,643
Meanwhile,

310
00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:09,799
I want you to ride in the back with him.

311
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,374
I'm telling you,
you are being penny-wise

312
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,454
and pound-foolish.

313
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,900
Get in the car.

314
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,257
I'll tell her about the offer.

315
00:29:40,801 --> 00:29:42,379
- Well?
- 12 years.

316
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,847
No. The jury heard Michael's tape.

317
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,399
They heard a convicted felon
lie for a woman

318
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,600
that he clearly cares for.

319
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,100
He's got no credibility.

320
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,403
Sara, we need to take a hard look
at what they're offering.

321
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,100
Due respect, Marty,
<i>we</i> aren't going to prison, <i>I</i> am.

322
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,499
They've made it very clear

323
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,200
that they want somebody
to hang for this,

324
00:30:02,265 --> 00:30:05,395
and unfortunately, you're the only one
they've got in their grasp.

325
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,628
There's no avoiding it.

326
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,800
This is the plea agreement.

327
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,588
We can walk you through it
if you'd like.

328
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
12 years?

329
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,206
He didn't answer.

330
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,803
I certainly hope your brother
makes it back to that boat.

331
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,056
And if he doesn't?

332
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,802
You should see yourself.

333
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,107
You look like you're hanging in there
by a thread.

334
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,000
I just want this over with.

335
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,889
Then you should never
have come down here.

336
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,309
In case you hadn't noticed,
me and my brother don't quit for no one.

337
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,206
Thank God for that.

338
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,897
Because it's guys
that are accused of things like you are

339
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:56,700
that keeps guys like me in business.

340
00:31:00,354 --> 00:31:01,300
Kept...

341
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,700
guys like me in business, rather.

342
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,665
It's gonna end bad for you, man.

343
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,317
Couple of things in this world
I'm good at.

344
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,214
One of them's looking into a man's eye

345
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:16,770
and knowing when he's beat.

346
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,000
How far to the embassy?

347
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,600
Just hang in there, buddy.

348
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
And then what?

349
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,101
We're gonna turn him in.

350
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,733
And how do we not get busted?

351
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,852
Before we get there, I'll pull over.

352
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:37,334
We'll hog-tie him with duct tape,

353
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,199
and we'll dump him out,
and hit the road,

354
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,768
and I'll call the cops,
tell 'em where we left him.

355
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,600
Then how we get to Bellick?

356
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:44,760
Don't worry, we'll find him.

357
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,119
Y'all ain't getting
within a mile of Bellick.

358
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:48,208
Nobody asked you.

359
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,843
He's got a point, though, Michael.

360
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,700
Just keep the gun on him, okay?

361
00:31:53,898 --> 00:31:57,194
I mean, if Bellick's locked up,
what's good the money going to be to us?

362
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,397
Buddy, we'll fix it.

363
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,892
My girl's life is on the line here.

364
00:31:59,893 --> 00:32:01,300
Sucre, you better pull it together.

365
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,706
Easy. Easy.

366
00:32:46,153 --> 00:32:47,500
Buddy, you're gonna be all right.

367
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Go get the money.

368
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,600
Please. Quick.

369
00:33:16,886 --> 00:33:17,890
Get the money.

370
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,400
Pressure.
<i>Presión.</i>

371
00:34:42,256 --> 00:34:44,402
What exactly is it that you want,
Pretty?

372
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,797
I'm turning you in.

373
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,169
Is that it? Really?

374
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,952
It ain't about the money?

375
00:35:02,194 --> 00:35:04,189
'Cause, if it is, you can tell me.

376
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,900
Ain't nobody here but us cons.

377
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,158
You can walk

378
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:10,208
or get dragged.

379
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,610
But it's up to you.

380
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,744
No. See, when you had the gun on me,

381
00:35:16,745 --> 00:35:18,699
I afforded you a certain respect.

382
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,960
But here?

383
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,861
Well, the scales are tipped back my way.

384
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,900
So I'm going to spell out
the present options.

385
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,393
Either we split this money,

386
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,268
and you can go get your legs tattooed

387
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:34,414
or whatever the hell it is you want,

388
00:35:35,023 --> 00:35:37,550
or they're gonna find your corpse
slumped over that there chair

389
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,288
with your pants down around your ankles,

390
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,839
'cause it's been a long time coming,
Pretty.

391
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,901
Well, I got my answer.

392
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,193
Whenever you're done yakking.

393
00:36:00,145 --> 00:36:01,151
Bring it, bitch.

394
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,865
Who are you fooling?

395
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,000
You ain't gonna kill me,
Mr. Michelangelo.

396
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,241
You ain't got it in you,

397
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:38,600
so how would you just
let me do the killing?

398
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,206
All right.

399
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:54,412
Thank you.

400
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Okay, Sara.

401
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,026
Now, here's how the plea
is going to go down.

402
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,200
The judge is going to need you
to allocute to the charges.

403
00:37:09,244 --> 00:37:10,488
He's going to ask you

404
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,700
if you intentionally left the door open.

405
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,664
- You will say yes.
- Right.

406
00:37:14,903 --> 00:37:16,330
Then he's going to ask you

407
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,899
if you gave support and comfort
to Michael Scofield

408
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,100
and Lincoln Burrows since the escape.

409
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,765
You'll say yes.

410
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:26,131
And then the sentence
will be immediately handed down.

411
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:29,089
The prosecution is asking
that you do your time

412
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,114
in a maximum security facility.

413
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,239
I think
the judge is going to agree to that.

414
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,419
With good behavior,

415
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:48,357
how many years of my sentence
can I expect to serve?

416
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,187
On a 12-year sentence?

417
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,493
You'll do nine years.

418
00:37:57,884 --> 00:37:59,620
I'll be out before I'm 40.

419
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,310
I'm sorry, Sara.

420
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,615
Are you ready for this?

421
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,200
What?

422
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,926
A very credible witness
has just came forward,

423
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,502
and he's willing to testify.

424
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,500
He'll corroborate everything you've said
about this conspiracy.

425
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,606
Who?

426
00:38:38,647 --> 00:38:39,658
Help!

427
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:47,600
Do you speak English?

428
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:50,100
Good. I need to...

429
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,999
I need to get in contact
with every hospital

430
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,402
in the Panama City area.

431
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,197
A friend of mine was...

432
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,139
A friend of mine was in a car accident.

433
00:40:01,062 --> 00:40:03,112
I'm sorry.
I'm going to have to call you back.

434
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,811
I'm sorry, Michael.

435
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:08,520
What's wrong?

436
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,306
Hello, Michael.

437
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,193
If you touch my brother,
you're a dead man.

438
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,300
<i>Oh, please.</i>

439
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,830
You don't have to worry about that.

440
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,428
When it comes right down to it,

441
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,000
<i>he's just like you.</i>

442
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,821
He has a heart that won't kill a man.

443
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:37,000
Give me the handcuffs

444
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,199
or I swear to God
I'll blow your head clean off.

445
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,138
What do you want, Alex?

446
00:41:06,348 --> 00:41:08,221
I'll tell you exactly what I want.

447
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,743
But first things first.

448
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,217
When the authorities captured Bagwell
today,

449
00:41:14,165 --> 00:41:17,000
the money was nowhere to be found.

450
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,523
Now, I can only assume

451
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:23,950
that <i>you've</i> got the money

452
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:28,010
<i>aboard the Christina Rose,
right now.</i>

453
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,100
It's an amazing plan, Michael.

454
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:32,266
Take the money, take the boat,
disappear forever.

455
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,100
But you...

456
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,976
are not the only one
that needs to disappear.

457
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
You still there?

458
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,242
Yeah, I'm still here.

459
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,585
<i>Good. Cause I'm going to say this,</i>

460
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,993
<i>and I'm going to say this once.</i>

461
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,739
Bring me the money, bring me the boat.

462
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:52,397
You are out of your mind.

463
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,604
Not really.

464
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,289
We both have something
the other person needs.

465
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,997
<i>It all comes down to this, Michael.</i>

466
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,700
<i>Your brother for your plan.</i>

467
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,057
Five minutes. That's what you have.
