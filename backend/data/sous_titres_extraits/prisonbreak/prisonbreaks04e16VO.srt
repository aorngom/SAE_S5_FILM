1
00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:02,617
<i>Previously on Prison Break...</i>

2
00:00:02,737 --> 00:00:05,793
<i>The price of the operation
is the safe return of Scylla.</i>

3
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:07,628
See if the buyer
left him a message.

4
00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:09,663
Yeah, it's a
Miami area code.

5
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:11,293
The item.

6
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:13,401
<i>I'm sure you understand
no one can know</i>

7
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:14,468
Where Scylla's going.

8
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:18,939
Do you know who took it?

9
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:21,142
No, but Self
and Gretchen do.

10
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:22,076
Then you've got your team.

11
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:23,310
I'm not working for them.

12
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:24,912
There are holes in your rsum?

13
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,089
That Gretchen or Self
or even Bagwell can fill.

14
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,620
What happened?

15
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:33,821
He got away.

16
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,327
What's this?

17
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:42,496
My resignation.

18
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:44,865
Whatever plan you're working on
to get us out of here,

19
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:46,434
We better make a move on it.

20
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:47,968
You're not getting
out of here, Michael.

21
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:49,203
I made a deal.

22
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:51,005
Your life
in exchange for Scylla.

23
00:00:51,073 --> 00:00:52,340
You think you can do that

24
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:53,874
Knowing what you know
about the Company?

25
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:55,309
You want to know
what I know about the Company?

26
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:57,111
Mom worked for them
before she died.

27
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,565
Now, I'm gonna do
Everything and anything I can to end this.

28
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:19,066
Hello?

29
00:01:19,134 --> 00:01:21,502
Sara, it's me.

30
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,903
Where are you?

31
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:25,306
Miami. The guy
who took Scylla's here.

32
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:28,142
So you're-You're actually trying
to get it back for the Company?

33
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,545
I'm gonna give it back to the Company so we can
Walk away from this.

34
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:32,546
How's Michael?

35
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:33,781
I don't know.

36
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:35,883
I don't know.
Two guys from the Company came,

37
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:38,486
And they brought me to a hotel,

38
00:01:38,553 --> 00:01:41,555
And-And I was given... flowers

39
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:42,857
And a fruit basket,

40
00:01:42,924 --> 00:01:44,825
And absolutely
no information about Michael.

41
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:46,193
Is Fernando with you?

42
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:47,762
Sucre split.

43
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:49,420
We, uh, we left some messages

44
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,832
With Mahone, telling him
Where we are, but that

45
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,000
Was two cell phones back.

46
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:55,569
Sorry, who's "we"?
Who are you with?

47
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:57,605
People I don't trust.

48
00:01:59,307 --> 00:02:00,608
Okay.

49
00:02:00,676 --> 00:02:03,177
Listen, um...

50
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:05,179
Lincoln, I know
why you did it, and-And...

51
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:07,415
I'm grateful to you,
because he was gonna die.

52
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:09,617
But do you really think that

53
00:02:09,685 --> 00:02:12,219
They're just gonna let us live
when we give them Scylla?

54
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:13,921
You know what, Sara,
I'm doing my best.

55
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:15,690
Just-Just call me

56
00:02:15,757 --> 00:02:18,225
If you hear anything
about Michael, please.

57
00:02:18,293 --> 00:02:20,594
GRETCHEN:
Linc, the Company's
data tech

58
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:23,064
Finally got a hit
on our guy's cell phone.

59
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:25,533
It's a number,
and it goes to this address--

60
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,867
The Grafton; it's a club.

61
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:27,935
How many calls?

62
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:29,704
Three. All outgoing.

63
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:30,705
How do we know
this guy's

64
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:31,739
Still in Miami,

65
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:33,207
That he hasn't
sold it already, huh?

66
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:34,709
Not that I'm
complaining.

67
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:37,078
I've had some filthy,
filthy times in this state.

68
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:38,212
Don't screw this up,
all right?

69
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,115
Because that's our
only lead on this guy.

70
00:02:41,183 --> 00:02:43,284
Be thankful
I haven't killed you.

71
00:02:43,352 --> 00:02:47,121
Oh, yeah? Wh-What are you,
Eliot Ness now? Huh?

72
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:48,732
What, are you upset because
I screwed you over, Linc?

73
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:49,890
'Cause don't act like

74
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,559
You haven't done that
to ten times as many people.

75
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:53,794
All right? We're just crooks
that got caught, Lincoln.

76
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:55,830
This...

77
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:58,132
This guy, this isn't gonna work.

78
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,469
Why don't we all just focus
on who's got Scylla.

79
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:03,337
What do you say?

80
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,773
MAN (calls):
Hey, Scofield.

81
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:22,416
Where am I?

82
00:04:22,484 --> 00:04:23,651
He's awake.

83
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:25,386
I said, where am I?

84
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:27,655
It's a house,
in the woods,

85
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:29,390
60 miles from anywhere.

86
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,992
Swept clean of weapons,
so you don't need

87
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,594
To worry your
head about that.

88
00:04:33,662 --> 00:04:36,197
There are no bars on
the windows or the doors,

89
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:38,599
But there are three types of
mountain lion in the area,

90
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,267
So you might want
to stay close by.

91
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:41,736
MAN:
I'll take it
from here.

92
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:46,540
Dr. Roger Knowlton, Michael.

93
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:48,209
How are you feeling?

94
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:50,444
You some kind of neurologist?

95
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:52,079
Psychiatrist.

96
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:53,547
Given that you've got

97
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:55,850
Some free time, the General
asked if I'd sit with you.

98
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,819
A cigar's a cigar.

99
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:00,521
Are we done?

100
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:05,893
You've been operating under some...
Misconceptions about the Company,

101
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:07,194
And the General wants

102
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:08,963
To, uh, open the books.

103
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:11,399
I'm here to... provide facts

104
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:13,567
And to help you process them.

105
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:15,736
If by facts, you mean
what's on Scylla

106
00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:18,072
And that my mother
once worked for the Company,

107
00:05:18,743 --> 00:05:21,170
I already know
these things.

108
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:23,277
"Worked"?

109
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:29,250
Your mother...

110
00:05:29,317 --> 00:05:31,285
<i>Works for us.</i>

111
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:35,923
Your mother is alive.

116
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:22,937
Hey.

117
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:25,373
We don't open
till 3:00.
I'm just looking for someone.

118
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:27,675
Haven't got the guy's name,

119
00:06:27,743 --> 00:06:29,777
Uh, but he called
here yesterday

120
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:31,746
About three times--
New Yorker, dark hair,

121
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:33,881
Bits of gray.

122
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:36,572
You know where I can find him?

123
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:40,187
Uh, yeah, I can't
help you. Sorry.

124
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:42,490
You sure?

125
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:45,159
My man, you need
to check your ears,

126
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:47,161
All right, 'cause he
just said we don't know
who you're talking about.

127
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,163
Is that right?
Yeah, that's right.

128
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:51,766
Well, what about blondie?

129
00:06:54,186 --> 00:06:56,170
You've got about
two seconds...

130
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:02,610
How about it?

131
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:04,578
I don't know his name.

132
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:05,446
How about it!

133
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:07,014
He works...

134
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:09,283
This girl... works here,
he dates her.

135
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:11,752
You're gonna take me to her.

136
00:07:15,157 --> 00:07:17,558
MICHAEL:
Well, this is all just..

137
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:20,428
Fascinating, Doctor.

138
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:23,264
KNOWLTON:
I don't know how
better to say this.

139
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:26,567
She left you and your
brother to protect you.

140
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:29,470
From the dangers
of solar synthesis work?

141
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:31,472
I know what's on Scylla.

142
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,709
There were threats, you and
Lincoln might be kidnapped.

143
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:36,197
You were in
imminent danger.

144
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:37,576
Really.

145
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:39,780
Where was she when
my brother was strapped

146
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:41,349
To an electric chair?
She'd been working

147
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,108
In a Madagascar
rain forest,

148
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:45,234
Without satellite access.

149
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:49,350
<i>Or she wasn't alive,
hasn't been for 25 years,</i>

150
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,461
And this is all fiction.

151
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:58,299
There's a million acres,
corn and soy, outside Cordoba

152
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:02,336
That was arid scrub before
your mother's research.

153
00:08:02,404 --> 00:08:04,071
That's not fiction,

154
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,573
That's food...

155
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,274
For thousands.

156
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:08,409
Millions.

157
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:09,643
There's so much more

158
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:10,845
On Scylla than you know.

159
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:13,147
It sounds like we'd have
a lot to talk about.

160
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:14,982
Why don't you get her
on the phone.

161
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,418
When you're ready.

162
00:08:17,486 --> 00:08:20,421
No time like the present.

163
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:22,957
When you're ready...

164
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:25,359
To join her.

165
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:27,495
Us.

166
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:30,498
That's... what
this conversation

167
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:32,433
Is about.

168
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:34,268
Joining...

169
00:08:34,336 --> 00:08:36,671
The Company.

170
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:45,613
Hey, Erica, it's me.

171
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:47,214
So, are you coming?

172
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:50,117
I really need
to talk to you.

173
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,924
She's on her way.

174
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:01,362
Oh, my God!

175
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,999
Why'd this guy call the club's
phone and not Erica's?

176
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:06,334
I... They fight a lot,

177
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:08,936
So when she doesn't answer,
he calls the club.

178
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:12,973
What do you want with this guy?

179
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,109
He took something
that belongs to me.

180
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:16,811
I want it back.

181
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:19,513
There.

182
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:22,783
There's Erica.

183
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:25,821
Wait here.

184
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:23,634
Get him stitched up.

185
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:26,420
<i>Big guy.</i>

186
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,903
Shaved head. Crazy.

187
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:31,005
Who the hell is he?
I don't know.

188
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:33,207
He bought the whole thing
about you being friends

189
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:34,676
With this chick
or whatever?
Yeah.

190
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:35,903
He didn't know
I was with you,

191
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:39,052
And by the time he did, he
was trying not to get shot.

192
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,892
Hey, hey, hey.

193
00:10:41,012 --> 00:10:42,817
You did good.

194
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:45,169
I just need a smoke so bad.

195
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:46,535
Oh, no.

196
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,423
What?

197
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,358
My wallet.

198
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:52,860
This is the chick who set me up.

199
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:54,086
We find her, we find our guy.

200
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:56,998
GRETCHEN:
Busting up clubs,
firing shots in public.

201
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:59,562
You keep that up and we're not
going to last here much longer.

202
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:00,328
I don't plan on

203
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:02,725
Staying here very long. You?

204
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:04,815
See, that's why I have to give
it up to the General.

205
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:07,532
He puts four enemies together,
guaranteed dissension.

206
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:10,345
No alliances
form against him.

207
00:11:10,412 --> 00:11:11,731
This is our guy's
girlfriend's address.

208
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:12,678
He's probably gone,

209
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,295
But see what
you can find.

210
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:19,714
This is Tia.

211
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:26,081
Do you want to know what
I think they were talking about?

212
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:27,405
I don't care.

213
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,955
Just as long as they
keep out of my way.

214
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:31,836
Same with you.

215
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:39,611
Send her in.

216
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:46,578
Sarah! You're looking...

217
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:48,291
Rested.

218
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:50,395
How is the hotel?

219
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:52,415
I would like to offer
my professional

220
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:54,689
Assistance in
Michael's rehabilitation.

221
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,638
Kind...

222
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,254
But he's receiving
excellent care.

223
00:11:58,374 --> 00:11:59,466
There's nothing for you
to worry about.

224
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:00,887
Whatever it is you
have planned for him,

225
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:04,189
I would simply like to help
maintain his health.

226
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:07,923
And that's appreciated,
but it's impossible.

227
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:10,388
Believe me,
you serve Michael best

228
00:12:10,508 --> 00:12:12,640
At a distance
right now.

229
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,175
Trust me.

230
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:19,414
I have no agenda apart
from simply...

231
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:22,552
Wanting to see that he's okay.

232
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:24,293
And in three days to a week,

233
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:26,801
He'll be back
in your loving arms forever.

234
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:30,145
Okay, I'm not that patient.

235
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:32,493
Indulge yourself.

236
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:34,827
Sit by the pool,

237
00:12:34,947 --> 00:12:36,318
Envision the future:

238
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:38,519
Financial security,

239
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,946
Michael's talents being utilized
on a global scale,

240
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:43,646
You beside him innovating.

241
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:47,191
Michael's talents being
utilized on a global scale?

242
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:51,846
I'm simply trying to maximize
his potential.

243
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:53,548
Yours, too.

244
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:56,284
What's being done to him?

245
00:12:56,352 --> 00:13:01,731
I'm putting an end to this
exhausting cat-And-Mouse.

246
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:04,659
Thank you for stopping by.

247
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:19,092
"Radical architecture
is a rejection
of all formal

248
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:22,343
And moral parameters."

249
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:23,355
From your thesis.

250
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:27,048
Someone else's words
heavily paraphrased.

251
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:29,542
And it pertains
to buildings, structures.

252
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:32,553
I think you meant it
as a metaphor.

253
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:35,019
What, that the ends
justify the means?

254
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:36,092
Which neatly

255
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:37,597
Coincides with
your mother's philosophy.

256
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,912
Did you know that she had
an almost identical quote

257
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:40,762
In her thesis?

258
00:13:40,882 --> 00:13:43,451
From 30 years ago.

259
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:45,471
You've done a lot of homework.

260
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,454
Just a few
conversations.

261
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:50,879
Let me guess.
You two had some kind of moment

262
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:53,574
At the Company Christmas party?

263
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:57,078
I've known your mother
for years.

264
00:13:57,146 --> 00:14:00,481
Well enough to know you've got
the same brilliant mind

265
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,648
And the same sense of humor,
for that matter.

266
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:05,520
I'm guessing this isn't about
my sense of humor.

267
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:07,508
She was just

268
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:11,102
As resistant
to joining the Company,

269
00:14:11,222 --> 00:14:12,864
But then she learned
the truth.

270
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:16,013
If the truth is that the Company
is all about saving the world,

271
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,880
I don't buy it.

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,956
And if my mother is so brilliant
and active in the Company,

273
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:24,172
What do you want with me?

274
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:27,975
A fully functioning Scylla
project would exist

275
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,132
On a global scale.

276
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:30,085
It can't be managed

277
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:31,792
By one person.

278
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,021
But two...

279
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:39,072
Equally formidable,
working in lockstep?

280
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:41,492
Absolutely.

281
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:43,925
That's very good.

282
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:47,414
You've clearly thought
of everything.

283
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:49,230
Michael...

284
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,035
If I weren't telling you
the truth,

285
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:57,839
How would I have gotten this?

286
00:15:57,271 --> 00:16:01,592
This is just a stupid girl
who dates a criminal.

287
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,104
This is  a waste of time.

288
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:05,387
A signature of Burrows'
leadership.

289
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,146
All right, we need
to make a shift.

290
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,435
Bagwell, I'm telling you
right now,

291
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:10,316
If I make my play
and you go soft,

292
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,043
I will sail you off
that loft balcony

293
00:16:12,163 --> 00:16:13,454
And no one will bat an eye.

294
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:15,282
My aim is true, Don.

295
00:16:15,402 --> 00:16:16,345
Keep it in your pants.

296
00:16:16,465 --> 00:16:19,288
I'll keep it in
my pants, all right?

297
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:22,789
All right, all in favor of
changing the regime, say "Aye."

298
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:23,817
Aye, aye, Captain.

299
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:27,996
Aye. All right, Burrows is out.

300
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,735
Good, great. Send it.

301
00:16:33,802 --> 00:16:37,605
The Company's e-Mailing
Tia's credit card history.

302
00:16:37,725 --> 00:16:40,919
You know, I'm thinking more and
more that this is an inside job.

303
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,559
Why?
A couple reasons.

304
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,144
The hardware he
brought to the meet.

305
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:48,008
He could read Scylla
right on the spot.

306
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:49,297
Since he's disappeared,

307
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,961
I should be able to find
this man, and I can't.

308
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:54,422
People you can't find are
usually Company.

309
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,679
How does that change anything?

310
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,411
It doesn't.

311
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:58,292
It just makes everything harder.

312
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:04,632
Lincoln...

313
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,973
Yeah?

314
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:08,936
When are we going to get this
out of the way?

315
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:10,048
What?

316
00:17:10,168 --> 00:17:11,790
Of all the mercenary humps
I've thrown at guys

317
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,447
In my lifetime, I think I'm due
for one I want.

318
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,980
Don't flatter yourself.

319
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:21,804
Too late.

320
00:17:23,546 --> 00:17:26,020
Name it.

321
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,256
And I do mean anything.

322
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:33,861
A big ol' fat load
of nothin'!

323
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,042
A big ol' goose egg.

324
00:17:37,162 --> 00:17:40,612
SELF:
Nothing. Old address
books, photographs,

325
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:42,145
Hard drive
from her computer.

326
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:43,538
I checked her e-Mails
and her Web sites.

327
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:44,914
There's nothing from our guy.

328
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:47,109
Are you sure this girlfriend
route is the way to go here?

329
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:49,042
Because this is starting
to feel like a wasted trip.

330
00:17:49,162 --> 00:17:50,122
How long is it gonna take
the Company

331
00:17:50,242 --> 00:17:51,776
To pull everything
off this thing?

332
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,548
A couple hours.

333
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,260
All right, Linc,
this is the deal.

334
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,914
Look, we appreciate your effort,

335
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,518
But Bagwell and I
took a vote,

336
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:03,550
And this being Florida and all,
you came up a little bit short.

337
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,579
Meaning?

338
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:05,796
You're not in charge.

339
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:06,701
Who is?

340
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:08,251
Him.
Yeah.

341
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:09,593
The bull-In-The-China-Shop routine

342
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,038
Might have worked when
you were stealing gumballs,

343
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:13,477
But our asses are
on the line now, okay?

344
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:15,062
And we all have deals
with the General.

345
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:16,978
So that's the way
it's gonna be.

346
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:19,973
And if you notice,
even Gretchen hasn't
leapt to your defense.

347
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:21,854
Linc, just let him wear
his crown.

348
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:23,944
I would if I thought he wasn't
gonna sell this thing.

349
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:25,790
Oh, what, am I the only one
who's thought about that?

350
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,305
Look, here's the
deal, Linc.

351
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:28,855
At some point,
you'll have a vote.

352
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,074
But until then,
you're done, all right?

353
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,119
We're shuttin' you down, okay?

354
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:32,887
You're no longer in charge.

355
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:43,003
GRETCHEN:
Uh-Oh, looks like
there's been a recount.

356
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,379
Bad time?

357
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,061
No, perfect.

358
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,286
The second you stop

359
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:54,689
Doing what I tell you to do,

360
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:57,478
I'm gonna blow your brains out.

361
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:11,618
Bring her back.

362
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:13,606
It's not gonna be
the same.

363
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:16,409
Stir any memories?

364
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:25,818
I was ten. We were on a camping
trip in Jackson Hole.

365
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:28,288
Fishing, hiking.

366
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:30,619
Family huddled under a blanket
in front of the bonfire.

367
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:32,058
You can stop now.

368
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:34,327
Why? Because two years later
it was gone?

369
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:37,664
You know, three
of the four

370
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:39,365
People in this photograph
are still alive.

371
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:40,967
So what are you
suggesting,

372
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:42,735
Grab my fishing pole?

373
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:44,070
Time for a...

374
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:45,905
A family reunion in Wyoming?

375
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:48,041
Or wherever you like.

376
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:50,877
Don't tell me it's something
you haven't wished for.

377
00:19:50,945 --> 00:19:55,181
I wished for a lot
of unrealistic things.

378
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,450
I got over them, too.

379
00:19:57,518 --> 00:19:58,885
Why,

380
00:19:58,953 --> 00:20:01,754
When we can make this happen?

381
00:20:03,457 --> 00:20:07,493
These pictures could have been
taken anywhere at any time.

382
00:20:08,343 --> 00:20:09,876
Before you were incarcerated,

383
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:11,492
You'd go to visit her grave
on the anniversary

384
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:13,132
Of her funeral.
All right, enough.

385
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,599
You'd bring a bouquet
of blue irises.

386
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,902
You'd sit for an hour.

387
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,786
I said stop it.

388
00:20:16,906 --> 00:20:17,957
When you'd leave,
you'd take a flower

389
00:20:18,077 --> 00:20:19,155
And pin it to your lapel.

390
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:20,743
She watched you
do this every year.

391
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,997
She's seen the pain you carry.

392
00:20:22,117 --> 00:20:22,945
She wants
to make amends.

393
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:24,577
All right!

394
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:29,048
So you did a little digging.
Good for you.

395
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:31,017
But everything out of your mouth
is a lie,

396
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:32,785
And I don't believe a word
of it.

397
00:20:34,113 --> 00:20:36,022
So let's just stop.

398
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:40,760
Let's just stop.

399
00:20:44,565 --> 00:20:46,099
<i>SELF:
That's Tia's address</i>

400
00:20:49,436 --> 00:20:53,139
All right, she lives here,
works here, but yesterday

401
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:54,874
She used her credit card
to buy a drink

402
00:20:54,942 --> 00:20:56,109
At the Pelican Club
a little after noon,

403
00:20:56,176 --> 00:20:57,944
And then she picked up
something at the gift shop

404
00:20:58,012 --> 00:20:58,765
A little after 1:00.

405
00:20:58,885 --> 00:20:59,517
Waiting for her

406
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:00,716
Boyfriend to debark.

407
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:02,148
<i>Disembark.</i>

408
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:04,651
He's already in town.
Yeah.

409
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:07,120
Then he lives in the marina.

410
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:10,657
Or this is another reason
to think it's an inside job.

411
00:21:10,724 --> 00:21:12,492
If he's working with someone
from the Company,

412
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,927
They wouldn't want their names
on any flight manifests.

413
00:21:14,995 --> 00:21:16,362
All right, they're trying
to get Scylla

414
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,764
Out of the country
by boat undetected.

415
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:19,732
Let's go.

416
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,334
Alex,
Yeah?

417
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:24,437
Thanks for coming
when you did, man.

418
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:29,208
You helped me like you said
you would. I owe you.

419
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:15,722
SELF:
Okay, I'll do
the talking.

420
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:16,537
You guys wait here.

421
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,758
Alex, let's go.

422
00:22:22,796 --> 00:22:23,896
Afternoon.

423
00:22:23,964 --> 00:22:25,164
How's it going?

424
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:26,899
What can I do you for?

425
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:27,834
Recognize her?

426
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,702
SELF:
Her name's Tia Hayden.

427
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,005
Can't say I do.
Wish I did.

428
00:22:32,072 --> 00:22:33,473
Nice little tomato there.

429
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,375
She was in here yesterday with a man.

430
00:22:35,442 --> 00:22:36,809
Can't help.

431
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:38,858
Sorry.

432
00:22:38,978 --> 00:22:41,324
Don Self, Homeland Security.

433
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,683
And this is my partner
Bruce Liberace.

434
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:45,485
No relation.

435
00:22:45,552 --> 00:22:49,078
Our department is working with the Office
Of Foreign Assets Control. Have you heard of them?

436
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:49,921
Yep.

437
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,858
Bet you have.
We're looking into smuggling

438
00:22:51,925 --> 00:22:54,694
And contraband transportation
of Cuban cigars.

439
00:22:54,762 --> 00:22:56,996
None here, swear to God.

440
00:22:57,064 --> 00:22:58,359
All right, well,
that's for us to decide.

441
00:22:58,479 --> 00:23:00,333
It's going
to take about a week,

442
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:02,435
And it's going to
involve shutting down this entire marina...

443
00:23:02,503 --> 00:23:03,336
Oh, yeah.

444
00:23:03,404 --> 00:23:04,404
...for about a week.

445
00:23:04,471 --> 00:23:05,705
Or...
She was here

446
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:09,075
With that guy
you were talking about.

447
00:23:09,143 --> 00:23:11,582
He wanted to know which berth a
private charter was docking in.

448
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:14,013
He asked me to move it further
down the dock, which I did.

449
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:15,692
Further away
from the Coast Guard slip?

450
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,518
I didn't ask.
And I didn't accept any money.

451
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:19,900
If he said he paid me,
he's lying.

452
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,754
What's the point of departure?

453
00:23:21,822 --> 00:23:23,556
Nassau, Bahamas. Round trip.

454
00:23:23,624 --> 00:23:24,891
When does it arrive?

455
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,593
Arrived.

456
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:32,365
Hey, everybody!
Okay, my name is Don Self!

457
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:34,400
Homeland Security.

458
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:38,237
My colleagues and I are hoping
that you guys have a wonderful

459
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:40,640
And safe trip.
Unfortunately,

460
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:44,077
We're going to have to do
a quick luggage check search.

461
00:23:44,144 --> 00:23:45,912
Shouldn't take more
than a minute, folks.

462
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,246
Your cooperation is all

463
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:49,749
That's required.
Open your bags.

464
00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:23,449
Get on your knees!

465
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:24,851
Okay, okay, okay.

466
00:24:24,918 --> 00:24:27,487
Where is it?
Where's Scylla?

467
00:24:27,554 --> 00:24:29,255
What have you
got in here?

468
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:31,991
Huh?

469
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:34,460
Three joints.

470
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:43,336
I'm on probation.

471
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:45,471
Is this going to send me back?

472
00:24:51,345 --> 00:24:53,079
Make yourself
a helmet, pal.

473
00:24:53,147 --> 00:24:56,049
Just like old times.

474
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:01,254
Bring her back.

475
00:25:01,322 --> 00:25:03,222
You know
I can't do that.

476
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,992
But, look, there's
some stuff

477
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,660
<i>That I can do.</i>

478
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:08,828
It's not going to be the same,

479
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:11,197
But we're going
to figure it out.

480
00:25:11,265 --> 00:25:12,732
And, no matter what,

481
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,437
It's still going
to be me and you.

482
00:25:16,504 --> 00:25:19,505
I am thrilled that
You're enjoying your trip to the mountains,

483
00:25:19,573 --> 00:25:22,008
But it's not
an open-Ended vacation.

484
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:25,612
Scofield's exhausted.
Despondent.

485
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,347
He's very resistant,
but a classic abandoned child.

486
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:28,348
He'll come around.

487
00:25:28,415 --> 00:25:29,849
Time frame, Doctor?

488
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:33,052
Unaided, three days.

489
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,554
With the pentothal?

490
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:38,057
Sooner, but it's nearly
a chemical lobotomy.

491
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,028
But, if he turns on his own,
it'll be his decision,

492
00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:43,429
His reasoning.

493
00:25:43,497 --> 00:25:45,465
We'll own him forever.

494
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:47,533
Scofield's squirrelly.

495
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:50,036
I won't trust him
till he walks hot coals.

496
00:25:50,104 --> 00:25:52,639
I think I can get him there.

497
00:25:52,706 --> 00:25:54,240
Good. But, if

498
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:57,110
I find out he's been
playing you, Doctor,

499
00:25:57,177 --> 00:25:59,512
You'll get the same lobotomy
as Scofield.

500
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,082
Just get it done.

501
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:41,454
Go!

502
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:13,032
If you fight
when those cuffs are off,

503
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,600
The guards will stomp the life
out of you.

504
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:17,537
Yeah.

505
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:24,344
Forgive
the dramatics.

506
00:27:24,411 --> 00:27:26,446
The Company can't know
I'm talking to you.

507
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:28,781
<i>You are the Company.
You're his daughter.</i>

508
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,249
Do you want
to find Michael Scofield?

509
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:31,618
Of course I do.

510
00:27:35,356 --> 00:27:37,023
It's 60 miles northeast

511
00:27:37,091 --> 00:27:39,192
Of downtown.
I'd move quickly.

512
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:40,493
What are they doing to him?

513
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:42,295
Having lemonade.

514
00:27:43,631 --> 00:27:45,498
They're carving out his personality.

515
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:46,532
That's how they recruit.

516
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,324
Or you're setting me up.

517
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:51,094
Clandestine warfare
isn't pretty,

518
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:52,097
But the rules of engagement

519
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:54,574
Don't include killing
and torturing the innocent.

520
00:27:54,642 --> 00:27:56,242
At least not for me.

521
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,427
Michael is the object
of a quick and nasty

522
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:02,949
Process,
and you're wasting time.

523
00:28:03,017 --> 00:28:04,017
Out.

524
00:28:05,386 --> 00:28:06,686
Out.

525
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:18,564
We need the footage
from that security camera.

526
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:20,133
Not to offend either of you,
but I took

527
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,668
The liberty of
calling my attorney

528
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:23,850
To find out exactly what the
scope of your authority is here,

529
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,707
And he tells me...
Just get the tape, all right?

530
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:31,054
sure

531
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,334
Either we
missed Scylla...

532
00:28:36,454 --> 00:28:37,393
No, no, no.
We did not

533
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:38,619
Miss Scylla.

534
00:28:38,739 --> 00:28:40,119
We searched every bag.

535
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:41,220
Then maybe

536
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:42,832
The buyer was already
on the boat,

537
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:45,558
<i>And was disembarking, right?</i>

538
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:48,271
I mean, if they don't want their
names on any flight manifest,

539
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:50,496
Maybe they just eased back on in.

540
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:52,699
That wouldn't be the worst news.

541
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:54,033
That means they're in Miami.

542
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:56,211
Right. So get yourself
back down

543
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:58,370
With your disgraced badge
to Steamboat Willie,

544
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,000
And have him cough up every name
Of every person on that boat coming off.

545
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:03,997
Okay, that's good, because

546
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,613
They probably would
have traveled in

547
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:06,879
On a low-Grade charter

548
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:08,860
From the Bahamas,
and used their

549
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,917
Real names, right?

550
00:29:10,985 --> 00:29:12,919
That would
be a good plan.

551
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:14,921
<i>MAHONE:
How is he?</i>

552
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:16,422
He's alive.

553
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:20,293
So we get Scylla.

554
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:23,262
Then we're free, all of us--
Pam, LJ...

555
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,865
All of a sudden,
the Company grew a heart?

556
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:26,861
They're just
tired of us.

557
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:29,202
They want Scylla back.
That's it.

558
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,556
Then we never really
had anything they wanted.

559
00:29:31,676 --> 00:29:34,274
Exactly.
Now we got leverage.

560
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,745
We don't have it yet.

561
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:46,085
Anything?

562
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:48,276
No.

563
00:29:48,396 --> 00:29:49,989
Nothing yet.

564
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:52,325
Nothing.

565
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:56,524
No, Lincoln,
you don't understand.

566
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:58,098
The way she said "recruit"
made my stomach turn.

567
00:29:58,218 --> 00:29:59,565
They're going to torture him.

568
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,134
He can take care of himself,

569
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,824
At least for one day,
until we get Scylla.

570
00:30:02,944 --> 00:30:06,005
Lincoln, he needs
to be in the ICU.

571
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:07,140
What's your plan?

572
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:08,273
Break him out?

573
00:30:08,393 --> 00:30:10,238
I don't know. I don't have one.

574
00:30:10,358 --> 00:30:12,522
Well, you're putting him
and us at risk.

575
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:15,741
Just stay in the hotel
until we get back to L.A.

576
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:17,283
All right?

577
00:30:31,954 --> 00:30:33,214
Yes?

578
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:36,362
Tancredi got the location
of her shining knight.

579
00:30:36,482 --> 00:30:38,299
She may be heading there now.

580
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,306
Exemplary, Bagwell.

581
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:42,976
Thank you, sir. A deal's

582
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:45,160
A deal is a deal, right?
Not to be a broken record,

583
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,747
But all I ask...

584
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:59,685
KNOWLTON:
But I think we're making
some real progress, General.

585
00:30:59,805 --> 00:31:01,092
The Scofield/Burrows family

586
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:03,196
Would have been a formidable
asset to the Company,

587
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:07,066
But since his lapdog insists
on complicating matters,

588
00:31:07,134 --> 00:31:09,068
We move on.

589
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:10,937
General,
we can handle a lone female.

590
00:31:11,005 --> 00:31:13,373
If, indeed,That's what we're dealing with.

591
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,941
But it's my experience,

592
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:16,794
That with the one comes many.

593
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:18,778
Do it now, Doctor.

594
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:21,466
I need an hour. He just ate.
I don't want him to aspirate.

595
00:31:21,586 --> 00:31:23,149
Now,

596
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:25,184
Doctor.

597
00:31:25,252 --> 00:31:27,920
I want Scofield pliable
for transit.

598
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:30,189
Your vehicle arrives
in 20 minutes.

599
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:32,191
And if we can't revive him?

600
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:35,728
C'est la vie!

601
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:50,598
KNOWLTON: Michael, come out.
We need to talk.

602
00:31:58,805 --> 00:32:00,922
make yourself a helmet,pal

603
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:13,568
<i>SELF:
That's it!</i>

604
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:15,036
That's our guy!

605
00:32:15,103 --> 00:32:17,392
LINCOLN:
There's Tia right beside him.

606
00:32:17,512 --> 00:32:19,440
We've got to pull that image,
get it to the Company,

607
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:20,304
And have them match it.

608
00:32:20,424 --> 00:32:21,709
Where's Gretchen?

609
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:55,209
How'd you find me?

610
00:32:56,277 --> 00:32:57,845
Once I found your mug shot,

611
00:32:57,913 --> 00:33:02,350
It really wasn't that hard
getting your legit cell number.

612
00:33:03,986 --> 00:33:05,140
Well, now I'm here.

613
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,714
What do you want?

614
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:09,190
You never bothered to ask
back in Los Angeles--

615
00:33:09,258 --> 00:33:11,359
You were too busy
planning on killing me--

616
00:33:11,426 --> 00:33:13,194
But I actually worked
for the Company.

617
00:33:13,262 --> 00:33:15,062
I know who you are.

618
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,345
And I'll ask it again.

619
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:19,407
What do you want?

620
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:21,402
To solve your problems, Scott.

621
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,506
I mean, it is what gets me
up out of bed in the morning.

622
00:33:25,574 --> 00:33:28,158
You have a big problem,
and so does

623
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:29,899
Whoever it is
you're working for.

624
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:31,153
And you obviously know that

625
00:33:31,273 --> 00:33:33,201
Or you wouldn't have graced
me with your presence.

626
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:35,068
And you can make
that problem disappear?

627
00:33:35,188 --> 00:33:37,018
Quickly and completely.

628
00:33:37,085 --> 00:33:39,598
With an extra added bonus.

629
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,822
Crucial, I might add.

630
00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:44,279
I then feed the Company
a story

631
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,193
That has them looking elsewhere.

632
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:47,455
Meaning you're invaluable

633
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:49,797
And please don't kill you.
Yeah.

634
00:33:49,865 --> 00:33:52,099
Without the "please."

635
00:33:53,135 --> 00:33:54,357
How much?

636
00:33:54,477 --> 00:33:56,037
A lot.

637
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:57,634
And it's about to double
here in a second

638
00:33:57,754 --> 00:34:00,641
If you don't look at me
when I'm talking to you.

639
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,646
You go run and talk it over
with your boss.

640
00:34:05,714 --> 00:34:07,666
Call me with a number.

641
00:34:07,786 --> 00:34:10,551
I'm authorized to negotiate
on their behalf.

642
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,126
If you serve up

643
00:34:12,246 --> 00:34:15,957
Whoever's looking for us and get
the Company off our scent--

644
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:18,559
$10 million.

645
00:34:19,595 --> 00:34:21,845
Best and final offer.

646
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:24,832
Ask for a penny more
and I'll shoot you

647
00:34:24,952 --> 00:34:26,968
In the chest
and take my chances.

648
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:44,405
Take it easy, Michael.

649
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:46,757
This...

650
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:49,056
Is for your own good.

651
00:34:49,124 --> 00:34:49,956
(Thumping)
What was that?

652
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:51,692
Sounded like
the water heater.

653
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,895
Came from the bathroom.

654
00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:09,343
Pick it up!

655
00:35:12,307 --> 00:35:14,213
you ain't get out of here

656
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:19,020
Now give the doctor
his medicine.

657
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,196
No.

658
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,205
Bedpost.

659
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,476
FERGUSON:
In here, in the bedroom.

660
00:36:11,596 --> 00:36:12,273
Come on!

661
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,903
Uncuff me now!

662
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,565
That's great..

663
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,267
Thank you. Perfect. Let me know
if you hear anything else.

664
00:36:44,815 --> 00:36:46,068
Where the hell you been?

665
00:36:46,565 --> 00:36:47,934
Figuring this
whole thing out.

666
00:36:48,054 --> 00:36:49,512
I know who it is.

667
00:36:49,632 --> 00:36:50,248
The buyer.

668
00:36:50,368 --> 00:36:51,947
His name is Lawrence Wilcott
and he's been working

669
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:53,312
For the Company for ten years.

670
00:36:53,432 --> 00:36:54,443
How did you figure that out?

671
00:36:54,563 --> 00:36:55,889
I still have friends
on the inside,

672
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:57,213
And on the outside
of the Company.

673
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:59,024
I've been putting
together a profile,

674
00:36:59,144 --> 00:37:00,226
Narrowing down
the candidates.

675
00:37:00,346 --> 00:37:01,863
Wilcott got on a plane

676
00:37:01,983 --> 00:37:03,814
In Bogot?and flew
to the Bahamas yesterday

677
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:05,365
And then got on a boat.

678
00:37:05,485 --> 00:37:06,788
The guy who took Scylla
off us in L.A.?

679
00:37:06,978 --> 00:37:08,504
We pulled his image
off the security tape.

680
00:37:08,624 --> 00:37:10,444
Company's running a
recognition match right now.

681
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:12,328
That's great, but
that's going to take all day.

682
00:37:12,448 --> 00:37:14,736
Do you know where
he is right now? With Wilcott.

683
00:37:14,856 --> 00:37:15,859
We need to go now.

684
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:16,999
Because better yet,

685
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,168
I know where
Wilcott's staying.

686
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,742
Okay, we need to move
before Scylla does.

687
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:21,905
Let's go.

688
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,440
Let's go.

689
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,010
Turn around!

690
00:38:18,637 --> 00:38:20,320
Punch it, we gotta get out of here!

691
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,261
Michael, get in!

692
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,313
GRETCHEN:
He's rented out
the entire top floor.

693
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:38,382
Security at every point.

694
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,785
We might want to get
to an employee-- Bribe 'em.

695
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:44,407
Top level company
in a big glass building.

696
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:48,565
Nice and slow.

697
00:38:48,685 --> 00:38:50,214
Get your hands up.

698
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,901
This is everyone?

699
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,410
You whore.

700
00:39:00,747 --> 00:39:01,786
You're a whore,

701
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,140
And your mother
was a whore,

702
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:05,598
And her mother,
and your father

703
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,782
Used to turn tricks at a gas station,

704
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:09,251
'Cause he was a whore, too.

705
00:39:11,793 --> 00:39:13,654
Bye, Auntie.

706
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:22,895
GRETCHEN:
Sorry.

707
00:39:23,015 --> 00:39:23,820
Sorry, but right now
I want my life back

708
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,913
More than I want your money.

709
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:28,999
Where's Scylla?

710
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:31,581
Well, let's talk
about that, okay?

711
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:32,640
Let's. Where is it?

712
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,937
I can get it.

713
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:35,733
MAHONE:
No, he can't.

714
00:39:36,312 --> 00:39:38,611
He's stalling, Linc. It's gone.

715
00:39:38,731 --> 00:39:39,770
CARRUTH:
You're right.

716
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,465
And since all you guys
can kiss my ass,

717
00:39:41,585 --> 00:39:43,569
There's only one thing I want
to accomplish right now.

718
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,734
MAHONE:
Lawrence Wilcott?

719
00:39:52,854 --> 00:39:54,860
The whole floor of
the hotel rented out?

720
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:57,237
Made it up.

721
00:39:57,357 --> 00:39:59,118
You have no idea
who this guy was working for?

722
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:01,465
GRETCHEN:
No.

723
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,166
No clue.

724
00:40:03,633 --> 00:40:05,628
(Siren wailing)
We gotta pull the
pin here, guys.

725
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:07,704
Just because she switched
sides at the last second

726
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:10,433
Doesn't mean she wasn't going to
kill us two minutes ago, okay?

727
00:40:14,032 --> 00:40:16,766
Kill her. All right, we're
not leaving her here

728
00:40:16,886 --> 00:40:18,103
For the cops and we're
not taking her

729
00:40:18,223 --> 00:40:20,183
To the hospital.
Why?

730
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,852
I didn't let you
get slaughtered.

731
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:24,670
She's got a kid.

732
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,618
SELF:
So what?

733
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:26,933
Are we killing the kid?

734
00:40:27,053 --> 00:40:28,148
The kid doesn't even
know it's her mother.

735
00:40:28,268 --> 00:40:29,776
Come on, Linc,
pull the trigger. Do it.

736
00:40:29,896 --> 00:40:30,924
Her name's Emily--

737
00:40:31,044 --> 00:40:32,749
She's only eight years old.
Come on.

738
00:40:36,516 --> 00:40:38,322
Do it.

739
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:44,508
We're not them.

740
00:40:48,008 --> 00:40:49,145
You keep your mouth shut,

741
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:50,982
And you get to see your kid
in visitation.

742
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,371
I know what the General will do to me for talking.

743
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,057
Believe me.

744
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:58,782
I know him well.

745
00:41:01,981 --> 00:41:03,727
Are you serious?

746
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,763
LINCOLN:
Let's go,
let's go.

747
00:41:37,259 --> 00:41:39,529
What happened?

748
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:44,801
You haven't said a word.

749
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,577
I think my mother's alive.

750
00:42:11,993 --> 00:42:13,693
MAHONE:
That's his cell phone.
Answer it.

751
00:42:18,306 --> 00:42:19,852
Hello.

752
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,280
Hello.

753
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:29,579
Your boy's dead.

754
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,848
And now I'm coming after you.

755
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:34,317
Did you hear me?

756
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,355
Whoever you are,
I'm coming after you.

757
00:42:57,418 --> 00:42:58,108
Who was that?

758
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,512
It was my son--

759
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,214
Lincoln.
