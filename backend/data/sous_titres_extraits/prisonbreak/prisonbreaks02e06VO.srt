1
00:00:00,381 --> 00:00:01,703
<i>Previously on Prison Break...</i>

2
00:00:01,761 --> 00:00:02,947
I'm on it.

3
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:04,703
Is pursuing her
the best use of your time?

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,511
- It is.
- I'll let the President know.

5
00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:08,179
I contact the President directly.

6
00:00:08,427 --> 00:00:09,519
I'll contact her.

7
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,491
<i>No family with Patoshik? Nothing?</i>

8
00:00:17,572 --> 00:00:20,157
<i>Until about four years ago
when he killed them all.</i>

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,813
<i>Fernando Sucre,
he was in Las Vegas around 2:00.</i>

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,246
Out west,
just like Bagwell and Franklin.

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,578
You know D.B. Cooper?

12
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:28,845
The money's in Utah,

13
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:30,430
and they're all going to get it.

14
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:32,898
<i>You're one of them
Fox River boys.</i>

15
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:43,495
Come on. You got the map?

16
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,308
No. Someone else does.

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,895
Before I destroyed it,

18
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:49,396
I committed it
to my photographic memory.

19
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:51,079
I have the information,

20
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,027
you have the manual requirements
necessary to unearth

21
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:56,063
Westmoreland's buried booty.

22
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,528
- Get in.
- Okay.

23
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:01,363
Should be dead ahead.

24
00:01:03,506 --> 00:01:05,378
The bastards built over it.

25
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,321
It's gone.

26
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,363
We have to open up in 15 minutes.

27
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:25,095
- So, it doesn't matter. I dare you.
- I said... I said no.

28
00:02:25,284 --> 00:02:26,905
I dare you. Please?

29
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:03,269
The ranch is gone, Michael.

30
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,399
Well, the five million might not be.

31
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,487
And you gonna find it how?

32
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:12,213
What, you got a divining rod
tattooed on your ass?

33
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:14,200
I don't want to hear anything out
of your mouth

34
00:03:14,238 --> 00:03:15,859
other than what your photographic memory

35
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:18,079
spits out regarding that map.

36
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:20,617
You watch your tone with me, boy.

37
00:03:20,694 --> 00:03:22,044
I will watch you get tossed

38
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,745
to the side of the road
to fend for yourself, boy.

39
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:27,412
Because if you can't remember
where that silo was,

40
00:03:27,663 --> 00:03:28,859
you're worthless to us.

41
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:31,135
<i>Yo, let me out!</i>

42
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:32,130
Shut up!

43
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:33,403
The map!

44
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,955
Okay, okay, all right,
all right, all right...

45
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:37,112
<i>Let me out !</i>

46
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,422
The ranch...
The ranch was in the center of a box,

47
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:40,965
Sheep Road on one side,

48
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:42,699
Kokosing Road perpendicular.

49
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:46,542
In the center of the property
was the ranch house.

50
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,989
And the ranch house
was surrounded by trees.

51
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:04,941
Every tree here is a year old at most.

52
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,807
Except those.

53
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:11,700
Where is the silo?

54
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:17,585
In... side the trees.

55
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,592
I want to say on the left,

56
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,553
but that may have been a barn.

57
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,186
I remembered the best I could, gents,

58
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:26,818
but I didn't know this place

59
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,985
would now be smothered in tract homes,

60
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:32,056
so, you know, I'm sorry
that I'm not Rainman over here.

61
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:37,782
Alex Mahone, how are you?

62
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,985
Lyle Sands.

63
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,446
We've been briefed
on all the men at large.

64
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:43,931
The full force and resources
of the entire Salt Lake City

65
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:45,644
field office are at your disposal.

66
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:47,891
Thank you. Do you have those files
my office requested

67
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:49,098
on the D.B. Cooper case?

68
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,147
We're pulling them now.

69
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:52,698
And this is the D.B. Cooper case
from 30 years ago?

70
00:04:52,756 --> 00:04:55,971
Correct. If I can get those files
immediately, I'd appreciate it.

71
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:57,680
Hey, sorry, but I have to ask.

72
00:04:57,738 --> 00:04:59,647
Aren't you here for the Fox River Eight?

73
00:04:59,756 --> 00:05:01,948
I am, and they're here in Utah

74
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:06,118
to get D.B. Cooper's money,
so how about those files, Lyle?

75
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:12,096
This is stupid.

76
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:13,981
We're gonna get made out here.

77
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,949
Ah, shut it. I think I remember.

78
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:18,729
If I had to bet, I'd lay it all

79
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:20,832
on the silo being on the left
of the ranch house

80
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,144
inside the trees.

81
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:24,769
No. It's outside the trees.

82
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:26,802
Right there.

83
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:29,197
You see those two trees?

84
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:31,585
They're shorter than the rest.

85
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:33,988
They were all planted at the same time,

86
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,267
but those two didn't get
as much sunlight.

87
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,035
Something was in their way.

88
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:39,930
The silo.

89
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:43,590
Our money should be right there,
under that garage.

90
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:45,406
You better be right, boy.

91
00:05:45,758 --> 00:05:47,630
This isn't a high-end subdivision.

92
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:49,832
They slapped this place up overnight.

93
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,074
The silo's foundation
might still be there.

94
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:54,472
To save money, they probably just laid
the concrete

95
00:05:54,549 --> 00:05:56,432
for the garage floor right on top of it.

96
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:59,277
We'll dig straight down.
If we hit the foundation, we stay.

97
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:01,380
But if not, we go.

98
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:02,865
Let's do it.

99
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:08,690
Oh, man.

100
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:19,703
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver
to her temple won't fix.

101
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:31,004

Transcript : FRM Team

102
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,907
People die all the time, boys.

103
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,557
Five million dollars
comes once in a lifetime.

104
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:08,220
<i>Let me out of here, men! Come on!</i>

105
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:09,855
Well, we got to do something.

106
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:12,259
And it's not going
to involve hurting anyone.

107
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:19,349
I got an idea.

108
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,912
First, we're going
to need some supplies.

109
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:41,976
110% do not agree with this.

110
00:07:42,557 --> 00:07:45,089
Everybody's got to pitch in
to make this happen.

111
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:46,989
But back in the big house,

112
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:48,856
the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.

113
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:50,420
Which is why we're doing it here.

114
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:51,887
If he gets caught in town,

115
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,856
he ain't got a clue where the house is.

116
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:57,399
Besides, you're the one
we can't turn our backs on.

117
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,162
I could have died in there, man.

118
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:11,196
Well, guess what?
We need you to do something.

119
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:13,183
I need you to do something for me.

120
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:15,277
I want my cut of the money.

121
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:18,078
Well, we'll talk once
you prove we can trust you.

122
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,120
What do I got to do?

123
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:23,563
I want you to go back to that Garden
Center and get everything on this list.

124
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:26,256
Then gas up the car.

125
00:08:28,913 --> 00:08:31,035
And we'll meet you
right back here in an hour.

126
00:08:33,705 --> 00:08:35,673
- All right.
- And David...

127
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:40,449
Don't screw this up.

128
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:43,132
This ain't Fox River no more, man.

129
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:46,562
You're looking at the real deal now.

130
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:49,627
But I want my cut.

131
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:54,534
I'll be back in an hour.

132
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:01,499
Let's go.

133
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:05,267
Mistake.

134
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:07,364
Big mistake.

135
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,995
Oh, come on man!

136
00:10:06,468 --> 00:10:08,431
I am very glad to see you.

137
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:11,118
Did you walk here?

138
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:13,557
Well, no... it's...

139
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:15,491
it's... it's just a long story, man.

140
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:17,643
Thought you were meeting up
with your family.

141
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:19,786
I met a... I met a few roadblocks.

142
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:21,348
And you?

143
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:22,747
Yeah.

144
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,104
Let me guess... you're going to Tooele.

145
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,444
Yep.

146
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:31,656
Well, it looks like we're going
in the same direction.

147
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:34,140
Hopefully we're not too late.

148
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,292
Can I hitch a ride?

149
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,875
Very well...

150
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,143
I'll make it worth your while.

151
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:50,667
<i>Got some good news, sir.</i>

152
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,411
<i>Got our first tip on Patoshik.</i>

153
00:10:52,762 --> 00:10:56,195
Spotted at a burger joint
in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin.

154
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:58,302
Just hand it over
to local authorities for now.

155
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,212
The only thing
we're working today is Utah

156
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,331
<i>and D.B. Cooper.</i>

157
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:02,452
Got it.

158
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:05,258
Lyle.

159
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:08,442
There's a guy here
listed as having the only

160
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,912
D.B. Cooper bill ever found
in circulation, Harold Jenkins.

161
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:13,022
Yeah, D.B. bought gas from Jenkins

162
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:15,125
with a hundred
on the day of the hijacking.

163
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:18,310
We checked the serial numbers
and they matched.

164
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:19,881
You worked the case?

165
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:22,182
Fresh out of the academy.

166
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:23,877
And nobody's cracked it yet.

167
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,600
What makes you think that these escapees
know where the money is?

168
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:30,233
Because they may have been locked up
with the real D.B. Cooper.

169
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,375
This Jenkins from the gas station,
he still alive?

170
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,933
Should be. He was only 18 at the time.

171
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:36,435
Let's go say hi to him.

172
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:14,224
<i>We're sorry. Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.</i>

173
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:16,489
<i>Please check the number and dial again.</i>

174
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,299
<i>Do you have updates on Sara Tancredi?</i>

175
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:35,800
<i>I assume that's why you're here.</i>

176
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:37,026
<i>Yes.</i>

177
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:40,519
Scofield sent her a message
through the mail.

178
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:42,935
That phone number
that was disconnected...

179
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:47,018
You know, to be honest...

180
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,232
I was expecting to brief the President.

181
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,852
Yeah, about that...

182
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,346
Right now, as you can imagine,
Caroline's quite busy.

183
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:00,778
She's always been busy.

184
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,950
I've been working side-by-side
with her for 15 years.

185
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:06,133
Paul, she's the President
of the United States now.

186
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:09,009
Yes, Bill, and I helped put her there.

187
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:11,354
Well, if you'd like for her
to remain in office,

188
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:15,133
you'll take my advice
and just stay on the sidelines for now.

189
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:21,210
She needs to be completely insulated
from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows.

190
00:13:24,357 --> 00:13:25,671
I want to talk to her.

191
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:31,238
You report to me now, and only me.

192
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:34,368
You're not to try and contact
Caroline again without my approval,

193
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:37,159
and you don't show up here unannounced.

194
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:42,715
Finish the job
you were given. Get Burrows.

195
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:46,700
If you're telling me the road
to him leads through

196
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:49,252
Sara Tancredi, by all means, pursue it.

197
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:51,413
And once that's been accomplished

198
00:13:51,471 --> 00:13:52,976
and this whole thing goes away,

199
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:57,208
we'll go about transitioning
you back into Caroline's life.

200
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:02,522
Now do you have anything else on Sara?

201
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:05,388
The President has
unwavering faith in you.

202
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,014
Wants to make sure you go through

203
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:09,252
the Senate approval process
with your eyes wide open.

204
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:10,480
So what are we up against?

205
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:12,089
Key allies in the House and Senate

206
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:14,700
are Meyerhoff, Barnwell and Summerville.

207
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,417
We're counting on them
to sway the middle.

208
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,709
But who's the opposition?

209
00:14:17,748 --> 00:14:19,019
Senators Blake and Killoren

210
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,692
have openly vocalized
their opposition to you as VP.

211
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,600
Any indications to why?

212
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:27,717
Political payback for the President's
vote on the energy bill last month.

213
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:30,458
Took them by surprise
and they don't like surprises.

214
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:35,823
Dad.

215
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:37,878
Lance, this is, my father Frank.

216
00:14:38,005 --> 00:14:39,184
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

217
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:41,291
It's nothing to lose sleep over.

218
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:42,666
Frankly, the biggest issue

219
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,966
we have to address are the charges

220
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,230
facing your daughter.

221
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:48,494
Governor, are you with me?

222
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:51,340
Absolutely.

223
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:08,264
No, just chill, dawg.

224
00:15:08,998 --> 00:15:11,564
Once we roll out, we bounce out of town,

225
00:15:11,941 --> 00:15:14,102
we'll drop a dime
and they will find you.

226
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:16,244
Just be quiet. Just chill, man.

227
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:34,286
Woody?

228
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:37,745
Where you at?

229
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,433
I need Sheriff Williams.

230
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:00,608
Yeah, I'll hold.

231
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,965
When'd you learn about electricity?

232
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:28,500
I used to steal copper wiring
from transformer boxes.

233
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,264
Sell 'em on the docks, make a few bucks.

234
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:33,525
When you were at school, of course.

235
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:46,743
I was just looking, Pretty.

236
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:48,453
What's that old chestnut?

237
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:50,916
"I can look at the menu.
Doesn't mean I'm gonna eat."

238
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:54,501
We get in, we get the money,
we get out. That's it.

239
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,691
No, absolutely.

240
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,011
We're good.

241
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:12,744
Now it's just up to the kid.

242
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:20,147
Did you get everything?

243
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:21,978
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

244
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,821
What?

245
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:45,499
Nothing. It's cool. I handled it.

246
00:17:46,438 --> 00:17:47,429
What?

247
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:49,975
Okay.

248
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,537
Check it.

249
00:17:51,648 --> 00:17:54,465
This fool came in the shop.
He was acting all shady.

250
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:55,950
He got a bad vibe, so he picked up

251
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:58,485
his celly phone, he started
to make a call, so I popped him.

252
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:00,125
You did what?!

253
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:01,670
I hit him with a shovel, man!

254
00:18:01,736 --> 00:18:03,191
I didn't know what else to do!

255
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:05,949
So I just... I tied him up
and I put him in the back room

256
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:07,187
with that other country hick.

257
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,826
Here we go. Here we go.

258
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,609
I came through, you gimp!

259
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:12,085
Who was he calling?

260
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,075
The sheriff.

261
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,528
Man, man, I... I don't know, dude.

262
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:19,148
- It just, it set off...
- Did the call go through?

263
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:21,949
- Maybe, man...
- Did the call go through?

264
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:24,149
Yes. No, I don't know!

265
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:25,619
I don't know, man.

266
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:30,297
Yo, but I got the gear.

267
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:32,524
We got to move on this now.

268
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:35,258
Yes?

269
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:37,996
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

270
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:39,537
Is your electricity out?

271
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:42,730
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Harold Jenkins.

272
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:44,146
Right here.

273
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:47,545
Alexander Mahone, F.B.I.

274
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:49,876
I'm staying 50 feet away
from her at all times.

275
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:51,671
What the hell else does she want?

276
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:53,576
I'm not here about that.

277
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:56,094
What are you here for?

278
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:57,299
D.B. Cooper.

279
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,828
People still want to know
about that guy?

280
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:01,391
Unbelievable.

281
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:04,946
You worked the gas station
in American Fork where he filled up.

282
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,992
Yeah. Normal-looking guy.

283
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,664
Barely said a word.

284
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,879
There were some discrepancies
in the statement you filed 30 years ago.

285
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:17,418
In the report, it's noted
that you said he filled up at 7:00am,

286
00:19:17,746 --> 00:19:20,351
but on another occasion,
you said it was 7:00pm.

287
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:22,344
Which was it?

288
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:23,687
Both.

289
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:26,206
He gassed up twice?

290
00:19:26,495 --> 00:19:27,623
Yeah.

291
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:30,418
Full tanks both times?

292
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:32,218
Yeah.

293
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:33,683
Why?

294
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,420
<i>A systems... what?</i>

295
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,624
It's a systems diagnostics test.

296
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:40,528
Footage from our gopher cam

297
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:43,003
picked up exactly where
your line was corrupted.

298
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:46,359
And who corrupted it, you guys?

299
00:19:47,014 --> 00:19:48,031
Maybe.

300
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:50,498
All I know is my supervisor called
and said he wants

301
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,947
me and my crew to get over here

302
00:19:52,044 --> 00:19:54,436
and fix that problem
double-quick, double-time.

303
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:00,052
So... you're not
with the electric company?

304
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:01,324
No, ma'am.

305
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:03,432
Now feel free to call your company,

306
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,121
but I should tell you, all they'll do

307
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:07,783
is send over some tech,
maybe tomorrow if you're lucky.

308
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:11,065
And he'll spend a whole day
trying to find the problem

309
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:12,947
and another day trying to fix it.

310
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,756
But we're here right now

311
00:20:16,768 --> 00:20:18,794
and we're ready to turn
your juice back on.

312
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,806
My juice?

313
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:23,397
That's right.

314
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:27,120
And...

315
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,921
and that's your... crew?

316
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,142
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:41,117
Yeah, D.B. Cooper was driving
a 1965 Chevy Nova.

318
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:44,139
There's no record on file
that Cooper even had a car.

319
00:20:44,197 --> 00:20:45,498
But Charles Westmoreland did,

320
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:47,169
and the car
registered to him at the time

321
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:50,572
was a 1965 Chevy Nova
with a 16-gallon gas tank.

322
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,095
Back then, a Chevy that size
probably got what,

323
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:54,400
eight miles to the gallon?

324
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:57,405
Now, D.B. stopped
at the station in American Fork,

325
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,799
gassed up once early that day
and then came back

326
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,850
later that same night
and gassed up again.

327
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,999
<i>Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico,</i>

328
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:06,999
<i>which is a straight shot south,
drive off the main road</i>

329
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,299
<i>for an all-day detour?

330
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,701
- The money.
- Exactly.

331
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:13,900
Cooper/Westmoreland
jumped out of a plane with $5 million.

332
00:21:15,388 --> 00:21:17,372
But Westmoreland didn't have
the money on him

333
00:21:17,373 --> 00:21:18,321
when he was arrested.

334
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,099
He ditched it before he got caught.

335
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,499
Give me that Magic Marker.

336
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,699
From American Fork,
he couldn't have gone further

337
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,799
than 64 miles in any direction.

338
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,899
I want everything
you've got in that perimeter.

339
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,556
Those cons are in one of these towns,

340
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:33,086
and if there's so much as a cat missing
in one of them, I want to know about it.

341
00:21:36,938 --> 00:21:39,523
The defective cable
runs right beneath your garage.

342
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,550
We're gonna have to dig up
the floor to get to it.

343
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,350
Well, who's gonna pay for this

344
00:21:46,427 --> 00:21:49,100
and what about
the cleanup and the repair?

345
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,300
Well, the company will cover all costs.

346
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,799
We'll just dig a small trench,

347
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,948
once we're finished,
we'll re-lay the cement.

348
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:57,517
It'll look as good as new.

349
00:21:57,824 --> 00:21:59,522
How long is it going to take?

350
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,762
One way or another,
we'll be out of here today.

351
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,026
We really need to get started, ma'am.

352
00:22:07,052 --> 00:22:08,100
We wouldn't want

353
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,999
a pretty little thing like yourself

354
00:22:10,053 --> 00:22:12,021
sitting in the dark tonight, now do we?

355
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,830
Now that depends
on who I'm sitting with.

356
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:17,952
Touché.

357
00:22:22,096 --> 00:22:23,080
Fine,

358
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:26,600
that's okay, y'all go ahead
and do whatever y'all need to do.

359
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:29,250
Jeanette, the noise
might be substantial.

360
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,965
You might wanna take in
that tennis game after all.

361
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,786
Oh, no it's...

362
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,319
It's too hot for that now.

363
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,100
Plus, I'm gonna keep an eye on y'all
and make sure you don't steal anything.

364
00:22:40,314 --> 00:22:41,298
Ma'am.

365
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,287
- How are you?
- Good.

366
00:22:51,193 --> 00:22:52,399
All right, where's Tweener?

367
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:54,573
He's next door plugging
in the extension cord.

368
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:56,576
We're going to have to cut up
the cement.

369
00:22:57,136 --> 00:22:59,431
Yo, we gots company.

370
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,700
What's up, snowflake?

371
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,665
Well, as always, your timing is flawless.

372
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:14,999
I don't follow.

373
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:16,770
Well, let me try to explain it to you.

374
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:18,399
We're trying to run something here

375
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:20,785
and we can't have people
walking in off the street.

376
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:24,213
Okay, so you want us to leave

377
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:26,036
and then you can just mail us the check?

378
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:30,333
Sucre, I know you trust me.

379
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:32,900
And you know I'll cut you
in on that money.

380
00:23:33,597 --> 00:23:36,864
But the two of you being here right now
jeopardizes everything.

381
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,801
I'm not going nowhere.

382
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,106
I want my share of the money.

383
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,624
Wait a minute. Hold on, man.

384
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:45,303
Ain't we did this dance before?

385
00:23:45,774 --> 00:23:47,299
You know, I say I want in,

386
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:48,686
you say no.

387
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,398
Then I threaten to tell somebody
about what's going on here.

388
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,901
Then you decide to play nice

389
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,061
and then we're one big, happy family.

390
00:23:58,194 --> 00:24:01,011
Why don't we just stop wasting time,
all right?

391
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:07,900
Thank you.

392
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,141
Damn, man, you still alive?

393
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,684
And kickin', home boy.

394
00:24:21,742 --> 00:24:23,189
How'd you find us?

395
00:24:23,357 --> 00:24:25,287
Man, if I can do rapid deployment

396
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:28,914
of satellite communications
for Uncle Sam all over the world...

397
00:24:29,823 --> 00:24:31,800
How are you guys doing?

398
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:34,400
Who are you?

399
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,599
Who are they?

400
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,880
I had to call my supervisor.

401
00:24:38,403 --> 00:24:40,872
He sent them right over.
This job is a top priority.

402
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:44,793
We want to get this done
as quickly and efficiently as possible.

403
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,500
Well, Jeanette, like I said,

404
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,680
there's a lot of work to do
and it's going to be noisy.

405
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,900
Oh, drinks. I forgot to ask.

406
00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:06,375
We're good. Thanks.

407
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:18,295
Yo, man, this is not good.

408
00:25:18,702 --> 00:25:21,788
We got her up in our grill
checking in on us all the time.

409
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:24,213
The boy is right.

410
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:26,755
And since I can't dig,

411
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:29,769
I'll volunteer to keep her occupied.

412
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,617
You don't touch her.

413
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:34,566
Who are you, Sister Mary Francis?

414
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:36,474
I know how to play nice.

415
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:38,622
I'll be watching.

416
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,873
Billy? Is that you?

417
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,700
Billy? Is that you?

418
00:26:49,344 --> 00:26:50,500
Yep.

419
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,762
Thank you kindly.

420
00:27:01,612 --> 00:27:05,239
Well now,
how did you get out of working?

421
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:08,081
Union rules.

422
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:11,326
One crew member always has to supervise.

423
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,830
I'll check on them in a bit.

424
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,947
Lemonade?

425
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:28,713
More ice.

426
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,062
And I like mine with a little...

427
00:27:41,025 --> 00:27:46,060
But since you're on the clock,
I guess you can't...

428
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,213
join me?

429
00:27:50,623 --> 00:27:52,128
Just two fingers.

430
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,644
Been a while.

431
00:28:17,977 --> 00:28:19,192
Yeah?

432
00:28:24,881 --> 00:28:26,695
Whiskey always makes me feel...

433
00:28:27,761 --> 00:28:29,169
irascible.

434
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,055
I don't know what that means.

435
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:36,800
But I do like the sound of it.

436
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,930
Are you wearing Angel perfume?

437
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,598
I am.

438
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:59,047
That reminds you of an ex, I take it.

439
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:01,227
Yeah.

440
00:29:03,264 --> 00:29:06,178
Now, was that good memories...

441
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,014
or bad memories?

442
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:13,032
Both.

443
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:24,887
Did you talk to Maricruz?

444
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:26,582
I don't want to talk about it.

445
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,358
I got to get some water or something.

446
00:29:30,773 --> 00:29:32,973
Use the hose
on the other side of the house.

447
00:29:36,237 --> 00:29:37,240
Sucre...

448
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:40,582
Down the road, if you're in trouble,

449
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:42,995
europeangoldfinch.net.

450
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,821
It's what we can all use to communicate.

451
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:50,106
Post a note on the message board.

452
00:29:52,441 --> 00:29:53,733
What's it called?

453
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,682
Europeangoldfinch.net.

454
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,005
That's a board, right?

455
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:06,200
I got something.

456
00:30:13,304 --> 00:30:14,847
It's the silo's foundation.

457
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,459
Hells, yeah.

458
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,609
Thank you, Charles.

459
00:30:19,242 --> 00:30:20,882
We just need to find the edge

460
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,122
and dig underneath it.

461
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:25,400
We'll get the money...

462
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:27,574
hit the back roads.

463
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:31,900
What's wrong?

464
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,300
We gots to stop in Tooele first

465
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,494
and gas up the ride.

466
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,670
I thought you already did that.

467
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,600
Man,
when the Garden Center thing happened

468
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,900
I just forgot, all right?

469
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,887
I want you to go back into town...

470
00:30:47,534 --> 00:30:49,174
I want you to gas up that car.

471
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,899
Because I'm not driving around

472
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,400
with millions of dollars in the trunk,
do you understand?

473
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,089
Man, why do I gots to do it...?

474
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,201
Better check in on our friend.

475
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:16,790
...about the old time.

476
00:31:17,465 --> 00:31:18,855
Miss Tinsel Toes.

477
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,698
Billy?

478
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,240
Yeah.

479
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:38,154
I made you a sandwich.

480
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,749
Peanut butter and jelly
with the crusts cut off.

481
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,206
Just like you like.

482
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,149
I'm so glad you came back.

483
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,645
I don't want to say I told you so,

484
00:31:54,703 --> 00:31:57,446
but that was just not the girl for you.

485
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,277
Where is that?

486
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,805
Where's what, sweetheart?

487
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,400
That painting.

488
00:32:11,905 --> 00:32:13,000
It's Holland.

489
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,783
Where I grew up. You know that.

490
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,186
It's beautiful.

491
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,409
Oh, there's no place better.

492
00:32:21,681 --> 00:32:27,565
It's so peaceful, so...
So protected from this crazy world.

493
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,463
<i>- Operator.</i>
- Hello, Operator?

494
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,664
There's an intruder in my house...

495
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,512
<i>Hello, ma'am?</i>

496
00:32:53,602 --> 00:32:54,700
<i>Ma'am? Are you there?</i>

497
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:57,679
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

498
00:33:01,265 --> 00:33:03,665
<i>Heard you had some activity
in Tooele today.</i>

499
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:04,939
A bit.

500
00:33:04,974 --> 00:33:07,050
Don't see how it warrants
a visit from the F.B.I.

501
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,019
A stolen car was dumped
just outside of town,

502
00:33:09,077 --> 00:33:12,262
belonging to a woman who went to school
in St. Louis, am I getting that right?

503
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,573
Yes, sir.

504
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:16,800
And then here, the owner's
girlfriend reports him missing,

505
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,890
and then his buddy comes by to check it
out and he... goes missing, too.

506
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,399
Yeah, but Woody and Chet
have been known to drop everything

507
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,150
and go boar hunting
when the opportunity presents itself,

508
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,257
and they don't tell their old ladies.

509
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:35,783
Mr. Mahone, I'll bet you my lunch money
there's nothing amiss around here.

510
00:33:38,531 --> 00:33:41,237
But Woody's dad'll be
showing up soon with the keys

511
00:33:41,343 --> 00:33:42,869
and... you can look for yourself.

512
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,500
What are you doing?

513
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:52,600
Mr. Mahone.

514
00:34:07,563 --> 00:34:08,699
They're here.

515
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,052
Those escaped convicts.

516
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:11,305
They're here in town.

517
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:40,512
Who's there?

518
00:34:41,283 --> 00:34:42,808
It's the police, ma'am.

519
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:44,652
You okay?

520
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:46,085
Yes.

521
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:49,708
Can you tell me what happened?

522
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:51,657
There was this strange man.

523
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,472
I made him a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

524
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:57,648
I thought he was Billy.

525
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:05,519
And once the kids went to sleep,
we'd take a bath.

526
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,085
A long... bath.

527
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:12,902
And afterwards, I'd just sit there

528
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,773
and watch her...

529
00:35:15,123 --> 00:35:17,018
do her routine, see.

530
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,044
Rub a lotion on my hand

531
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,712
Dress up in her nighttime fineries.

532
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,995
Oh, you're killing me.

533
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,021
She had this spot on
her neck right... here.

534
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:37,400
Gave her goosebumps every time.

535
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:45,299
And that perfume...

536
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,664
My ex.

537
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:55,336
He was an accountant.

538
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,602
He was really buttoned up.

539
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:03,258
He was ram, damn, thank you, Sam.

540
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,800
Well, shame on him.

541
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:11,517
Why did it end

542
00:36:12,173 --> 00:36:14,600
with that lady you were talking about?

543
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:22,800
Just went out separate ways.

544
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,559
Do you know...

545
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:35,043
what I think the best cure is
for a broken heart?

546
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:38,256
Do tell.

547
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:41,907
Get back on the bike.

548
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:45,459
Whatever bike it is.

549
00:36:49,828 --> 00:36:51,565
Amen to that.

550
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:54,400
Speaking of.

551
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,840
Could you do something for me?

552
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,000
I'm certain of it.

553
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:07,400
Come here.

554
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,450
Only you have to be very discreet.

555
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,657
They don't come any discreter.

556
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,604
You know that... That big guy,

557
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,495
the strong guy that, that doesn't...

558
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,847
speak much?

559
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,926
Would you go in there

560
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:33,512
and ask him if he would like to have
a drink with me after he punches out?

561
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:35,300
Please.

562
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:40,411
You've just been playing me
this whole time, haven't you?

563
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,709
Come on.

564
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:43,962
Don't be like that.

565
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:48,246
Would you just go in
and ask your friend? Please?

566
00:38:10,696 --> 00:38:11,700
Hey, Dad.

567
00:38:11,752 --> 00:38:13,300
Sara. I've been trying to reach you.

568
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,176
Yeah. I've been meeting
with my defense attorneys all day.

569
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,900
You in Washington?

570
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yeah, but I'm coming back
on the next flight.

571
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:22,567
I thought you were going
to be there for a while.

572
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,100
No, no. Plans changed, okay?

573
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,844
<i>Sara, do you remember that guy
that I met with you in your apartment?</i>

574
00:38:28,186 --> 00:38:29,800
I want you to stay away from him.

575
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,065
Who? Lance? From my, my group?

576
00:38:32,244 --> 00:38:34,926
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
He is not who he says he is.

577
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,232
<i>I found out some other things, too.</i>

578
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,502
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>
- You were right.

579
00:38:42,414 --> 00:38:43,610
I got to go.

580
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,790
Just one second, sir.

581
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,299
How can I help you?

582
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,900
Just put $40 on three.

583
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:11,416
I'm sorry.

584
00:39:11,494 --> 00:39:13,693
- What pump was that?
- Three.

585
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,176
Oh, that one's been sticking.

586
00:39:15,292 --> 00:39:17,700
- Okay, well, then, I'll move the car.
- Ah, no. Don't...

587
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,495
Don't trouble yourself. I'll have the...

588
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:21,199
mechanic come out and pump it for you.

589
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:23,300
Hey, we got a customer waiting on three!

590
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,753
<i>All right, I'll be right there.</i>

591
00:39:24,802 --> 00:39:26,422
Look, man, I'm in a hurry, all right?

592
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:28,605
He'll be right out. Just one second.

593
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,616
Put your hands behind your head
and drop to your knees.

594
00:40:38,948 --> 00:40:39,952
Drop!

595
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:44,378
Where are they?

596
00:40:50,707 --> 00:40:54,006
Where... are... they?

597
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:57,899
All right, man.

598
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,812
One hand or not, I think Hillbilly
needs to be up ahead digging.

599
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:02,105
What you think?

600
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:11,752
Good man.

601
00:41:32,664 --> 00:41:34,600
What the hell are you doing up here?

602
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,195
I'm sorry, Jeannette.

603
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:39,105
I just didn't see you downstairs.

604
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,207
I heard something.
I apologize for barging in.

605
00:41:41,254 --> 00:41:44,824
Don't bother. She's got the hots
for the big, strong one.

606
00:41:44,886 --> 00:41:47,803
I'm sorry, Jeannette. We're gonna...
We're gonna get back to work now.

607
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,269
No, I think y'all are done,

608
00:41:49,462 --> 00:41:52,047
and I think y'all need to leave now.

609
00:41:52,836 --> 00:41:53,994
We're almost finished.

610
00:41:54,032 --> 00:41:55,942
No, I think you are finished, okay?

611
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:58,229
And I want you to leave my house now.

612
00:42:04,827 --> 00:42:06,139
Sucre, check it out.

613
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:19,900
Cop.

614
00:42:23,755 --> 00:42:25,047
Thank God.

615
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:33,299
Where are you going?

616
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:35,400
- Let her go!
- Oh, God.

617
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:38,135
She's our only way out of this, pretty.

618
00:42:41,337 --> 00:42:45,408
Don't say a word, you old whore,
or I'll cut your throat out.
