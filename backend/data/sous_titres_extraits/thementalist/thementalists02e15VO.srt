00:00:03,619 --> 00:00:07,269
Welcome to the 23rd annual
westing resort best chef challenge.

2
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,306
I'm Bertram Duesterberg, your host.

3
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,574
Our competing chefs today are...

4
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:18,809
First,

00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,735
from restaurant 182

6
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:21,979
in Sonoma,

7
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,689
The youngest winner ever

00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,648
of the <i>Schilling Palm de cuisine</i>,

00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:27,261
Chef Hannah Diaz.

10
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,408
From San Francisco, where they host

11
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,368
the acclaimed
public radio show <i>Two top</i>,

12
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:40,373
Chefs Arliss and Julia St. Germain.

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,632
Do you want the mousse?

14
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:51,884
Jeff?

15
00:00:53,773 --> 00:00:55,123
Trained in Paris,

16
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:58,548
he is executive chef
at <i>La Petite Maison</i>,

17
00:00:58,961 --> 00:01:00,059
Chef Adrien Ludo!

18
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:07,775
Where's my chives?

19
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,293
Let's go, people!

20
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:13,447
And first up
before our judges today...

21
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,259
Okay, let's move!

22
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:17,535
Come on, go, go!

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,940
Hurry up.

24
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:20,341
Jeffrey Barge.

25
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:28,405
Thank you.

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
My...

27
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:40,474
<i>My first, dish</i>

28
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:41,835
<i>today...</i>

29
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:43,518
<i>is...</i>

30
00:01:46,184 --> 00:01:47,184
<i>is...</i>

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,784
Is there a doctor in house, please?

32
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:00,941
<i>Somebody call 9-1-1!</i>

33
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,372
<i>Jeffrey!</i>

34
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,707
Somebody!

35
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:07,722
Say something!

36
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:09,378
Can you hear me?

37
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:23,187
- Anything from the deputy coroner?
- He can't tell us anything yet.

38
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:25,863
Tell him we need to know.
If this guy died of natural causes,

39
00:02:25,988 --> 00:02:27,019
we're going home.

40
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:28,803
- Why so grumpy?
- I'm not.

41
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:30,899
Why are we here?
We don't know if it's a murder.

42
00:02:31,024 --> 00:02:33,514
One of the chefs called her daddy
who's a state senator,

43
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,067
who called the AG,
who called the assistant AG,

44
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:38,142
who called me. So we're here.

45
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,750
I hate politics.

46
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,740
This might go quick.
Victim had a fistfight

47
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:44,020
- with the event organizer.
- Happy days.

48
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:47,541
I want to be clear.

49
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:50,809
What happened was sheerest accident.
I did nothing wrong.

50
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,463
Let's just stick to the facts.

51
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,717
You said you had a fight
with the victim. About what?

52
00:02:57,293 --> 00:02:58,135
Truffles.

53
00:02:58,626 --> 00:02:59,428
Truffles?

54
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:01,722
They're very pricey fungus.

55
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,145
I know what it is.

56
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,352
Jeffrey ordered a bundle
and he paid for them himself.

57
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,501
A few hours before the competition,
He couldn't find them.

58
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,342
He demanded replacements,
which would have cost thousands.

59
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:13,317
I said no.

60
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:16,386
He started yelling and then shoving.

61
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,532
- Naturally, I defended myself.
- Very gently, of course.

62
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,727
And then he, fell on his head?
Something like that?

63
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:25,362
- It's as I said it was an accident.
- We'll see.

64
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:28,165
Jeffrey sounds like a scrapper.
Quick with his fists?

65
00:03:28,965 --> 00:03:31,386
Not really.
He was a genius.

66
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:33,568
Genius can be noisy.

67
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:35,965
But he's never laid hands
on me before.

68
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:37,817
Genius, really?

69
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:45,081
- Is he good for it?
- Not sure yet. What's that?

70
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:46,933
Some <i>hors d'oeuvre</i>
they're handing out.

71
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:49,955
- Want one?
- I don't eat anything I can't identify.

72
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:52,439
Excuse me.
Is this the victim's dish?

73
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:02,205
Excuse me.

74
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:07,654
Pardon.

75
00:04:08,344 --> 00:04:10,594
No genius there. Way too much salt.

76
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:15,888
Dr. Steiner.

77
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:18,602
Long time, new threads. Sharp.

78
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,171
The move from Sacramento
has been quite pleasant.

79
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,497
Fine wine, lovely weather,
no Patrick Jane.

80
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:25,804
Or so I hoped.

81
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:27,683
Cheeky. Have you checked his mouth?

82
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:30,060
For a possible head injury?
I don't think so.

83
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:32,604
Don't be alarmed,
I am going to touch you.

84
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:35,067
Please, I am in the...

85
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:41,612
Excuse me.

86
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:43,899
What made you think to look there?

87
00:04:44,024 --> 00:04:46,843
Bad-tasting food
means bad taste buds.

88
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:49,497
So much for the head wound.

89
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:52,663
Duesterberg's off the hook.
He didn't die from a fall.

90
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:54,715
Let's huddle together,
divvy up the interviews.

91
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,128
What did kill him?

92
00:04:56,685 --> 00:04:57,685
Poison.

93
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,388
2x15
<i>Red Herring</i>

94
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,837
Preliminary test, came back.

95
00:05:13,962 --> 00:05:16,690
Deputy coroner says
that the poison is probably ricin.

96
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,442
Victim either ate it or drank it.

97
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,736
If it was airborne,
people would be dropping.

98
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,189
Ricin's easy enough to make.
Grind up some castor beans.

99
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:25,686
- Makes for a broad suspects pool.
- They tested the food.

100
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:27,206
There's no sign of it.

101
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:30,044
Ricin takes hours to work.
Must something he ingested a while ago.

102
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:32,081
No need to get your
stomach pumped then, huh?

103
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,082
Funny.

104
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,876
You search the room.
Test any liquid or food

105
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,244
that you find.

106
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,505
The victim's wife just arrived.

107
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:42,489
I'll handle it.
Talk to the other chefs.

108
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:45,582
Duesterberg says that the winner
gets 100 grand.

109
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,468
What are you doing?

110
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:57,575
Trying to get the taste of salty food
out of my mouth.

111
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,992
It's basically,
potential chocolate pudding.

112
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:03,913
- Very nice. You want some?
- No.

113
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:05,823
We have to talk
to the victim's wife.

114
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,165
Maybe she'll want some.

115
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:10,786
Comfort food.

116
00:06:12,397 --> 00:06:15,448
Jeffrey was a dear friend.
We'd known each other for years.

117
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:17,709
Which is why I had my father
bring you on.

118
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:19,542
We want to find out who did this.

119
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:22,523
Interesting that you called us in
before anyone knew It was poison.

120
00:06:22,705 --> 00:06:24,515
You know something
everyone else didn't?

121
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,677
I just knew
that something was wrong.

122
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:29,583
Now you're all in competition
for a large cash prize.

123
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,515
- Helps that one of you is dead.
- Helps?

124
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:34,785
We eat together and work together.
We're comrades.

125
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,537
Something to add, miss Diaz?

126
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:39,732
If we're all such comrades,

127
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:41,483
Why'd you steal Jeff's sous-chef?

128
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,759
Not true.

129
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,280
- Inquiries were made, that's all.
- Yeah, right.

130
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:49,025
- How'd you feel about the victim?
- I hated his guts.

131
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,076
Egotistical, manipulative,

132
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:53,568
Maybe half as good
as he thought he was.

133
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:55,622
Still make him twice
the chef that you are.

134
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,231
Go get another tatoo.

135
00:06:57,356 --> 00:06:58,588
Bite me, Julia.

136
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,420
The delivery guy says
he left truffles this morning,

137
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,038
then they vanished.

138
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:06,362
- Who stole them?
- Stealing truffles

139
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:08,343
- makes one of us a murderer?
- It's a start.

140
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,390
What?

141
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,933
That is exactly the kind of thing
that he would do.

142
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:17,936
He and Jeffrey
never really got along.

143
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:19,354
You fat bastard.

144
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,441
Truffles are very expensive.
And you wouldn't throw them out.

145
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:25,978
- Where does he keep his food?
- Down on the left side of the pantry.

146
00:07:26,103 --> 00:07:27,863
You know who would stop
at nothing to win?

147
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,458
Those two.

148
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,742
Ask them about the book deal
they've been chasing.

149
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:34,203
A competition prize
would help that, no?

150
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:40,459
Fine. Arrest me.

151
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:42,836
But I didn't steal
the truffles, okay?

152
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,130
I rescued them from a terrible fate.

153
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:46,482
I see.

154
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,650
Did Jeffrey have any problems
that you knew about,

155
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,249
personally or at work?

156
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,180
We were a problem.

157
00:08:00,743 --> 00:08:01,954
We're separated.

158
00:08:02,906 --> 00:08:06,777
- I haven't spoken to him in months.
- What was the breakup about?

159
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,045
What wasn't?

160
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:10,239
Drinking, mostly.

161
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:14,284
Occupational disease for chefs.
It's the pressure. It wants a release.

162
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,977
Don't listen to her,
whatever she says.

163
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:19,706
She hates Jeff.

164
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:21,914
- And you are?
- Victim's brother.

165
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,379
Cheekbones. Come on,
you can see that.

166
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:29,758
- Kevin, why don't we talk later?
- I don't think so, Abigail.

167
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,219
My brother was a freakin' genius.

168
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:35,931
You think anybody in my family
taught him how to cook? Please.

169
00:08:36,488 --> 00:08:38,903
He wanted to be a great chef,
and that's what he was.

170
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:40,396
Did it all by himself.

171
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:42,002
And you?

172
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:44,523
You were perfectly happy
to spend his money, weren't you?

173
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:49,050
Your brother was a great man.
He elevated himself, didn't he?

174
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:50,112
But you didn't.

175
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:53,031
That must've been cause
for some friction, I would think.

176
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,201
Did he leave you anything?

177
00:08:56,738 --> 00:08:58,937
Or did he leave it all
to the hated sister-in-law?

178
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:00,205
Money, restaurant...

179
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,197
- Why don't you step back?
- That's enough?

180
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:04,960
- You don't tell me what to do, okay?
- As you can see, drinking

181
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:09,132
- it runs in the family.
- See, that's how wrong you are.

182
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:10,944
Jeff was sober.

183
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,845
- He was in the program for 2 weeks.
- Right. I've heard that before.

184
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:19,683
- It's probably why he called.
- You said you hadn't talked to him.

185
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,718
I didn't talk.

186
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:25,098
Two weeks sober.
That's impressive.

187
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:28,317
And what else are you hiding
from us?

188
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:31,852
He called last night at 12:30.

189
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:35,982
- I hung up.
- What'd he say?

190
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
He said...

191
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:44,941
He said he was sorry.

192
00:09:57,819 --> 00:09:59,069
Test for ricin.

193
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:02,899
"Yellow" means positive,
"nothing" means...

194
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:05,646
nothing.

195
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:11,526
- This place is quite a mess.
- What do you think the intruder wanted?

196
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,746
Nobody was looking for anything.

197
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:15,822
Jeffrey did this himself.

198
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,619
You know this, how?

199
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:20,562
The punched-in mirror
is an act of self-hatred.

200
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,371
Plus, all these drawers are closed.

201
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:24,839
A thoughtful ransacker
would close maybe one,

202
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:26,917
- but all of them? No.
- Anyway.

203
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:30,045
- Room's clear. We're moving on.
- That's nice.

204
00:10:33,273 --> 00:10:35,300
Except you're not. What's up?

205
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:38,818
Jeffrey was recently sober,
but acting erratically.

206
00:10:38,943 --> 00:10:40,347
Demolishing his room,

207
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:44,063
picking fistfights, calling his ex-wife
in the middle of the night.

208
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:45,936
- You know what that's called?
- Relapse?

209
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,090
And an addict on a relapse
will hide his stash.

210
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:03,084
What better way to poison a drunk
than through his drink?

211
00:11:03,502 --> 00:11:05,455
- Let's check it out.
- Let's.

212
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:14,641
- There we go.
- Hold the applause.

213
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:20,220
Bingo.

214
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,819
Poison gin.

215
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,298
A smart way to eliminate a rival.

216
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:33,984
But not the act of a gentleman.

217
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:36,106
Is it...

218
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:37,904
<i>Monsieur</i> Ludo?

219
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,408
You joking?

220
00:11:43,758 --> 00:11:44,858
Take him in.

221
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:47,581
This is not right.

222
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:49,333
I've done nothing.

223
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,489
- I've done nothing.
- Hang on.

224
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,968
- She's the one we need to talk to.
- Me?

225
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,556
You should've seen your reaction
when I accused Ludo.

226
00:11:58,681 --> 00:11:59,781
Pure relief.

227
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,370
Come on, please.
At least

228
00:12:02,495 --> 00:12:03,945
attempt denying it.

229
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,391
- I didn't do it.
- She's the one.

230
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,561
Thank you.

231
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:12,143
<i>Merci.</i>

232
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:18,445
Why would I want to kill Jeffrey?

233
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,047
Winning a contest would do a lot

234
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,112
for a young woman
trying to prove herself.

235
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:24,534
- I don't have anything to prove.
- You're a good cook.

236
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,412
Making ricin out of castor beans
wouldn't be hard.

237
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,456
But I didn't.

238
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:32,309
<i>Take a look of this.</i>

239
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:35,129
<i>That's your credit card statement.</i>

240
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:37,864
<i>You bought gin.</i>

241
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,791
<i>I'm over 21.</i>

242
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,273
<i>It's not a crime.</i>

243
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:44,012
<i>You just happened to buy the same gin
we found at the victim?</i>

244
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:45,569
Can I go or what?

245
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:49,289
We've enough to charge you
with murder right now.

246
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:51,728
You need to talk to us,
tell us your side of the story.

247
00:12:58,227 --> 00:12:59,227
<i>I'm 28.</i>

248
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:01,234
<i>I run my own kitchen.</i>

249
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:04,487
I don't have any...

250
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:09,109
Food channel connections,
no cookbook with my name on it.

251
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:11,972
The westing is my way up.

252
00:13:14,683 --> 00:13:16,378
Jeffrey was the one to beat.

253
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:19,106
We all knew it.

254
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:21,758
So I figured,

255
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:23,927
get him a drink.

256
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:25,470
Why not?

257
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,045
Level the playing field.

258
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,406
So yeah, I bought him the gin.

259
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:32,644
But I have no idea
how the ricin got in there.

260
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:33,937
Okay.

261
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:36,976
I just tried to get him drunk,
that's all.

262
00:13:37,365 --> 00:13:38,233
No poison.

263
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:45,952
Without anything else,
we can't hold her.

264
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,798
What do you got?

265
00:13:47,923 --> 00:13:50,466
Jeffrey's phone records.
Confirmed the call with his wife.

266
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:55,292
- How long did they talk?
- About five seconds.

267
00:13:55,673 --> 00:13:57,586
Guess she did hang up.
There's a second call

268
00:13:57,956 --> 00:14:00,088
at 2:00 AM.
That one lasted over an hour.

269
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:02,737
- Who'd he call?
- His restaurant.

270
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:11,395
Miss Barge, you have a minute?

271
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:13,566
Sure. What's up?

272
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:14,925
Money troubles?

273
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:16,396
How'd you guess?

274
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,731
It's a restaurant.
They always have money troubles.

275
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:21,326
This restaurant's drowning in debt.

276
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,072
Jeffrey was driving
this place off a cliff.

277
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,280
It was all about the food.

278
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,096
This is Eliza Greene.
Jeffrey's sous-chef.

279
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:33,215
She's keeping things afloat
while I get my bearings...

280
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:35,957
Now that I own a failing restaurant.

281
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:39,096
Sorry.

282
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:42,542
People would say
that the place is failing,

283
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:44,633
And... Jeffrey would say,

284
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:46,872
"Yes, but failing with style."

285
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,652
You're the one the others
wanted to hire.

286
00:14:49,777 --> 00:14:51,056
You must be very good.

287
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:54,100
- I guess. I wouldn't know.
- False modesty?

288
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:56,871
Jeffrey called the restaurant
last night at 2:00 am,

289
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,897
- do you know who he spoke to?
- Me.

290
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:01,399
He was considering changing the menu

291
00:15:01,524 --> 00:15:03,474
for the contest,
wanted to talk about it.

292
00:15:03,743 --> 00:15:05,528
Couldn't that have waited
till the morning?

293
00:15:06,898 --> 00:15:10,616
That was just Jeff being Jeff.
He was always after perfection.

294
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:14,204
Irritating, a phone call like that
when you're on your way home, isn't it?

295
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:15,420
Not at all.

296
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:17,787
If you want to make something great,

297
00:15:18,273 --> 00:15:19,365
that's the job.

298
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:23,306
You should get these deposits posted,
or the checks are gonna bounce.

299
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,820
Thanks for your time.

300
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,259
- Thank you.
- Night.

301
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:29,115
Bye.

302
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,311
Bye. Bye.

303
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:37,227
Where are my keys?

304
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:39,770
You picked my pocket?

305
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,145
My turn to drive.

306
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,615
Don't be such an old lady. Get in.

307
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:47,303
Your fears are groundless.

308
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,481
You're right. The car has air bags.

309
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:05,353
Bad move.

310
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:25,771
- Victim's brother?
- Kevin.

311
00:16:28,432 --> 00:16:30,946
I can't tell you how happy I am
that wasn't my car.

312
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:41,979
<i>You're out of your freakin' mind.</i>
<i>I would never, ever harm my brother,</i>

313
00:16:42,104 --> 00:16:43,104
<i>ever.</i>

314
00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:47,120
You assaulted and robbed a girl,
who ran your brother's restaurant.

315
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,090
You don't think that makes you
a little suspicious?

316
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:52,760
It had nothing to do
with what happened.

317
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:54,219
I don't believe you.

318
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:56,878
I can tell you why I went
after the money,

319
00:16:57,003 --> 00:16:58,557
but I need some guarantees.

320
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:01,685
So we're negotiating now, are we?

321
00:17:02,165 --> 00:17:04,088
<i>I have valuable information.</i>

322
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:05,898
<i>I can help you.</i>

323
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:10,248
But you're not gonna tell us anything
unless we cut you a deal?

324
00:17:14,662 --> 00:17:16,994
We're talking
about your brother here.

325
00:17:17,272 --> 00:17:18,450
That's pretty low.

326
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:24,331
You know what?
You go to jail.

327
00:17:24,456 --> 00:17:27,586
You'll have plenty of time to think how
you could've done things differently.

328
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:32,884
Wait.

329
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:37,689
Sean Horlick.

330
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,160
Jeff owed him money.

331
00:17:40,455 --> 00:17:42,994
He needed it for the restaurant.
Guy's a loan shark.

332
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:45,451
I actually put them in touch
five months ago.

333
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,542
I get a call yesterday from Horlick,

334
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,736
and he says unless
I want to end up like Jeff,

335
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:52,611
I'd better get him
the money he owed.

336
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,739
So you rob your dead brother's wife?

337
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:57,602
She was always trying
to turn Jeff against me.

338
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,576
Said I was
a bad influence or somethin'.

339
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,132
Imagine that, huh?

340
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:02,455
Crazy.

341
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,959
I knew their deposit schedule,
and they don't keep a gun.

342
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:09,652
I figured she screwed me before,

343
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:11,547
I screw her back.

344
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:13,601
Sean Horlick.

345
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,342
What else do you know about him?

346
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,387
Fraud, racketeering, extortion,

347
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,355
couple of violent
crimes sprinkled in.

348
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,680
Charges never seem to stick.
Horlick's smart.

349
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:23,919
- Track him down. Take Rigsby.
- Okay.

350
00:18:24,044 --> 00:18:26,115
Cho, look into Jeffrey's restaurant.

351
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:28,838
The financial records,
see who else he owed money to.

352
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,608
I'll come with.

353
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:33,315
I'm a mite peckish.

354
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,440
What does that mean?

355
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:38,331
It means I'm hungry.

356
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:42,055
I can't read this.

357
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:47,941
That says,
"March '09 accounts payable."

358
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,798
This... this is just ridiculous.
This is delicious.

359
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:55,513
Thank you.

360
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:58,774
Let's hope you can keep the quality up
with the new boss.

361
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:01,785
Abigail seems more concerned
about the money than the menu.

362
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,468
Won't be a problem, I promise.

363
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:16,794
- For God's sake. Did you try this?
- You don't like Abigail much, do you?

364
00:19:17,921 --> 00:19:18,990
Do it over.

365
00:19:20,588 --> 00:19:22,670
You're obviously very talented.
You should've

366
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,463
struck out on your own
a long time ago, unless there was

367
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:26,760
some reason to stay.

368
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:29,934
I did try to strike out
on my own, actually,

369
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,711
Couple months ago.

370
00:19:31,992 --> 00:19:33,497
- Failed with style?
- I wish.

371
00:19:33,776 --> 00:19:36,156
State wouldn't
grant me my liquor license.

372
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:38,759
No license, no investors, so...

373
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:41,228
Luckily, Jeffrey took me back again.

374
00:19:41,353 --> 00:19:44,476
So why not hook up with him?
He was separated, available.

375
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:49,061
I've never liked waiting in lines.

376
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:52,688
Excuse me.
I've got prep work to do.

377
00:19:52,813 --> 00:19:54,107
Thanks for lunch.

378
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:56,820
I didn't see any other loans
on the books. Good thing.

379
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,203
Jeffrey wasn't taking a salary
the last few months.

380
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:00,443
He wasn't?

381
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,824
We'll have to make a stop
on the way back.

382
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,961
Magic brownies.

383
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,507
This is more...
Clean-cut than I'd expected.

384
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:19,159
Medical pot, it's a...

385
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,344
- growth industry.
- First timers?

386
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:23,596
I'll tell you
that I tell all the newbies:

387
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:26,504
Go for today's specials.
They're a couple bucks more

388
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:29,529
but between us,
it's the freshest herb we got.

389
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,532
Plus it's locally grown.
Who doesn't wanna support local formers?

390
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:33,940
Where's your boss?

391
00:20:35,806 --> 00:20:37,735
Mr. Horlick? I couldn't say.

392
00:20:38,316 --> 00:20:40,780
Our permits are
all up to date by the book, 100%.

393
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,846
Mr. Horlick's a suspect
in a murder investigation,

394
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:46,202
So if you know where he is,
you should tell us.

395
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,454
There a problem here?

396
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:51,791
We're here about Jeffrey Barge.

397
00:20:52,113 --> 00:20:53,113
Who?

398
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:55,954
Yeah, Jeff. Sure.

399
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,423
- What about him?
- He died yesterday.

400
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,309
I know.
I saw that on the news.

401
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:03,052
Heavy.

402
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:05,847
Boom, he's here.
He's gone.

403
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:09,301
And how about that? Life?

404
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:11,394
We know you lent him money.

405
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,022
How do you know that?
I mean, who says?

406
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,138
- I'll take that as a "Yes."
- Frosty one, aren't we?

407
00:21:18,158 --> 00:21:20,194
- I like it.
- You like jail, too?

408
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,532
That's right. Kevin told us everything.
It's about time you did as well.

409
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Fine.

410
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:30,068
I called him about the money.

411
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:33,027
Obviously, he drew some sinister
and incorrect implications

412
00:21:33,152 --> 00:21:34,542
from our conversation,

413
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,045
but it was
all a big misunderstanding.

414
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:39,936
Chalk it up to my...
poor communication skills.

415
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:42,274
- I think you communicate very well.
- Yes, you do.

416
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:45,033
You've "Sleazebag" written
across your forehead in big letters.

417
00:21:45,158 --> 00:21:46,560
Why would I kill Jeff?

418
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:48,683
You don't off someone
who can pay you back.

419
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,683
The guy practically lived
at the Ritz.

420
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,923
What are you talking about?
He was broke.

421
00:21:53,048 --> 00:21:55,052
That's what he wanted me
to think, too.

422
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:57,369
I got a buddy
who works security at the hotel.

423
00:21:57,494 --> 00:22:00,068
He saw the deadbeat staying there
a bunch of times.

424
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:03,289
You don't stay there
unless your pockets are padded.

425
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:07,939
I'd like to take you sometime,
thaw you out a little bit.

426
00:22:08,513 --> 00:22:10,063
Yeah, that'll happen.

427
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:15,191
We got something.

428
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,803
Jeffrey stayed at the Ritz
over a dozen times in the past 2 months,

429
00:22:18,928 --> 00:22:20,338
paid in cash every time.

430
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,915
Looks like an affair.

431
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,225
But Jeffrey and his wife
lived separate lives.

432
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,052
Why would he care
if there was a record?

433
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:28,862
- Maybe his partner cared.
- Because she's married.

434
00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:30,691
She had the money.
She paid for the room,

435
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,892
but in cash
so her husband wouldn't find out.

436
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:35,050
Keep digging.
Find out who the woman was.

437
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,886
Next round's tomorrow?

438
00:22:47,812 --> 00:22:48,992
Keep workin'.

439
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:51,889
- You'll get there.
- <i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

440
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:54,351
Watch it.

441
00:22:55,327 --> 00:22:56,676
Careful, careful.

442
00:22:59,803 --> 00:23:01,815
That smells good. What is that?

443
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,506
Knock yourself out.

444
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:06,426
It's not for the competition.
It's my lunch.

445
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,473
- I'd advise against that.
- Don't listen to him. He's a coward.

446
00:23:09,642 --> 00:23:11,806
- Is he?
- It's the red Savina pepper.

447
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:14,100
- It's kinda spicy.
- Kind of?

448
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:16,978
It's the hottest pepper known to man.
Trust me. Leave it alone.

449
00:23:17,344 --> 00:23:19,147
It's good on everything:
meat, fruit,

450
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,315
soups.

451
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,026
Not that any of the people
would know. Babies.

452
00:23:23,538 --> 00:23:26,062
- I'd love a little try of that.
- Mr. Jane,

453
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:30,191
our chefs are extremely busy.
Would you mind coming back another time?

454
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,994
You're quite the ghoul,
aren't you, Duesterberg?

455
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,330
Dragging on this meaningless contest
after a man has been killed.

456
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,068
This contest, Mr. Jane,
is an affirmation of life.

457
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:43,504
It's a testament
that appetite still exists,

458
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,545
- even in the face of death.
- And you need the money.

459
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,273
- Time for you to go.
- Fine.

460
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:51,163
I have all the information I need,
thank you very much.

461
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,514
He lies. He hasn't asked
one single question.

462
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:55,909
Why would I?
I can learn everything I need to learn

463
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,884
from watching you all cook.

464
00:23:58,443 --> 00:23:59,604
You, for example.

465
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:03,086
Use lemon to the point of excess.

466
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:06,094
Tart, aggressive flavors,

467
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:09,614
sublimated aggression toward
an important figure in your life.

468
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:12,950
You're a daddy's girl,
so I'm gonna go with mother.

469
00:24:13,075 --> 00:24:14,744
No, let me correct that...

470
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:17,457
Stepmother.

471
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:19,794
Ludo!

472
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,759
You were adopted, no?

473
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,742
No. I wasn't.

474
00:24:24,494 --> 00:24:25,718
Took a shot.

475
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:26,843
Moving on.

476
00:24:27,255 --> 00:24:29,050
You were having an affair
with Jeffrey.

477
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:30,415
Weren't you?

478
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,597
- What?
- You can tell all this by the food?

479
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:36,682
They cooked together every day,

480
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,434
yet their kitchen rhythms are off.

481
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:42,438
They're bashing into each other,
getting in each other's way.

482
00:24:42,906 --> 00:24:44,995
You're not paying enough
attention to her.

483
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,610
- No wonder she strayed.
- That's nonsense.

484
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:48,924
Really?

485
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:50,887
Why did your wife have her father

486
00:24:51,012 --> 00:24:53,656
put the state's best police force
on this case?

487
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:54,867
Look at her.

488
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,536
She's made no attempt.

489
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,701
No attempt at all to deny it.

490
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:01,117
Is it true?

491
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,844
I take it you know about Julia's affair
with the victim now.

492
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:05,962
Roger that.

493
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,970
Jeff and I got together
about five months ago,

494
00:25:15,095 --> 00:25:17,245
after he separated from his wife.

495
00:25:18,827 --> 00:25:19,892
But he ended it.

496
00:25:22,183 --> 00:25:23,183
When?

497
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:25,731
The night before he died.

498
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:28,234
I went to his room at the resort.

499
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:29,595
He was drunk.

500
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,524
I thought he was trying to get sober,
but I guess not that night.

501
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:35,950
Jeff didn't handle stress well.

502
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:38,333
Must have made you angry.

503
00:25:40,477 --> 00:25:41,653
I accepted it.

504
00:25:42,604 --> 00:25:43,676
I loved him.

505
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,826
But he was a drunk.

506
00:25:46,168 --> 00:25:47,253
Better left alone.

507
00:25:47,948 --> 00:25:48,921
Wise of you.

508
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:52,175
I asked for a glass of water.

509
00:25:52,412 --> 00:25:54,593
I'm sure it'll be here in a minute.

510
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,659
You think I'm entitled
and snippy and rich.

511
00:26:00,413 --> 00:26:03,519
My father's a senator. I don't have
to take crap from people like you.

512
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:07,362
I'm just trying to figure out
who killed Jeffrey Barge, that's all.

513
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:10,943
- I didn't kill him.
- I don't believe you, Julia, not yet.

514
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:13,714
I really need

515
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,644
that glass of water.

516
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:16,930
I'll get it.

517
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:19,118
We still have
a few more questions for you.

518
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:23,271
9-1-1.

519
00:26:27,276 --> 00:26:28,294
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

520
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:30,838
Are you on medication?

521
00:26:31,517 --> 00:26:32,517
Come on.

522
00:26:32,836 --> 00:26:33,633
Answer.

523
00:26:40,905 --> 00:26:41,905
Yes.

524
00:26:43,342 --> 00:26:44,342
I know.

525
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:48,143
Mr. Attorney general, sir, I...

526
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,192
I understand completely.

527
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,119
I will.

528
00:26:53,858 --> 00:26:55,112
She's straightening.

529
00:26:58,036 --> 00:26:59,033
Absolutely.

530
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,080
Coroner's office says
it was ricin poisoning,

531
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,790
Just like Jeffrey. Guess they were both
poisoned at the hotel.

532
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,501
Crap. Is she straightening?

533
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,337
Victim was a senator's daughter.
A.G. must be livid.

534
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:14,251
It's not our fault.
Ricin takes hours to kick in.

535
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:17,176
- Tell it to the A.G.
- What's going on with the search?

536
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,596
The sheriffis on it, taking food
and liquid off the resort to be tested.

537
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:23,557
Resort, the contest,
it's all been shut down.

538
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:27,055
News flash.
The A.G. wants this case closed now.

539
00:27:27,363 --> 00:27:30,022
We've got 2 dead married lovers.
I'd say the killer's a spouse.

540
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,560
Let's start with that.

541
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,736
There he is.

542
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:39,651
Cinnamon, sage and coriander,

543
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:42,260
a squeeze of lemon, then butter.

544
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,013
No, no garlic.

545
00:27:45,928 --> 00:27:47,290
Not at all. Ciao.

546
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,194
Idiot.

547
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:52,086
Your wife just died,
and you're talking about recipes?

548
00:27:52,434 --> 00:27:53,462
What can I do?

549
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,381
We'd like to discuss
your wife's estate.

550
00:27:56,151 --> 00:27:57,057
Yes.

551
00:27:57,182 --> 00:27:58,182
Sorry.

552
00:27:58,354 --> 00:27:59,807
Idiots. Garlic.

553
00:28:00,964 --> 00:28:02,596
So Julia had money. So what?

554
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,640
You stand to inherit
all of it, right?

555
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,843
Yes. So?

556
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,295
She and her lover are dead.
Killed the same way.

557
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,827
You're our number one guy.

558
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:11,272
Or number two, I'd say.

559
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,690
- Have you talked to Abigail yet?
- Why?

560
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,178
Ask her about the fight
she and Jeffrey had

561
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:19,196
at the fairplex market two weeks ago.
It was quite a scene

562
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,656
You mention this earlier?

563
00:28:20,983 --> 00:28:23,492
Interrogation focuses the mind.
What can I say?

564
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,704
Except you're lying.
Jeffrey hadn't seen his wife in months.

565
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,069
If Abigail said that,

566
00:28:29,561 --> 00:28:30,721
she's the liar.

567
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,503
The market Clerk
confirmed the story.

568
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,033
You were in contact with Jeff,
and you were fighting.

569
00:28:37,158 --> 00:28:39,717
I didn't kill Jeffrey,
if that's what you're getting at.

570
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:43,304
I didn't even know
about this thing with Julia.

571
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:46,807
- What were you fighting about?
- You've really changed your look.

572
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:50,561
Haven't you? Not that you don't look
lovely now. It's just

573
00:28:51,592 --> 00:28:52,792
this old look,

574
00:28:53,387 --> 00:28:54,732
accentuated your assets.

575
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:56,901
My husband just died, okay?

576
00:28:57,282 --> 00:28:59,820
You're still putting in time
with the makeup though, I see.

577
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,989
So appearance is important to you.

578
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,620
What are you getting at?
She's put on 5 or 6 pounds,

579
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:06,535
doesn't fit
into the sleek outfits anymore,

580
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,746
So she wears this. She's pregnant.

581
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,623
Right? Congratulations.

582
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:12,571
First trimester.

583
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:14,068
Jeff's child,

584
00:29:14,223 --> 00:29:15,002
right?

585
00:29:17,524 --> 00:29:18,524
Right?

586
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,420
A few months ago, he

587
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:25,749
came by to pick up some stuff.

588
00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:30,211
Things happened.

589
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,816
And two weeks ago,
I took a pregnancy test.

590
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:39,026
How did he take
the news of fatherhood?

591
00:29:43,506 --> 00:29:45,032
That's what you were fighting.

592
00:29:46,897 --> 00:29:48,577
I don't know why I didn't tell you.

593
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:51,799
I've been...

594
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:55,292
Confused.

595
00:29:57,794 --> 00:29:59,334
My parents don't even know.

596
00:30:02,753 --> 00:30:04,543
Do us a favor, Abigail.

597
00:30:05,481 --> 00:30:08,247
We're gonna need to search your house.
Save us all some time

598
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:10,028
and grant us permission.

599
00:30:16,634 --> 00:30:18,232
Did you know a full-grown elephant

600
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,652
can eat up to 495 pounds
of food per day?

601
00:30:22,084 --> 00:30:24,170
Could you at least
pretend to be helping?

602
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,671
Got somethin'.

603
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,510
Found this in the garage.

604
00:30:28,815 --> 00:30:29,785
Nice work.

605
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:32,355
And we care
about a bag of beans why?

606
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,432
Castor beans.
They're used to make ricin.

607
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,319
Of course.

608
00:30:38,267 --> 00:30:39,503
Naughty Abigail.

609
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,683
We found traces of ricin
in Julia's favorite red pepper.

610
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,354
Her death was not accidental.

611
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,374
Both her and your husband
were specifically targeted.

612
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:55,506
Together with the castor beans we found,
It's not looking good for you.

613
00:30:55,631 --> 00:30:59,001
My client denies any
involvement in these killings.

614
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:02,201
She bore no malice towards her
husband or Ms. St. Germain.

615
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,048
No malice toward her alcoholic

616
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:06,614
and fiscally irresponsible
husband and his lover?

617
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:09,325
She was not aware of
that relationship,

618
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:12,369
Nor did she ever set
foot in that resort.

619
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,600
- Which you can't prove.
- I didn't do this...

620
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:16,499
How do you explain the castor beans?

621
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,792
- She had no knowledge of them.
- That's convenient.

622
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,460
This is a grieving widow...

623
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,339
a pregnant, grieving widow.

624
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:26,675
You think that a jury
is going to convict on this

625
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:28,802
circumstantial traif?

626
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,349
We can make this stick,
and you know it.

627
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:34,183
Believe me,
you will feel much better if you...

628
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,447
Would you excuse me?

629
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,060
What?

630
00:31:43,893 --> 00:31:45,994
- What emergency?
- Follow me.

631
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:49,099
I don't really have time for this.
I was working on getting a confession.

632
00:31:49,224 --> 00:31:50,951
- This is more important.
- What is?

633
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:54,662
Agents, welcome. It's a relief to know
that the killer has been caught.

634
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:56,121
Just doing our job.

635
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,846
Thank you for coming
to this little memorial dinner

636
00:31:58,971 --> 00:31:59,750
Dinner?

637
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:01,916
Honoring Jeffrey and Julia.

638
00:32:03,045 --> 00:32:04,307
We're having dinner?

639
00:32:04,432 --> 00:32:05,432
Gotta eat.

640
00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:10,271
I certainly hope you enjoy yourself.

641
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:11,912
It should be delicious.

642
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:13,146
Excuse me.

643
00:32:13,595 --> 00:32:15,509
Those serviettes are horrifying.

644
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:17,893
You have five seconds to
tell me what's going on.

645
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,517
First, we need a drink.

646
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:21,233
Is it that bad?

647
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,586
It's lovely.

648
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:30,447
Not bad, Ludo.

649
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:34,187
- Can we get the bowls ready?
- You shouldn't be here.

650
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:37,105
You're probably right.
You gonna make me leave?

651
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:39,929
- I hope not.
- Excuse me.

652
00:32:40,423 --> 00:32:41,423
Excuse me.

653
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:44,488
I thought you'd be grateful.
I did just catch your friend's killer.

654
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:46,488
We're grateful.
Just a little busy.

655
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:47,756
Is that it?

656
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:51,260
- Thats smells...
- Not now, <i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

657
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,391
Fire!

658
00:32:57,553 --> 00:32:58,553
Fire!

659
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:00,181
Fire! Quick!

660
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,597
I'm just gonna leave you with that.

661
00:33:13,768 --> 00:33:15,618
All right everyone, please.

662
00:33:16,473 --> 00:33:17,661
Lift your glass.

663
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:20,122
To Jeffrey

664
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:21,374
and Julia,

665
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
friends,

666
00:33:23,163 --> 00:33:24,713
colleagues, titans

667
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,378
in the culinary world.

668
00:33:27,454 --> 00:33:28,297
You'll not

669
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:29,965
be soon forgotten.

670
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,342
<i>Salud.</i>

671
00:33:31,607 --> 00:33:32,843
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

672
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,016
To begin we have a melon soup.

673
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:40,809
<i>Prosciutto di parma,</i>

674
00:33:41,118 --> 00:33:42,102
mint and basil.

675
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:47,358
A reinterpretation
of one of Julia's specialites.

676
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:49,276
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

677
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:50,653
Thank you.

678
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,407
Don't let your midwestern taste buds
hold you back.

679
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,383
- What is this spice?
- Spice?

680
00:34:07,423 --> 00:34:09,546
I like a little heat,
but this is overpowering.

681
00:34:12,212 --> 00:34:13,467
We didn't add any heat.

682
00:34:13,813 --> 00:34:15,010
That would be me.

683
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,419
Sorry.

684
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,092
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>

685
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,720
The red Savina pepper.

686
00:34:24,742 --> 00:34:26,427
I got it from Julia's...

687
00:34:26,552 --> 00:34:29,024
pantry.
I thought it would be appropriate.

688
00:34:29,364 --> 00:34:31,276
And I'm just mad for heat, so...

689
00:34:31,956 --> 00:34:34,812
Obviously, I was a little heavy-handed.
My apologies.

690
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:37,324
What's the trouble?

691
00:34:41,981 --> 00:34:43,431
What's the problem?

692
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:45,708
The peppers, it didn't go down well.

693
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:47,793
The pepper?

694
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,545
If you prefer,

695
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,088
we can go to headquarters.

696
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,965
- How long we got?
- 48 hours.

697
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:54,717
That's a stretch of time.

698
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:56,853
I have to leave.

699
00:34:57,436 --> 00:35:00,264
- Right now.
- No, that would be rude.

700
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,765
What is wrong with you?

701
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,893
We all...
have to go to the hospital,

702
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,937
- right now.
- What for?

703
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,689
The pepper...

704
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,024
It was poisoned.

705
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,569
I saw Ludo put

706
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:16,321
- something into it.
- I did not. How dare you!

707
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,699
Maybe you're just cramping a little?

708
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,005
All right, all right.
I poisoned Julia's pepper.

709
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,206
- And Jeffrey's gin.
- Just bring me to a hospital.

710
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:29,126
Hospitals are terrible germ factories.
You don't wanna go there.

711
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,462
- Are you insane?
- Relax.

712
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,757
We knew about the ricin in the pepper.
We didn't know who put it there.

713
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,788
I don't understand.
Are we poisoned?

714
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,673
I switched the peppers.

715
00:35:39,926 --> 00:35:40,971
Clever of me.

716
00:35:47,074 --> 00:35:49,815
We know that your restaurant
didn't fail, Eliza.

717
00:35:50,478 --> 00:35:52,425
Jeffrey and Julia, they killed it.

718
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,065
We did some digging
on Julia's father.

719
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,154
He's the one who squashed
your liquor license.

720
00:35:57,445 --> 00:35:58,887
Jeffrey was a drunk.

721
00:35:59,262 --> 00:36:02,451
He needed you in his kitchen,
so he asked his lover if he could have

722
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,735
her big powerful daddy
do her a favor.

723
00:36:05,586 --> 00:36:08,478
<i>He didn't call you that night
to talk about recipes, did he?</i>

724
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:10,274
<i>He called to apologize</i>

725
00:36:11,457 --> 00:36:13,170
<i>for sabotaging your liquor license,</i>

726
00:36:13,295 --> 00:36:16,533
<i>for ruining any chance you had
at opening your own place.</i>

727
00:36:17,987 --> 00:36:18,987
<i>But I...</i>

728
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:22,607
<i>I am trying</i>

729
00:36:23,158 --> 00:36:24,413
<i>to become a better man.</i>

730
00:36:26,129 --> 00:36:27,100
<i>I am.</i>

731
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:29,311
He told you what he did,

732
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,615
and then you...

733
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:33,160
decided to take your revenge.

734
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:38,425
So you got some castor beans,
mixed up a batch of ricin

735
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,614
and went to the resort to find him.

736
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:49,701
I went to his room.

737
00:37:01,274 --> 00:37:02,874
<i>I accept your apology.</i>

738
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:08,438
<i>Let me just... wash up.</i>

739
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:11,036
<i>Such a fool.</i>

740
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:14,555
<i>Like I was gonna let that go?</i>

741
00:37:15,924 --> 00:37:18,325
<i>Like we were just gonna make up
and all be friends again?</i>

742
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,450
<i>That's...</i>

743
00:37:21,123 --> 00:37:22,173
<i>ridiculous.</i>

744
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,535
<i>You went to the pantry</i>

745
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:30,093
<i>and you found Julia's pepper
and you dosed that, too.</i>

746
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:36,127
One time
I was cleaning shrimp for Jeffrey.

747
00:37:37,744 --> 00:37:40,674
There were like, 40 pounds of it
and it was still half frozen.

748
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,669
But that was the job.

749
00:37:44,213 --> 00:37:45,012
I couldn't

750
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,162
feel my hands.
It was so cold.

751
00:37:48,496 --> 00:37:50,934
I realized I was cutting the flesh

752
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:52,859
off my own fingers.

753
00:37:55,455 --> 00:37:56,705
Carving it off.

754
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,512
And I didn't mind,

755
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:05,782
because Jeffrey had a vision.

756
00:38:14,222 --> 00:38:15,472
I had a vision.

757
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,616
And he said: "Go babe.

758
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:23,940
"You deserve your own place."

759
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:28,369
But he was lying.

760
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,142
Him and his...

761
00:38:36,132 --> 00:38:37,981
rich bitch girlfriend.

762
00:38:38,562 --> 00:38:40,242
Like I was gonna let that go.

763
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,696
He said, "I'm sorry."

764
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:54,868
"I'm sorry."

765
00:39:03,565 --> 00:39:04,900
What good is that?

766
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,559
A word.

767
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:18,730
Yes.

768
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,002
You framed me.

769
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:22,901
You put those castor beans
in my house, didn't you?

770
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:27,030
On my word of honor, I did not know
that those beans were planted.

771
00:39:27,912 --> 00:39:30,248
Mr. Jane was responsible.
I should've known.

772
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:33,745
I should've stopped him, and I didn't.
I am really sorry.

773
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:35,706
Why?

774
00:39:36,227 --> 00:39:38,146
He thought in order
to catch the killer,

775
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:40,482
that somebody else
had to be suspected of the crime.

776
00:39:40,607 --> 00:39:41,837
He's probably right.

777
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:43,876
I know you must be angry.

778
00:39:45,523 --> 00:39:47,715
Trying to leave the anger behind.

779
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:51,138
Though that's pretty much impossible,
isn't it?

780
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:52,472
It's hard.

781
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,590
Anyway.

782
00:39:56,465 --> 00:39:57,968
Thank you for your honesty.

783
00:39:59,324 --> 00:40:01,124
Tell Mr. Jane he's a mean,

784
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:03,218
irresponsible sadist.

785
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:04,579
I will.

786
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:09,358
Ms. Barge?

787
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,728
Living with an alcoholic is hard.

788
00:40:16,733 --> 00:40:19,373
Some never change.
They don't even want to.

789
00:40:20,029 --> 00:40:22,474
But your husband
checked into treatment two weeks ago,

790
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:24,774
right after you told him
about the baby.

791
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:29,007
I think he wanted to be there
for you and your child.

792
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:33,318
That's why he ended
the relationship with Julia.

793
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:37,142
For what it's worth,
it seemed like he wanted to change.

794
00:40:40,984 --> 00:40:41,813
Thank you.

795
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:52,596
It's okay. She's gone.

796
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:54,637
Who?

797
00:40:54,762 --> 00:40:57,746
Please, your guilty conscience
is obvious and well deserved.

798
00:40:58,632 --> 00:41:00,449
Justice can be a harsh mistress.

799
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:04,544
Omelets and eggs, ends to means,
all's well that ends well.

800
00:41:04,928 --> 00:41:06,728
A glib answer's no excuse.

801
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:12,294
And Abigail said to tell you
that you are a mean,

802
00:41:12,419 --> 00:41:13,969
irresponsible sadist.

803
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:17,220
That's pretty accurate.

804
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:20,275
You okay?

805
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:24,349
- No point denying it to me.
- I'm fine.

806
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,243
Good night.
