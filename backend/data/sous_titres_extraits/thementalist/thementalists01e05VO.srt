1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,990
<i>MENTALIST
/'men-t3-list/ noun</i>

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,120
<i>Someone who uses mental
acuity,hypnosis and/or suggestion.</i>

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,000
<i>A master manipulator of
thoughts and behavior.</i>

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,490
The girls were last seen leaving
sullivan's tavern,1:00 in the morning.

5
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,270
A truck driver spotted the car
around 5:30 and called it in.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,600
Look,i only have four deputies.

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,210
Only a couple of 'em have ever
seen a body killed in anger.

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,410
If what we have here is a
homicide,i'm gonna need some help.

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,540
Just to be clear,except in special
circumstances,we don't help out.

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,750
We take over.

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,270
You need to be okay with that.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,860
Okay. I guess.

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,630
She's not really a morning person.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,840
She'll improve.

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,850
Names of the missing women?

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,460
Nicole gilbert and kara palmer.

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,370
Local girls,both 21.

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,330
Work together at hunting store in town.

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,570
Last night was nicole's
engagement party.

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,310
The car was found exactly like this?

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,590
Yep. Well,no.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,470
Uh,the door was open just
like that. We popped the trunk.

23
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,100
Ah,yep. Dead as a dodo. No gas
either. They must have left it running.

24
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,180
Hey,there's a different set of tire
tracks here that pulled off the road.

25
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,390
A truck or big S. U. V.,looks like.

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,760
They're still fresh.

27
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,820
Must be from the trucker
who called in the car.

28
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,750
- Make sure forensics gets a mold.
- Yep.

29
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,220
What's going on with your dog?

30
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,570
Oh,he's confused somehow.

31
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,620
This behavior?

32
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,300
He's saying,"hey,look! Here they are!"

33
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,880
Give me my slim jim already.

34
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,520
Parker,do you have a better
dog close by somewhere?

35
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,790
Sir,this is the best dog in the county.

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,570
Come on,dexter. People
are waitin' on us.

37
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,220
Did you look under the car?

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,150
- Under the car?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,880
Of course we looked under the car.

40
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,190
Oh,crap.

41
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,630
One or two?

42
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,770
One.

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,760
It's kara palmer.

44
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,120
So... Where's nicole gilbert?

45
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,420
Nicole!

46
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,670
Good boy,dexter. He's
got her on lock now.

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,780
Is there any way to tell from the
scent trail how fast nicole was moving?

48
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,290
Oh,sure. Dexter's detecting skin cells.

49
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,270
They fall off your body all the
time at a pretty consistent rate.

50
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,860
So the faster you move,the
thinner the trail you leave.

51
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,080
So are we following nicole on foot or
nicole tied up in the back of a truck?

52
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,850
I don't know.

53
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,940
You said you can tell
how fast she was moving.

54
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,630
Oh,dexter can tell. I'm
just walking behind him.

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,890
Nicole,can you hear us?

56
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,800
Tell us about kara and nicole.

57
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,680
I've known them practically
their whole lives.

58
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,760
Kara was a real sweetheart.

59
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,700
You'll find no one around here will
say a bad word about kara palmer.

60
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,930
Good churchgoing
family,no trouble at all.

61
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,220
Meaning nicole gilbert was trouble.

62
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,690
Nicole--well,she
had her problems.

63
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,030
Drugs and drug-related
foolishness mostly.

64
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,360
Fraud,petty theft.

65
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,610
Any violent offenses?

66
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,440
No. No. No,she was more of a
troubled soul than a bad person.

67
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,340
Tough life. Her mom died when she was 7.

68
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,310
Her father raised her
on meth and hot dogs.

69
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,500
He's in prison now for drug dealing.

70
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,990
Kara and her family were all
the stability nicole ever had.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,480
So she and kara were good friends.

72
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,750
Odd match.

73
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,670
Yeah,real close since they were little.

74
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,060
In a small town,you
don't choose your friends.

75
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,680
They're the same age.
They're female. That's enough.

76
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,850
Kyle,boys,thank you for coming.

77
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,740
Sheriff. Where do you want us?

78
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,960
Well,you know this valley as well
as anyone. Just pick your spots.

79
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,430
Do we know if she's armed?

80
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,390
What do you know about this case?

81
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,640
Uh,same thing as everybody else,i guess.

82
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,730
Some badass townie girl got mad drunk,stabbed
her friend to death and ran off into the woods.

83
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,860
Kara palmer died from loss of blood.

84
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,480
Nicole gilbert is missing. Maybe she ran
off. Maybe she was abducted. We don't know.

85
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,700
Don't assume anything.

86
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,360
Message received and understood,ma'am.

87
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,530
All right,fellas.

88
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,600
You knew nicole. You think she did this?

89
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,680
Who knows what others are capable of?

90
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,730
She sure had built
up a lot of bad karma.

91
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,520
But i don't know.

92
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,470
She seemed to be
turning her life around.

93
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,690
Bad karma doesn't have
an expiration date.

94
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,520
Uh,actually,it does,according to
traditional buddhist teachings.

95
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,190
I'm counting on it.

96
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,300
Let's go.

97
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,700
People in town are already
saying nicole did this.

98
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,180
But i don't believe it.

99
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,750
She will have to tell me herself
that she did this before i believe it.

100
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,520
Nicole loved our daughter,and we loved
nicole almost like she was our own.

101
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,890
Almost.

102
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,240
Why--why would
she kill her?

103
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,660
She had her troubles,lord knows,but...

104
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,890
She wasn't crazy.

105
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,840
Has there been any tension
between them recently?

106
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,560
Oh,nothing. No. None at all.

107
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,210
- Well...
- Yes?

108
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,320
That boy. That--that
fianc\ of nicole's.

109
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,930
Jason... O'toole.

110
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,070
We never met him but once or
twice,and he seemed nice enough.

111
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,720
He works lumber. You know how those
fellas are. Like to play the buck.

112
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,680
All but sleep at sullivan's tavern.

113
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,420
But,you know,these days,you
have to look past the piercings

114
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,170
And the tattoos and all that,don't you?

115
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,490
But kara didn't think much of him.

116
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,450
No?

117
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,920
Didn't approve.

118
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,890
I think there might have
been some tension there.

119
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,580
What was her problem rr with jason?

120
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,290
Oh,i guess just a feeling that
he wasn't trustworthy,you know?

121
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,220
But nicole was in love,and she thought kara was
just jealous 'cause kara didn't have a boyfriend.

122
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,260
- Did jason ever get violent rr with nicole?
- No.

123
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,480
Not that i heard,but i
wouldn't be surprised.

124
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,680
Nicole had her fair share of that type.

125
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,290
Kara didn't have a boyfriend?

126
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,900
Kara could've had anyone she liked.

127
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,360
She had no shortage of suitors.

128
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,330
But have you seen the men around here?

129
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,830
It's all drunken lumberjacks
and hippie pot farmers.

130
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,070
Kara had...

131
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,930
She had higher standards than that.

132
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,010
What's the problem now,parker?

133
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,480
Trail's cold,sheriff.

134
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,450
Best dog in the county,huh?

135
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,470
Come on.

136
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,260
Nicole!

137
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,180
She can't answer you.

138
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,390
Or doesn't want to.

139
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,990
No,she's a captive or dead.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,440
How do you know that?

141
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,460
How far have we come? What,5 miles?

142
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,440
Nicole would've been
barefoot,probably drunk.

143
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,710
It was a dark night.

144
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,860
There's no way she could
cover that distance.

145
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,580
Someone must have her in a
vehicle,and dexter lost the scent.

146
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,510
Okay. So you're in
charge now. What do we do?

147
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,500
It's close to evening.
Call off the search.

148
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,230
- Gather everybody
together and-- - Give up?

149
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,840
There's a girl missing.

150
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,470
Tell me,of the men on this search party,

151
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,070
Which one would you guess
is a violent sexual predator?

152
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,120
- What kind of question is that?
- Whose name just popped into your head?

153
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,560
Someone's did. There's always someone.

154
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,110
This is your method?

155
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,670
Asking people to guess whodunit?

156
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,650
Strange kind of detective
work you guys do.

157
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,800
Jane's being dramatic,but if somebody
did victimize kara and nicole,

158
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,680
Statistics show that they'd be really
likely to join the search party.

159
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,270
They enjoy the deceit. It's
like being the invisible man.

160
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,630
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

161
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,190
So gather up the search party.
Let me have a crack at 'em.

162
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,810
He gets results.

163
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,090
I know all these guys.

164
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,930
I'll vouch for every one of them.

165
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,360
Well,most of them.

166
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,960
I'll call 'em in.

167
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,780
Jason o'toole?

168
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,530
Get your truck outta my way.

169
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,380
We need to talk to you
about nicole gilbert.

170
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,100
I don't have time for this,xxguys.

171
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,560
Let's have a little chat.

172
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,890
Where were you going
in such a hurry,jason?

173
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,910
Back to the woods to find nicole.

174
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,140
How do you know she was in the woods?

175
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,240
I don't. i hope she's in the woods.

176
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,970
'Cause if she's not in the woods,then she
can be anywhere in the frickin' world,right?

177
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,110
Why not search pp with
the rest of the town?

178
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,750
Nah,i cover more ground alone.

179
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,170
Why did kara drive nicole home
ppafter the party? Why didn't you?

180
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,820
Because i was too drunk.

181
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,330
Or maybe you two had a fight.

182
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,780
No. We were celebrating our engagement.

183
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,650
That's right about
when vvthe fights start.

184
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,010
We video'd the whole thing. Okay?

185
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,850
You can watch it and
see. There's no fighting.

186
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,550
We'll do that. Where is that video?

187
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,840
It's in my truck.

188
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,050
There's this whole kara
issue we have to talk about.

189
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,240
- Maybe that blew up,huh?
- What issue?

190
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,590
Well,kara didn't like you,didn't
think you were good enough for nicole,

191
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,960
Thought you were untrustworthy.

192
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,960
That's funny. Is that what you do?

193
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,700
You try to get me all upset
or somethin' so i look guilty?

194
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,930
Does it upset you?

195
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,920
That kara didn't like you?

196
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,420
She was trying to undermine you?

197
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,780
I couldn't care less,okay?

198
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,640
'Cause it's not true anyhow.

199
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,300
Kara liked me well enough.

200
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,620
Least i never heard her say different.

201
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,370
Where were you between 1:00
and 7:00 A. M.last night?

202
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,260
I was here,passed out on the floor.

203
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,770
We'll regroup in the
morning,first light.

204
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:13,020
Before you go,patrick jane from the cbi
would like to have a word with all of you.

205
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,900
Thanks,sheriff nelson.

206
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,320
I want you to look at me,all
of you,and listen closely.

207
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,050
I'd like you to raise your
hands above your heads like this.

208
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,950
Both hands.

209
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,550
You,too,sheriff.

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,100
And you,agent lisbon.

211
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,100
Please.

212
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,810
Good. Very good.

213
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,090
One of you--one of you here killed
kara palmer and abducted nicole gilbert.

214
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,500
I want that person to
lower their right hand now.

215
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,380
Uh,okay. Okay,uh,usually gets a hit.

216
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,350
Forget i even spoke.

217
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,410
Sheriff nelson,we have a 10-28
reported on nicole gilbert--

218
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,360
A gas station convenience store.

219
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,020
I repeat,10-28 on nicole gilbert.

220
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,140
Copy that.

221
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,020
She had a nasty blow to her
head,moderate concussion.

222
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,440
Her feet are badly abraded.

223
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,240
And she has a lot of minor
scratches and bruises.

224
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,010
Mild hypothermia.

225
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,460
Physically,she'll be
fine in a day or so.

226
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,620
Mentally,it's another story.

227
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,720
When you brought her in,she was
in some kind of a psychotic state.

228
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,730
We've medicated her to take the edge
off that,but she's still in deep shock.

229
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,640
She has no memory at all of the
events that brought her here.

230
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,140
That's convenient.

231
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,860
If i just stabbed my best friend
to death,i'd want to forget,too.

232
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,660
As soon as she's well enough,i'm
charging her and taking her to jail.

233
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,410
Sheriff,you have custody of nicole,but
the cbi's leading this investigation.

234
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,260
I decide when to file charges.
We don't have the full facts yet.

235
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,840
Facts? She's covered in blood.

236
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,670
She's carrying what looks
to be the murder weapon,

237
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,140
Which the forensic guys
say has kara's blood on it.

238
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,390
What more do you want?

239
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,870
If she well enough to speak to?

240
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,740
As long as you're gentle with her.

241
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,770
Have you told her kara's dead?

242
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,520
No. We don't want to upset her.

243
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,980
- She's very fragile.
- Yeah.

244
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,900
Nicole?

245
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,500
My name is teresa lisbon.

246
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,720
I'm with the california
bureau of investigation.

247
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,640
We want to ask you a few questions
about what happened to you and kara.

248
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,960
I told the doctor i can't remember.

249
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,020
That's okay.

250
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,950
What's the last thing you do remember?

251
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,930
My party.

252
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,070
I remember leaving sullivan's
and getting in the car withara.

253
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,840
You know where my fianc\ is?

254
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,070
Do you remember anything
else about the party?

255
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,890
We had a good time.

256
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,340
Nothing bad or unusual happened?

257
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,890
No.

258
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,170
We drank a lot... Danced.

259
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,450
Where's kara?

260
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,020
You and kara left the
sullivan in her car.

261
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,900
Then what happened?

262
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,380
I don't know. I don't know.
That's what i'm telling you.

263
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,370
The next thing i
remember,i was in this bed.

264
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,600
What's wrong with me? What happened?

265
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,230
Where's--where's kara? Why
won't anyone tell me anything?

266
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,280
- It's okay.
- She's dead.

267
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,470
Jane!

268
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,940
Stabbed to death.

269
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,950
No.

270
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,450
Why did you say that?

271
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,180
She was gonna find out at some point.

272
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,770
The doctor said to be gentle.

273
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,350
Ah,doctors.

274
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,360
Open your eyes,nicole.

275
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,260
Look at me.

276
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,000
Open your eyes.

277
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,510
I told you the truth
because you can handle it.

278
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,340
You have to. You will.

279
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,600
Tell me you will.

280
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,720
What you have to do now,you
have to remember what happened.

281
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,680
Close your eyes and remember.

282
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,890
Jane...

283
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,540
Close your eyes.

284
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,980
You were driving with
kara down flagship road.

285
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,880
- Pull over.
- What?

286
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,970
Pull over!

287
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,190
Why did you stop?

288
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,950
I was feeling sick.

289
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,240
There's a man.

290
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,440
What does he look like?

291
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,680
I don't know. I can't see. It's dark.

292
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,340
I can hear...

293
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:20,160
A loud rushing sound,like water.

294
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,910
- Then what happened?
- I... I don't know.

295
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,210
I can't remember.

296
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,500
You have to.

297
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,860
- No,i can't.
- You have to.

298
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,650
I can't remember.

299
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,930
- You have to.
- No,i can't. I...

300
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,900
What have you been doing to her? Out!

301
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,570
That's bull.

302
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,610
She's got amnesia,but not so badly she
can't finger somebody else for killing kara.

303
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,010
Rushing water,my ass.

304
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,200
No,she's telling the truth.

305
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,390
Something happened-- something too
horrible for her mind to handle.

306
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,420
Her memory's blocked.

307
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,260
Well,even if that's true. Maybe
it's blocked because she killed kara.

308
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,290
Well,it's possible. I don't think so.

309
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,390
- I think she's a victim.
- How can you tell?

310
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,680
It's in her eyes.

311
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,660
Well,then... Why didn't you
say so? It's in her eyes.

312
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,260
Here's me looking for facts.

313
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,520
Why would she kill her best
friend? What's her,uh,motive?

314
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,540
- Why do women kill other women?
- Over men.

315
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,860
Could've been fighting over
jason,though he's no brad pitt.

316
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,300
- She was covered in blood.
- Yes?

317
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,700
But it rained. It rained hard
for a good few hours last night.

318
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,830
Only when they recovered nicole,she
was still covered in blood. So...

319
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,810
So she must've been under good cover
when it rained. She must've been indoors.

320
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,930
She was hiding.

321
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,200
Or she was a captive,probably
near the river--

322
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,250
Hence the sound of rushing water.

323
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,580
Rigsby.

324
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,170
Rigsby,get a couple park rangers and organize
a search of all the empty summer cabins,

325
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,410
storage units and sheds within
earshot of the river-- Caves,too.

326
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:18,330
Oh,and,rigsby,have van pelt set up the video
jason shot at the party at sullivan's tavern.

327
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,270
- You got it,boss.
- Let's go.

328
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,230
Uh,sheriff?

329
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,370
There's a man out there that needs to
silence nicole before she recovers her memory.

330
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,470
- So you say.
- So i say.

331
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,120
No one should enter her room.

332
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,680
Make sure your men keep her safe.

333
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,080
I know my business.

334
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,460
You mind yours,whatever
in the heck it is.

335
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,980
How's jason's alibi look?

336
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,100
Alibi's solid. Several people
saw him passed out at the bar.

337
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,160
Damn. Nelson was right.

338
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,390
About what?

339
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:03,380
Look at jason's camera work.
He's torn between nicole and kara.

340
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,610
I love this girl. I love this girl.

341
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,340
- And i love you,baby.
- So he had a thing for kara.

342
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,610
It's no proof of motive
unless nicole knew about it.

343
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,160
And it doesn't look like
they're feuding over him,does it?

344
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,020
I'm gettin' married!

345
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,590
Wait. Stop right there.
Run it back. There.

346
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,450
The guy at the bar staring
at kara,in the baseball cap.

347
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,670
I can blow it up.

348
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,070
Yeah,let's get a
better look at that hat.

349
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,140
Earthly pure. What is that?

350
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,630
That's the brand of cosmetics
we found in kara's vehicle.

351
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,620
Can we match that image
to the D. M. V.database?

352
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,240
I can try.

353
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,710
Rulon farnes.

354
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,690
Truck driver for earthly pure cosmetics.

355
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,010
I can call the company,see
if i can get a track on him.

356
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,670
Mm,yeah.

357
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,710
Anything?

358
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,960
We searched every cabin and
shack along the river. Nothing.

359
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,110
- Have them drop you back at the station.
- Okay,boss.

360
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,540
- Where you goin'?
- For a walk.

361
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,510
How you doing?

362
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,170
People are saying that i killed kara.

363
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,180
That's why there's a policeman
outside,so that i don't escape.

364
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,260
Did you... Kill kara?

365
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,440
I don't know.

366
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,420
I don't think i did.

367
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,250
Do you think i did?

368
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,470
No. Why would you kill kara?

369
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,270
Yeah. Why would i kill her?

370
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,510
But the thing is,i don't know.

371
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,580
I don't think i did,but... I don't know.

372
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,230
Hey,where you going?

373
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,110
Take your hands off of me!

374
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,160
Don't make me tase you,son.

375
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,050
Guys,come on.

376
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,020
Everybody just take it down a notch.

377
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,020
Uh,what's going on?

378
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,410
He was trying to sneak in to see her.

379
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,800
I was just--i was trying
to see my girl,all right?

380
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,420
I was just walking through!

381
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,290
Nobody's allowed to see her right now.

382
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,670
Come on.

383
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,470
- Are they gone?
- Yes.

384
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,550
I'm not ready to see anyone yet.

385
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,420
Are you okay? You need
me to get the nurse?

386
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,850
No. No,no. Don't leave me alone.

387
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,340
I won't.

388
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,640
What was it in particular that
scared you just now,nicole?

389
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,340
I don't know.

390
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,370
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,750
It's okay. It's not your fault.

392
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,990
Rulon,we need to talk to you
about kara palmer. Let's go.

393
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,550
Rigsby,get up! Come on,get up!

394
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,240
Let's go.

395
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,520
Nice job,guys.

396
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,030
Daddy,listen.

397
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,610
I. C. U. Dr. Bradford, I. C. U.

398
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,530
Uh,what?

399
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,020
Yeah,yeah. I'll be there.

400
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,860
So how is it you know kara palmer?

401
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,850
This town's on my regular
route,and i stop here to eat.

402
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,220
Huntin' store's next door to the diner.

403
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,480
One day i walk in there,and a tight
little pair of buns caught my eye.

404
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,460
Boy meets girl.

405
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,690
So i walk over,and i
start up a conversation.

406
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,640
What did you talk about?

407
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,580
Offered her $10 to sit in my lap.

408
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,900
She said no,but she said no in that
kind of way like i was lowballing her,

409
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,380
Not no,like,to the general principle.

410
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,450
So i guess you could say
i've been courtin' her.

411
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,030
I'm through town,i stop by,i
give her some free stuff.

412
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,100
What did you expect from kara
in return for the free stuff?

413
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:55,790
I gave her a lot of stuff,so
i'm thinking eventually...

414
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,900
Some form of sexual congress.

415
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,390
And what did you get?

416
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,820
I disgust you,don't i?

417
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,620
A little,yeah.

418
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,410
You're pretty.

419
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,410
How's your lipstick supply?

420
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,050
You beautiful people got no idea
what unattractive guys go through.

421
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,730
Don't i have a heart?

422
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,200
Don't i long to be held,to
be loved,to be cherished?

423
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,760
Yes,i do.

424
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,240
So i gotta pay for a little human
contact every now and then. Shoot me.

425
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,780
It's not my fault i look like this.

426
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,490
It is,actually.

427
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,320
With a low carb diet and exercise,you
could look very different.

428
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,060
I got a glandular problem.

429
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,300
Uh,how heavy are you,exactly?

430
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,820
I-i've lost a lot of
weight in the last year.

431
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,610
You expected sexual favors
from kara. What did you get?

432
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,810
She was a beautiful woman.

433
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,430
There's nothing more beautiful
than a beautiful woman,is there?

434
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,220
What did you get from kara?

435
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,560
Nothing at all.

436
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,220
In france,they'd have
called her a coquette.

437
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,560
I was-- always
held out high hopes.

438
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,320
I mean,there's always hope.

439
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,860
There sure is.

440
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,600
Suppose she never did put out for you.

441
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,920
How would you feel?

442
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:26,340
If i killed all the women
that had rejected me...

443
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,530
I'd have killed a lot of women.

444
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,600
We can place you at the same bar where
kara was last seen the night of her murder.

445
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,650
So were a whole
boatload of other people.

446
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,630
Where were you between the hours
of 1:30 and 7:00 A. M.that morning?

447
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,790
My motel.

448
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,300
Were you alone?

449
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,120
Yeah,i was.

450
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,150
- So you have no alibi.
- Nope.

451
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,000
Doesn't look good for me,does it?

452
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,510
You seem fine with that.

453
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,480
You know,i read that prosecutors are
not real happy with juries nowadays,

454
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,320
'Cause those folks watch
a lot of crime shows on tv,

455
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,240
And they walk in there expecting
every crime scene to have,

456
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,770
like,D. N. A.,hair,whatnot.

457
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:07,120
And if that prosecutor does not hand
them the defendant's spit on a plate,

458
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,050
not guilty.

459
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,110
You saying you're innocent or careful?

460
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,320
You'll never know.

461
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,860
He has no alibi,but we have no proof,and
i can't find an angle to get at him.

462
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,680
He's shameless. He likes the attention.

463
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,720
Maybe we should let jane at him.

464
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,580
Hey,jane. Want to have a crack at him?

465
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,710
Jane!

466
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,350
Oh,him? Oh,let him go.

467
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,350
- Let him go?
- What for?

468
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,620
We had to fight to catch him.

469
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,340
Oh,you're such
policemen. Yes,let him,go.

470
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,960
Set him free. He's telling the truth.

471
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,320
You know this how?

472
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,730
He liked kara.

473
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,690
Why would he kill her and kidnap nicole?

474
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,020
Doesn't make any sense.

475
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,360
Besides,he blushed when
he lied about his weight.

476
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,580
A man without
guile-- innocent.

477
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,100
Kara--not quite as innocent
as she's been painted.

478
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,670
By the word of a creep.

479
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,410
An honest creep whose stuff she took
knowing what kind of a man he was.

480
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,640
Free eyeliner doesn't make
her a whore,and a man blushing,

481
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,230
Embarrassed by his
weight,hardly makes him innocent.

482
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,740
It makes him sensitive about his weight.

483
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,530
I think he's a good prospect.
We should keep him close.

484
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,260
- Hey,is that kara's mp3 player?
- Yeah.

485
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,300
What are you doing with it?

486
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,730
Uh,listening to music. It's pretty good.

487
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,480
But that's evidence.
You can't play with that.

488
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,380
Evidence of what,that she likes music?

489
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,360
It's in the log as physical
evidence. It's evidence.

490
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,640
Okay. What's with her?

491
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,620
Seriously,if it's in the log,it's
in the log. You can't touch it.

492
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,540
Really? All right. Well,uh... I'm sorry.

493
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,780
I,uh,i didn't realize
it was a sacred thing.

494
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,550
I'll put it right back.

495
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,900
You gonna release rulon or what?

496
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,240
I don't want to,but i don't
have enough to hold him on.

497
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,900
Let him go. We'll keep
him under surveillance.

498
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,960
- Put that back.
- All right. It's going.

499
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,840
Rulon,you can go. Sorry
about the inconvenience.

500
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,060
There it is.

501
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,460
Nicole?

502
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,550
You want to get out of here?

503
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,520
Put these on as quick as
you can. Quick as you can.

504
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:36,610
if i may? Thank you.

505
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,320
I'll be right back.

506
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,560
There's nothing left to eat.

507
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,030
You cleaned us out this morning.

508
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,970
listen.

509
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,960
Cars?

510
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,700
The flow of them. It's like a hum.

511
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,820
What if nicole didn't
hear water that night?

512
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,800
What if it was the flow of traffic?

513
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,650
Then we should have been searching cabins
on this side of town,near the highway.

514
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,550
We'll split up. I'll get a ranger to
come and get me,search the likely spots.

515
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,230
You stay with rulon.

516
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,690
Where are we going?

517
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,060
You trust me,nicole?

518
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,210
Yes.

519
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,510
I'm gonna help you remember
what happened to you that night.

520
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,460
- I don't want to remember.
- You have to.

521
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,960
Wherever you go,until you know the truth
of what happened,you will be haunted.

522
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,370
Until you see kara's death
redeemed,you'll be haunted.

523
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,180
You have to know the truth.

524
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,520
* Curled up like a cat at
the corner of everything *

525
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:43,140
{\a6}<font color=#32CD99>"Adore,Adore"--- Yoav</font>

526
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,140
* don't feel bad even if you could *

527
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,000
* Cuz if you did not do it *

528
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,820
* Someone else just would *

529
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,910
* it's easy *

530
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,030
makes me feel sad.

531
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,050
It's the same music that was
playing in kara's car that night.

532
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,350
Yes.

533
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,920
Yes. How did you know that?

534
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,370
- Are you psychic?
- No.

535
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,090
These machines have clocks.

536
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,060
They log in their memory
what was played when.

537
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,820
Kara told you the secret,didn't she?

538
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,690
Terrible secret she'd
been keeping from you.

539
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,480
But she had to tell you.
She had to be honest.

540
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,430
- i'm gonna be sick.
- Okay.

541
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,510
She said that i shouldn't marry jason...

542
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,280
Because he's no good,and
then i said she was wrong.

543
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,160
Then she said that she
knows he's no good because...

544
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,760
She and him were sneaking
around behind my back...

545
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,100
Hooking up.

546
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,050
I'm sorry.

547
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,170
Nicole,then what happened?

548
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,010
No.

549
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,840
- I don't want to remember any more.
- You must.

550
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,720
No. I'm scared.

551
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,060
I've been where you're going.

552
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,400
I know how you feel. I know.

553
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,320
But you have to be brave.

554
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:56,380
I'm here. I won't let
anything bad happen. I promise.

555
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,710
sorry. I'm so sorry!

556
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,380
Nicole,get back in the car.

557
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:17,390
Go screw yourself!

558
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,480
Get in the car!

559
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,900
Hey,mister,are you
looking for a good time?

560
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:27,180
'Cause my friend here is a cheap
whore,and i'm sure she'd be happy--

561
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:42,260
kara died trying to save me!

562
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,290
I'm being carried now.

563
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,560
I can hear the engine.

564
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,730
It's vibrating.

565
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,940
Gasoline or diesel?

566
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,790
Sounded like a diesel.

567
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,580
Where is he taking you?
Is it a long journey?

568
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,840
No. No,not long. Short.

569
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,210
A bumpy road.

570
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,790
Agent lisbon,your man jane just kidnapped
nicole gilbert from the hospital.

571
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,790
Oh,no.

572
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,510
Oh,yes.

573
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,030
And i'm not happy.

574
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,700
In fact,i'm mad as hell.

575
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,030
You people are my guests.

576
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,620
You can't come in here
and abduct my suspects!

577
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,740
Sheriff,i will fix this.
Let me get on it right away.

578
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,600
- Son of a bitch.
- What's up?

579
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,370
Personnel issues.

580
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,150
Pick up your phone,damn it.

581
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,760
We're stopping now.

582
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,940
It's like an old shed.

583
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,340
It was small and dark...

584
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,290
And cold and dusty.

585
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,730
I'm scared.

586
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,530
Help me! Somebody help me!

587
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,490
The door won't open. I can't get out.

588
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,630
- You will get out.
- I can't get out!

589
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,680
It's gonna be fine. The--the
door will open. It will open.

590
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,320
Is it bolted?

591
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,270
Somebody help!

592
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,810
No.

593
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,690
Chained?

594
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,140
No,i don't think so.

595
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,550
I'm trapped. I'm gonna die.
Oh,my god. I'm gonna die!

596
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,320
Nicole,you can open
it. It's your choice.

597
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,470
The door is unlocked
if you want it to be.

598
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,550
Open the door,nicole. Open it.

599
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,050
It's cold up here at night,huh?

600
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,480
Yeah,and broiling during the day.

601
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,250
Worst of both worlds.

602
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,620
He--he's got
a knife on me.

603
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,380
He's trying to rape
me,but i won't let him.

604
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,470
Where the hell are you?

605
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,560
Nicole remembered everything.

606
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,570
She can describe the suspect.

607
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:35,310
We're looking for a tall,well-built
man with brown hair and glasses,mid 30s.

608
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,180
That's it? That describes
half the men in california.

609
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:43,440
Yeah,that's it,but at least we
know it wasn'her that killed kara.

610
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,560
And it wasn't rulon farnes.

611
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,560
Nice work. For this you illegally
abducted her from the sheriff's custody?

612
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:53,430
Yeah. I was--i was gonna tell you about
it,but i figured seeing that it's illegal,

613
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,900
Best to keep you out of it
so that you have deniability.

614
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,790
Oh,how considerate of you.

615
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,080
Listen to me carefully and
do exactly as i tell you.

616
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,800
Take her back to the hospital right now
and sincerely apologize to sheriff nelson.

617
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,270
What was all that about?

618
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,630
My bad karma.

619
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,150
- How's she doing,anyway?
- Who?

620
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,300
The girl--nicole.
How's she holding up?

621
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,270
Okay,considering.

622
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,850
She remember anything yet?

623
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,530
- We're doing what we can.
- Good.

624
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:42,950
Is there anything else,anything
specific that you can remember about him?

625
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,530
Just what he looked like.
That's all i remember.

626
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,310
Doesn't matter how small it is.

627
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,960
Little things like what his voice
sounded like or what he smelled like or...

628
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,350
Pineapple.

629
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,280
That's great.

630
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,250
Is this the last place to check?

631
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,900
No,there's one more place.

632
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,370
All right,let's go.

633
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,710
Pineapple. He smelled like pineapple.

634
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,710
Pineapple? What the hell go...

635
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,620
Okay,good.

636
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,800
Listen,tell rigsby
teresa needs his help.

637
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,040
Me? I'm at the eagle
pine lodge off route 6.

638
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,090
Okay.

639
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,380
Kyle,let's stay calm
and think this through.

640
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,840
Think what through?

641
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,630
I really don't want to shoot you,

642
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,490
but i do have to take you into
custody for killing kara palmer.

643
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,170
What are we gonna do about that?

644
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,690
It's not like i set out to hurt anyone.

645
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,830
I just wanted to talk to nicole.

646
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,710
Before she ran off and got married?

647
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,730
I've noticed her around
town for a long time.

648
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,670
I didn't want her
marrying that guy jason.

649
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,400
She's too good for him.

650
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:31,800
Please,kyle,i really and
truly do not want to hurt you.

651
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,680
You like your chances,do you?

652
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,840
Uh,lisbon?

653
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,250
Lisbon? Lisbon!

654
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,350
You all right?

655
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,630
Yeah. Did you call rigsby?

656
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,260
Yeah,he's on his way.
Listen,i have an idea.

657
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,460
Lisbon,be careful!

658
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,120
Drop it!

659
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,480
Really drop it.

660
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,260
On your knees.

661
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:41,020
Hands,come on. Let's go. Come on.

662
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,530
Nice work,jane.

663
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,410
I was hoping i'd find you here.

664
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,750
Yeah,we're,uh,we're just
about to hit the road.

665
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,280
Thank you.

666
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,340
It's okay.

667
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:17,030
You know,uh,eventually you'll
start to remember the good things.

668
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,460
Yeah.

669
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:27,420
- It goes without saying...
- You're welcome.

670
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,910
You ready to go?

671
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,800
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

672
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,240
Hey,can you believe he fell
for that old cell phone gag?

673
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,810
Old cell phone gag?

674
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,330
I invented that
right there and then--

675
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,640
Rather brilliantly,i thought.

676
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:54,650
Oh,please. I've seen
that done a dozen times.

677
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,930
What do you mean? Where?

678
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,460
On tv.

679
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,310
Oh,on tv. Well,anything
can happen on tv.

680
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,897
The question is,where have you
seen that done in real life?

681
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:10,591
