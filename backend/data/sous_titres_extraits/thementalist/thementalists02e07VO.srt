1
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:29,978
I'm seeing lights.
People are inside the house.

2
00:00:30,103 --> 00:00:31,865
- How many entry points?
- Three.

3
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,283
Front, back, basement.
Windows are all boarded up.

4
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,642
Witnesses said 3 men
took part in the abduction.

5
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:39,330
So figure those 3 inside
plus a couple more just for fun.

6
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,332
It's Mia Westlake. I want everybody

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,417
- to take another good long look.
- It's her.

8
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:46,962
We believe the kidnapper's
got her alive, be careful.

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,508
Me, Hicks and Martinez
take the front door.

10
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,686
Dyson and Shelly,
take the two-three corner.

11
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:54,303
Bucci, Paulson and Fredericks,

12
00:00:54,477 --> 00:00:55,680
take the three-four.

13
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:58,891
Go.

14
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:20,718
- Ready.
- Ready.

15
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:23,457
Three, two, one.

16
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,646
Stay where you are! FBI!

17
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:42,268
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

18
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:50,818
What are you doing here?

19
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,989
You waving your guns around.
Can you put your guns away.

20
00:01:57,776 --> 00:01:58,776
Cowboys!

21
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,707
2x07
"Red Bulls"

22
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:13,497
The important thing
is nobody got hurt.

23
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,659
All respect to your people,
the important thing is...

24
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:19,180
We make sure that this
does not happen again.

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,014
CBI agents shoot each other.

26
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:24,059
Is not a headline
that I want to see.

27
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,515
We came in hot because we thought
the kidnap victim was there.

28
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,607
- Mia somebody.
- Mia Westlake.

29
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:30,900
Marin county heiress.

30
00:02:31,245 --> 00:02:33,080
She was taken a day and a half ago.

31
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,515
Witness gave us a partial plate
on the kidnapper's car.

32
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:39,035
We dug up an outstanding
parking ticket...

33
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,255
to a car in Oakland,
checked the address,

34
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,829
There were people in a house
that was supposed to be empty.

35
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:47,690
He found you there because?

36
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:49,745
We got a call
from the coroner's bureau.

37
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,906
There was a report
of a corpse in a house.

38
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:55,407
They were shorthanded budget cuts
so they asked us to check it out.

39
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,734
My team went there.
The corpse was there

40
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:01,472
- but not the coroner, so we waited.
- And everyone almost died.

41
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,783
- Where are you with Westlake?
- Set up inside the house.

42
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:08,229
Waiting for a ransom demand.

43
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:12,181
- What's with the corpse?
- Young male dead three to five years.

44
00:03:12,306 --> 00:03:14,360
Coroner couldn't be specific.
There 2 bullet holes

45
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,765
in the base of the skull.

46
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,364
It was wrapped in plastic
and stored in a window seat.

47
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:20,689
- Do you have an ID?
- Not yet.

48
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:23,118
Yes yet.
Coroner's report just came in,

49
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,662
the corpse is...

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,750
Colin Haymer.

51
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:29,458
I know that name?

52
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,545
Colin Haymer was a kidnap victim
three years ago.

53
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,548
Early 20s from San Francisco,
wealthy family.

54
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,393
S.F.P.D. handled the case.
Family paid the ransom.

55
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,615
Didn't work.

56
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,022
Eerily similar
to your kidnapping, no?

57
00:03:42,147 --> 00:03:45,641
Who wants to bet C. Haymer kidnapper
the same that kidnapped Mia Westlake?

58
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:48,686
- Well, could be a coincidence.
- There are no coincidences.

59
00:03:48,923 --> 00:03:49,923
I agree.

60
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:53,315
I want your people
teaming up on this.

61
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:56,902
- That necessary?
- Yes it is.

62
00:03:57,285 --> 00:04:00,085
I want to foster better
inter-unit relations.

63
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,617
Let's stop stumbling into each other
and try working together.

64
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,746
You have concerns.

65
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:09,055
I do.

66
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,291
This man...

67
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:14,622
I don't even know what he is.

68
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,255
An accident waiting to happen.

69
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,633
- Be fair.
- He closes cases, i know.

70
00:04:19,852 --> 00:04:21,557
- I do.
- He does.

71
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,129
In my opinion,

72
00:04:24,635 --> 00:04:25,723
this is a mistake.

73
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,268
Okay.

74
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:32,354
Off you go.

75
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,693
Mia Westlake
was abducted 38 hours ago,

76
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:39,678
coming home from a gallery opening.

77
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,866
- Thank you, Rebecca.
- You need anything else?

78
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:45,757
We're good. Thank you.

79
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:49,788
This is copies
of the case paperwork so far.

80
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:52,333
Now the kidnappers

81
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,461
forced her car off the road,
killed the driver and then took her.

82
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,296
Why kill the driver?

83
00:04:57,521 --> 00:05:00,966
It's a message. They'll kill the hostage
if they don't get what they want.

84
00:05:01,796 --> 00:05:03,802
No ransom demand.
Is it really a kidnapping?

85
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:07,648
They sent the family a proof of life
a few hours later.

86
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:10,851
No blindfold, that's not good.
They don't care if she sees anything.

87
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:13,812
- Good thinking, Bert.
- What's your problem?

88
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:17,141
No problem.

89
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,817
I agree.

90
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,608
This is shaping up to end
like the Haymer abduction.

91
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,489
Let's make sure that it doesn't.

92
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:26,367
- I get back to the Westlakes.
- I'd like to come with.

93
00:05:26,822 --> 00:05:29,286
I'd like to ask some questions
about our dead guy,

94
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,913
see if there's connections.

95
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,539
Digging on the Haymer case.

96
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:36,132
- Contact the family, set up interviews.
- I'd like leave Hicks with you.

97
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,587
That's all right with you?

98
00:05:38,936 --> 00:05:40,673
- Keep 'em honest.
- What did he say?

99
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:42,925
Care to reframe that?

100
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:45,761
They're Jane's people.
They need watching.

101
00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:48,173
I like to think of them
as my people.

102
00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:49,467
Think what you like.

103
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:52,304
I can't have them trying to pull
some cheap stunt behind my back.

104
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:55,312
We've a whole range
of expensive stunts if you prefer.

105
00:05:56,412 --> 00:05:59,358
I understand your issue, agent Bosco.
No problem.

106
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,114
Welcome, Hicks.

107
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:04,209
We'll extend every courtesy.
Let's go.

108
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:09,076
Let's get started.

109
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:28,679
Verona Westlake.

110
00:06:28,893 --> 00:06:31,640
- This is Mia's sister.
- You must be CBI, too?

111
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:33,809
I'm agent Lisbon.
That's Patrick Jane.

112
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,169
My husband Duncan Weaver.

113
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:39,273
More CBI?

114
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,650
Where did you come from, anyway?

115
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,113
- I never heard of you.
- You neither.

116
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:47,364
Nice place, you must be loaded.
How did you make the money?

117
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:49,948
My grandfather, actually.

118
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:51,410
Oil, lumber.

119
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,757
I just assumed it was new money,

120
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:56,406
because of the...

121
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,708
the decor.

122
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:01,420
Already you start with this crap?

123
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,588
What?

124
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:06,832
Belinda Sandborne,
Verona's attorney.

125
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:08,735
Any conversation
you have with Verona

126
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,487
or Duncan, I need to be there.

127
00:07:10,612 --> 00:07:12,681
Not a problem.
Is there someone else

128
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,141
we should be talking to?

129
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:15,970
I'm sort of...

130
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:17,933
the family.

131
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:20,564
Our parents are dead.

132
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:23,859
Mia, she's

133
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:26,616
the grown-up, capable one.

134
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,031
I'm the mess.

135
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:31,470
Too bad, huh?

136
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,953
- They took the wrong sister.
- You're doing fine.

137
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:37,122
Listen to the man
with the gun, babe.

138
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,417
We understand
you're investigating a related case?

139
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:43,796
Another kidnapping that may have been
carried out by the same people.

140
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,355
How did it,

141
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,801
turn out?
Did the person they took get home okay?

142
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,721
No. He was killed.

143
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,770
His name is Colin Haymer.
Here's his picture.

144
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,606
He's from Pacific Heights.
Does he look familiar?

145
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:03,857
You, babe?

146
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,622
Nothing. Sorry.

147
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:09,863
Does his name ever come up
in any context, even casually?

148
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,318
I don't think so.

149
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:16,295
He was working at a company called
Straf Investments when he was taken.

150
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:18,827
- Anything to do with them?
- Straf?

151
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:24,503
No, i don't think so.
I'll check the records.

152
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,880
I'm sorry i'm not really helping.
I'm trying.

153
00:08:28,036 --> 00:08:28,882
I'm not...

154
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:31,453
Hello!

155
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:34,391
Look what i found.

156
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,182
What are you doing in here?

157
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,484
She's yours?

158
00:08:39,932 --> 00:08:42,187
- Mrs. Kent? Where is she?
- Mrs. Kent!

159
00:08:42,758 --> 00:08:43,808
She's fine.

160
00:08:44,786 --> 00:08:46,086
She's a little smelly,

161
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:48,559
but, other than that,
she's a little cherub.

162
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:50,320
- Sorry.
- Mrs Kent,

163
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,448
please keep her in her room.
We discussed this.

164
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:54,805
Yes, ma'am.

165
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,703
Boss, ransom demand just came in.

166
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,289
Excuse me.

167
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,758
How the message came in?

168
00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:16,930
It's a video attachment
to an e-mail.

169
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:19,760
- Can you get the IP address?
- I'm trying,

170
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:22,808
but they routed it through
a bunch of servers. It might take days.

171
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,610
<i>You want me to read this?</i>

172
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,377
<i>My name is Mia Westlake.</i>

173
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:42,029
<i>I am not hurt.</i>

174
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,458
<i>I am being treated well.</i>

175
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,829
<i>For my safe return,</i>

176
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,464
<i>you must pay $3.75 million</i>

177
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,426
<i>in small, nonsequential bills.</i>

178
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:58,946
<i>This money is to be ready
by 6:00 pm tonight.</i>

179
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,415
<i>You will be instructed
what to do then.</i>

180
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:05,103
<i>Failure to comply will result...</i>

181
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:11,360
<i>in my immediate execution.</i>

182
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:16,076
<i>Any interference will result
in my immediate execution.</i>

183
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,659
<i>Verona, if you're watching this...</i>

184
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,777
Did you see the tat on that guy?

185
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,540
That looks like mexican mafia.

186
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:30,462
We're not gonna get anything out
of the Westlakes now.

187
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:33,126
- Let's go.
- $3.75 million.

188
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:35,676
Very specific number,
don't you think?

189
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:39,304
Maybe the kidnappers watch
the Westlakes' bank account.

190
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:42,003
I'll talk to Bosco about it,
then we'll go.

191
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:43,757
Okay. Take your time.

192
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:53,962
Excuse me.
We'd like some privacy.

193
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,427
I can understand that.

194
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,452
What's in your pocket?

195
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,297
None of your business.

196
00:11:00,004 --> 00:11:01,407
You just keep tapping it...

197
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,970
tap, tap, tapping it.

198
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:07,749
Whatever is in there,
you're obviously nervous about it.

199
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,453
I'm assuming it's illegal.

200
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:13,672
My best guess would be...

201
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:17,009
drugs.
Do you have any lemon?

202
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:19,219
I'm gonna go find your boss,

203
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:22,035
Be sure to tell her
about the drugs in your pocket.

204
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,182
I'll be right here
with your lovely wife.

205
00:11:25,347 --> 00:11:27,644
Please leave.
I just want to be alone.

206
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:31,602
That's what we all want.
No one gets it.

207
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:33,191
So there's no lemons?

208
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:36,757
- No, i don't think so!
- I really felt like...

209
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,698
Never mind.

210
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,557
Your sister needs you here now.

211
00:11:41,928 --> 00:11:43,368
As comforting as it might be

212
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,567
to crawl under the blanket of narcotics
that your husband has

213
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,789
so generously

214
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,292
procured for you,
it's better that you don't.

215
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,836
Nothing i do is going to help her.

216
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:56,131
Probably.

217
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:57,799
What's the point?

218
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,436
What you can accomplish
is irrelevant.

219
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:04,823
But if you are absent
in this moment,

220
00:12:05,878 --> 00:12:08,385
you'll regret it
for the rest of what will be

221
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:10,275
a miserable life.

222
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:13,342
That's all.

223
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:16,151
See you.

224
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,912
What were you doing there?

225
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:29,910
Just getting a snack,
a little light refreshment.

226
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:31,409
Why don't I believe you?

227
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:33,377
What is this?

228
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:35,331
This is proof of my veracity.

229
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:37,005
- Time to go.
- I'm gonna stay.

230
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:39,179
I know what this is about.

231
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:42,549
Bosco's got the Red John file.
You think if you hang long enough,

232
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,369
you'll weasel your way into it.

233
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,683
- Weasel is too strong.
- You're wasting your time.

234
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,419
Bosco will never go for it.

235
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:50,894
- Never.
- What?

236
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:53,814
- I'll never go for what?
- I like the way you work.

237
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:56,608
I want to work on your team
on the kidnapping detail.

238
00:12:57,095 --> 00:12:58,008
You do?

239
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:00,268
A live kidnapping victim
is so much more my speed

240
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:01,696
than a shriveled corpse.

241
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,633
Like I care about your speed.

242
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:07,109
You claim to have control
over this whack-job.

243
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:10,008
- Do me a favor and walk him away.
- Don't talk to me that way.

244
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:11,331
- You rude.
- Quiet.

245
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:13,607
Minelli gave us specific orders.

246
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:15,594
I don't give a flying.

247
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,827
- You this agent's boss?
- Why?

248
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:20,799
I want him removed from this case.

249
00:13:21,213 --> 00:13:22,369
Now, all right?

250
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:25,846
He's disrespectful,
rude and unprofessional.

251
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:27,791
He's just angry

252
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,850
'cause I called him
on his drug deal thing.

253
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,348
Okay, you're nuts.

254
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:32,936
Ihave no drugs.

255
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Liar.

256
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:38,024
I demand you take him off the case,
or there will be consequences.

257
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:40,110
Sir, that's not your call.

258
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:41,971
You think?

259
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,031
One phone call,
I can have you directing traffic.

260
00:13:46,523 --> 00:13:48,410
- Is that right?
- Yeah, it is.

261
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:50,100
Well, make your call,

262
00:13:50,225 --> 00:13:52,918
'cause he staying on the case
whether you like it or not.

263
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,374
Really?

264
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:56,084
Yes. You see this?

265
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,957
You see what he's done to my wife?
This guy's out of control.

266
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:00,281
Shut up, Duncan.

267
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,215
- I was trying to explain...
- Shut up.

268
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:05,969
Mr. Jane, is it?

269
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,143
What you said earlier was right.

270
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:14,467
I guess.

271
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,769
Leave him alone.

272
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:26,198
Okay then, it's settled. Have fun.

273
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:34,749
Wait.

274
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,739


275
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:40,853
S.F.P.D. sent over transcripts
of the interviews from the Haymer case.

276
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:45,212
You want names that begin
with "A" through "L" or "M" through "Z"?

277
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:47,205
- "A" through "l."
- You got it.

278
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,264
- Rather "M" through "Z."
- Too late. You already chose.

279
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,432
Come on.

280
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:54,476
Rock, paper, scissors? Step up.

281
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,991
Bert, can I get
on this rock, paper, scissors?

282
00:14:57,116 --> 00:14:59,564
I haven't had a really good game
since I was, 10.

283
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,150
It's Rigsby.

284
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,950
I know.

285
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:08,073
Why he called me Bert?

286
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:10,111
I'm sure I don't know.

287
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:12,869
It's Bert, like the muppet.

288
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:15,205
It's a stupid nickname.

289
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:16,540
It mean anything.

290
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,543
Bosco's team
calls us Bert and Ernie.

291
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,919
- You knew that?
- It would bother you.

292
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:24,548
- It doesn't bother you?
- Ernie's the clever handsome one.

293
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:28,218
- Where's Jane?
- With Bosco.

294
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,226
Don't ask me why,
'cause I don't know and I don't care.

295
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:32,452
What do you got?

296
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:35,600
I've been checking out the house
where we found Haymer's body.

297
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,728
It's been abandoned seven years.

298
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,766
There were some complaints
about squatters five, six years ago.

299
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:42,861
Nothing else.

300
00:15:42,986 --> 00:15:45,652
There's a Louis Earlen
to see you in your office.

301
00:15:46,368 --> 00:15:48,118
- Keep digging.
- Right.

302
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:51,533
Lieutenant Earlen.

303
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:54,327
- Thanks for coming.
- Louis, please. I'm retired.

304
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:57,205
So you found poor Colin Haymer?

305
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:58,702
We did.

306
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,627
You were in charge
of the kidnapping investigation,

307
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,210
- right?
- I was.

308
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:06,399
Spent a lot of time
with the Haymer family.

309
00:16:06,642 --> 00:16:08,758
- Have they been notified?
- They have.

310
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:11,191
Hope it's some kind of consolation.

311
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:12,971
They've been waiting a long time.

312
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:16,099
We have another kidnapping.
Maybe the same people are involve.

313
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:18,810
How can I help?

314
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:20,812
Anybody we should take a look at?

315
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:23,890
Tall order.
We looked at a lot of people.

316
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:26,394
We were wondering
if maybe it was an inside job.

317
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,611
The ransom demand

318
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:29,019
was pretty specific.

319
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:30,405
We considered that.

320
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,077
I always had a feeling
about Colin's girlfriend.

321
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,328
- It's just a feeling.
- Remember her name?

322
00:16:37,107 --> 00:16:38,207
Diane Zar...

323
00:16:39,002 --> 00:16:40,002
Zaranski.

324
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:43,251
Talked to her twice.

325
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:45,045
When's the ransom drop?

326
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,394
Tonight, 6:00.

327
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,674
The night Colin's ransom got paid,

328
00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:52,897
I sat with his parents till morning.

329
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:56,263
Just waitin' to hear, he was safe.

330
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:59,225
Don't think we said ten words.

331
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,834
If it is the same people
that took Colin,

332
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:12,113
you do this girl's family a favor.

333
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,135
Money drops at 6:00.

334
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,077
You tell them their child is dead,
give 'em a chance to get used to it.

335
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:21,790
It would be a kindness.

336
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:36,179
- I might have something.
- What?

337
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:38,627
Those squatters in the house
where we found Haymer.

338
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:39,849
Drug dealers.

339
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,240
Oakland narcotics

340
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:43,478
said they're an extended family,
8 or 10 people.

341
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:46,733
<i>They grew pot on a farm
called Crazy Hill in Goodhue county,</i>

342
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,102
brought it into Oakland
and sold it out of the house.

343
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:50,902
And this has to do with Haymer how?

344
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,318
Apparently, they also sold drugs
that they bought from border cartels,

345
00:17:55,443 --> 00:17:57,970
and they picked up
some of the cartels' habits

346
00:17:58,095 --> 00:17:59,411
like kidnapping for cash.

347
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:02,664
So they went from dealing pot
to kidnapping wealthy kids?

348
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,453
- Less effort, more profit.
- Do you have any names?

349
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:07,547
<i>Known as the Crazy Hill Gang.</i>

350
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:10,983
One of the them was nicknamed
"Deezer." Nobody knows his real name.

351
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:14,115
Deezer's been hanging
around an apartment in west Oakland.

352
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
Let's check the building out.

353
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:18,138
Forgot my extra mags.
Meet you downstairs.

354
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,808
"Extra mags." Big man.

355
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,697
- Where's your vest?
- Don't need one.

356
00:18:24,992 --> 00:18:26,855
- Sure you do.
- We're just canvassing.

357
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:31,985
For people called the "Crazy Hill Gang."
You should wear a vest.

358
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,687
Look, it's hot.
It's uncomfortable.

359
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:36,573
Hicks isn't wearing one.

360
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:38,783
You're afraid he'll make fun of you?

361
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,417
Not at all.

362
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,871
Don't be an idiot.
Put on a vest.

363
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:51,906
Fine, get shot. See if I care.

364
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:04,112
There you go.

365
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:06,811
- One more?
- She likes you.

366
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,229
She has good taste.

367
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:11,608
- You're good with children.
- Unlike your employers?

368
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,485
What?

369
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:16,780
Come on. It's clear to see
they're skittish about the parenting.

370
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:18,364
I wouldn't know anything.

371
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,660
Verona's low self-esteem makes her
doubt she'll ever be a real parent.

372
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:25,561
And because Duncan married her for

373
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:26,824
her money.

374
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,791
He sees the child as a rival,
in more than the usual Freudian term.

375
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,544
They're very caring people.

376
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:34,166
Very loving,

377
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,932
just not particularly hands-on,
if you know what i mean.

378
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,694
How's Duncan's relationship
with Mia?

379
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:44,432
It can be hard.

380
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:47,038
It makes sense.

381
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:50,104
If he sees his child as a rival,
why not his sister-in-law?

382
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:54,028
I've heard angry words between them.

383
00:19:55,204 --> 00:19:57,028
I think Mia doesn't trust him.

384
00:19:58,092 --> 00:19:59,070
But...

385
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:00,630
i shouldn't say anything.

386
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:03,692
But you did.

387
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,038
We got to go.

388
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:10,687
All right.

389
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:13,127
Gotta go and run an errand
with the big, serious man.

390
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,046
Come on. Let's go.

391
00:20:15,436 --> 00:20:16,436
Bye.

392
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:29,977
So what's the deal here?

393
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:32,716
The tattoo
on the kidnapper's arm suggests

394
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,329
The mexican mafia might be involved.

395
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:37,520
Those guys. They're members.

396
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:39,654
So we're gonna go talk to 'em.

397
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:41,614
They look scary.

398
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,969
They are scary.

399
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:45,201
You've become a full member
until you've killed.

400
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,915
Maybe I'll just wait here.

401
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,334
No, you're coming with me.
I need you for backup.

402
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:00,217
Backup?

403
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:05,680
Hey, fellas.

404
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,836
<i>Hola. ¿Qúe pasó?</i>

405
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:14,906
I'm agent, Bosco with the CBI.

406
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:17,086
- Agent Jane.
- Hi.

407
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:21,237
I was wondering if any of you fellas
have seen your man Snoopy?

408
00:21:21,768 --> 00:21:23,866
We need to talk to him.
Snoopy?

409
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:25,575
Snoop.

410
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:29,126
We're lookin' for him.
Ke'd like to talk to him.

411
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:30,413
Keep walkin'.

412
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,175
Who are you?

413
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:36,621
Why are you being that way?
I asked you nicely.

414
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:38,831
- Iasked...
- The name is Raoul,

415
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:40,548
and i ain't got no warrants,

416
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,926
- So back up, fool.
- Well Raoul,

417
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,511
We are gonna have
to go have a private chat in a moment.

418
00:21:45,895 --> 00:21:48,056
I ain't did nothing wrong.

419
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:50,813
Don't make it difficult.

420
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:54,520
Tuugh guys, huh?

421
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,482
Depends on what you mean by "tough."
Emotionally resilient?

422
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:01,732
So now you gonna play me, too?

423
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:04,864
That's battery on a state officer.

424
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:08,159
- Now i'm gonna have to take you in.
- Barely touched him, homes!

425
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,620
We're gonna go have
a conversation about respect.

426
00:22:11,535 --> 00:22:12,330
And you?

427
00:22:12,938 --> 00:22:13,790
Come on.

428
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:15,166
Anybody else?

429
00:22:15,432 --> 00:22:17,210
- You? You?
- All right.

430
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:18,795
I'm waiting. Move!

431
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:20,631
That's right, move.

432
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,382
That's right. Thank you.

433
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:26,063
How long have you been
an informant for the CBI, Raoul?

434
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:28,627
What are you talking about?
What informant?

435
00:22:28,752 --> 00:22:30,746
Come on.
You can come clean with me.

436
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,392
Who is this guy, Sam?

437
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:34,810
What did you tell him?
What's going on?

438
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:37,271
- Guess he just figured it out.
- It's kind of obvious.

439
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:40,066
As if you'd want me for backup.
Really.

440
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:43,069
Listen,

441
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,864
<i>You know about the Westlake kidnapping.
Is Emme involved?</i>

442
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:50,489
I ain't heard anything about that.
Westlake?

443
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,736
- You sure?
- Sure, no,

444
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,073
but when a big score's coming up,
I hear about it.

445
00:22:56,548 --> 00:22:58,960
People start bragging
even before they got the money.

446
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:00,878
I ain't heard nothing about that.

447
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:04,590
<i>We saw Emme</i>

448
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:08,122
- tats on the kidnappers.
- Come on. Anybody can get a tattoo.

449
00:23:08,247 --> 00:23:11,389
They were kind of showy.
A little too visible, don't you think?

450
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:13,975
Like it was meant to misdirect us.

451
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:17,315
That kind of stuff
is getting to be a real problem.

452
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:19,636
<i>People putting their crimes
on la Emme.</i>

453
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,026
You jacked me up for nothing.

454
00:23:25,717 --> 00:23:26,867
Thanks a lot.

455
00:23:27,227 --> 00:23:29,157
We really appreciate it.
Come on, get in.

456
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:33,024
Only now you gotta punch me
in the face.

457
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:35,413
- May be people watching.
- They're watching.

458
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,457
- Come on.
- Serious.

459
00:23:37,906 --> 00:23:39,167
Next time,

460
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,433
make sure
it's for a worthwhile question.

461
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:48,217
That was good, did that hurt?
Looks like.

462
00:23:48,935 --> 00:23:50,535
Watch your head there.

463
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,040
Get in there.

464
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:18,874
Thanks. That was fun.

465
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,001
No actual progress but,
certainly a lesson in life

466
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,036
- on the mean streets.
- That's what cops do.

467
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:28,674
We get a lead, we run it down.
Most leads don't work out.

468
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:31,135
We move on.
You don't understand that, do you?

469
00:24:32,963 --> 00:24:35,556
All this kind of hard,
methodical work we do

470
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:37,681
is somehow beneath you...

471
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:39,597
not your speed.

472
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:41,572
Please, get off your horse.

473
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:43,593
You wanted to frighten
and impress me

474
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:46,470
with your macho cop prowess.
Understandable impulse.

475
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:48,445
A little juvenile, perhaps.

476
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:53,043
You shouldn't be working with us.

477
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:55,788
- You're hurting people. You know that?
- Who?

478
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,563
The cops you work with.

479
00:24:57,816 --> 00:25:00,742
Don't kid yourself.
Their careers are taking a hit.

480
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:04,377
- If you care about 'em, you'll leave.
- Cops I work with, meaning Lisbon?

481
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:06,587
And her team.

482
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:08,249
But mostly Lisbon.

483
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,423
That ransom demand...
Did she talk to you about that?

484
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:13,911
Sure.

485
00:25:14,812 --> 00:25:17,084
And yes, it could mean
there's someone on the inside.

486
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:19,355
Be useful to know who it is,
don't you think?

487
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,930
We're working that,

488
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:23,146
But the ransom drop's
in three hours.

489
00:25:23,709 --> 00:25:27,468
We make a move on a suspect now,
all it'll do is spook the kidnappers.

490
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,753
They'll kill Mia,
and they'll scatter.

491
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:32,738
- We gotta make sure the girl is safe.
- She's not gonna be safe.

492
00:25:33,578 --> 00:25:35,822
They'll kill her 5 minutes
after they get the ransom.

493
00:25:35,947 --> 00:25:38,547
- Could happen.
- So she dies either way.

494
00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:40,200
We could try something.

495
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:44,208
- You want to hear what I have to say?
- Not interested.

496
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,376
OK, sure.

497
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:48,942
I was very impressed, by the way,
with the macho cop prowess.

498
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:51,770
Those guys,
they were genuinely frightened of you.

499
00:25:51,895 --> 00:25:54,340
You're absolutely cool.
You're good out there.

500
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:55,367
Go away.

501
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:57,392
Bullitt.
Like, really cool.

502
00:25:58,716 --> 00:25:59,716
Kojak.

503
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:05,827
Sorry to disturb you. We're looking for
an individual by the name of Deezer.

504
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,248
Might have lived in the building
or stayed with someone here.

505
00:26:08,373 --> 00:26:09,681
Never heard of him.

506
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:11,985
What about the Crazy Hill Gang?
Ever heard of them?

507
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:15,156
If you do hear them,
you call us at this number?

508
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:19,255
You want me to spy on my neighbors?

509
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:22,788
Fascists.

510
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:27,009
Make a new friend, Bert?

511
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,087
- Enough with the "Bert".
- Sorry. Hurt your feelings?

512
00:26:30,482 --> 00:26:32,298
It's just not funny, that's all.

513
00:26:32,556 --> 00:26:33,656
It's a joke.

514
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:36,772
You can't take a joke?

515
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:39,555
Excuse me, ma'am, I'm with the CBI.

516
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,225
- Could I ask you a few questions?
- Sure, what about?

517
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,305
I just think it's childish,
that's all.

518
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,103
And I just think
you need to lighten up.

519
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:48,492
Sorry. Never heard of him.

520
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:50,367
All right. Thanks anyway.

521
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:52,401
Maybe you need to grow up.

522
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,611
Idiot.

523
00:26:54,637 --> 00:26:55,802
Not... you.

524
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,784
Wayne Rigsby, CBI.

525
00:26:58,037 --> 00:26:59,825
Need to ask you
a couple of questions.

526
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:07,625
I was wondering
if I could leave a card with you.

527
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,678
Get in! Go!

528
00:27:12,517 --> 00:27:14,382
Hicks, cover the room!
Go, go!

529
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:21,305
Grace?

530
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,892
- Went out the window.
- I got it. Go!

531
00:27:37,263 --> 00:27:38,363
Just breath.

532
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:40,088
I can't see any blood.

533
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:42,445
The vest... I'm OK...

534
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,411
Go!

535
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,300
How you doing?

536
00:29:44,714 --> 00:29:47,868
They think a couple rounds
probably broke a couple of ribs.

537
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:50,037
They're gonna check
for internal injuries.

538
00:29:50,615 --> 00:29:51,965
I'm fine. Really.

539
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:53,618
Just...

540
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,536
my legs keep twitching.

541
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,211
Adrenaline. It'll wear off.

542
00:29:57,623 --> 00:29:59,713
Don't ever do this to me again.

543
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,248
No problem.

544
00:30:11,922 --> 00:30:12,744
Go inside.

545
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:16,426
See what, in the shooter's apartment,
can tie her to the kidnapping.

546
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,650
You okay?

547
00:30:27,697 --> 00:30:28,797
Hey, Rigsby.

548
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:31,858
Thanks.

549
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:58,747
My leg's still twitching.

550
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:05,779
I love you.

551
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:10,015
Thanks.

552
00:31:16,411 --> 00:31:19,161
I have to go.
They don't even know I'm here.

553
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:21,264
I'll call you later.

554
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:25,536
One thing.

555
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,205
What was that for?

556
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:32,732
Next time...

557
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,860
wear your vest.

558
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:37,353
I mean it.

559
00:31:39,328 --> 00:31:40,528
I believe you.

560
00:31:44,817 --> 00:31:46,117
Get out of here.

561
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,696
Is she all right?

562
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:02,336
- Thank God.
- Well, thank kevlar, actually.

563
00:32:02,863 --> 00:32:03,863
Hush.

564
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:05,965
This is our fault.

565
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,298
- What do you mean?
- Rigsby said that he and Hicks

566
00:32:09,423 --> 00:32:12,177
were going at it
when Van Pelt was shot.

567
00:32:12,302 --> 00:32:15,530
- That kind of bad blood starts with us.
- She's right.

568
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:17,964
This isn't about bad blood.
It's about professionalism.

569
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,339
There you go again.
You won't take any responsibility.

570
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:24,353
I. D. says the shooter's name
is Diane Zaranski.

571
00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:26,873
- You're kidding.
- Nope. D. Z. Deezer.

572
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,655
Diane Zaranski was
Colin Haymer's girlfriend.

573
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:33,413
S. F. P. D. suspected her
of being in the gang that kidnapped him.

574
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:36,365
The Crazy Hill Gang. Same crew
must have kidnapped Mia Westlake.

575
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,456
We know for sure they have someone
planted in the Westlake house.

576
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,918
- That's the way they work.
- We're running background checks

577
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,844
on everybody that's been inside
that house in the past six months.

578
00:32:44,969 --> 00:32:47,045
You'll catch anyone
with a background check.

579
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,994
- They plan too carefully for that.
- You do know how to catch him.

580
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,885
- Of course. I told you I do.
- Forget it.

581
00:32:52,174 --> 00:32:54,953
- You're not even gonna hear him out?
- He's got nothing to tell me.

582
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:57,224
You know what?
Jane's not the problem. You are.

583
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,643
You're so stuck on the idea
that he's not a cop

584
00:33:00,024 --> 00:33:01,353
you can't see what he is.

585
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:04,495
You know how many cases
he's closed for us?

586
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,842
You think he's given me bad habits?
I think he's made me a better cop.

587
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:10,613
- Thank you, Lisbon. Can I just...
- Be quiet!

588
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:13,443
If you're so sure you're right
that you won't even listen to him,

589
00:33:13,568 --> 00:33:15,075
then you're not a person I know.

590
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:24,465
I did hear you out,
and I still say no.

591
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,796
Got the money
and the instructions for the drop-off.

592
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:34,219
- How much time?
- About 20 minutes.

593
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,138
- You're making a mistake.
- Stop it.

594
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,825
- I'm just...
- Quiet!

595
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,035
Mrs. Westlake,
I need to speak to you privately.

596
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,410
- Agent, I told you...
- I know. Counselor, I'm sorry.

597
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:44,638
Stay here.

598
00:33:53,093 --> 00:33:54,293
Come this way.

599
00:33:55,205 --> 00:33:56,405
Right in here.

600
00:33:58,763 --> 00:34:00,070
You're not welcome here.

601
00:34:00,195 --> 00:34:02,706
I'm gonna tell Minelli you refused
to work with me. Face him.

602
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:05,593
- How do you like that?
- You really are a schoolboy.

603
00:34:05,718 --> 00:34:06,798
You know that?

604
00:34:06,923 --> 00:34:07,923
Just...

605
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:10,936
We're gonna do...

606
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:13,461
exactly as the kidnappers
have asked.

607
00:34:14,057 --> 00:34:17,646
That is the best way to ensure
that your sister will come home safely.

608
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:19,356
But we're gonna do one thing.

609
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,258
We're gonna put
this small transmitter

610
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,769
in the suitcase.

611
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:27,027
- Why?
- If they fail to return her,

612
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:30,360
it's the best way for us to follow them.
We think they're gonna take the money

613
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,184
- to where your sister is.
- Idiocy.

614
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:34,423
- What was that, Mr. Jane?
- This is ridiculous.

615
00:34:34,548 --> 00:34:36,335
You're gonna get that girl killed.

616
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,369
There's something
that you really should know.

617
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:41,086
Keep talking.
I'm gonna put my hands on you.

618
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:44,267
One of the kidnappers
is in this house right now.

619
00:34:44,818 --> 00:34:45,874
- Here?
- A spy,

620
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:49,075
a mole, reporting back to those
that are holding your sister.

621
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,631
We should be talking to them,
not playing with "Star Wars" toys.

622
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,485
- Oh, my God. Who?
- Come here.

623
00:35:07,381 --> 00:35:08,381
Her.

624
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,525
- You bitch!
- What? Jeez!

625
00:35:13,012 --> 00:35:14,278
You crazy bitch!

626
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,251
I'm gonna kill you!

627
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,777
My money's on Verona.

628
00:35:29,902 --> 00:35:31,513
Sandborne's got her on experience,

629
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:34,488
but it's hard to beat
that kind of enthusiasm.

630
00:35:35,985 --> 00:35:37,009
Got the image up.

631
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,730
- Nobody.
- There will be.

632
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:44,211
Somebody better come.

633
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,810
If nobody does,

634
00:35:49,296 --> 00:35:50,732
you just killed Mia Westlake.

635
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,448
Blame, blame, blame...

636
00:35:52,573 --> 00:35:54,623
Somebody's coming. Don't worry.

637
00:35:54,883 --> 00:35:55,944
And here they are.

638
00:35:57,169 --> 00:35:58,519
Hello, Mrs. Kent.

639
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,220
The nanny.

640
00:36:02,657 --> 00:36:03,869
Should we go get her?

641
00:36:05,603 --> 00:36:06,603
Wait.

642
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:38,136
Money's on its way.
It's clean.

643
00:36:38,261 --> 00:36:40,391
They tried planting a tracker,
but I caught it.

644
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:42,066
Get the girl ready.

645
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,325
- Hands where I can see 'em!
- What's going on?

646
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,630
Don't move.
Don't do anything unless I tell you to.

647
00:36:46,755 --> 00:36:48,611
I don't understand.
The baby is sleeping.

648
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:51,875
The baby. She's been wandering around
the house like a little lost lamb.

649
00:36:53,076 --> 00:36:55,026
You're just a terrible nanny.

650
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,966
- Who you talking to on the phone?
- My sister.

651
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,747
- Is she a kidnapper, too?
- No!

652
00:37:00,872 --> 00:37:01,972
What's this?

653
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:05,519
Let me go.

654
00:37:05,944 --> 00:37:07,260
Let us have the money.

655
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:11,084
- The girl might live.
- Put your hands behind your back.

656
00:37:12,684 --> 00:37:14,356
You are making a bad mistake.

657
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:19,570
If you people don't let me go right now,
Mia Westlake will be tortured to death

658
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,626
if they think you've done
anything to me.

659
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:24,157
No, they won't.
We're gonna go get her.

660
00:37:24,855 --> 00:37:25,993
Good luck finding her.

661
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,246
No need luck.

662
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:31,849
Let's go.

663
00:37:37,095 --> 00:37:38,100
Checking...

664
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:39,673
last number called.

665
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,509
767-555-0131.

666
00:37:46,749 --> 00:37:47,723
It's a landline.

667
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,689
1867 Cliff Point Circle, Oakland.

668
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,069
Call Oakland P. D.
Tell them we're taking the house.

669
00:38:38,595 --> 00:38:40,495
Get down! Drop your weapons!

670
00:39:42,322 --> 00:39:44,965
Thought I would resurrect
an old tequila tradition.

671
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:46,225
I'm in.

672
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,290
Cheers.

673
00:39:54,544 --> 00:39:55,544
Smooth.

674
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:56,944
Yes, it is.

675
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,815
So am I someone you know now?

676
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:04,842
I'm starting to recognize you, yeah.

677
00:40:05,918 --> 00:40:09,456
You know that thing you said
about Jane making you a better cop.

678
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:11,074
You don't believe that.

679
00:40:11,922 --> 00:40:14,122
I may have exaggerated for effect.

680
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:18,222
Anyway, I wanted to say...

681
00:40:18,474 --> 00:40:20,584
that it's been nice
working with you again.

682
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,510
You, too.

683
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:34,849
Anyhow...

684
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:38,283
Good night.

685
00:40:38,748 --> 00:40:39,603
Good night.

686
00:40:57,926 --> 00:40:59,134
I've been thinking.

687
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,835
You're not a cop.

688
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:06,386
You never will be.

689
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:08,642
But you have a...

690
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:10,587
useful perspective.

691
00:41:16,034 --> 00:41:19,434
This is a summary of the Red John case
since I took over.

692
00:41:34,055 --> 00:41:35,155
Take a look.

693
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:37,394
Tell me what you think.

694
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,666
- Don't thank me.
- I wasn't going to.

695
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:46,233
I need the actual case file...

696
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,213
