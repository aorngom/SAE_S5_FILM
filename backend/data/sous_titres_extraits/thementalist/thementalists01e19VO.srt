<i>MENTALIST

*Subs by Maiden*

5
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,220
The victim is Felix Hanson. 47.

6
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,870
Took three bullets to the chest.
No weapon found.

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,360
The coroner estimates the shooting occurred
sometime between midnight and 3:00 a.m.

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,450
Why is this one ours, boss?

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,260
Looks like a mugging to me.
Hollywood homicide can handle that.

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,420
It came from the big brass.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,030
Hanson was super rich, and he was a
California state representative for six years.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,180
Golfing buddy of the attorney general?

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,870
Correct, but not quite fair.
Hanson was a good guy.

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,440
He headed a campaign
against the drug trade.

15
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,160
He kicked butt, named names
and made a lot of enemies.

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,740
Wait a second. I know
this guy. He's semi famous.

17
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,390
He, uh, he was married to Felicia Scott.

18
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,930
She left the movies for him.

19
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,560
Felicia Scott?

20
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,760
Oh, come on. You know, she's
been in loads of movies.

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,600
"Sudden embrace". Love that movie.

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,610
Okay, my point is, if
this is drug-related,

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,430
The A.G. is gonna want to use all
of his resources to close this case.

24
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,430
Anybody hear shots, see what happened?

25
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,140
Nobody's come forward so far, but, uh,
Marilyn Monroe and Charlie Chaplin over there,

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,410
They were with Hanson when the
first officer arrived on the scene.

27
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,670
Any kids?

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,850
Daughter. 16.

29
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,670
- How you doing?
- Good.

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,590
You didn't happen to pick up a set
of car keys off this guy, did you?

31
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,710
Uh, no.

32
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,780
Valet ticket?

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,610
No, nothing in the pockets.

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,810
- Nobody walks in L.A.
- No. No, they don't.

35
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,370
So you didn't hear anything unusual?
- Nothing.

36
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,060
And where were you going
when you found the victim?

37
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,640
I don't speak, uh...

38
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,470
In the movies, no. But here in the
real world, you speak. You just did.

39
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,910
I'm saying nothing more.

40
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,520
Five hours we've been here.

41
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,640
For the umpteenth time, I was going home
from work. Victor was walking me to my car.

42
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,760
And what is your work?

43
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,710
I'm Marilyn.

44
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,520
How is that your work?

45
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,950
I stand on the street. People
take photos of me and give me tips.

46
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,640
- Why?
- I don't know. Where are you from?

47
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,210
What are you staring at?

48
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,590
You. What's your real name?

49
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,920
Norma Jean Baker.

50
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,960
What's your real real name?

51
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,410
Yolanda Quinn.

52
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,170
Yolanda, you don't actually look
very much like Marilyn at all.

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,090
You do this kind of work 'cause you
feel a deep connection with her, yeah?

54
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,190
- I guess.
- Yeah.

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,680
She was a lonesome soul, poor woman.

56
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,420
Longed for affection,
attention, acceptance.

57
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,320
She got it. She came out here, and she worked
hard, and she struggled, and she got it--

58
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,010
All the love and respect that she
longed for. And you can, too. You will.

59
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,860
You will, Yolanda, if you
do the right thing now.

60
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,680
What thing?

61
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,700
Hand over the valet ticket, Yolanda,
that you stole from the dead man.

62
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,790
- I haven't got any valet ticket.
- Then tell Charlie to hand it over.

63
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,190
- Give him the ticket.
- Son of a bitch.

64
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,230
Give it!

65
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,850
Thank you.

66
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,760
- Can we go?
- Sure.

67
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,250
I'll keep the cops at bay. You guys run.

68
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,230
Run! Run! Go, go, go, go, go! Run!

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,950
Nice. I could arrest you for that.

70
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,940
You'll never take me alive, copper.

71
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,340
- Seriously.
- Seriously, it's Marilyn and Charlie.

72
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,760
What, do you want to make a comedy arrest, see
your name written in the weird news section?

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,570
Where did he valet?

74
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,390
At Musso & Frank's, down the block.

75
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,270
After you're done here, go
back to the restaurant.

76
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,690
Go through the credit card receipts.

77
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,510
- Find out who he was having dinner with last night.
- Will do.

78
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,690
Uh, boss?

79
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,710
So I guess it is drug trade-related--
but not in a good guy way.

80
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,590
<font color=#EAADEA>The Mentalist
Season01 Episode19 A Dozen Red Roses</font>

81
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,100
And I want to pull back
really, really slowly.

82
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,890
Then I want to pick up a little
piece of that, do a tilt up, okay?

83
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,020
And at the same time, simultaneous,
they're gonna come to the window.

84
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,780
And we're gonna catch them
when they come out the window.

85
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,130
- Gabriel Fanning?
- Yeah, that's me.

86
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,850
CBI. We want to talk to
you about Felix Hanson.

87
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,380
Why? What did he do?

88
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,570
- He died last night.
- What?

89
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,820
Is there somewhere we can talk?

90
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,220
Yeah, back over here.

91
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,470
Last night at dinner with Felix, both
of your credit cards were charged at 11:30.

92
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,290
You stay at the restaurant much longer?

93
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,410
No, we left soon after that.

94
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,450
We were having a good time, but, um,
I wanted to be up early this morning.

95
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,180
Tomorrow is the first day of production.

96
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,490
What is the production?

97
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,460
"A Dozen Roses". I'm directing.

98
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,030
Felix financed the picture.
That's why we were having dinner.

99
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,950
We were celebrating his first
foray as a film producer.

100
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,980
How did he get into film producing?

101
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,130
He's, uh, married to Felicia Scott.

102
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,680
She's starring in the movie.

103
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,690
Felicia Scott. Remind me?

104
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,630
Come on. Felicia Scott?

105
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,050
"Love Times Two".
"Baby, You're Mine".

106
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,850
- "Sudden Embrace".
- "Sudden Embrace".

107
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,770
Sounds familiar. Those were all a
while back, though, weren't they?

108
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,770
She looks better now than she did then. Just as good, anyhow.

109
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,260
So what's this movie about?

110
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,560
A mother's quest to find
good men for her three daughters.

111
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,070
It's funny. It's moving. It's sexy.
- Can I read it?

112
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,960
No you can't read it.

113
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,960
- It's about family and redemption and...
- Gotcha.

114
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,680
Did you and Felix get along?
You ever have any arguments?

115
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,520
I loved him. Loved him.

116
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,500
So many people in this town are phonies.

117
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,010
But Felix Hanson, he was real.

118
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,310
Felix, he didn't like
something, he'd say so.

119
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,290
What in particular he did not like?

120
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,860
Nothing. I'm just saying in general.

121
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,470
He was like that. Real.

122
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,630
How much did he have invested in the film?

123
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,540
- Ten.
- Million? Of his own money?

124
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,820
Yep. He's a brave man. Doing it all for Felicia,
of course, not just for the potential profits.

125
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,470
Did you two leave the restaurant together?

126
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,620
We walked out together, yeah.

127
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,840
Was anybody waiting for him?

128
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,440
I didn't see anybody. I
parked my car down the street.

129
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,950
We shook hands and said good-bye.

130
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,790
Do you own a gun, Gabriel?

131
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,960
No. I like guns, but I'm afraid
of blowing my own head off.

132
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,790
Yeah.

133
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,450
What do you think?

134
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,050
Oh, he's lying. They had an argument last night.

135
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,300
You go out to celebrate with
the man that financed your movie,

136
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,530
And you only pay half the dinner bill?

137
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,570
Van Pelt? We need Gabriel Fanning痴' cell
phone records from last night.

138
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,340
Sure. And while I have you,

139
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,450
the last number dialed on Hanson痴' cell was
blocked, so I had the phone company trace it.

140
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,930
- Belonged to a Frederick Ross.
- Who?

141
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,450
Oh, just a convicted felon with
multiple possession and assault charges.

142
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,050
Beautiful. Find out where he
is, and have the boys pick him up.

143
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,650
Okay. Wait a minute. I know this guy.

144
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,820
He's on that beer commercial.

145
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,030
Oh, the one with the lama?

146
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,830
What?

147
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,630
This Ross guy. He must be an actor, too.

148
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,190
You know that beer commercial
with the guy wearing the toga?

149
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, and we're all supposed to be
surprised when the toga gets caught in the elevator.

150
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,370
Yeah, that's him. Weird, huh?

151
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,850
Yeah he should've stuck to his day job.

152
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,440
You have the address?

153
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,990
Yeah, okay, wait.

154
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,300
- Go pick him up.
- Yes, ma'am.

155
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,560
We're sorry for your loss.

156
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,760
How long were you two together?

157
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,480
We've been married almost eight years now.

158
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,690
Where were you last night?

159
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:31,260
Palm Springs. Felix insisted I have a
spa weekend before filming started.

160
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,080
- And you?
- At home.

161
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,090
Was there anybody in your husband痴
life who posed a threat to him?

162
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,160
Somebody he didn't feel safe around?

163
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,890
No.

164
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,770
We found...
- What was it that first attracted you to your husband?

165
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,940
Not his looks.

166
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,230
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really. He not your type.

167
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,360
And what is my type?

168
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,490
Sporty bad boys with a
hidden masochistic streak.

169
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,840
Not too bright.

170
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,260
Not even close.

171
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,020
No, that was a bulls' eye.

172
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,310
So what did you like about Felix?

173
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,030
His voice. His self-assurance.

174
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,610
I don't understand how
these questions are relevant.

175
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:21,400
Oh, no reason. Just, uh, curious.

176
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:28,920
We found a large bag of marijuana and various other
prescription drugs in the trunk of your husband's car.

177
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,030
- Well, that's absurd.
- Why?

178
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,100
Because Felix didn't do drugs. Period.

179
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,800
They've been planted.

180
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,040
I'm  straight edge. Have been for years.

181
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,060
Do you know anybody named Freddie Ross?

182
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,600
No. Who is that?

183
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,100
It's mine.

184
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,210
It's Gabriel痴' assistant. He wants us
to report to set for rehearsals.

185
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,610
Tell him we'll be there on time.

186
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,080
I'm  sure they would understand
if you don't go in to work today.

187
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,240
Oh, believe me, I would like to
back out of the whole project.

188
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,440
With Felix gone, there is no point.

189
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,680
But the insurance company
holding me to my contract.

190
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,690
They won't even cover any delays,
and I don't want end up in court.

191
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,410
You in the movie, too?

192
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,370
Kind of.

193
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,240
We gave her a small speaking
role as one of my daughters.

194
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,020
Isn't that cute?
- Yeah.

195
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,760
Do you wanna be an actress?

196
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,790
Whatever. Not anymore.

197
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,430
Honey, I know it's hard now but
one day you might be glad that

198
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,450
you were a part of something that
so important to your father.

199
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,260
He didn't think this film was important?

200
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,070
No, he thought Gabriel
screwed up the script.

201
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,860
He wanted to back out of the film.

202
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,910
Oh, don't be a drama queen.

203
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,710
He wasn't happy with the script, but that's
why he met with Gabriel, to talk it through.

204
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,450
He wasn't gonna back out.

205
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,420
He may have threatened to back out to
get what he wanted that's how it works.

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,280
So who's the fella?

207
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,800
Brandon.
- Brandon who?

208
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,380
Brandon Fulton ,

209
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,170
Oh, you guys, uh, dating?

210
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,870
Dating? No. Maybe. Sort of.
That's so nerdy, dating.

211
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,390
Your stepmother didn't like him?

212
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,620
No. Thank you for not saying anything.

213
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,730
Nah, forget it.
- We'll being you, Sydney.

214
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,840
Brandon Fulton.
- I知 on it.

215
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,710
Freddie Ross, apartment 23.

216
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,630
Supposedly this guy's also an actor.

217
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,720
He was in that beer commercial.
- The one with the lama?

218
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,340
No, the one with the guy in the toga.

219
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,460
Yeah?
- Yeah.

220
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,160
Stupid.

221
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,850
Nobody home.

222
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,770
Stop! Police!

223
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,150
Hey, hold it.

224
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,050
Freddie Ross! CBI!

225
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,100
Stop!

226
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,820
Hey, get out of the car!

227
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,050
Crap.
- It's okay. I got the plate.

228
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,620
I just spoke to Minnelli.
The warrant's on its way.

229
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,400
Okay, boss. We'll wait here for it.

230
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,830
Yeah, search Ross' place. The L.A.P.D. should be...

231
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,780
Yeah, they've been helpful so far.

232
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,220
It shouldn't be long.
- All right.

233
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,080
We'll keep you posted, boss.

234
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,470
Hey, kid.

235
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,260
Hello?
- It's a closed set. What does that mean?

236
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:06,980
Hello?

237
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,880
I'll call you back.
- Okay.

238
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,100
Warrant's on its way.

239
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,630
This is a closed set. What's it mean?

240
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,850
Closed set.

241
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,910
I know what it means,
but they're from the CBI.

242
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,470
I don't care if they're
from a far away galaxy.

243
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,340
This is a closed set, okay?

244
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,770
No gawkers, no fans.

245
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,320
We're not fans.
- Well, I知 sort of a fan.

246
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,430
California bureau of investigation.

247
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,750
We need to speak with Gabriel Fanning.

248
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,300
Oh, he can't talk to you right now.

249
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,700
It's regarding a murder investigation.

250
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,640
I知 Mitch Cavanaugh, Gabriel's agent.

251
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,290
Hey, Mitch.

252
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,740
How you doing?
- Good.

253
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,950
I heard about what
happened to Hanson. Tragic.

254
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,560
I mean, such a cool guy. Truly.

255
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,600
We're trying to make
a movie here, though.

256
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,730
Yeah, well, we're trying
to solve a homicide.

257
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,360
He can't talk to you right now.

258
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,830
You keep this up, I'll have
you arrested for obstruction.

259
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,690
That's unfortunate, but go ahead.

260
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,730
I understand, Mitch. Gabriel's one of
your top clients. You can't lose him.

261
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,970
Right.

262
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,800
No choice, whatever he says.
He says "jump", you jump.

263
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,200
Bullied at school, were you?

264
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,190
I was not, actually.

265
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,550
Sure you were. Even after all these
years, you lie awake sometimes,

266
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,260
thinking of all the ways that you
could wreak revenge on your tormentors.

267
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,460
And now out of fear and avarice, you let
this man Fanning bully you the same way.

268
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,590
Mitch, it's the same way. It's same thing.

269
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,240
You gotta get a life.

270
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,660
Or get arrested.

271
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,950
Go ahead.

272
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,690
That was strong.

273
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,920
Look at the size of this thing!

274
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,750
Great. Mitch, you little scum sucker.

275
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,290
Class "A". You have a
prescription for these?

276
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,760
What is this? Come on. Jesus!

277
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,120
Sit down. We have a few
follow-up questions for you.

278
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,430
Didn't we do this earlier? I already
answered all your questions.

279
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,100
Well, that was before we knew that
you were a liar and a drug abuser.

280
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,220
I don't abuse drugs. I use them.

281
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,740
They're for creativity.

282
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,480
Ah, but you don't deny being a liar.

283
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,370
I didn't lie. I spun the
truth a little bit, maybe.

284
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,170
Why don't you try giving
it to us straight?

285
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,810
Felicia blabbed, didn't she? Stupid bitch.

286
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,910
Fine.

287
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:36,240
Yes, Hanson told me last night that he
was pulling his money out of the movie.

288
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,640
The day before principal
photography, the schmuck.

289
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,720
Without his money, production
would have shut down?

290
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,840
Yes.

291
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,780
This is your first feature
in what, seven years?

292
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,940
Word on the street is you're a
little, little difficult to work with.

293
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,710
Oh, really? Is that what
the word on the street is?

294
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,840
Well, you know what? Screw
the word on the street.

295
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,420
I took some time out to recharge.

296
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,260
I've been, uh, exploring
other aspects of my life.

297
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,440
Narcotics and despair?

298
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,590
It's been tough, okay?

299
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,310
I've come very close to
having to take a TV gig.

300
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,240
So yes, I知 extremely
anxious for this film to work.

301
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,780
I need it to work.

302
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,880
Hanson痴' death was
awfully convenient then.

303
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,670
Yeah, it was. It was.

304
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,890
And when you told me he was
dead, my heart leapt for joy.

305
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,290
And then I felt terrible.

306
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,340
And then you felt good again.

307
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,820
Listen, I知 an artist, okay?

308
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,770
I'm arrogant, I'm dishonest and I'm
childish. But you know what? I'm not stupid.

309
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,090
I do not think I'm above the law.
- Gabe.

310
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,650
Felicia's on set, ready to go.

311
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,780
Thanks, Mitch, you incompetent weasel.
- Wait a minute.

312
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,930
Lady, I have a movie to shoot.

313
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,190
And we've got a narcotics
charge we can't ignore.

314
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,870
Those aren't my drugs.
Those are Mitch's drugs.

315
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,130
Right, right. That's not
Gabe's drugs. That's my drugs.

316
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,500
Sorry, Gabe. I shouldn't have
left them around the trailer.

317
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,580
How dumb is that?

318
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,080
Can I go, ma'am?

319
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,340
Go win an Oscar, Gabe.
- Yeah, yeah.

320
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,660
Mitchell Cavanaugh, you are under arrest.

321
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,380
Oh, Mitch. And I thought we
worked through your doormat issues.

322
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,220
Tell Cho to squeeze him
a little. He knows things.

323
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,460
No, I don't.

324
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,520
Sure, you do, Mitch.

325
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,530
You're not gonna like
getting squeezed by Cho.

326
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,890
Action!

327
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,640
Daisy, where are you?

328
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,220
I知 home. I知 not feeling so good.

329
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,130
Oh, but puddin', you have to come.

330
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,570
Why? Why is it so important?

331
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,530
Line. Rowan's on his way.

332
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,190
Rowan.

333
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,850
Rowan is on his way.

334
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,390
I called him and pretended to be you!

335
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,010
Oh, mom. No, you didn't.

336
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,110
Oh, yes, I did.

337
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,300
I知 sorry, pudd'.

338
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:49,890
Rowan's not even interested in me,
and I don't want him anymore anyway.

339
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,260
I'm sorry. Sydney, honey. Honey.
- Cut!

340
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,510
You can't just read the lines, hon.

341
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,460
You have to be Daisy.
You have to be her.

342
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,110
I need your passion here,
Sydney. I知 working alone.

343
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,780
Okay.

344
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,910
Okay. Let's, uh, pick it up from where
we left off. Rowan doesn't need me.

345
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,020
Two pickup.

346
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,290
Rolling.

347
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,740
Speed.

348
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,240
Action!

349
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,850
Rowan's not interested in me, and
I don't want him anymore anyway.

350
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,160
Oh, honey, don't give up
on your dream so easily.

351
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:33,000
I know love can be tough,
but it's all we have in..

352
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,500
Hello?
Hello? Hello...

353
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,620
- Hi, Rowan.
- Good morning, Mrs. Atkins.

354
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,940
Daisy's not here.
She's, uh, she's at home.

355
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,090
Oh, that's all right. It's, it's
actually you that I wanted to speak with.

356
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,220
What you said just now, about love...

357
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,740
Cut! Great. Lovely.

358
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,270
Okay. Okay, everybody. We're
gonna go one more time.

359
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,410
Geoff, baby, don't flinch
before she throws the slap.

360
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,310
You don't know it's coming.

361
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,250
But she's taking a right
wallop. I mean, it hurt.

362
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,800
Oh, I知 sorry for feeling
a little emotional today.

363
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,380
Gabe, Gabriel, this scene is
still running really flat.

364
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,040
I, I have an idea.
I think I know...

365
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,140
We're in the master, babe.

366
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,840
We're really, really wide, and
you're about that big in the frame.

367
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,940
We're gonna fix it in coverage, okay?

368
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,240
I, I realize that, but I think
that it's an important establishing...

369
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,090
No, no, Gabriel, please. This is an
establishing moment for the character.

370
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,660
Die screaming, you malignant harpy.

371
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,330
I'm sorry. I missed that. What?

372
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,010
You know what? Let's take ten, folks. Okay?
- Okay.

373
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,750
- Come on, princess. Let's talk.
- Yeah, please.

374
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,590
You know... I know it's
an inch wide, you know?

375
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,740
No, I understand.

376
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,180
I realize that they're gonna cover...

377
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,610
You're good. You're a good actor.

378
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,070
Thank you.

379
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,870
It must have been tough when your dad took
up with Felicia, replacing your real mother.

380
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,120
My real mom is in an alcoholic
stupor somewhere in New Jersey.

381
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,910
I was happy to see her go.

382
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,240
- Why is it that actors...
- Bye.

383
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,060
All right.

384
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,790
So what do you know, Mitch?

385
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:44,980
Nothing?

386
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,130
Jane says you know stuff.

387
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,460
And he's always right, is he?
- Pretty much.

388
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,920
So this is one for the
books. It's a first.

389
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,960
I got nothing for you.
- Mitchell,

390
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,220
unlawful possession of prescription drugs
puts you in line for actual prison time.

391
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,480
I doubt that, but, uh,
if you're right, so be it.

392
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,510
Really? So be it?

393
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,540
I知 told the pills actually
belong to your client, Gabe Fanning.

394
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,860
No comment.

395
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,050
You'll go to prison to protect Fanning?

396
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,980
"Hey, how good of an
agent is Mitch Cavanaugh?

397
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,310
Well, he went to prison
to protect a client."

398
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,350
Sounds, sounds
pretty good to me.

399
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,880
"To protect a client, he became the personal servant
of a large and violent criminal." How's that sound?

400
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,710
Look, I'm willing to speak to you
on any subject you care to mention,

401
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,150
but on my life, I don't
know who killed Felix Hanson.

402
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,440
Give me some guidance here.
What, what, what do you want to know about?

403
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,010
Frederick Ross.

404
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,780
Ross? Freddie Ross, the drug dealer?

405
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,570
What about him?
- Do you know where we can find him?

406
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,230
Maybe.

407
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,800
Give us Ross, and you're
free to go, charges expunged.

408
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,760
Deal.

409
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,430
There he is.

410
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,230
I got the hoodie.

411
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,700
Hey! Stop right there!

412
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,840
Gotcha!

413
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,990
Okay, stop!

414
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,690
Sydney Hanson. Let's go.

415
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,240
Well, it's good to see you
again, in our custody.

416
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,930
How do you know Felix Hanson?

417
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,760
I never met the man in my life.

418
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,800
He called your cell phone
minutes before he was shot.

419
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,700
I was in bed.
- Can anyone attest to that?

420
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,330
Bruce.
- Where can we find Bruce?

421
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,170
Probably on my kitchen floor, chewing
on a pigs' ear that I left for him.

422
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,900
What did Hanson say when he called you?

423
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,810
He told me to stay away
from his little girl.

424
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,190
You sleeping with her?
- Come on. What is she, like 10?

425
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,230
16.
- Whatever.

426
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,770
I'm not a pervert. I know her boyfriend.
He's the one who'd buy from me.

427
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,670
Brandon Fulton.

428
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,700
Little bad boy.

429
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,450
Hanson had them both followed.

430
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,260
Shazam! Lead him right to me.

431
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,800
I really do have to get a
new system going, you know?

432
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,630
Retail drugs is for suckers.

433
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,550
So where's Brandon now?

434
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,580
I don't know. I mean, we never
hung out, except for business.

435
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,370
So Hanson found out that Brandon got Sydney
hooked on drugs and traced the drugs back to you.

436
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,600
See, you know, you should write that
down, you know, get a pitch together.

437
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,860
You got a murder, intrigue, young love.

438
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,560
Yeah, all we need is an ending.

439
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,910
Hanson wanted to do you some damage.
If you killed him off to protect yourself,

440
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,090
That's self-defense, justifiable homicide.

441
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,600
Thanks for the tip. Can I call
my lawyer now? Please?

442
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,220
How long have you been
using drugs, Sydney?

443
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,490
You sound like my father.

444
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,250
Yeah, well, you father wasn't
gonna throw you in juvie, was he?

445
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,280
That was your weed and your pills
we found in the car, wasn't it?

446
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,510
You're the man. You figure it out.

447
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,260
It must have made you pretty mad
when your dad took your drugs from you.

448
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,960
Yeah, well, it's not the first time it
happened, and I can always get more.

449
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,400
From Freddie Ross?
- From whoever.

450
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,310
Where'd you meet Freddie?

451
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,870
I don't know. Around.

452
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,720
Freddie says Brandon Fulton hooked you up.

453
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,660
Brandon's not like people say he is.

454
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,280
Brandon Fulton, actor, 19
years old, nine prior arrests...

455
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,330
D.U.I., drug possession,
disorderly conduct. Shall I go on?

456
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,920
Why do women love bad boys so much?

457
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,420
I don't get it. Why do they love 'em?

458
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,900
What do you think, Sydney?

459
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,750
Can I go now?
- In a minute.

460
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,550
Your parents forbade
you from seeing Brandon.

461
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,160
That's why you didn't want
your mom to see the picture.

462
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,060
Yes.
- Why didn't she like him?

463
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,240
You know, they said he was a bad influence.

464
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,510
Did he make you do something?

465
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:11,060
We needed some cash, so I
took some stuff from the house.

466
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,060
Like what?

467
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,860
Like stuff. Money, some old gun, pills.

468
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,500
Gun? What kind of gun?

469
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,370
I don't know. A gun.

470
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,730
Brandon sold it for cash.

471
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,090
You parents stopped you seeing
your prince. That make you mad?

472
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,870
Of course.
- So you just kept on seeing him?

473
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,100
No. No, I have not seen him.

474
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,670
Phone records say he's been
calling your house regularly.

475
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,850
Well, that's not... That's, I
don't, I, I don't know. Whatever.

476
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,070
Where is he now?

477
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,860
I don't know where he is.

478
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,700
You know, Brandon's not a bad kid.

479
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,170
He's just too old, way too wild for Sydney.

480
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,830
She said she stole a gun, along with
some other things from the house.

481
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,630
Yeah, it was some old army thing
that Felix liked to keep around.

482
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,690
What caliber?

483
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,760
A .45 I believe. Please, sit down.

484
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,420
You didn't report the theft?

485
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,160
No, it was a foolish girl's mistake.

486
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,490
Your husband was murdered with a .45.

487
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,500
No, that, that's
a coincidence.

488
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,580
Sydney loved her father.

489
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:27,480
No. No.
- What about Brandon?

490
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,560
He's a mixed-up kid.
There's no malice in him.

491
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,250
You knew the drugs in Felix's
car were Sydney's all along.

492
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,000
Yes.

493
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,070
You're good.
She... Wow.

494
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,120
Felix found the drugs a few days ago.

495
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,440
He was heartbroken because
she had promised to stop.

496
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,470
So he held on to them while
we debated what to do.

497
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,630
And now that Felix is gone,
what are you gonna do?

498
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,470
Forgive her. Show her love.

499
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:03,830
We all make mistakes, but we have the
power to give ourselves a second chance.

500
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,700
Do you know if Sydney and Brandon
were still seeing each other?

501
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,970
Did you ask her?

502
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,110
I did. She said she hadn't seen
him since you banned him.

503
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,150
Then I believe her.

504
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,410
He has been calling this house regularly.

505
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,030
Oh, god Sydney...

506
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,910
Brandon dropped out of sight
after the murder of your husband.

507
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:32,130
No. I... I refuse to
believe it. I... I refuse.

508
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,080
I need to see Sydney. When
can she come home?

509
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:40,230
She's on her way. There's no
charges regarding the drug offence.

510
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,470
Oh, god. Thank you so much for your
kindness and your understanding. Thank you.

511
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,790
That's okay. There's a lot of
leeway in juvenile cases.

512
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,310
I'll always be very grateful.

513
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,840
She was some woman to make the mighty
agent Lisbon blush like a schoolgirl.

514
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,890
Oh, please. I did not.

515
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,750
- You know what I predict?
- Nope.

516
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,140
- Guess.
- Oh, just tell me.

517
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,490
No, I think you should
guess. It's good for you.

518
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,490
I predict that Brandon Fulton will pay
a visit to the Hanson residence this evening.

519
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,120
You think? Wouldn't be too clever of him.

520
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,830
Well, love is not blind.
It's often pretty stupid.

521
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,090
I'll arrange a stakeout.

522
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,430
Oh, yeah. When I super
rich, I'm  gonna live here.

523
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,760
Can't beat the sound of the waves, ah?

524
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,020
They've got gadgets
that'll do that for ya.

525
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,370
The sound of waves on the
beach, jungle sounds, roaring fire.

526
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,600
Yeah, well, it's not quite the real
live Pacific ocean, though, is it?

527
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,190
It's cheaper, in the event
you don't become super rich.

528
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,000
Oh, I値l be rich. I'll be, I'll be super rich.
- I know.

529
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,430
The eagle has landed.

530
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,750
Crap. He's already
in. He must have keys.

531
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,940
Oh, god. Help me. Help me! Help!

532
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,840
Drop the gun, ma'am!

533
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,830
Get back.

534
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,540
Have I killed him?

535
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,600
Oh, god. Is he dead? Have I killed him?

536
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:04,440
This is agent Cho. CBI. We need
paramedics at 43565 Trancas Beach Road.

537
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,570
We got a juvie male with a
gunshot wound to the abdomen.

538
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,930
I just panicked. I, I just saw,
I saw the gun and I panicked.

539
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,970
I just panicked. Is he gonna be okay?

540
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,900
Hey, a .45.

541
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,340
Nice. Is he okay?

542
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,330
Hope so.
- What happened?

543
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,970
- Oh, my god. Brandon! Please.
- No, no, no, no, no.

544
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,830
Come on. No, no. No. He's all right. He's all right.
- Please.

545
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,620
What?
- Hey, boss.

546
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,740
Hey, we got a good news/
bad news situation here.

547
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,980
Now there are no guarantees, but as of now, there won't be
any charges pressed against you for shooting Brandon.

548
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,480
Oh, thank goodness for that.

549
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,760
Is he gonna be all right?

550
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,530
Yeah, he'll be fine.

551
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,460
Well, that's a relief.

552
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,330
I mean, I feel terrible, but what was he
thinking, sneaking around our house with a gun?

553
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,440
What does he say he was doing?

554
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,850
He's still recovering from surgery.

555
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,460
We're gonna talk to him as soon as we can.
- Okay.

556
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,300
The gun he was carrying was the
gun that killed your husband.

557
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,480
It's the gun Sydney
stole from your house.

558
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,320
Oh, my god.
- Yes.

559
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,900
Sydney may be an accessory to murder.

560
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,470
Why were you there last night, Brandon?

561
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,520
What were you planning on doing?

562
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,620
Before you Nazis shot me?

563
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,790
I was visiting my girlfriend.

564
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,600
We didn't shoot you.

565
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,080
Yeah, tell that to the judge.

566
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,810
I'm  suing your ass, big-time.

567
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,220
Yeah, okay, that's a plan.

568
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,350
Here's your
problem, Brandon.

569
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,810
The gun that you were carrying last night
was the same gun used to kill Felix Hanson.

570
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,870
The gun that Sydney stole for you, which
puts you both in a whole lot of trouble.

571
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,300
I have nothing to say about that.

572
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,240
Did Sydney know?

573
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,200
Did she know what?

574
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,510
Did she know you were gonna
use the gun to kill her father?

575
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,660
I didn't.

576
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,860
Did she ask you to do it?

577
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,970
- I didn't kill him.
- We know you killed him. That ship has sailed.

578
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,550
We're charging you with
the murder of Felix Hanson.

579
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,780
We just want to know if Sydney's involved.

580
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,330
You people have no idea who he really was.

581
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,010
He was a monster, total saddist.

582
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,640
A sadist?
- Whatever, man. He liked to hurt people.

583
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,690
And that would be a good reason to kill a
man. If he was hurting someone that you love.

584
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,230
Yeah, any man would do the same.

585
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,180
Did he hurt Sydney?
Is that what she told you?

586
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:35,080
Did she persuade you that he
needed to die? To protect her?

587
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:43,360
I'm saying nothing. I want my lawyer.

588
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,950
Hey, boss. He's lawyered
up and admitting nothing.

589
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,130
Tough to get a conviction
with what we have so far.

590
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,640
But we have the murder weapon.
We don't need a confession.

591
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,520
Yeah, the gun's a
double-edged sword, kind of.

592
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,490
Belonged to Felix Hanson,
was never reported stolen.

593
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,910
- And we recovered it in Hanson's house.
- From Brandon.

594
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,260
Or from the floor. We never
saw it in Brandon's possession.

595
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,650
And there's no recoverable prints.

596
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,010
In a courtroom, we can't put Hanson and the
gun and Brandon together in the same place.

597
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,000
So without an actual confession
from Brandon, we're stuck.

598
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,880
Or a confession from Sydney.

599
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,170
There's no way that Brandon did
this without her say so. Right?

600
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,900
That, my dear, is an excellent question.

601
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,330
Is Brandon gonna be okay?
- He'll live.

602
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,790
I want to see him. I need to talk to him.

603
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,620
And, uh, what would you say to him?

604
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,580
That's not your business.

605
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,540
I think I know what happened here, Sydney.
I知 wondering if you do, too.

606
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,480
Uh, yeah.

607
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:45,440
My boyfriend shot my dad, and
then my stepmom shot my boyfriend.

608
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,910
My life is like a sick joke.

609
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,390
So tell me, Sydney, why would Brandon
kill your dad unless you wanted him to?

610
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,900
Unless you asked him to?

611
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,570
I didn't ask him to do anything.

612
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,730
Can you look at me and say that?

613
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,360
I didn't ask him to do anything.

614
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,690
I loved my father. I did.

615
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,550
Maybe someone else made him do it.
- Who?

616
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,680
You tell me.

617
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,350
What are you thinking?

618
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,350
I'm thinking Felicia and
Sydney should go back to work.

619
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,320
Oh, really? Why so?

620
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:56,100
A great man once said, "All the world's a
stage, and all the men and women merely players".

621
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,640
Oh, really?
- Really.

622
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,660
Ladies, good morning.

623
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,030
How are you?
- Mm, fine.

624
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,790
Okay. Listen, I was
thinking before we roll,

625
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,900
why don't we just run through the whole
thing from the top for fun okay?

626
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,060
Don't worry about being on page too much.

627
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,300
Just use your instincts, and
let's see what happens, okay?

628
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,200
- Okay.
- All righty.

629
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,570
Shoot it.

630
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:27,580
Okay! Let's see how this goes.

631
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,810
And... Action.

632
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,710
Daisy, where are you?

633
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,030
I'm right here, mom.

634
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:40,270
Look at you, you look... Good.

635
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,880
Thanks.

636
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,560
What were you calling me about?

637
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,070
I just wanted to make
sure you were on your way.

638
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,740
Why is it important I be here?

639
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,860
I did a naughty thing. I called Rowan.

640
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,950
He's on his way. I pretended to be you.
- Oh, no. You didn't.

641
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,540
Oh, yes, I did. I知 sorry, bunny.

642
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,510
Why would you do that?

643
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,060
Why play games? You've already
seduced him away from me.

644
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,290
I did not. Why would you say that?

645
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,250
Stop acting! It's over.

646
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,850
I know what you did. I know who you are.

647
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,540
You've always hated me.

648
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:18,610
You seduced Brandon, and you lied to
him, and you made him kill my father!

649
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,260
All right. Gabe...
- No, you're not going anywhere.

650
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,390
Gabe, cut it. She's gone mad.
- No!

651
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,680
I'll let you go after you
tell them it's not true.

652
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,150
Tell them I知 wrong. Tell them!

653
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,840
I... It's not true. It's...

654
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,250
No, it's not.
It's... It's not.

655
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,580
It's not true.
- God, you're such a liar.

656
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,630
This is ridiculous.

657
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:45,600
I don't know what he said
to you, but it's nonsense.

658
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,320
This is upsetting to me and unfair.

659
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,210
Sydney, terrific. Just terrific.

660
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,590
You, uh, I知 not buying it.

661
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,110
You're wooden, high-pitched
believe it, Felicia.

662
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,690
Believe it, and then we will. Okay?

663
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,550
Let's try one more from,
uh, "This is ridiculous".

664
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,150
This is... I'm ... I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

665
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,580
It's easy to understand.

666
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,990
You told Brandon that
Felix was abusing you.

667
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,430
You persuaded Brandon to kill Felix.

668
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,980
When you feared
he'd confess to the police,

669
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,840
you lured him to the house,
planning to kill him as well.

670
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,480
But now Sydney sees the truth.

671
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:23,270
She knows that you're a
conniving, murderous bitch.

672
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,320
Way too melodramatic.

673
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,230
Your whole world is falling apart.

674
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:31,240
You're done unless you can convince
us that you are telling the truth now.

675
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,440
My w... my work is
always truthful.

676
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,650
There's a little afternoon soap in there.

677
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,560
That's a terrible thing to say.

678
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:53,380
Tell us the truth, Felicia.

679
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,270
Make it real. You can do it.

680
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,850
Oh, god, I知 sorry.

681
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,630
What was that? Speak up.

682
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:36,030
- I知 s... sorry.
- For what?

683
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:43,140
I, I was angry.

684
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:48,020
He changed his mind over
"script issues", he said.

685
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,600
He didn't want me out there, being successful,
having other men look at me and want me.

686
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,170
It made him feel insecure.

687
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,400
I gave up my life to be with him.

688
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:02,240
This is my life, and he
wouldn't let me have it back.

689
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:05,700
He was suffocating me.

690
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,730
It was a form of abuse.

691
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,140
Is Sydney here?

692
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,270
No, she's out.

693
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:33,770
Brandon came along at a weak moment.

694
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,160
Why don't you come sit down with me?

695
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,340
He forced himself on me.

696
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,290
I let him.

697
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:59,030
He told Felix that Sydney was
in trouble. Felix went right along.

698
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,210
It's Sydney. She's back
here, and she needs you.

699
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,350
Sydney!

700
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,700
Sydney!

701
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,760
What's going on here, Brandon?

702
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,830
You sick bastard.

703
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:33,340
He did love that daughter
of his. I'll give him that.

704
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:38,460
If only he could have
accepted me for who I am,

705
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,970
respected my needs...

706
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,810
This would never have happened.

707
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,060
Men are beasts.

708
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,500
Patrick, would you do me a favor?

709
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,230
Oh, I might.

710
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,050
Tell Sydney that I知 sorry.

711
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,850
I see now, on reflection...

712
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,200
I wasn't the stepmother I might've been.

713
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,040
I知 sorry for that.

714
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,240
I did try.

715
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:25,280
And I hope and pray that she doesn't
become bitter, hope that she finds happiness.

716
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,070
'Cause happiness is... So hard to find.

717
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:35,590
Once you find it, you
better hang on tight...

718
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,360
Or you will lose it.

719
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,610
That's true.

720
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,030
That's true.
