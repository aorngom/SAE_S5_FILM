1
00:00:29,816 --> 00:00:32,115
Boy, am I glad to see you guys.

2
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:35,398
We are sorely ill-prepared
for this kind of deal.

3
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:39,709
Quail hunter's dog found her
this morning at 5:30.

4
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:43,383
Wasn't meant to be hunting quail,
but he was.

5
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,005
Do we know who she is?

6
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,676
Nope. Looks familiar, though,
so I'm guessing local.

7
00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:53,348
People sure look different
when they're dead, though, don't they?

8
00:00:57,217 --> 00:00:58,697
That wound doesn't look fatal.

9
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:04,054
There's no ligature marks on the neck,
so she wasn't strangled or hung.

10
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:06,806
Gums are livid.
Eyes are hemorrhaged.

11
00:01:07,313 --> 00:01:09,613
- Suffocation.
- My bet is

12
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:12,297
it's a meth head from the city
coming in off the interstate.

13
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:14,077
No, he's a local.

14
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,580
And it was an accident. Her killer
didn't intend her to die this way.

15
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,624
- How so?
- She still has her clothes on.

16
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:23,016
Her abductor was taking her
to a location that was quiet and private

17
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:25,190
so he could undress her
for a sexual assault.

18
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:27,194
She made too much noise{\
at the wrong moment}.

19
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:30,218
He tried to keep her quiet
and smothered her by mistake.

20
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:32,961
No good to him now,
so then he dumps her

21
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:34,224
in a spot

22
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:36,432
only a local would know.

23
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:40,013
She's all yours. Thanks for waiting.

24
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:52,321
Why sexual motive?
Could be gangs or drugs.

25
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,326
- A drug trade smothering?
- By who... "Sesame street" crips?

26
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:58,121
{\There's n}Nothing to say
it isn't just boyfriend trouble.

27
00:01:58,394 --> 00:01:59,812
Could be boyfriend trouble.

28
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:01,411
Doesn't feel like it, though.

29
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:03,128
Who is this guy?

30
00:02:03,838 --> 00:02:06,288
He's a consultant.
You want CBI assistance?

31
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:07,881
He comes as part of the package.

32
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:09,799
Consultant, huh?

33
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:12,215
What, are you clairvoyant or some gizmo?

34
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:13,928
You got psychic powers?

35
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:16,925
No powers.

36
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:19,851
Had them once. I mean,
I pretended I had them, obviously.

37
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:24,372
- No such thing as psychic powers.
- So what is it you do, exactly?

38
00:02:26,962 --> 00:02:28,412
You know rock paper scissors?

39
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:30,862
- I do.
- Play me.

40
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:33,123
On three.

41
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:35,033
One...
Two...

42
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:36,865
Three.

43
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:06,221
<i>Sync: Kasius</i>

44
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:23,390
Go inside the house.

45
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:26,292
Go do your homework.
Get your homework started.

46
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:27,688
Go. Go now.

47
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:32,523
Joe?

48
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,074
Mr. And Mrs. O'Keefe?
I'm agent Teresa Lisbon,

49
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,332
California Bureau of Investigation.

50
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:03,203
I'm sorry. We're bringing bad news.

51
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:06,314
We found your daughter Melanie.

52
00:04:47,084 --> 00:04:48,084
Who are you?

53
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:51,085
{\My name's }Patrick Jane.
I'm with the police.

54
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:54,752
Is this your sister's room?

55
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:04,872
Did someone kill my sister?

56
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,737
She didn't come home from work
the night before last.

57
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:20,657
She waitresses
at the Shand Creek winery restaurant.

58
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:23,284
She was on until 11:00.

59
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:25,256
Her car is still parked there

60
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:28,004
- in the parking lot.
- We're always asleep

61
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:30,563
when she comes home.
We didn't even know she was missing

62
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:32,669
until the morning.
{\We c}Called all her friends,

63
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:34,671
and nobody knew where she was.

64
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:37,006
Nobody'd seen her
after she left work that night.

65
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:39,550
She was all set to go to college
in the fall.

66
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:42,006
She won a softball scholarship

67
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:45,436
- at UCLA.
- We were worried about her

68
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:47,934
going down to L.A.
because you read about all the crime.

69
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:53,856
Did they do anything to her?

70
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:56,435
Doesn't appear so.

71
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,486
She was fully clothed.

72
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:02,108
Why would anybody
do something like that?

73
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,532
Oftentimes, the first name that pops
into the mother's head

74
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:06,866
is the guilty party.

75
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:09,747
Jealous boyfriends, anything like that?

76
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:13,960
- Nothing like that.
- Nothing?

77
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:16,176
She was always shy of boys.

78
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:18,640
She was a good girl.

79
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:23,011
She took the purity pledge
in ninth grade,

80
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,707
and she still wears that ring today.

81
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:47,012
When did she take the posters down?

82
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:50,246
- After Christmas.
- Who was on the posters?

83
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,166
Boys with long hair from the TV.

84
00:06:55,118 --> 00:06:57,920
- She didn't like them anymore?
- Said they were for little girls.

85
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,467
{\Do y}You know who killed her?

86
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:39,629
- Are you gonna find out who killed her?
- Me and my colleagues are gonna try.

87
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:40,838
How?

88
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:44,467
Looking, listening, asking questions.

89
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:47,053
When you find him, will you tell me?

90
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:48,913
Sure. Why?

91
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:52,892
No reason.

92
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,405
- Rigsby.
- Van Pelt.

93
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:08,819
{\Did y}You get the fax
from the sheriff's department there?

94
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,043
<i>Run the details through the crime
database, see if we get any matches.</i>

95
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:13,754
- Okay, Van Pelt?
- Will do.

96
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:16,011
I finished the budget reports here
like you said.

97
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:18,668
- Why don't I drive down there?{\give you guys a hand?}
- No, you stay there.

98
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:21,633
- Look, I'll call you if I need you.
- She has a lover...

99
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:24,507
Someone she met
around Christmas at a fair.

100
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:27,329
He's either too old, too closely related

101
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:30,449
or too villainous to tell her folks
about. I'd bet on villainy.

102
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:32,473
His first name starts with an "H".

103
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:34,853
Explains why she wasn't wearing
a purity ring.

104
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,373
You know, it is the damndest thing.
I was at the Shand Creek that night

105
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:41,297
on a call round about the same time
that girl was taken.

106
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,430
A drunk wouldn't pay his check.

107
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:47,238
That is the damndest thing. You notice
anything that might be useful?

108
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:50,700
For crying out loud.

109
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:53,480
When I got there,

110
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:56,913
I saw a black truck, full-size, taking
off out of the other end of that lot

111
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:58,667
going way too fast...

112
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,337
Nearly went after him, too, you know?

113
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:09,168
What time was that?

114
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:11,527
A quarter to 12:00.

115
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,764
Have these woods been checked?

116
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,601
Not to speak of.

117
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:19,020
You might want to put
a few man-hours into that.

118
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:25,321
That's her car right there.

119
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,549
You want to take it?

120
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:31,851
She worked for us for...
three summers in a row.

121
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,822
Lovely girl.

122
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,257
This is good.

123
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:38,414
- Yes, it is.
- It's unbelievable.

124
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:41,853
And from the parking lot.
I was practically right there.

125
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:44,049
I can't even think about it. Mm-hmm.

126
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:46,382
Try this.

127
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,236
No, I won't.

128
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:50,391
- This one's really good.
- To your knowledge,

129
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:53,888
did Melanie ever have any incidents
with disgruntled coworkers, maybe...

130
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:55,336
Boyfriend problems?

131
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:59,250
This one is really good. Cardamom?

132
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:00,853
Yes, and caraway.

133
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:02,913
And a lot of butter.

134
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:06,150
There's no shame in it.
A lot of butter.

135
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:09,695
T{\hat's t}he great thing about food.
Indulgence and necessity all in one.

136
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:12,142
What time did Melanie leave work
that night?

137
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:14,368
To build a time line,
we need to know exactly.

138
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,578
I know she took off first, But I'd have
to check her time card to be exact.

139
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,165
It wasn't me, by the way.

140
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:24,252
I have a staff of 20 who'll tell you
the only time I ever leave the kitchen

141
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:26,180
is to take a leak or yell at a customer.

142
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,256
Sad but true.

143
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:31,260
So this is the kitchen.

144
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,595
This is the main prep area,
and this is where the magic happens.

145
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:39,183
Attention, Randall! Pay it!

146
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:40,672
My office is this way.

147
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:42,895
This is a go.

148
00:10:47,158 --> 00:10:49,576
She was by no means a gifted server.

149
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:52,228
"Betty butterfingers",
that's what we called her,

150
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,365
but she had a good spirit.

151
00:10:57,654 --> 00:10:59,370
She left at 11:25.

152
00:11:06,134 --> 00:11:08,115
- Good night.
- She went out that door

153
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:11,054
and that's the last we saw of her.

154
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,688
It's all reservations, I assume?

155
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,752
- Credit cards?
- Yes. I can get you a full list.

156
00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:19,492
- Great.
- Raquel, come in.

157
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,012
These people are here to help find out
what happened to poor Melanie.

158
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:26,069
Okay. Good.

159
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:31,735
You and she were good friends,
weren't you?

160
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:34,363
Not really. She was okay.

161
00:11:36,877 --> 00:11:39,759
Cause on her wall at home, she has
a picture of you and her together.

162
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,526
That's weird, huh?

163
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:48,067
I don't know why she has
a picture of me and her, ma'am.

164
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:50,373
Maybe she has a secret crush on me.
I don't know.

165
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:53,167
- What's her boyfriend's name?
- She doesn't have a boyfriend.

166
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,533
That's her thing, right?
Purity. No boys.

167
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:58,862
So who was it that she cut out
of the picture?

168
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:00,639
- I don't know.
- You were there.

169
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:03,243
It was Christmas. I was high.

170
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:07,214
Raquel, this is a murder investigation.

171
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:10,399
If you protect someone who did this,
you'll do time.

172
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,013
I'm sorry, ma'am. I can't help you.

173
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:15,613
I would if I could. Swear to God.

174
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:17,490
Thank you.

175
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:22,936
Car's clean.

176
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:26,585
Have a chat with Raquel, why don't you?
Gonna go check the credit card receipts.

177
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:31,712
Give me a minute with her.
She's got a super low threshold.

178
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:32,755
Nope.

179
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:35,424
Just stand in the doorway,
pretend you're making a phone call{\ for a moment}.

180
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:37,802
It's illegal and it's unprofessional.

181
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:40,137
That's why I need you
to stand in the doorway.

182
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:42,417
One minute.

183
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:51,819
Raquel, look at me.

184
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:55,740
Before you fall asleep tonight,
while you're lying in your bed relaxing

185
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,692
and slowly drifting off into sleep,

186
00:12:58,558 --> 00:12:59,929
I want you to think of me.

187
00:13:00,348 --> 00:13:02,335
Think of me
and imagine that you can fly.

188
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:05,954
Imagine you're weightless. You can float
gently into the air if you want to,

189
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:09,534
safe and calm and serene.

190
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,627
You can fly away, leave all your burdens
and worries and fears behind you.

191
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:17,294
Imagine that...

192
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:19,245
What a nice feeling it is.

193
00:13:20,552 --> 00:13:23,514
Next time you see me, when I say hello,
you'll remember that good feeling,

194
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:26,411
you'll want to tell me the truth,
'cause when you do tell the truth,

195
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:29,296
you'll feel that a heavy weight
has been lifted from your shoulders.

196
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,407
I'll say hello,
and you will feel as light as a feather,

197
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:34,600
as if you were floating on air.

198
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:38,904
Why don't you sit here a moment, think
about that before you go back to work?

199
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,266
Whatever.

200
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:46,036
Your friend's crazy. Can I go now?

201
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:55,337
Worked on the chicken.

202
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:57,536
Right.

203
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:02,720
Maybe that's a clue.

204
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:04,264
"Sorry"?

205
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:14,337
- Take it to the lab.
- I got a better idea.

206
00:14:16,016 --> 00:14:17,770
Settle down now, everyone.

207
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,529
These are agents of
the California Bureau of Investigation.

208
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:23,616
- They wanna talk to you a moment.
- {\There's n}Nothing to worry about.

209
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:28,319
We need your help.

210
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,872
Will you help us?

211
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:33,814
We know the identity
of Melanie's killer.

212
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:36,613
The murderer of that poor girl
is in this room.

213
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:41,888
This note...

214
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,303
was found in Melanie's locker.

215
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:48,946
We have strong reason to believe
that whoever wrote this note

216
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:50,809
is the killer.

217
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:56,548
Unluckily for that person,
my colleague, agent Cho here,

218
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:58,609
is the bureau's chief graphologist.

219
00:15:00,104 --> 00:15:03,044
Each one of you will be giving us
a sample of your handwriting,

220
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:04,782
left and right-handed.

221
00:15:06,212 --> 00:15:09,827
Cho will examine these samples and
determine which of you left this note.

222
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,580
Which of you is the killer?

223
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:18,337
Randall?

224
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:20,315
Back it up.

225
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:23,587
<i>Voilà.</i>

226
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:32,309
Randall, why did you want to say
"sorry" to Melanie?

227
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:35,396
- Didn't kill her.
- Didn't say that you did.

228
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,315
I asked why you wanted to say
"sorry" to her.

229
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:42,132
Your time card and your boss say you
left work ten minutes before Melanie.

230
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,738
You waited for her in the parking lot.

231
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:46,739
Right?

232
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:50,286
There's no law
against waiting for someone.{\ You waited for her.}

233
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:52,955
- I just wanted to speak to her.
- Nothing wrong with that.

234
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,625
You wanted to speak to her.
Then what happened?

235
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,252
I was like,
"Hey, Melanie, what's up?"

236
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:03,396
And we talked.

237
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:04,852
She didn't leave.

238
00:16:05,335 --> 00:16:07,427
She was smiling and laughing,

239
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:10,449
so I figured I was doing pretty good.
So...

240
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,515
I made my move, and...

241
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:15,268
she wasn't so into it,
which was cool,

242
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:18,472
only I know she has
this whole virgin thing happening.

243
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:21,025
So I figured
that I just have to be more...

244
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:22,776
goal-oriented.

245
00:16:23,653 --> 00:16:25,447
She was pretty upset,

246
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:29,079
She was pretty upset, so I apologized
for any misunderstanding, and I left.

247
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:32,036
I got in my car, and I drove off,
and that was it.

248
00:16:32,465 --> 00:16:35,495
Only I felt like
maybe she would still be mad at me

249
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:36,957
and, like, complain.

250
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:39,235
So when I got in to work this morning,

251
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:41,724
before I knew that she was missing,
I wrote " sorry"

252
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:43,326
and I put it in her locker.

253
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:48,448
How long were you in the parking lot
with her? Try and be precise.

254
00:16:49,163 --> 00:16:50,978
Five minutes. Six.

255
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:57,561
Randall tried to kiss Melanie
because he thought it was on his account

256
00:16:57,774 --> 00:17:00,119
- that she didn't leave.
- But in fact,

257
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:02,862
- she didn't leave because...
- She was meeting somebody else.

258
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:05,690
- Are we gonna see Raquel again?
- She's on her way in now.

259
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:12,719
I did the database search.
I'm e-mailing the results.

260
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,421
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

261
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:18,374
<i>It's not much.
One pop for the brand of silver tape</i>

262
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:21,033
used two months ago in Fairfield...
an abduction case.

263
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:23,921
- What happened?
- Delores Sanchez, a female, 22,

264
00:17:24,082 --> 00:17:26,346
migrant farm laborer
abducted at a bus stop.

265
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:29,843
Doesn't know how. Wakes up on a bed in
a motel room all tied up in duct tape,

266
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:33,972
<i>unharmed. The cleaners found her.
Never saw her abductors. No suspects.</i>

267
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,600
Fairfield PD concluded
it was a drunken prank.

268
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,478
The complainant Sanchez left town,
the case kind of drifted away.

269
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:42,814
- This is very interesting.
- Let's knock off on tangents already.

270
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:44,420
Any other correlations?

271
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:47,486
Sanchez is a redhead like O'Keefe.

272
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:51,155
Cool down.
It's a common brand of tape,

273
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:54,363
and there's a quarter million
redheaded women in California.

274
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:56,029
You're right.

275
00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:00,124
Just supposing, for fun, that
it was the same guy did both crimes.

276
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:03,721
He kidnaps a redheaded girl,
ties her up, takes her to a motel room,

277
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,046
has her at his mercy but does nothing.

278
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,454
Months later,
kidnaps another redheaded girl,

279
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:11,101
but his planning is not good enough,
and he kills her

280
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:13,637
in a panic to keep her quiet.
What does that say?

281
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,219
- He's an idiot?
- He's new to this, and he's conflicted.

282
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:19,601
He's hungry to do terrible things, but
his conscience

283
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:22,767
and his fear tell him not to.
So he's not yet going into this

284
00:18:22,887 --> 00:18:26,233
with the proper focus and planning,
and stuff goes wrong.

285
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,028
Or you're making that up,

286
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:32,076
and Melanie was murdered
by her secret lover.

287
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:35,909
We can be fairly certain she was meeting
at the exact time of her abduction.

288
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:38,537
<i>Excuse me. I'm still here.</i>

289
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:41,551
- <i>What would you like me to do?</i>
- Call all the motels

290
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:44,737
within 10 miles of Shand Creek.
Find one that had a cash booking

291
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:48,219
- who didn't show on that night{\ of the murder}.
- No, let's work the solid leads first.

292
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:51,766
Cross-check {\all }the full-size black trucks
with known criminals in the Napa area. 

293
00:18:51,886 --> 00:18:53,039
Yes, ma'am.

294
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,639
If the boyfriend angle doesn't work,
we'll look at your trainee psychopath.

295
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:01,097
I don't know anything,
so I can't tell anything!

296
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:03,937
I told them that.
I told you I don't know anything.

297
00:19:04,449 --> 00:19:05,773
Have a seat, miss Garcia.

298
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,350
Thanks.

299
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:12,821
Hello, Raquel.

300
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,328
Melanie had a thing
with Hector Romerez.

301
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:23,791
He's my second cousin.

302
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:27,738
I was with him at the fair one time,
and we ran into Melanie,

303
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:29,546
and then they were like...

304
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:30,958
Romeo and Juliet.

305
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:33,450
She was meeting him that night.

306
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:35,820
The night she died.

307
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,306
And I didn't tell you because

308
00:19:40,232 --> 00:19:41,573
I'm afraid of him.

309
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:45,979
The eight ball locos?
He runs all the drugs in Vacaville.

310
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:49,834
And he's had people killed for way less
than just snitching on him like this,

311
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:51,126
for real.

312
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:02,746
That was funny, the way
she gave him up so easily like that.

313
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:04,343
Yeah, it was.

314
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:06,817
But you were right, huh?
Secret lover.

315
00:20:07,217 --> 00:20:10,367
Guess I was wrong about
the whole red hair and duct tape thing.

316
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,528
- You hypnotized her, didn't you?
- I certainly did not.

317
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:21,948
- Yes, I did hypnotize her, but...
- But nothing.

318
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:23,802
It's unprofessional, and it's illegal.

319
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,862
- {\It's t}Totally out-of-bounds.
- That's what I told{\ him}.

320
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:28,146
I was gonna say
you had nothing to do with it.

321
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:33,058
You allow him to pull that stuff again,
and you'll be showing visitors

322
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:36,148
- around the statehouse in a stupid hat.
- Yes, ma'am. Understood.

323
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,453
I got a hot warrant in Vacaville.
You can get there in an hour, can't ya?

324
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,743
- Yes, boss. I'll get rolling.
- Bring Van Pelt.

325
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:44,663
- Yes, bo... for a hot warrant?
- Why are you still on the line?

326
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:47,263
Hey, come on. Let's go.

327
00:21:21,276 --> 00:21:23,493
Sheriff's department!
We have a warrant! Open up!

328
00:21:24,946 --> 00:21:25,954
Don't move!

329
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,183
He's out!

330
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:51,855
Put your right hand behind your back.

331
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:12,455
Out of nowhere.
Guy didn't know what hit him.

332
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:16,108
So what were you planning to do
if Lisbon hadn't stopped him?

333
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:20,140
I didn't bother to formulate a plan.
I knew she'd stop him.

334
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,013
Cho, Jane, Let's move.

335
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:25,027
{\You two f}Fill out the paperwork with the staties,
then go back to Sacramento,

336
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:27,015
- hold the fort.
- Yes, boss.

337
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,787
Hector, we're investigating
the murder of Melanie O'Keefe.

338
00:22:35,246 --> 00:22:36,543
Do you know who she was?

339
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,072
She was suffocated,
then stabbed to death,

340
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:43,345
dumped on the side of the road
three nights ago.

341
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:48,453
We know you and Melanie were lovers.

342
00:22:48,613 --> 00:22:50,753
We know you were planning
to meet her that night,

343
00:22:50,873 --> 00:22:53,250
and we can put your truck
in the Shand Creek parking lot.

344
00:22:54,346 --> 00:22:56,169
I've got enough to charge you with.

345
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:59,209
We just want to know
your side of the story.

346
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:01,911
How'd you two meet?

347
00:23:07,682 --> 00:23:09,349
Oprah and Dr. Phil here.

348
00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:14,520
I told her this is
how it was going to end,

349
00:23:15,232 --> 00:23:19,210
only it was going to be me that died
and her sitting here

350
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:22,529
with dumb cops asking dumb questions.

351
00:23:25,994 --> 00:23:28,665
"Why was a respectable girl
like you...

352
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:33,505
- "with a thug like Hector Romerez?"
- Why was she?

353
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,064
You wouldn't understand.

354
00:23:38,005 --> 00:23:39,057
Sure she would.

355
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:42,799
All women understand
the charm of a violent man.

356
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,119
What we had

357
00:23:45,497 --> 00:23:46,681
was special.

358
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:49,552
You made her feel
like a captured princess

359
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:51,567
instead of a small town choir nerd.

360
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:54,110
And she made you feel
like a dashing pirate

361
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,579
instead of what you are...

362
00:23:56,056 --> 00:23:57,056
sort of

363
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:59,139
a bad-tempered pharmacist.

364
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,307
Funny man.

365
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:08,992
Those pirates back then, they were
just banging like anybody else today.

366
00:24:09,993 --> 00:24:12,166
A pirate is exactly what I am,

367
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,829
and she was a princess.

368
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,055
She was.

369
00:24:17,986 --> 00:24:19,377
What happened that night?

370
00:24:22,153 --> 00:24:25,634
We were supposed to meet at 11:30
at the restaurant.

371
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:29,888
I got there ten minutes late,
and she hadn't come out yet.

372
00:24:31,698 --> 00:24:34,225
I waited for a few minutes,
and I left.

373
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:37,386
I'm impatient.

374
00:24:38,117 --> 00:24:39,233
I was angry.

375
00:24:43,897 --> 00:24:46,335
I will always hate myself for that.

376
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:49,014
I left her to be killed

377
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:51,833
because I don't wait for nobody.

378
00:24:52,297 --> 00:24:53,703
That's a noble admission.

379
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,624
How did you feel about the fact
she was going to college in the fall?

380
00:24:57,981 --> 00:24:59,162
I was proud

381
00:25:00,864 --> 00:25:02,087
and happy for her.

382
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:05,795
- She was leaving you behind.
- I wanted her to leave me behind.

383
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:09,010
I wanted her far away.

384
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,018
I told her,"Go to L.A.
and don't come back for nothing."

385
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:14,200
He told the truth.

386
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,766
You're just trying to be contrary.
Have you read his sheet?

387
00:25:16,886 --> 00:25:18,582
- {\Did y}You hear {\what he said}him?
- He's a good actor.

388
00:25:18,702 --> 00:25:21,945
- It was you who thought it was him{\ in the first place}.
- I said Melanie had a secret lover.

389
00:25:22,065 --> 00:25:24,605
- I didn't say he killed her.
- If it wasn't him, who was it?

390
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:27,445
And if you say a man who likes red hair
and silver duct tape, I'll scream.

391
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:30,977
- I don't want you to scream.
- You have your reasons. I understand.

392
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:33,476
But you're seeing more than
what's actually there.

393
00:25:33,596 --> 00:25:35,142
You have a tendency to do that.

394
00:25:35,262 --> 00:25:39,098
Not every murder is a secret
inside of a secret inside of a secret.

395
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,960
- {\There's n}Not always a hidden pattern.
- Not always, but sometimes{\ there is}.

396
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:44,561
Sometimes the obvious guy did it.

397
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:46,672
Most of the time,
the obvious guy did it.

398
00:25:47,822 --> 00:25:49,874
Look at the time line.
Hector's admitted

399
00:25:49,994 --> 00:25:52,372
he was in the parking lot
for ten minutes, give or take.

400
00:25:52,492 --> 00:25:55,513
There was no time for anybody else
to have entered the parking lot,

401
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:58,351
abducted Melanie and driven away.
It was Hector.

402
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:05,053
You're right. There's no time.

403
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:16,787
Hey, Frankie.

404
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:23,613
So show me.

405
00:26:24,928 --> 00:26:25,993
Show you what?

406
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:28,241
Your gun.

407
00:26:29,617 --> 00:26:31,468
- I don't have a gun.
- No?

408
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:39,142
Lisbon changed her mind. She wants you
to check out those motels like I said.

409
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:41,572
- The motels?
- <i>Looking for one</i>

410
00:26:41,692 --> 00:26:43,689
<i>with a no-show cash booking that night.</i>

411
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,739
Cover all the bases, she says.

412
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:48,158
She's right here
if you want a word with her.

413
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,229
- That's okay, but listen, I...
- Call me first if you get anything.

414
00:26:57,661 --> 00:26:58,662
No gun, huh?

415
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:03,715
What were you gonna kill Hector with,
a knife?

416
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,642
That should work.

417
00:27:18,189 --> 00:27:19,292
Put it away.

418
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:28,912
What if it turns out that Hector
isn't the man who killed your sister?

419
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,814
Isn't he?

420
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:32,612
We don't know that yet.

421
00:27:32,772 --> 00:27:35,258
You don't have to worry about that.
That's for us to work out.

422
00:27:35,378 --> 00:27:38,618
You need to be here for your family
and leave the vengeance part to us.

423
00:27:39,816 --> 00:27:42,062
When you find who did it for sure,

424
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:45,293
will you kill him?

425
00:27:46,983 --> 00:27:49,045
I won't kill him,
but I'll make him very sorry.

426
00:28:05,378 --> 00:28:08,648
I have a daughter who'd be about
your age if I hadn't caused her death...

427
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:12,130
Her and her mother.

428
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:13,862
How?

429
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:15,672
Out of arrogance...

430
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:17,688
Stupidity.

431
00:28:19,251 --> 00:28:22,609
I made an evil man very angry,
and he killed them to teach me a lesson,

432
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:26,875
to make me sorry for what I'd done.

433
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,104
And I am sorry.

434
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,001
Being sorry is a far worse punishment
than being dead. Everybody dies.

435
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:42,015
Very few people ever feel truly sorry
for the bad things they've done.

436
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:48,009
It hurts.

437
00:28:56,252 --> 00:28:58,495
- Van Pelt, what do you got?
- Microwave,

438
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:01,034
spa tub and premium cable in every unit.

439
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:03,745
Special rates for state
and federal employees.

440
00:29:04,438 --> 00:29:08,208
- What did he look like... this man?
- Big, with a hat and sunglasses...

441
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,287
and a thick beard, like a Sikh.

442
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,297
- An absurd disguise, in other words?
- Ridiculous.

443
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,543
I run a motel.
I don't care who you are.

444
00:29:17,937 --> 00:29:19,809
He bought a good beard for nothing.

445
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:21,599
That night he doesn't show,

446
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:24,008
so I remembered him
when your nice young lady called.

447
00:29:24,438 --> 00:29:27,477
No disrespect,
but your maid isn't very thorough.

448
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:30,563
No, she is most thorough.
She cleans here tomorrow.

449
00:29:30,986 --> 00:29:32,816
- For monthly rentals, she...
- Monthly?

450
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:34,731
She comes every third day.

451
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,611
So he's been here recently,

452
00:29:37,015 --> 00:29:38,314
in the last two days.

453
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,699
- The chips would imply this, yes?
- Yes, they would.

454
00:29:46,513 --> 00:29:47,555
This?

455
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,624
Those are not ours.

456
00:29:54,996 --> 00:29:56,137
He's coming back.

457
00:29:59,806 --> 00:30:01,698
Thank you.
Nice work.

458
00:30:05,922 --> 00:30:09,188
I don't want to make you mad, but
I found something really interesting,

459
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,884
- and I want you to take a look at it.
- You can't make me mad.

460
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:13,650
Go ahead. What'd you find?

461
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:17,735
- You first. Who made you so happy?
- Forensics.

462
00:30:18,124 --> 00:30:21,114
There's substantial traces of Melanie's
blood on the seat of Hector's truck.

463
00:30:23,307 --> 00:30:24,361
Happy day.

464
00:30:25,111 --> 00:30:27,719
Yeah. Now I'm gonna go and see
what Hector has to say about it.

465
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:30,749
What'd you find?

466
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,836
- It can wait.
- Blood?

467
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,300
Last time I saw her,
two weeks ago,

468
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:42,159
she was disrespectful,

469
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:44,730
so I had to tune her up.

470
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,578
- She got a bloody nose.
- Was physical abuse

471
00:30:48,698 --> 00:30:50,574
a normal occurrence
in your relationship,

472
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:52,319
or is this more of a recent thing?

473
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:54,275
She chose me.

474
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:57,245
She wanted to know where the edges are.

475
00:30:58,172 --> 00:30:59,172
I showed her.

476
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:01,048
Go ahead. Say it.

477
00:31:02,056 --> 00:31:04,732
- I think he's telling the truth.
- I disagree. I'm charging him.

478
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,750
Good. That's good. Go ahead.
You got more than enough evidence.

479
00:31:09,651 --> 00:31:10,845
Nearly forgot.

480
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:13,750
Okay, tell me. What'd you find?

481
00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:16,419
Telling you won't do.
I have to show you.

482
00:31:18,838 --> 00:31:21,299
I made a booking for two
for this afternoon.

483
00:31:22,015 --> 00:31:25,053
Could you put us on the terrace?
It's more romantic.

484
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:28,243
Thanks.

485
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,835
Lovely. See you then.

486
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:36,322
Don't fret.
I wouldn't seduce you over a meal.

487
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:38,566
That would be very sophomoric.

488
00:31:39,123 --> 00:31:41,129
I didn't think
you were trying to seduce me.

489
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:44,025
Come on. How could that thought
not have entered your head?

490
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,105
Your denial that it did intrigues me.

491
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:51,162
Bite me.

492
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:00,546
What is this?

493
00:32:06,546 --> 00:32:09,097
That's Van Pelt?
What is she doing?

494
00:32:14,645 --> 00:32:16,728
This is a live feed
from the Shand Creek restaurant,

495
00:32:16,889 --> 00:32:19,255
and this is
how we're gonna catch Melanie's killer.

496
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:39,741
Say again.

497
00:32:40,296 --> 00:32:41,296
Nothing.

498
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:46,217
I see you.

499
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:52,557
- How do I look?
- Good. You look good.

500
00:32:53,114 --> 00:32:54,714
I meant, can you see the wire?

501
00:32:58,386 --> 00:32:59,386
<i>Nope. Nope.</i>

502
00:33:03,311 --> 00:33:05,653
The killer plans
to bring his victim back to this room.

503
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:08,823
And when he does, we're gonna be here
to greet him. How sweet is that?

504
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:12,683
This is all a big elaborate joke
you're gonna apologize for now.

505
00:33:13,237 --> 00:33:16,079
Whoever killed Melanie had to be there
that night at Shand Csreek.

506
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:19,250
Your time line proves it. There's no way
anyone else could've done it.

507
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:21,878
One of the 20 people there
that night killed Melanie.

508
00:33:22,511 --> 00:33:25,672
All 20 of those people
are there now today,

509
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:28,832
- including the killer.
- And he's gonna try it again today?

510
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:31,448
- Come on.
- No, yes, that's just the point.

511
00:33:31,568 --> 00:33:33,556
Yes, he is gonna try again.

512
00:33:35,134 --> 00:33:36,492
He's planning on it.

513
00:33:38,155 --> 00:33:40,964
And he's gonna try again today
because we are gonna make him try again

514
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:43,516
because he's not
in control of his desires.

515
00:33:43,636 --> 00:33:46,611
He's been thinking of nothing else
but this perverse craving of his.

516
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:50,490
He's gotten so close.
He's desperate to go all the way.

517
00:33:50,698 --> 00:33:54,088
All we need to do is present him
with something he can't resist,

518
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:57,372
something that he will jump at,
and damn the consequences.

519
00:33:58,011 --> 00:34:00,708
Give it a try.
If I'm wrong, there's no harm down.

520
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:06,275
It's fusion.

521
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,137
Confusion.

522
00:34:09,384 --> 00:34:11,469
Up to me,
make it a cheeseburger every time.

523
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,055
Me, too. With onion rings.

524
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:28,493
- Let's do it.
- Not yet.

525
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:30,947
- Why not?
- This is actually quite good.

526
00:34:37,485 --> 00:34:39,706
You're meant to shout at me
and leave.

527
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:45,317
Now you've gone too far!

528
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:50,134
I hate you!

529
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:03,521
- Smooth work.
- Don't.

530
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:14,115
Can I call you a cab?

531
00:35:14,388 --> 00:35:17,744
No, thank you. I need a walk.
I have a number for a cab if I need one.

532
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:21,209
- Thank you for a delicious meal.
- Oh, you're so welcome.

533
00:35:39,551 --> 00:35:40,967
Just left the restaurant.

534
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:42,977
<i>I'm heading towards the main road now.</i>

535
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,940
<i>Sorry, miss.
I didn't see you there.</i>

536
00:35:49,101 --> 00:35:50,293
I was just...

537
00:35:50,868 --> 00:35:52,820
- You okay?
- Sure. Absolutely.

538
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,447
<i>Just scared me a little.</i>

539
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:57,263
He wasn't su...

540
00:35:58,148 --> 00:36:00,912
- What the hell is he doing there?
- He was there.

541
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,504
He was there that night.

542
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:04,883
<i>Going for a stroll?</i>

543
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
Fresh air.

544
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:08,564
Only you need to be careful.

545
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,192
We've been looking for a murderer
loose around here.

546
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,237
Went after a girl just like you...
Red hair and all.

547
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:16,759
No kidding.

548
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:19,402
I'll drive you up to the main road.

549
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:21,163
Thank you, but...

550
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:23,679
No trouble, really.

551
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:25,379
My car's just over here on the side.

552
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:28,272
- Please advise.
- Keep it rolling.

553
00:36:28,777 --> 00:36:29,816
Beg your pardon?

554
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:35,462
I'm not used to wearing these shoes.

555
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:39,534
- Are you out here alone?
- I had an argument with my date.

556
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:43,829
<i>Sorry to hear that.
You know, if you were my date,</i>

557
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,225
I wouldn't argue,
pretty lady like yourself.

558
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,387
My car's just right over here.

559
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:51,076
It's okay. I'll walk.

560
00:36:51,196 --> 00:36:53,275
Wait, no. I won't let you.

561
00:36:58,631 --> 00:37:01,597
Really, ma'am.
I don't feel comfortable letting you go.

562
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:03,259
Really, I'm fine.

563
00:37:04,198 --> 00:37:05,713
I think you're intoxicated.

564
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:08,482
- I am not.
- Get your hands off her!

565
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:11,662
What the hell's the matter with you?!

566
00:37:11,926 --> 00:37:14,110
- You're under arrest!
- You're under arrest...

567
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,422
- Calm down.
- Cho?

568
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:17,351
Is this clown one of yours?

569
00:37:19,073 --> 00:37:21,993
- What the hell is going on here?
- Sheriff, everything okay?

570
00:37:23,184 --> 00:37:24,187
Now it is...

571
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,123
<i>Suppose so. Barely.</i>

572
00:37:30,685 --> 00:37:33,137
- Everything's funny.
- Well, if you try.

573
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,797
Come on. It's pretty funny.

574
00:37:35,848 --> 00:37:36,876
Strange, though.

575
00:37:37,477 --> 00:37:40,595
I was sure the chef would bite.
There's still a chance he could show up.

576
00:37:40,982 --> 00:37:42,227
The chef... Malcolm?

577
00:37:43,256 --> 00:37:44,678
Why do you think it's him?

578
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,824
He uses way too much butter.

579
00:37:47,107 --> 00:37:48,738
- Say?
- He's a gluttonous baby.

580
00:37:48,858 --> 00:37:51,366
He's self-indulgent.
He wants what he wants and he takes it.

581
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:52,971
Too much butter. - Yeah.

582
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:55,484
It's fascinating
the way your mind works.

583
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:59,468
One thing, though... Malcolm
was in the kitchen with 20 people

584
00:37:59,588 --> 00:38:01,799
when Melanie was taken.
He couldn't have done it.

585
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:03,737
Hang on.
There's a way he could...

586
00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:06,230
Forgive me if I can't stay
for more of your theorizing,

587
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,670
but I've gotta go
and see if I can save your colleagues

588
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,901
from getting formal complaints
in their files.

589
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,125
I'll be right there.

590
00:38:40,406 --> 00:38:41,549
I know where it is.

591
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:00,841
Right here.
That's good.

592
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:04,142
You're good.

593
00:39:06,006 --> 00:39:07,056
It's okay. Good.

594
00:39:24,232 --> 00:39:25,241
Quiet! Quiet!

595
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:41,818
Help me put this on the bed.

596
00:39:55,044 --> 00:39:56,312
Stop. Think.

597
00:39:56,883 --> 00:39:59,358
Do not move.
Whatever you do, do not move.

598
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:01,352
- What?
- Do not move!

599
00:40:05,298 --> 00:40:06,907
Stop! Come back here!

600
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:11,204
- What are you doing here?
- Think.

601
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:14,607
- What are you doing here?
- Does it matter? I'm here.

602
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:17,260
This place is surrounded by police
and CBI agents.

603
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,483
He's lying.
They would be up here arresting us

604
00:40:21,603 --> 00:40:23,335
- by now if they were here.
- S.W.A.T.

605
00:40:23,608 --> 00:40:26,260
They're waiting on S.W.A.T.
There's no way out of this.

606
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:32,224
Nobody. Let's just kill them
and get out of here.

607
00:40:32,903 --> 00:40:35,583
Listen to me.
You can walk away from all of this.

608
00:40:36,013 --> 00:40:38,320
No disrespect,
but you're both clinically insane.

609
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,037
You're not gonna go to prison.
But to a hospital for a couple of years,

610
00:40:41,157 --> 00:40:43,319
- and you can walk away.
- Shut up! Just shut up!

611
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,322
- I'm trying to think.
- Now he's trying to think!

612
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:49,098
Don't pretend you didn't want this.
You wanted it just as much as me!

613
00:40:49,218 --> 00:40:51,842
I told you we didn't have enough time.
I told you...

614
00:40:51,962 --> 00:40:54,245
- One more word out of you!
- Don't you point that at me!

615
00:40:54,762 --> 00:40:55,748
Police!

616
00:40:59,862 --> 00:41:00,878
Put the gun down!

617
00:41:16,856 --> 00:41:18,395
You're gonna be fine, all right?

618
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:24,401
We're gonna get you out of here.

619
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,418
I don't get it.

620
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,271
She actually enjoyed helping him kill.

621
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,134
One crazy evil person, I understand.

622
00:41:48,728 --> 00:41:50,177
But two? Husband and wife?

623
00:41:51,854 --> 00:41:55,371
Marriage is supposed to be a sacred,
loving thing.

624
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:59,144
They were soul mates
in their own strange way.

625
00:42:01,848 --> 00:42:02,848
Let's go.
