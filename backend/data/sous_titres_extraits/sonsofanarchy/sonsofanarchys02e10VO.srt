00:00:01,688 --> 00:00:02,877
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:06,380
I need you to pass on
a message to your old man.

3
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,966
Tell him to stop selling guns
to niggers and wetbacks

4
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:11,378
or we find you and we do this again.

5
00:00:11,503 --> 00:00:14,180
- My god.
- Promise me you won't tell anyone.

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,933
- We got to tell Clay.
- Not Clay, not Jax.

7
00:00:17,108 --> 00:00:18,108
No one.

8
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,318
- What the hell are you doing here?
- We were worried.

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,655
- The other one?
- Doesn't matter. Came to see you.

10
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,198
I'm not after Sam Crow.

11
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,409
I want Cameron Hayes's
true IRA contacts.

12
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:38,428
This was in one of his boxes.
He wrote it all down.

13
00:00:38,553 --> 00:00:40,706
John is speaking to him
from the goddamn grave.

14
00:00:41,028 --> 00:00:44,001
Clay tried to kill my son.
Slaughtered his wife by mistake.

15
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:45,859
I'm depending on you
to make that right.

16
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:48,540
Right now,
it's about protecting Ope.

17
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:50,466
Why don't you tell me how I get righ

18
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:53,301
with your little trigger boy blowing
an innocent woman's head off?

19
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:55,972
If you mention Donna
or the incident again,

20
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:57,368
I'll kill ya.

21
00:01:04,996 --> 00:01:06,699
I knew getting into porn
was a bad call.

22
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:07,935
We need Caracara.

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,861
Sam Crow deals guns.
You tied us to prostitution.

24
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:12,865
You got one
of our member's old lady killed.

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,033
You are really going to lay
the guilt of a dead wife on me?

26
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,369
You remember that promise I made?

27
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:20,955
Do you want recompense
against Sam Crow?

28
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:23,074
I want to hurt 'em.

29
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,486
This thing will cook all night
before the flames are visible.

30
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:33,193
This was Clay.

31
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:35,587
I'm going nomad.

32
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,780
What's going on?

33
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:47,236
Nomad president.

34
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:50,055
All right.

35
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:51,728
Yeah, no thanks.

36
00:01:53,137 --> 00:01:54,490
Quinn accepted Jax.

37
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,365
He's waiting on our answer.

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,520
Is he really going through
with this?

39
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:07,043
I didn't strike the goddamn match.

40
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,989
Maybe that's the case
you make to Jax.

41
00:02:09,114 --> 00:02:11,242
If he really believes
that I would burn down Caracara,

42
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,027
I got no reason to keep him around.

43
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:19,638
Need a full table.

44
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,429
Vote's got to be unanimous.

45
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:33,515
- Jesus Christ.
- What do you want?

46
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:36,405
No one's heard from you in weeks.

47
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:38,018
So?

48
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:41,069
So, I'm making sure you're not dead.

49
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,908
Well, am I?

50
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,856
You smell like shit.

51
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:47,790
When's the last time
you took a shower?

52
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:51,865
You really come all the way up here
to give me hygiene tips, did ya?

53
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:58,052
I got news.
I wanted you to hear it from me.

54
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:04,266
I think it's best I go nomad.

55
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,731
I gave you John's book

56
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,680
so you'd make things right.

57
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:15,805
- And you gave me your word.
- I'm trying, Piney.

58
00:03:17,618 --> 00:03:18,823
Did you read it?

59
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:20,851
A long time ago.

60
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:23,126
It's not exactly a how-to manual.

61
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:26,622
It's half angry manifesto,
half MC love letter.

62
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:34,949
I'm trying to read
between the lines here...

63
00:03:35,335 --> 00:03:36,485
see the path.

64
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:39,009
Your father saw this coming.

65
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:43,091
Saw the feds, the Irish,

66
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,270
guys like Zobelle.

67
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:51,315
And he knew
we were going to die bloody.

68
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,670
We're not going to die bloody.

69
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:57,959
We will...

70
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,069
if you give up.

71
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:08,065
If I don't get away from Clay now,

72
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:11,627
one of us is going to end up dead.

73
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,110
And we both know who that should be,

74
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:17,866
don't we?

75
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,741
If you're not number two

76
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,766
when Clay's hands freeze up,

77
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,560
who becomes leader then?

78
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,103
I mean, tig?

79
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:33,299
Bobby?

80
00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:34,836
You want

81
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,392
to trust your father's legacy
to those two clowns?

82
00:04:43,238 --> 00:04:44,788
This is just a detour

83
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:47,105
on a very long road.

84
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,037
I don't have a long road.

85
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:52,625
You think about this move, son.

86
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,780
'cause it's just a reaction.

87
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:57,742
It's not a solution.

88
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:22,317
Guess you told him.

89
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:27,451
Can't wrap my head around it either.

90
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,578
You called me on it months ago, man.

91
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:31,180
When it comes to Clay,

92
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:34,605
I'm not sure anything I do
is for the good of the club.

93
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:36,548
He's your father, Jax.

94
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:38,942
My father died on 580...

95
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:40,581
16 years ago.

96
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,314
<i>Riding through this world</i>

97
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,930

<i>Gotta look this life</i>

105
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:13,080
<i>In the eye.</i>

106
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:16,997
Episode 210: Balm

107
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,450
- I got Quinn's letter of acceptance.
- Not now, bro.

108
00:06:30,796 --> 00:06:32,276
I'm free!

109
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:33,767
Jackie boy! Elvis!

110
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:36,033
Put this on.

111
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:40,366
Clearly there's been
some brain damage.

112
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:45,658
I'm pretty sure he was
this stupid before he got here.

113
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:48,257
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

114
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,443
What's going on with Zobelle?

115
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:55,740
It's complicated, man.
Got the feds in town.

116
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:57,415
Us going to county...

117
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:00,803
- He's gotta go away.
- I know.

118
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:02,305
We'll settle the score.

119
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,130
Let's just get you home.

120
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:11,503
Thank you.

121
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,920
See you later.

122
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,022
Trouble down below?

123
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:30,829
I don't know.

124
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:33,133
I think
the swelling's getting worse.

125
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:35,365
I got a perfect cure for that.

126
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:38,024
Let's go to Caracara,
get ourselves a couple of lovelies each.

127
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,001
- The warehouse burned down, man.
- When?

128
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:43,170
- How?
- We don't know yet.

129
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:47,087
Jax thinks Clay did it
to kill the porno biz.

130
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:49,676
Why the hell
would Clay try to kill porn?

131
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,929
I don't know.
He wants us focused on guns.

132
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:53,654
Jesus Christ.

133
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,141
That's why Jax is talking nomad.

134
00:07:57,428 --> 00:07:58,428
Nomad?!

135
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:08,362
Make a left.

136
00:08:08,994 --> 00:08:09,994
Why?

137
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:14,967
Make a left.

138
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:18,366
Shit.

139
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:22,022
Where they going?

140
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:25,147
Shit. I got this.
Meet you back at the clubhouse.

141
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,348
Chibs, what the hell are we doing?

142
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:41,449
What the hell's
the matter with you?!

143
00:08:41,574 --> 00:08:42,624
Wait, wait!

144
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,399
Explain to me.

145
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:49,027
<i>- Explain what?
- Why you mick bastards are selling guns</i>

146
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,596
<i>to the piece of shit
that blew me up!</i>

147
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:54,568
- Should we go in?
<i>- Christ man.</i>

148
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:59,997
The feds were all over you guys.
What was I supposed to do?

149
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,616
That's not the answer
I'm looking for.

150
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,080
Let him go, Chibs.

151
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:07,781
Put the gun down.

152
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:11,508
Down.

153
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:16,717
Careful, brother.

154
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:19,933
You'll pop your sutures.

155
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:25,314
You got every right
to blow his head off.

156
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,990
Things went sideways
when McKeavy died.

157
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,153
I should've been stateside
to handle that transition.

158
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:33,817
It's too late.

159
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:36,366
Sons have got a new pipeline.

160
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,480
They don't.

161
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:46,992
Enough.

162
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:48,568
Enough!

163
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:55,802
How are you, Jackson?

164
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,420
Been better, Jimmy.

165
00:09:58,046 --> 00:10:00,496
Chibs, come on.
Let's get out of here.

166
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:05,760
You are not my VP anymore...

167
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:08,848
Nomad.

168
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,854
<i>Prospect, let's go.</i>

169
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,892
Time to press the scot.

170
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,322
Put eyes on him.

171
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:27,125
I'll give the prince
one last chance.

172
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:40,678
Iron man.

173
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:42,701
Jax going nomad...

174
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:44,643
Caracara burning down...

175
00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:48,397
- Anything else that I don't know?
- We were gonna let you heal.

176
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:50,566
I'm all better now.

177
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,027
Let's just save it for the table.

178
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:59,029
- Welcome home, baby.
- Hi, darling.

179
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,850
My guardian angel.

180
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:04,788
I have a repo run.

181
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:10,299
Sack, let's go.

182
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:15,188
We'll catch you up. Come on.

183
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:22,521
You tell her or I will.

184
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:34,021
What's up? Text was vague.

185
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:42,909
You got a warrant?

186
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:45,096
You see me searching?

187
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:46,997
I got nothing to say to you.

188
00:11:50,564 --> 00:11:52,514
What's happening, little man?

189
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:55,756
- Where's Neeta?
- I sent her out for groceries.

190
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,530
Look at you two.
Ozzy and Harriet.

191
00:11:58,995 --> 00:11:59,995
Shut up.

192
00:12:00,994 --> 00:12:02,144
Get out, now.

193
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:03,972
I was just curious, Jax.

194
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,642
I just wanted to know
why you were leaving Sam Crow.

195
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:11,857
Give me a minute?

196
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:24,912
I'm sorry,
I thought old ladies were privy.

197
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:28,284
Has she got issues
with the extracurricular?

198
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,808
Just say it.

199
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:30,904
Same pitch.

200
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:34,092
The Irish screwed you,
so you screw them back.

201
00:12:34,617 --> 00:12:37,267
More importantly,
you screw Ethan Zobelle.

202
00:12:37,977 --> 00:12:39,427
You even the score,

203
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,569
you protect the MC.

204
00:12:42,174 --> 00:12:44,024
Same response. I don't rat.

205
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:47,180
Sons are living in grace,
sweetheart.

206
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:50,082
You're not my target now.

207
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,350
But if you don't help me,
I will come after you.

208
00:12:55,263 --> 00:12:57,129
Is Tara a legal guardian?

209
00:12:58,574 --> 00:13:00,553
Because I would really hate to see

210
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:03,115
that perfect boy end up
in the system.

211
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,017
You're so full of shit.

212
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
You know,

213
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:11,380
I do want to thank you

214
00:13:11,505 --> 00:13:14,627
for confirming
a suspicion of mine, though...

215
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:16,669
Agent Kohn.

216
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:19,537
ATF always assumed
that he went awol,

217
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,283
but, I never believed that, though.

218
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:24,428
We both know
that he's more than missing.

219
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,510
He's wherever he's supposed to be.

220
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:31,407
When I'm done burying the Irish,

221
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:34,582
I'll just go digging into Charming.

222
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:37,804
Maybe find me a shallow grave, hmm?

223
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:43,533
And I always thought that you were
too damn pretty to be a killer.

224
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,991
Wish I could say the same.

225
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:02,993
You okay?

226
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:06,928
What was she talking about?

227
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,308
I'm joing the nomad charter
of the Sons.

228
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:16,813
Means I'm still a member of the MC,
just not attached to any one town.

229
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,325
Leave Charming?

230
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,930
The rest of the nomads
are spread out north.

231
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:29,242
I attend church at different places,
put a few more miles on my bike.

232
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:32,871
I got to do this.

233
00:14:33,743 --> 00:14:35,790
I need space between me and Clay.

234
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:38,743
How do you fix Sam Crow
if you're not a part of it?

235
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:42,630
I can't do what I need to do
with this guy in place.

236
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,117
I ride independently for a few years
and wait for him to step down.

237
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:50,342
A few years?

238
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,600
We've barely made it
through the last few months.

239
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:58,021
You made this decision without me.

240
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,769
- It's the right thing.
- Then why were you afraid to tell me?

241
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:08,244
You're gonna be late for work.

242
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:09,869
I'll wait for Neeta.

243
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,868
Just doing our jobs, ma'am.

244
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:42,107
Son of a bitch, I need my truck!

245
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:45,862
- Really?
- All my beads are in there.

246
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,495
They're very rare.
I'm a bead weaver, how I make money.

247
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,490
Please.

248
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,293
Got to contact your finance company.

249
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,121
Please.

250
00:15:58,593 --> 00:15:59,444
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:12,393 --> 00:16:14,680
You and Bobby got all
that fishing gear yesterday.

252
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:16,383
I got dibs on this shit.

253
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,508
You gonna start weaving beads?

254
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:19,772
Maybe.

255
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:22,255
Did a lot of macramé in Iraq.

256
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:31,499
Holy shit.

257
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:39,716
- It's bullets.
- Goddamn.

258
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:43,621
Unstamped.

259
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:45,788
Homemade.

260
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:48,192
We hauled it from the Wahewa land.

261
00:16:49,222 --> 00:16:52,497
I don't know too many hunters
using nine mil for deer.

262
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,664
Nationwide ammo shortage.

263
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:57,371
Pick up the porn slack,
we get ahold of this supply.

264
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:59,396
We should talk to the squaw.

265
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,770
Is he supposed to be driving?

266
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,369
Goddamn.

267
00:17:22,182 --> 00:17:23,182
What?

268
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:33,043
Jax says he's joining
the nomad charter.

269
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:35,202
Needs to get away from Clay.

270
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:37,419
Jesus Christ!

271
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:45,584
Shit that's been going on around here,
maybe it's a good solution.

272
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:47,293
No, it's not.

273
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,267
Nomad is MC purgatory.

274
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,196
No family, no roots.

275
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:55,075
He seems convinced
it's the best thing.

276
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,951
He's so deep in his hate for Clay,
he don't know what's best.

277
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,669
But isn't that hatred

278
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,016
a good reason to step away?

279
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:06,244
You don't want Jax in a charter
scattered across four states.

280
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:08,144
On the road alone.

281
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,672
The list of enemies we have.

282
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:17,303
You want that phone call telling you
where to pick up the body?

283
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,558
Shit.

284
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,943
Asshole!

285
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:46,695
You stupid gash!
You trying to kill me?!

286
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:48,555
Watch it! Stop.

287
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,211
Watch his head.

288
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:51,902
All right, let him up.

289
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:58,431
You okay?

290
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,391
Jesus.

291
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,369
You get blown up, Jax quits,

292
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:08,500
you are in a charter

293
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:10,899
that neither protects
nor retains its members.

294
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,067
What do you want?

295
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:15,993
Jimmy O'Phelan.

296
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,571
I know that you two have history.

297
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:24,174
I know he excommunicated you
from the IRA,

298
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,161
that he stole your wife,
raised your daughter.

299
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,951
Left you

300
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:34,756
with a little reminder
you'd never forget.

301
00:19:36,027 --> 00:19:37,027
Great.

302
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:40,429
Thanks for that little trip
down memory lane.

303
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:43,661
Are we done here?

304
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:45,147
You hate him.

305
00:19:45,556 --> 00:19:46,656
We both know

306
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:49,361
that he's the devil, so...

307
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,318
Maybe we help each other, hum?

308
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:00,553
Think about it.

309
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:25,890
Were you gonna tell me?

310
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:29,796
Of course I was gonna tell you.

311
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:36,985
I just didn't want to say anything
till things were certain.

312
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:39,028
Are things certain?

313
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:43,032
Vote's tonight.

314
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,893
Sit.

315
00:20:58,244 --> 00:21:01,618
The other day,
you asked me what was in that box.

316
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:04,831
It wasn't just old t-shirts.

317
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:06,661
I know.

318
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,893
Why'd you burn it?

319
00:21:10,743 --> 00:21:12,893
I didn't know what to do with it.

320
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:15,121
And now?

321
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:23,681
It was after Thomas died.

322
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,956
Your dad was lost.

323
00:21:26,938 --> 00:21:28,688
Darkest part of his life.

324
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,335
You want it back?

325
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:41,257
I think it's good you have it.

326
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:44,782
If I know your father,

327
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:47,281
there's more than one copy.

328
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,220
I loved your dad.

329
00:21:58,628 --> 00:22:00,578
More than I've loved any man.

330
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:03,338
Great lay.

331
00:22:04,744 --> 00:22:05,740
Smart,

332
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,130
big heart...

333
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,070
And very complicated.

334
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,374
Sound familiar?

335
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,701
His complications killed him.

336
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:26,928
What do you mean?

337
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,870
I don't think your father's death
was an accident.

338
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:39,183
I think

339
00:22:39,954 --> 00:22:41,354
he hated his life,

340
00:22:41,856 --> 00:22:43,756
and he let the road take it.

341
00:22:45,882 --> 00:22:48,491
I don't want that same fate for you,
Jackson.

342
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:50,811
Things I do,

343
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:53,301
I do to keep you safe.

344
00:22:55,447 --> 00:22:57,000
Less complicated.

345
00:22:57,655 --> 00:22:58,755
I know, mom.

346
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,870
Nomad...

347
00:23:03,204 --> 00:23:04,612
is a bad idea.

348
00:23:15,948 --> 00:23:17,270
Page 449.

349
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,857
Thanks for coming.

350
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:41,281
I was worried about you.

351
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,770
Well, what is it, Fi?

352
00:23:55,985 --> 00:23:56,985
Filip.

353
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,090
Sorry, love.

354
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:10,430
Sit down.

355
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,175
Want a drink?

356
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,360
I'm not stateside for the Sons.

357
00:24:26,935 --> 00:24:29,135
Came to close a distribution deal.

358
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:32,497
I had no idea how muddled things
had become.

359
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:36,224
Edmond and Cameron wouldn't take
a piss without your permission.

360
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:39,393
You see what happens
when you give men some rope.

361
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:41,869
Shit only works
when I handle it myself.

362
00:24:41,994 --> 00:24:43,689
And that's my lesson here.

363
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,010
I want a sit-down with Clay.

364
00:24:48,931 --> 00:24:50,238
Get us back together.

365
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,872
You expect me to recommend?

366
00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:54,033
Our bond with the Sons runs deep.

367
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:57,087
Belfast charter has been
our right hand since '87.

368
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:58,579
Not gonna jeopardize that.

369
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:00,206
I'm not your errand boy, Jimmy.

370
00:25:00,652 --> 00:25:02,175
Aye, Filip, you are.

371
00:25:03,611 --> 00:25:04,808
I banished you,

372
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:06,333
took what's yours.

373
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:09,237
These are the facts.

374
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:10,814
You do as I say.

375
00:25:14,677 --> 00:25:16,077
Go to hell, Jimmy.

376
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:19,401
Have you seen any recent pictures
of Kerrianne?

377
00:25:21,256 --> 00:25:22,556
She's all Fiona.

378
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:25,353
Gorgeous.

379
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,070
Reaching that magical change,

380
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,570
tight little curves,

381
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:33,547
breasts popping.

382
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,250
Timely, actually.

383
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:41,414
Fiona's look's fading.
Can hardly catch an edge anymore.

384
00:25:44,117 --> 00:25:45,417
But Kerrianne...

385
00:25:47,474 --> 00:25:50,452
The thoughts that enter my brain...

386
00:25:52,178 --> 00:25:53,445
Impure,

387
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,678
awful, I think.

388
00:25:56,876 --> 00:25:58,347
But then I recall

389
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,115
she's not my daughter.
So what's the sin?

390
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,352
Even if she does call me "da."

391
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:06,534
Piss off.

392
00:26:10,876 --> 00:26:11,976
Put it away.

393
00:26:15,913 --> 00:26:18,265
You set the meeting with Clay,

394
00:26:19,248 --> 00:26:21,412
and we'll work out
** misunderstanding.

395
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:35,703
What is this?

396
00:26:36,075 --> 00:26:37,678
I'm a big fan of your bead work.

397
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,346
Where are the boxes?

398
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:42,642
- Who's pressing your bullets?
- That's our ammo, you son of a bitch!

399
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,767
Mother,

400
00:26:44,044 --> 00:26:45,144
wait inside.

401
00:26:47,676 --> 00:26:51,108
- Tonto, speak up, will ya?
- My name is Ferdinand.

402
00:26:52,793 --> 00:26:53,903
We sell guns.

403
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,250
You

404
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:56,647
make bullets.

405
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,909
Now, I can either help you,
or crush you.

406
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:06,338
Smart boy.

407
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:11,618
You've been quiet about all this.

408
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,187
Nobody asked my opinion.

409
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:15,617
Right.

410
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:20,692
So now I'm asking.

411
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,234
I don't think
Clay sabotaged Caracara.

412
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:29,106
If you wanna believe it,

413
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,359
makes it easy for you to hate him.

414
00:27:33,897 --> 00:27:35,361
Go see Unser...

415
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,576
fire dick info should be in.

416
00:27:38,397 --> 00:27:39,991
See what he knows.

417
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,700
You think going nomad's a bad idea?

418
00:27:44,544 --> 00:27:48,248
I think this club needs
a psychic shift of some sort.

419
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,744
Get it past whatever this shit is.

420
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,090
Maybe you going nomad

421
00:27:57,768 --> 00:27:58,768
is it.

422
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,439
Maybe not.

423
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:19,589
Dr. Mason didn't call you?

424
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:22,495
I haven't returned yet.
I have to scrub in.

425
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,951
Umbilical hernia repair.

426
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,120
Dr. Barclay is taking the surgery.

427
00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:27,705
Why?

428
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:29,728
The ruse you played
with Filip Telford.

429
00:28:29,853 --> 00:28:31,596
Don't know
what you're talking about.

430
00:28:31,721 --> 00:28:34,003
Faking symptoms to extend
his critical status.

431
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,579
It was unethical,

432
00:28:35,704 --> 00:28:37,673
dangerous and a breach
of insurance law.

433
00:28:37,931 --> 00:28:39,800
He said he had severe head pain.

434
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:40,968
Come on, doctor,

435
00:28:41,372 --> 00:28:44,472
the biker's not that clever.
He was coached by you.

436
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:49,209
I was taking care
of a vulnerable patient.

437
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:51,771
- By breaking the law?
- By doing my job.

438
00:28:52,043 --> 00:28:54,776
You'll get an opportunity
to explain yourself to the board.

439
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:56,046
Until then,

440
00:28:56,547 --> 00:28:58,235
I've had your privileges suspended.

441
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:12,743
No worries about the cops?

442
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,207
We supply tribal police.

443
00:29:15,816 --> 00:29:18,547
State and local law enforcement
have no jurisdiction.

444
00:29:19,282 --> 00:29:21,282
All you're pressing are 9 mil.

445
00:29:21,568 --> 00:29:23,844
Can you make 7.62? AK rounds?

446
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,846
Full metal jacket or hollow point?

447
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:28,483
Hollow.

448
00:29:30,108 --> 00:29:32,608
How long would it take
to press a case?

449
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:35,314
Thousand rounds...
A couple hours.

450
00:29:35,764 --> 00:29:38,317
Who says you can't make
an honest deal with the white man?

451
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:41,171
There's something else.

452
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:43,116
Mushrooms.

453
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:45,273
Fair price.

454
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,826
Psychedelics?

455
00:29:47,924 --> 00:29:49,474
We don't deal, chief.

456
00:29:49,698 --> 00:29:51,148
Then neither do we.

457
00:29:54,436 --> 00:29:55,653
Let me guess,

458
00:29:55,778 --> 00:29:56,778
some

459
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:00,294
state law allows you to grow psyches
for religious purposes.

460
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:02,091
Visionquest and whatnot.

461
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:05,909
You know people who deal.

462
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:07,416
Call them.

463
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,349
I do know some serious people.

464
00:30:11,872 --> 00:30:13,853
I have some serious fungi.

465
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:18,107
Prospect!

466
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,660
Get in here.

467
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:29,362
Taste test.

468
00:30:30,837 --> 00:30:31,837
Mushrooms?

469
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:35,897
- Like, tripping mushrooms?
- Need to know if they're any good.

470
00:30:36,696 --> 00:30:37,876
Smell like shit.

471
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,582
They grow on shit.

472
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,572
I know you love 'em.

473
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,873
But we got the vote later, I...
I can proxy for you.

474
00:30:51,998 --> 00:30:52,998
Really?

475
00:31:06,093 --> 00:31:08,969
- How's our favorite pin cushion?
- Good.

476
00:31:09,094 --> 00:31:10,785
Shit, I miss you guys.

477
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,495
Miss you, too, little rican.

478
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,961
Should have been out of here days ago,
but still got much blood in my stool.

479
00:31:17,086 --> 00:31:19,236
- Nice.
- Appreciate the update.

480
00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:22,296
Trust me, man,
you're better off in here.

481
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:23,197
I know.

482
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:26,124
Heard about Caracara.
That shit sucks.

483
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:28,344
What do we know?

484
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,142
What?

485
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:38,437
You're going to need
to proxy a vote.

486
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:42,987
- For...?
- I'm asking for transfer.

487
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:47,288
Nomad.

488
00:31:51,803 --> 00:31:53,410
Guess it's been coming.

489
00:32:00,388 --> 00:32:02,788
I'll let you give
your vote to Bobby.

490
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:11,831
You remember what you said to me when
I told you that I wanted to prospect?

491
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:14,914
My blood family,

492
00:32:15,084 --> 00:32:16,234
my home town,

493
00:32:16,989 --> 00:32:18,769
all that shit moves back a row.

494
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:22,988
Once you're patched,

495
00:32:23,211 --> 00:32:25,111
the members are your family.

496
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:27,646
This charter is your home.

497
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:00,811
So, this is how it works.

498
00:33:01,081 --> 00:33:02,872
You do not touch Sam Crow.

499
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:05,447
I don't want the sons.
I want the IRA.

500
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:10,541
the assault charges against the club.
Drop them.

501
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:14,700
- That's not easy.
- Then we are done talking.

502
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,450
I'll get into it.

503
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:21,279
What else?

504
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:23,623
My daughter and my wife.

505
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:26,450
If I help you move on Jimmy,

506
00:33:26,575 --> 00:33:28,380
he's going to think they conspired.

507
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:32,235
Fiona is not an innocent bystander.
She's third generation IRA.

508
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,962
Full protection and immunity...

509
00:33:38,052 --> 00:33:40,129
'cause he'll kill them both.

510
00:33:43,235 --> 00:33:44,235
All right.

511
00:33:45,488 --> 00:33:49,427
I'll bring in Fiona
and I'll task Interpol with Kerrianne.

512
00:33:49,982 --> 00:33:51,664
We'll witpro them.

513
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:57,938
What you're asking for here is huge.

514
00:33:59,093 --> 00:34:00,726
International red tape up the ass.

515
00:34:00,851 --> 00:34:03,451
I'm going to need some
good faith, Chibs.

516
00:34:07,884 --> 00:34:09,705
IRA safe house.

517
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,549
The guns.

518
00:34:12,624 --> 00:34:14,975
I can give you the location.

519
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:18,049
Edmond Hayes...

520
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,149
he will be there.

521
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,643
Maybe his old man, too.

522
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:27,811
Good enough.

523
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:44,001
Remind me of your old man
when you go all quiet like that.

524
00:34:46,406 --> 00:34:48,656
Jax wants me to vote to let him go.

525
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:53,921
Sure likes to give advice.

526
00:34:54,276 --> 00:34:55,926
Won't take any, though.

527
00:34:57,494 --> 00:34:59,913
Reminds me of his old man.

528
00:35:01,345 --> 00:35:02,745
John was stubborn.

529
00:35:03,906 --> 00:35:05,006
I meant you.

530
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,933
Goddamn gig,

531
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,250
I got so spun out...

532
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,075
after Donna died.

533
00:35:30,894 --> 00:35:33,682
No idea how to comfort my kids.

534
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,269
You're a good man, ope.

535
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:42,068
Kids...

536
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:45,731
they pick up on that shit.

537
00:35:47,391 --> 00:35:48,741
And they forgive.

538
00:35:52,256 --> 00:35:53,260
I hope so.

539
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,903
Just go home, brother.

540
00:35:59,028 --> 00:36:00,782
I'll wait for Laroy.

541
00:36:00,907 --> 00:36:01,907
You sure?

542
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:05,235
I'll see you at the clubhouse.

543
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:17,362
<i>I found myself lost in my own club.</i>

544
00:36:17,996 --> 00:36:20,643
<i>I trusted few, feared most.</i>

545
00:36:21,163 --> 00:36:23,430
<i>Nomad offered escape and exile.</i>

546
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:28,486
<i>I didn't know if leaving would cure
or kill this thing that we created.</i>

547
00:36:28,662 --> 00:36:31,856
<i>I didn't know if it was an act
of strength or cowardice.</i>

548
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,065
<i>I didn't know,</i>

549
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,333
<i>so I stayed.</i>

550
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,735
<i>I stayed because, in the end,</i>

551
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,750
<i>the only way I could hold this up</i>

552
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:41,275
<i>was to suffer
under the weight of it.</i>

553
00:36:50,728 --> 00:36:51,878
Ammo's tight.

554
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:54,962
But we're running out
of shit to load 'em into.

555
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:57,377
We got a line on a new source
through the Chinese.

556
00:36:57,502 --> 00:37:00,081
Should be up and running
before the end of the month.

557
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:02,856
- We're losing ground, brother.
- I heard.

558
00:37:03,566 --> 00:37:05,305
You'll be my first order.
I promise.

559
00:37:08,196 --> 00:37:09,196
So,

560
00:37:10,112 --> 00:37:12,162
help me out with the dry goods?

561
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:16,358
'shrooms got to be high end, man.

562
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,945
Step into my office.

563
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:25,774
How's it going, Prospect?

564
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:27,077
Good.

565
00:37:27,505 --> 00:37:28,805
I can feel it...

566
00:37:29,857 --> 00:37:31,235
Wants to cure me.

567
00:37:32,435 --> 00:37:35,216
It's cool and warm at the same time.

568
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:37,666
It's coorrmm.

569
00:37:54,498 --> 00:37:57,333
Product quality tested by SOA.

570
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,534
Little white frat boys
will eat this shit up.

571
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,125
Jesus.

572
00:38:37,203 --> 00:38:39,399
Thought it was a late one for you.

573
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:43,580
I got to get back pretty soon.

574
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:45,805
I was gonna go pick up the kids.

575
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:07,010
If you're not ready.

576
00:39:10,586 --> 00:39:11,736
It's the bed.

577
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:01,549
Forensics says
it was definitely arson.

578
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:04,209
Found some burn patterns.

579
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:06,376
Still running tests.

580
00:40:08,251 --> 00:40:11,659
They found multiple
sets of footprints.

581
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:15,154
Blaze that size,

582
00:40:15,392 --> 00:40:17,470
couldn't have been one guy.

583
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,722
Had to be a crew.

584
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:28,624
My money lands on Zobelle.

585
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:38,018
Can I talk to you?

586
00:40:41,495 --> 00:40:43,899
Guys, why don't you take a break.

587
00:40:54,515 --> 00:40:56,015
What's on your mind?

588
00:40:58,186 --> 00:41:00,248
I think maybe I was wrong
about Caracara.

589
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,421
I'm sorry I put it on you.

590
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:07,525
Way we've been going,
made sense at the time.

591
00:41:11,576 --> 00:41:12,926
Me going nomad...

592
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:15,688
what's your hit on that?

593
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,351
Way we've been going, makes sense.

594
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:24,897
You want me gone?

595
00:41:25,325 --> 00:41:27,225
This ain't gonna be my call.

596
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:30,142
You put this transfer in motion.

597
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:34,916
I'm not putting it on you.
I'm asking you a simple question.

598
00:41:36,418 --> 00:41:38,120
Do you want me gone?

599
00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:29,921
Wanted to know about Caracara.

600
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,675
I told him
it couldn't have been Clay.

601
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:42,217
The club's gonna need your help.

602
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,605
For what?

603
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,146
You need to protect them.

604
00:42:50,352 --> 00:42:51,352
Why?

605
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:53,659
What are they gonna do?

606
00:43:00,104 --> 00:43:01,104
Thank you.

607
00:43:12,434 --> 00:43:14,552
We know what's on the table.

608
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:18,262
Nomad charter accepted Jax.

609
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:20,765
Redwood

610
00:43:22,118 --> 00:43:23,558
has to vote to release.

611
00:43:28,755 --> 00:43:30,607
You want to say anything?

612
00:43:33,142 --> 00:43:35,442
This is the best thing for Sam Crow.

613
00:43:47,176 --> 00:43:49,176
I got Tig's proxy, it's a yea.

614
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,650
Juice's proxy's a yea.

615
00:44:02,084 --> 00:44:03,084
Me...

616
00:44:45,764 --> 00:44:46,764
Chibs.

617
00:44:55,131 --> 00:44:57,110
This what you want, jackie boy?

618
00:44:59,058 --> 00:45:00,058
For real?

619
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:08,930
Jesus.

620
00:45:14,362 --> 00:45:15,771
Unanimous.

621
00:45:20,841 --> 00:45:22,541
You're free to transfer.

622
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:27,641
Then I quit now. ???

623
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,915
- Get your hands up.
- Shit.

624
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,607
Edmond Hayes.

625
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:10,488
Agent June Stahl,

626
00:46:10,884 --> 00:46:11,768
ATF.

627
00:46:14,454 --> 00:46:15,855
Lovely to meet you, laddy.

628
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,041
You okay?

629
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:45,635
I have some vacation time coming.

630
00:46:46,066 --> 00:46:47,066
Let's just

631
00:46:47,618 --> 00:46:51,622
get away for a few days.
Big Sur, the desert, I don't care.

632
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:55,061
- What about the kid?
- Take him with us.

633
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,780
Let's just go.

634
00:46:57,009 --> 00:46:57,897
Tonight.

635
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,220
I need to talk to you.

636
00:47:07,347 --> 00:47:08,827
It's done, ma.

637
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,171
Meet me at my house.

638
00:47:12,718 --> 00:47:13,837
Both of you.

639
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:28,666
I know that you are a little cog
in a big green wheel,

640
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:32,695
and I am perfectly willing
to look past the illegal guns

641
00:47:33,088 --> 00:47:35,810
and the decades of jail time.

642
00:47:36,324 --> 00:47:38,324
Because I want James O'Phelan.

643
00:47:38,979 --> 00:47:40,327
Don't know him.

644
00:47:41,011 --> 00:47:42,572
Don't know anything.

645
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,571
Guys.

646
00:48:00,068 --> 00:48:02,946
I arrest you and seize the guns.

647
00:48:04,598 --> 00:48:08,024
Then I leak a rumor
that you've turned rat.

648
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:12,737
I pick up your father
on some bullshit charge.

649
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:14,993
Unfortunately,

650
00:48:15,514 --> 00:48:17,264
Jimmy believes the rumor.

651
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:21,022
And he pushes the button on you.

652
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:24,834
They'll know it's a lie.

653
00:48:26,934 --> 00:48:28,946
Let's see how that plays out.

654
00:48:35,865 --> 00:48:38,414
Been stateside the last two years.

655
00:48:41,449 --> 00:48:43,496
Can't tie anything to Jimmy.

656
00:48:49,004 --> 00:48:50,284
But my da can.

657
00:48:56,953 --> 00:48:58,818
He never has to know.

658
00:49:26,757 --> 00:49:28,567
Sit down, both of you.

659
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,142
You, too, sweetheart.

660
00:49:40,467 --> 00:49:41,289
Sit.

661
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:44,898
You know what it is
I have to tell them.

662
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,910
What is this?

663
00:50:03,172 --> 00:50:05,554
The night of Bobby's party...

664
00:50:09,025 --> 00:50:11,716
I didn't get into
an accident driving home.

665
00:50:15,593 --> 00:50:18,095
I was attacked.

666
00:51:02,409 --> 00:51:04,930
A minivan pulls up behind me.

667
00:51:07,033 --> 00:51:09,643
A girl jumps out in a panic.

668
00:51:10,986 --> 00:51:12,694
Says her baby's choking.

669
00:51:15,557 --> 00:51:16,948
The girl was

670
00:51:17,596 --> 00:51:19,180
very convincing.

671
00:51:22,763 --> 00:51:25,748
A goddamn doll in the car seat.

672
00:51:28,525 --> 00:51:30,420
She hit me over the back
of the head with,

673
00:51:31,586 --> 00:51:34,191
a blackjack, something.

674
00:51:45,675 --> 00:51:46,675
I'm sorry.

675
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:49,816
I'm just so sorry!

676
00:51:56,984 --> 00:51:58,200
I came to

677
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,200
handcuffed to the chain-link

678
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:04,942
of a utility house out
by the access road.

679
00:52:07,597 --> 00:52:08,897
They wore masks.

680
00:52:11,001 --> 00:52:12,751
There were three of them.

681
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:16,758
The one who spoke,

682
00:52:17,189 --> 00:52:18,384
I knew his voice.

683
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,202
The tat on his throat.

684
00:52:22,813 --> 00:52:25,438
Zobelle's right hand... Weston.

685
00:52:55,926 --> 00:52:59,207
Told me to deliver a message to you.

686
00:53:01,298 --> 00:53:03,578
Stop selling guns to color.

687
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:05,807
Said if I...

688
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:09,189
If I didn't tell you,

689
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,354
that he'd find me

690
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:15,516
and do it again.

691
00:53:25,233 --> 00:53:26,433
They raped me.

692
00:53:29,857 --> 00:53:31,257
All three of them.

693
00:53:33,164 --> 00:53:34,418
More than once.
