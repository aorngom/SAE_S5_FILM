1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,300
TWELVE CYLON MODELS

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,490
SEVEN ARE KNOWN

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,600
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,940
ONE WILL BE REVEALED

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,670
Previously on Battlestar Galactica:

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,460
Helo handpicked a crew for you.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,020
I'm giving you a ship.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,610
We liberated the Demetrius.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,550
A sewage recycling ship.

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,855
Now go.

11
00:00:31,955 --> 00:00:33,565
Find a way to Earth.

12
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:36,400
I'm telling you, guys,
this thing is a setup anyway.

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,375
I mean, you think that the old man just
gave her the ship and then cut her loose?

14
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:42,155
Hey, that's enough of that crap.

15
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:44,305
The resurrection ship didn't make the jump.

16
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:48,040
And now Cavil's baseships are breaking formation,
taking positions around our periphery.

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,590
They're going to attack.

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,320
They've taken out our FTL!

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,785
No resurrection ship.

20
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:54,195
They're really trying to kill us.

21
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:56,230
Stay the frak away from me!

22
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,210
I heard you.

23
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,080
You're Cylons!

24
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,360
A bunch of frakkin' skinjobs.

25
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,985
You think Cally killed herself
because of you, don't you?

26
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:14,030
she thought we were having an affair.

27
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:14,765
But we weren't.

28
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:15,875
No, that's right.

29
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,010
I'm not a cheater. I'm a Cylon.

30
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,115
I'm not a priest.

31
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:21,980
But that doesn't matter, you see.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,445
Something in the universe loves me.

33
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,940
God only loves that which is perfect,
and he loves you.

34
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,770
He loves you because you
are perfect just as you are.

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,880
Captain.

36
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,320
Captain!

37
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,905
I'm glad you're here.
I might have found something.

38
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:22,960
Before that, we need to talk about
making our rendezvous with the fleet.

39
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,550
Later.

40
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,515
No, no.

41
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:32,830
No. Come on.

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,525
Here.

43
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:35,800
What do you think?

44
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,850
Well.

45
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,030
It's hard to say.

46
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,100
Spectroscopics are promising.

47
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,480
But according to this, we already did
two long-range recons of that grid.

48
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,390
Both no joy.

49
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,130
Third time's the charm maybe.

50
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,300
All right,

51
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,180
I'll have Sharon prep to go as soon
as Anders gets back from his scout.

52
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,080
Hey.

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,015
What about you?

54
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:27,880
You been getting any sleep?

55
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,830
I don't know. Not...not much.

56
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,560
It was so clear when I first got back.

57
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,815
If I could...

58
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:39,760
if I could just focus,

59
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,360
I know that I can find that sound again.

60
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,810
I gotta go see the cap off.

61
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,200
We'll talk when I get back.

62
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,170
Hold up.

63
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,270
I think I'll go with you on this one.

64
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,455
You haven't flown cap since we left the fleet.

65
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:13,190
I think I'll go with you on this one.

66
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,360
I need you to tell me that
all this somehow makes sense.

67
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,090
This was my husband, James.

68
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,995
My two children, Danya and Reece.

69
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:43,940
They were on Picon when the Cylons attacked.

70
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,060
What do you feel when you
look at this photograph?

71
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,705
I feel rage

72
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:54,060
against the Cylons.

73
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,500
Not just the machines,

74
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,555
anyone involved.

75
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:01,380
The engineers who designed them.

76
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,345
The corporations,

77
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:09,080
the politicians who provoked this war
and then did nothing to protect us.

78
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,870
And most of all the gods.

79
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,130
The gods.

80
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,365
They stood by and let it all happen.

81
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:17,070
Yes, I know.

82
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,300
I know.

83
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,730
I am so sorry, Phoebe.

84
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,770
I sympathize.

85
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,230
Unfortunately, the gods cannot be blamed
for not coming to your aid.

86
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,160
It's not because they weren't listening.

87
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,830
It's because they don't exist.

88
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,980
The gods we've been praying to for
thousands of years do not exist.

89
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,160
They can't help you because
they are not real.

90
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,290
We have been pandering to our own
ignorance for far too long.

91
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:34,450
Now on my own journey I've
been wronged, persecuted.

92
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:42,405
I prayed to the gods on my knees, 
begging them for mercy.

93
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:44,475
Tortured.

94
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:46,510
I received nothing in resp...

95
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,420
I could've lived in that abyss of bitterness,

96
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,215
but that will destroy you like nothing else.

97
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:05,380
But I chose to forgive.

98
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,080
And most importantly, I began with myself.

99
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,480
"Third time's the charm?"

100
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,660
And you just went along with it?

101
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,520
It's called following orders, Lieutenant.

102
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,420
It's called dragging our feet.

103
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,440
Starbuck's pushing our go back
deadline to the last second.

104
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,485
She's afraid of what Adama's gonna say

105
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:37,840
when he realizes her vision
was just a pipe dream.

106
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,535
You've got to be kidding me.

107
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:44,995
She's taking a viper out now?

108
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:46,400
She can't be serious.

109
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,125
Maybe she could do a little finger painting...

110
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:50,910
I've heard enough bitching
and moaning to last a lifetime.

111
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,235
Two more days and we're
back with the fleet, okay?

112
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:56,550
Until then, everyone just
shut up and do your jobs.

113
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,365
Come on.

114
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:23,160
Come on.

115
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,510
Come on.

116
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,520
Starbuck, Hot Dog.

117
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,285
Didn't catch that.

118
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,590
What are your orders?

119
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,275
Hot dog, Demetrius.

120
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:33,945
You know the drill.

121
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:37,095
Keep your eyes open and stick
close to Starbuck's wing.

122
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:39,790
I know you're out here somewhere.

123
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,810
Come on.

124
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,805
Starbuck, Dradis contact.

125
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:49,610
Demetrius, we've got an inbound.

126
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,110
One bogey bearing 1-4-9er.

127
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,055
Roger that.

128
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:54,010
Call action stations.

129
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,265
Spool up the FTL for emergency jump.

130
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:58,025
Action stations, action stations.

131
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,570
Set condition one throughout the ship.

132
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,510
This is not a drill.

133
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,170
Repeat, action stations, action stations.

134
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,280
This is not a drill.

135
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,830
Son of a bitch, I knew it.

136
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,810
Demetrius, Hot Dog.

137
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,725
I've got visual.

138
00:09:15,825 --> 00:09:17,440
Cylon heavy raider.

139
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,365
Starbuck, Demetrius.

140
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:19,810
Report.

141
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,280
Report!

142
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,890
Demetrius, I'm seeing blast
damage all over this thing.

143
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,370
Starbuck, what are your orders?

144
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,425
Come on.

145
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:41,210
Talk to me, shoot me, do something.

146
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,760
Starbuck, what are your orders?

147
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,440
Kara.

148
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,940
I'm alone.

149
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,920
It's not an attack.

150
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,670
I knew I'd find you.

151
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,160
Knew you'd be out here searching.

152
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,580
Leoben?

153
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:14,610
I'm here for you, to offer a truce
between Cylon and human.

154
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,150
And a chance for you to complete your journey.

39,676 SURVIVORS

158
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,980
IN SEARCH OF A HOME

159
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,210
CALLED EARTH

160
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:15,830
<font color=#38B0DE>Battlestar Galactica
Season 4 Episode 5</font>

161
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,465
Heavy raider's docked at the aft airlock.

162
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:20,710
The animal part that controls it looks dead.

163
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,360
We only found the one Leoben aboard.

164
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,660
Starbuck's still taking one hell of a chance.

165
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,670
If he wanted to kill us,
we'd all be dead by now.

166
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,540
Just means he wants something else.

167
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,590
Kara.

168
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,720
Thank you for this.

169
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,905
We were praying for a miracle.

170
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:53,750
It wasn't a miracle.

171
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,430
It's like I knew you were out there.

172
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,375
I'm not picking up any gamma emissions, sir.

173
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:59,210
Raider's packing conventional weaponry only.

174
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,400
No nukes.

175
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,690
All right.

176
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,730
Keep checking for tracking devices.

177
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,310
Anything that might give up our position.

178
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,070
Don't look at me like that.

179
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:10,735
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:10,835 --> 00:12:13,235
The difference between the way
you were on New Caprica

181
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:16,130
- and now is--
- I'm the same person.

182
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,410
I have eyes. I can see.

183
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,415
God has taken your hand and purged
you of the questions, the doubt.

184
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,310
Your journey can finally begin.

185
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,500
But there isn't much time.

186
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,490
The others, the ones I left behind,
they need your help.

187
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,970
But not as much as you need theirs.

188
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,300
Why?

189
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,455
Your crew.

190
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,100
They don't trust you.

191
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,760
I need you to tell me why you're here...

192
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,145
Captain, we should move the prisoner.

193
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,730
A blue planet...

194
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,035
- surrounded by clouds.
- You okay?

195
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:47,290
Stop!

196
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,720
The hybrid.

197
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:04,525
When she first described it to me,
how beautiful it was, I cried.

198
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,350
You need to go to her, Kara.

199
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,890
The hybrid, she'll tell you things.

200
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,915
Amazing things.

201
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:13,155
We're done here.

202
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:14,700
Get him out of here.

203
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,590
Wait!

204
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,480
Take him to my quarters.

205
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,350
Just do it!

206
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,090
It may never make any sense.

207
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,000
Hangar deck crew tells me you've
been obsessing over this place.

208
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,640
Going over the logs.

209
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,040
Replaying the accident again and again.

210
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,610
Accident.

211
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,040
What is it?

212
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,950
I spoke to Cottle.

213
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,350
Cally was on moxopan and cosapine.

214
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,610
Antidepressants.

215
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,380
How did she go from
antidepressants to suicide?

216
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,435
Well, she was...

217
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:34,340
emotionally disturbed.

218
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,550
She would've left me.

219
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,895
She never would've left Nicky behind.

220
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:42,270
So.

221
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,730
What do you think then?

222
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,910
Someone killed her?

223
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,430
Galen, you have to let it go.

224
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,170
No, I gotta figure out what happened.

225
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,380
What if she knew?

226
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,705
How would she have known?

227
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:06,455
Maybe she sensed it.

228
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:08,475
I mean, she was your wife.

229
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:13,330
You've been different since the nebula.

230
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,840
Maybe she was afraid of you.

231
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,850
Maybe it was God's will.

232
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,470
We don't know why these things happen.

233
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,840
But God does.

234
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,690
And he has plan for us.

235
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,610
For whatever reason, her death, our awakening,

236
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,235
you gotta trust that it's all for the best.

237
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:35,850
Why are you here?

238
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,150
Because we are in this together.

239
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,540
And I am here for you, Galen.

240
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,520
I know exactly where you are right now.

241
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,380
I have been there.

242
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,840
Until Gaius helped me realize that.

243
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,730
What?

244
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:58,100
Whatever has gone on before, whatever
I have done, it doesn't matter.

245
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,490
We can still change.

246
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,150
You spend way too much time with Baltar.

247
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,530
So I guess I missed all the excitement, huh?

248
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,070
So what's the deal?

249
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,095
This Leoben, has he said anything?

250
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:30,130
Don't know.

251
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,750
Starbuck ordered the guards
to wait outside, lose the cuffs.

252
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,850
Said she didn't want to be disturbed.

253
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,710
Guess I'll talk to her.

254
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,770
Yeah, why don't you do that?

255
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,560
Hey.

256
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,580
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

257
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,375
Get the hell away from her.

258
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:03,160
Sam--Sam, stop it!

259
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,630
What is wrong with you, Kara?

260
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,140
I can see why she's so fond of you.

261
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,520
Just leave him alone.

262
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,780
You know--you know what we have to do.

263
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,095
Just remember there isn't much time.

264
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:17,750
Get him the frak out of here!

265
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,130
Cuff him and lock him in storage!

266
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,445
What is going on with you?

267
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:24,950
Kara!

268
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,170
He can help us.

269
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,525
The Cylons, they understand about Earth.

270
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,985
And you believe him?

271
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:33,210
After everything he's done to you?

272
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,740
Kara, he kept you locked up
for months on New Caprica.

273
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,740
The frakkin' mind games.

274
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,890
I swear to gods this is not a dream.

275
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,500
It's real.

276
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,480
I'm glad you're here.

277
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,890
You and Kara, did you get things worked out?

278
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,005
Because you should.

279
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:10,180
You weren't meant to be enemies.

280
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,170
No.

281
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,560
That'd be you and me.

282
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,570
What do you want from Kara?

283
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,580
The same thing I've always wanted.

284
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,460
For her to understand her destiny.

285
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,515
That's not good enough.

286
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:27,540
It's good enough for her.

287
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,010
What is the most basic article of faith?

288
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,850
That this is not all that we are.

289
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,760
C-bucks rule.

290
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,890
What did you just say?

291
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,805
Forward guard, right?

292
00:18:58,905 --> 00:18:59,905
I saw a couple of games.

293
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,075
You were good.

294
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:04,555
Yet after all the celebrity
and acclaim, what were you?

295
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:06,090
Just another face selling magazines.

296
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,540
Another piece of scoreboard trivia, and you
always knew you were destined for more.

297
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,380
You were just waiting for your
singular moment of clarity.

298
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,505
Well, maybe I just found it.

299
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:19,740
You kill me, Kara's dream dies with me.

300
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,005
I don't think so.

301
00:19:22,105 --> 00:19:26,460
I think you download into another
Leoben body and you spew more lies.

302
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,390
No one's coming back.

303
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,745
We were lured out of resurrection range.

304
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:37,955
Ship was attacked.

305
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:38,730
We survived.

306
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,555
The baseship was damaged.

307
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:42,330
We were set adrift.

308
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,610
What are you talking about?

309
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,350
Who attacked you?

310
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,580
War has broken out between the Cylons.

311
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,520
Battle lines have been drawn

312
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:02,380
between those who embrace their
nature and those who fear it.

313
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,630
Good.

314
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,690
You can blow yourselves
to hell for all I care.

315
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,025
That's one way, that's one way.

316
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,330
There's another.

317
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,000
An alliance.

318
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,400
Allow our paths to converge.

319
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,960
You save us from our savage brothers.

320
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:25,735
And our old one, the hybrid,
will show Kara the righteous path.

321
00:20:25,835 --> 00:20:29,925
And together, they'll lead us
to the promised land.

322
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:33,360
Together, we will find Earth.

323
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,925
He said his baseship was attacked;

324
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:45,370
that they were ambushed by their own kind.

325
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,650
So now the Cylons want us to rescue them.

326
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,670
That's novel.

327
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:54,585
Well, he's proposing an alliance
between us and his damaged baseship.

328
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:56,000
How's that supposed to work?

329
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,605
Yeah, are supposed to leave
them piggyback on our nav

330
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:01,950
and FTL systems and help
them jump out of harm's way?

331
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,755
They'll join forces with the fleet.

332
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:05,260
Right.

333
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,640
If it's true.

334
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,830
Frak.

335
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,590
Are you actually thinking about doing this?

336
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,670
XO, listen.

337
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,740
Bringing Leoben on board,
that was questionable at best.

338
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,140
But jumping back to his baseship?

339
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,050
It's suicide.

340
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,920
Nothing's been decided.

341
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,950
And will you trust Starbuck to
make the right decision?

342
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:22,920
Because she's out of control.

343
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,640
Whoa, what are you saying?

344
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,850
We are running on fumes, Anders.

345
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,020
In two days we are gonna be overdue
for our rendezvous with the fleet.

346
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,840
We gotta do something before
she takes us all down with her.

347
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,010
Are you talking mutiny?

348
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
'Cause that's sure what it sounds like.

349
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,345
You want to tear this ship apart,

350
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:46,265
then keep riling up the crew
making your crazy Starbuck cracks.

351
00:21:46,365 --> 00:21:48,650
Otherwise, I suggest you both shut the frak up.

352
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,450
Starbuck is leading us into a trap.

353
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,220
Cylons are gonna capture the freighter.

354
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,655
They're gonna have nav data
straight back to the fleet.

355
00:21:57,755 --> 00:21:59,830
Then we better keep that from happening.

356
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,980
Order the cap back and lock down the ship.

357
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,670
As soon we can work through the jump
coordinates from Leoben's raider, we go.

358
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,960
It's a chance to find Earth!

359
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,620
I intend to take it.

360
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,960
Not that I particularly care,

361
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,900
but since I haven't been
arrested recently or beaten up,

362
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,390
can I...can I surmise that the president

363
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,590
has not been apprised of my pirate broadcasts?

364
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,360
Actually, I told her all about them.

365
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,040
I even suggested she speak to the admiral.

366
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,550
Really.

367
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,510
I guess you'll have to do something about that.

368
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,470
Or not.

369
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,580
Even Roslin and Adama must realize the
movement's taken on a life of its own.

370
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,305
It's gonna take them more than
bashing in a few heads to stop this.

371
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:20,380
The truth is you're not worth another
confrontation in the quorum.

372
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:27,095
You may be drawing more bodies to your
crusade, but they're from the fringes.

373
00:23:27,195 --> 00:23:29,780
No one of consequence.

374
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,210
Get some clothes on.

375
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,290
They're waiting for you.

376
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,945
Think we have enough?

377
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:37,610
It doesn't matter.

378
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,180
They'd not coming to be fed.

379
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,120
They're coming to hear Dr. Baltar's word,

380
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,180
and learn from it, just like we did.

381
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,680
The past is written.

382
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,080
Impossible to change.

383
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,380
Why are so many of us living in the past?

384
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,970
Living with the shame of what we have done.

385
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:21,360
When we could live in awe of what we might do.

386
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,650
At we might do.

387
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,900
What will we do?

388
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,220
Spiral endlessly through the heavens until
humanity itself comes to a close?

389
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,530
Or do we look inward...

390
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,230
and find that strength within?

391
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,420
Can you believe these people
are buying into Baltar's crap?

392
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,950
We need to talk.

393
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,355
I don't have anything to say to you.

394
00:24:53,455 --> 00:24:54,775
Well, then you can listen.

395
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,180
Come with me.

396
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,940
I've been cutting you some slack
because of Cally, but that's over.

397
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,980
You gotta pull yourself together now.

398
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,620
Suck it up.

399
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,880
Just like you, huh?

400
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,050
Now what is that supposed to mean?

401
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,310
I hear you've been spending some
time in the lockup with the Six.

402
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,830
Remember when this all started?

403
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,250
You said nothing would change you
from the man you want to be.

404
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,970
Well, how about it, Colonel?

405
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,800
You still the same old Saul Tigh?

406
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,830
Anything I've done I can live with.

407
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,140
Well, that's the difference
between you and me.

408
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,280
I can't.

409
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:46,085
Tory's got in her head that we can be
the salvation of the human race.

410
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:48,340
All I know is if there is a God,

411
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,970
he's laughing his ass off.

412
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,800
EVA is almost complete, captain.

413
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,525
Demetrius, Mathias.

414
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:08,360
I've finished inspection of the aft section.

415
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,780
She's a big sucker.

416
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,680
Okay, wrap it up, sarge.

417
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,650
Get back to nest asap.

418
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,400
Roger that, Athena.

419
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,100
I was getting bored with the view anyhow.

420
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,040
Hold up.

421
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,525
Got a leak.

422
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:33,015
Some kind of gas venting
through a crack in the hull.

423
00:26:33,115 --> 00:26:34,960
Something's happening.

424
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,780
Mathias, report.

425
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,310
Mathias, report!

426
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,400
What are you all doing here?

427
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,940
The reason that we are all here

428
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,440
is 'cause the old ways have failed us.

429
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,475
It doesn't matter if you're
a believer or a nonbeliever.

430
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:05,140
It certainly makes no difference to me.

431
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,190
You are all welcome.

432
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,410
Mr. Tyrol.

433
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,300
Mr. Tyrol.

434
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,840
I know that we have had our differences,

435
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,260
but I am begging you right
now to set those aside.

436
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,640
Come down here and take my hand.

437
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,440
If not for yourself, then for your wife.

438
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,460
For Cally.

439
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,840
She would've wanted this.

440
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,960
Cally wasn't like me.

441
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,370
She forgave you for New Caprica.

442
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,690
Even read your bogus manifesto, 
but not me.

443
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,720
You may have your sheep fooled.

444
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,920
They may be buying into your
message of forgiveness.

445
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,180
But let me tell you:

446
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:18,650
There are some sins that even your
imaginary god can never forgive.

447
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,835
I have not been talking about an imaginary god.

448
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:26,350
I am asking you to take my hand.

449
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,150
Take my hand, Mr. Tyrol.

450
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,910
For Cally.

451
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,100
It's what she would've wanted.

452
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,765
Get off of him!

453
00:29:51,865 --> 00:29:52,880
Leave him!

454
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,510
Leave him!

455
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,970
You didn't know her!

456
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,880
I heard an explosion. 
Are you all right?

457
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,740
What'd you do?

458
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,145
Blow the Tylium stores?

459
00:31:17,245 --> 00:31:18,585
That's the Kara I used to know.

460
00:31:18,685 --> 00:31:21,280
The raider's in pieces, 
you mother-frakker!

461
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,430
Sergeant Mathias is dead.

462
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,600
Not that you give a damn!

463
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,495
You can't think that
I had anything to do with that.

464
00:31:31,595 --> 00:31:33,730
I wasn't even on the deck.

465
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:38,095
I was too busy believing you
instead of watching out for my crew.

466
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:39,670
My ship was under fire.

467
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,965
The reactor could've been damaged.

468
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:43,385
It was a setup.

469
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,600
Say it!

470
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,885
Hit me, hit me again.

471
00:31:47,985 --> 00:31:50,905
You used me to get close to the ship.

472
00:31:51,005 --> 00:31:53,015
How many times did you 
kill me on New Caprica?

473
00:31:53,115 --> 00:31:53,885
Don't stop now.

474
00:31:53,985 --> 00:31:55,800
- Frak you!
- Go on, do it.

475
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,650
I won't come back this time, I promise.

476
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,955
Resurrection ship's well out of range.

477
00:32:00,055 --> 00:32:01,230
Go on, do it.

478
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,570
Do it!

479
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,090
It doesn't help.

480
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,800
Does it?

481
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,350
Nothing feels quite like it did before.

482
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,070
Does it?

483
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,290
What are you doing to me?

484
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,070
All of your life...

485
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,230
you forced back the truth by
lashing out at everyone around you.

486
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,000
Anesthetizing yourself with
ambrosia and empty affairs.

487
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,850
But you've lost the taste for those petty things.

488
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,495
I'm the same person.

489
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,945
No, there's a void,

490
00:32:54,045 --> 00:32:57,240
an emptiness that can only be filled by
taking the next step on your journey.

491
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,050
What happened to me the two months I was missing?

492
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,265
I don't know.

493
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:05,070
The mandala, the paintings, my mother.

494
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,035
It had to mean something.

495
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:09,380
You have to make peace with your past.

496
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,535
Why?

497
00:33:12,635 --> 00:33:14,230
Because that part of you is gone.

498
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,025
I told you when I first came aboard
this ship that you had changed.

499
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,635
I look at you now, 
I don't see Kara Thrace.

500
00:33:19,735 --> 00:33:20,860
I see.

501
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,200
an angel blazing with the light of God.

502
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,640
An angel eager to lead her people home.

503
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,465
This is bad.

504
00:33:32,565 --> 00:33:34,120
This is really bad.

505
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,670
She can't explain this one away.

506
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,650
So you think she's a Cylon now?

507
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,795
Starbuck's racked up more kills
than any pilot in the fleet.

508
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,320
Yeah, Starbuck maybe.

509
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,870
Okay, but who the hell knows who
got off that viper two months ago?

510
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,650
I'm not really very good at any of this.

511
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,000
We've all come to remember 
Sergeant Erin mathias.

512
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,190
To grieve for our loss.

513
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,060
To honor her.

514
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,750
Mathias is dead because of me.

515
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,855
We've all heard the words, the prayers,

516
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:24,040
but I don't know what any of it means anymore.

517
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,950
We want to believe that she died for something.

518
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,235
But in this war, people die and it is just stupid.

519
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:34,570
It's an accident. 
There's no nobility to it.

520
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,515
There's nothing we can grab onto
that's gonna make it any easier.

521
00:34:37,615 --> 00:34:39,620
They're just gone.

522
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,300
I have to live with that.

523
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,880
You know, I know...

524
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,800
that this has been a difficult mission. 
And...

525
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,260
maybe I haven't...

526
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,220
Captain, we've downloaded the
rendezvous coordinates to the FTL.

527
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,790
We're ready to jump back to
the fleet on your order.

528
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,240
We're not going back to the fleet.

529
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,535
What the hell are you talking about?

530
00:35:24,635 --> 00:35:26,055
We came out here to complete a mission.

531
00:35:26,155 --> 00:35:28,580
That baseship has something
to do with it, I know it.

532
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,270
Captain Agathon.

533
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,635
Lock down the ship.

534
00:35:32,735 --> 00:35:33,990
Prepare to jump.

535
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,265
No, you know what?

536
00:35:39,365 --> 00:35:41,140
Frak her and frak her little pet Cylon, okay?

537
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,865
- Pike!
- This baseship was never part of the mission.

538
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:45,660
Okay, one of us is dead now.

539
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,435
One of us is dead,

540
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:50,350
and if we don't leave right now
we are all going to die, all right?

541
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,715
Let it go-- just let it go, Pike!

542
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:54,490
- Everybody stand down!
- If I don't do anything, we're all gonna die!

543
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,825
- Get out of my way.
- You have your orders, Pike.

544
00:35:55,925 --> 00:35:56,465
Now back off.

545
00:35:56,565 --> 00:35:58,895
You better choose which 
side you're on, captain.

546
00:35:58,995 --> 00:35:59,960
Walk away.

547
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,185
Walk away and this doesn't go any further!

548
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,170
Huh, you'd be the one to protect
that Cylon thing, right--unh!

549
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,765
Gaius, I just don't understand what
you're trying to accomplish.

550
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,965
- I mean, this man is psychotic.
- My message is for everyone.

551
00:36:42,065 --> 00:36:43,085
Especially for the ones who don't want to listen.

552
00:36:43,185 --> 00:36:45,280
- I just don't think it's safe.
- Five minutes, that's all.

553
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,480
Mr. Tyrol.

554
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,335
- Gaius, I really don't think--
- There's nothing to be afraid of.

555
00:36:59,435 --> 00:37:00,990
Be careful.

556
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,690
Look, uh, chief, I...

557
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,040
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.

558
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,010
About my presumption earlier.

559
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,600
You were right, you know.

560
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,630
I hardly knew your wife.

561
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,760
I'm sorry.

562
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,520
Would you mind if I...

563
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,890
just, um...

564
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,780
I know it's hard to...

565
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,200
make sense of things sometimes.

566
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,290
In my own life...

567
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,325
In my own life, I joined the fleet as a scientist,

568
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:13,490
as a skeptic, as supposedly a man of reason.

569
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,370
Only to have fate turn that all on its head,

570
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,490
but I understand now that
there is a purpose to it.

571
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,580
We change.

572
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,820
We evolve.

573
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,460
Maybe we even learn something along the way.

574
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,610
I have committed...

575
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,840
unconscionable crimes...

576
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,820
and I have been offered one
last chance at redemption.

577
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,170
Because I chose to accept my fate,

578
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,280
not fight it anymore.

579
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,270
I'm so sorry for your loss, chief.

580
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,605
She was a very beautiful woman, your wife.

581
00:39:26,705 --> 00:39:28,520
I'm also told quite spiritual.

582
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,420
You know, I don't expect you 
to believe me, but...

583
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,260
I would very much like to have known her better.

584
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,050
Thank you.

585
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,555
Action stations, action stations.

586
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:13,070
Set Condition One throughout the ship.

587
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,300
Are you really gonna do this?

588
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,790
I don't have any choice.

589
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,730
Yes, you do.

590
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,080
FTL's spooled, captain.

591
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,780
Good.

592
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,450
Set the clock.

593
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,140
Captain.

594
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,980
Captain, I'm asking you to reconsider.

595
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,570
There's not enough time.

596
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,800
We don't go now, we lose our shot.

597
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,925
That's assuming we believe the Cylon.

598
00:40:51,025 --> 00:40:53,135
That's assuming we believe that
Leoben's coordinates are right.

599
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:55,545
We don't jump into a nest of baseships
or the middle of a star...

600
00:40:55,645 --> 00:40:58,200
Galactica's standing orders are clear.

601
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,685
If we miss the rendezvous,
Adama will assume we're dead or captured.

602
00:41:01,785 --> 00:41:02,595
They will leave us.

603
00:41:02,695 --> 00:41:04,690
No. Not Adama.

604
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,325
Listen to me, we can jump back to Galactica.

605
00:41:07,425 --> 00:41:09,455
Okay, if the admiral's for it, we can re-supply,

606
00:41:09,555 --> 00:41:11,120
send out an armed patrol.

607
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,470
Do not do this, Helo.

608
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,960
I can't allow you to risk
the lives of this ship's crew.

609
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,765
When the admiral put me in command,
he told me to trust my instincts.

610
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:32,455
Find the next marker, see if it checks out.

611
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:35,840
Lead the people from the fleet home.

612
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,845
That is what I intend to do.

613
00:41:37,945 --> 00:41:40,200
Now prepare to jump!

614
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:47,150
I'm sorry, sir, but I cannot obey that order.

615
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,870
Then you are relieved, captain.

616
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,370
Mr. Gaeta, you are now the new XO.

617
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,480
Prepare to jump on my mark.

618
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,430
No, sir.

619
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,670
Okay, everybody needs to think about
what they're doing here.

620
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,660
They have thought about it, Sam.

621
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,830
They all have.

622
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,160
It's a mutiny.

623
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:45,520
Captain Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius,

624
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,190
and acting under article ten of
the colonial military code,

625
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:54,740
I'm hereby relieving you of command.
