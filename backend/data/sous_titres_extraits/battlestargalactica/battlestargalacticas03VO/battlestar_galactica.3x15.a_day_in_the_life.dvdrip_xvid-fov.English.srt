00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,033
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,513
Congratulations on making captain.

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,433
Sorry l wasn't there.

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,478
- Thank you, sir.
- How's your mother?

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,028
Getting married.

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,592
In the mountains north of here
there's this little stream.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,276
The water's so clear,
it's like looking through glass.

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,352
l'm thinking of building a cabin.

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,957
- <i>(Apollo) You and Cally have a fight?</i>
- <i>We should have sold tickets.</i>

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,074
To marriage - why we build bars.

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,828
It's not too late for Baltar
to just disappear.

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,360
l can't do that.

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,671
For all his crimes, he's one of us.

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,671
So what happens next?

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,273
We give him his trial.

16
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,476
<i>(buzzer)</i>

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,635
- <i>(man) Colonel Tigh to see you, Admiral.</i>
- <i>(Adama)</i> Enter.

18
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,396
- You're up early.
- Couldn't sleep.

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,710
So l thought l'd make myself useful.

20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,390
Happy anniversary, Bill.

21
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,718
- <i>(baby cries)</i>
- <i>(Cally)</i> Hey...

22
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,834
Shh.

23
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,956
It's OK.

24
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,557
It's OK.

25
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,599
l don't know. Here.
Just double-check it for me.

26
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,750
l think Daddy's getting good at this.

27
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,990
Daddy's tired of burning his wrists.

28
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,833
We gotta get ready.
We got morning watch.

29
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,357
- We were spending the day with Nicky.
- But Laskin and Perry called in sick.

30
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,715
- <i>(Nicky cries)</i>
- It's OK.

31
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,435
Shh.

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,637
So you volunteered us in their place?
We barely get any time off as it is.

33
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,711
You know the deck is short-handed.

34
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,429
The deck has been short-handed
since we got here.

35
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,830
Frakking daycare workers
see more of Nicky than we do.

36
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,391
Until the daycare workers figure out
how to strip a Viper, this is the way it'll be.

37
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,550
Hey, buddy. Come here.

38
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,790
Oh. Oh. Oh, l know.
l know, l know.

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,556
You just laid down, too, didn't you?
Come here. l got you.

40
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,437
<i>(sighs)</i>

41
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,910
Here you go.
l'll take him to daycare.

42
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,838
Come on, buddy.
Come on.

43
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,911
Hey!

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,195
Forgetting something?

45
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,788
- What's on duty schedule?
- <i>(Tigh)</i> Nothing sexy.

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,192
CO2 scrubber's out near sickbay.
Broken water line in the galley.

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,034
Oh, now that most of our Vipers
are out of dry dock,

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,351
Chiefs gonna have a look
at the servos in airlock 12.

49
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,678
Could you, please?

50
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,591
- Is that it?
- <i>(sighs)</i>

51
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,830
Fleet's quiet.

52
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,277
You can use some time for yourself.
l can handle first watch.

53
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,033
l'll be keeping my schedule.

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,554
This is just another day.

55
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,756
<i>(Carolanne) Just another day?</i>

56
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,719
<i>Maybe l should have married him</i>
<i>instead of you.</i>

57
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,678
<i>(Adama) l could have sold tickets to that.</i>

58
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,437
<i>(Carolanne)</i> We had some good times.

59
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,714
<i>(sighs)</i>

60
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,151
But more bad.

61
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,874
<i>But you keep bringing me back anyway.</i>
<i>Just this one day. Year after year.</i>

62
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,188
Only thing l can't understand is why.

63
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,153
- <i>(Adama)</i> Neither do I.
- <i>(man)</i> Excuse me, sir.

64
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,674
Put it on the table, uh, Private.

65
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,751
<i>(man)</i> Jaffee, sir.

66
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,993
- Would there be anything else, Admiral?
- That will be all, Jaffee.

67
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,714
- <i>(Carolanne) lt's going to be a long day.</i>
- <i>(Adama) lt always is.</i>

68
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,114
Morning, Chief.

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,514
- Is Nicky OK?
- Yeah, he's fine.

70
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,230
The first time he didn't cry
when l dropped him off at daycare.

71
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,676
So, Figurski. You gonna at least pretend
to do something today?

72
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,637
Oh, frakking scrubber.

73
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,193
It takes Adama two seconds to sign off
on an order that'll take us all day.

74
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,510
It'll take you all day, anyhow.

75
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,195
Seelix. Cally.
You're with me. Airlock 12.

76
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,792
- Seelix, can you get the door?
- Yep.

77
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,511
- <i>(Cally)</i> This place is a mess.
- The Cylons blew the hell out of it.

78
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,479
Nobody's been down here
since Damage Control plugged the holes.

79
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,676
- Seelix, can you hear me there?
- Yeah.

80
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,877
<i>See if you can find</i>
<i>the electrical diagrams for the airlock.</i>

81
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,949
OK.

82
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,953
Ooh, l did find
somebody's year-old lunch.

83
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,069
- He didn't even cry?
- Cal, l told you. Nicky is fine.

84
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,596
Anybody could've dragged a tool bag
here. It didn't have to be me.

85
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,355
Yeah, well, you know these gearing
systems better than anybody.

86
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,557
You want me to give you
special treatment? How'd that look?

87
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,631
l don't care!

88
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,749
We try to pretend our lives are exactly like
they were before we went to New Caprica.

89
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,479
But it <i>is</i> different.

90
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,518
We're married.
We have a son.

91
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,672
Yeah. It's just a little rough patch.

92
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,070
<i>(Cally) What if rough patches</i>
<i>are all we have left?</i>

93
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,115
We swore we would raise
Nicky ourselves.

94
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,918
Well, we swore a lot of things.

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,516
<i>The Cylons didn't exactly cooperate.</i>
<i>You wanna give me those wire cutters?</i>

96
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,558
<i>(alarm)</i>

97
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,475
What the hell?

98
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,438
<i>(sighs)</i> For frak's sake.

99
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,637
Seelix, what are you doing?
Open the door.

100
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,553
<i>(Seelix)</i> l didn't do anything.

101
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,389
<i>Chief, l'm picking up</i>
<i>a pressure differential in there.</i>

102
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,474
<i>It's nothing drastic,</i>
<i>but you guys are definitely losing air.</i>

103
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,198
It doesn't take much.

104
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,078
Once the airflow sensors
detect a big enough leak,

105
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,358
all the inner doors drop automatically.
It's just a safety precaution.

106
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,590
- l feel safer already.
- <i>Wait a second.</i>

107
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,990
<i>Are you saying that</i>
<i>the hull's been breached?</i>

108
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,072
"Breach" is a bit dramatic
but the air's going somewhere.

109
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,197
One of these patches must have cracked
when we came in.

110
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,955
As soon as we plug it and restore
the pressure, the door should open.

111
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,398
Then we pull the work orders on whoever
made these welds and kick their asses.

112
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,156
Yeah, well, the most important thing is to
keep breathing, so let's just find the leak.

113
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,515
- Ah.
- <i>(hissing)</i>

114
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,273
This is it, right here.
This one.

115
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,990
Leeson takes first watch.

116
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,430
Leeson takes first watch.

117
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,031
Kinsey checks the roster.

118
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,310
Kinsey checks the roster.

119
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,555
Jaffee brings me coffee.

120
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,716
Jaffee brings me coffee.

121
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,873
Are you still doing that?
The memory exercises?

122
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,270
Do you really think they expect you
to know all of their names?

123
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,033
- You never change, do you?
- <i>(laughs)</i>

124
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,398
One of the joys of being long dead...
l suppose.

125
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,678
Now, hurry.
You're going to be late meeting Laura.

126
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,799
<i>Maybe she's got a thing for bad boys.</i>
<i>She wouldn't be the first.</i>

127
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,758
She's the president
of the Twelve Colonies.

128
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,719
Oh, l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
Of course.

129
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,518
Since you've created
one godlike facade for yourself,

130
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,875
why not invent another one for her?

131
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,111
<i>lt's another excuse</i>
<i>to keep your distance.</i>

132
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,232
- Admiral.
- Madam President.

133
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,595
- How are you?
- Very good.

134
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,797
l'm sure this all could have been done
over the wireless,

135
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,429
but l was going stir-crazy
on Colonial One and l had to get out.

136
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,195
Deep-space pilots
used to call it OBE.

137
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,953
- What's OBE?
- Overcome by events.

138
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,112
And you're always welcome here.
You know that.

139
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,636
You may not feel that way after you finish
this. Tory actually drew up an agenda.

140
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,316
Baltar again.

141
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,390
Hm.

142
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,359
- Can't we give him back to the Cylons?
- You know how much l love that idea.

143
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,479
Unfortunately, given what little
l was able to glean from the Caprica Six,

144
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,994
l don't think the Cylons
would take him back.

145
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,277
Fine. Then try the son of a bitch
and be done with it.

146
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,911
We have to give him a trial, but under
what law? Caprican, Picon, Tauron?

147
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,675
Do we give him a jury trial?
Do we set up a tribunal?

148
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,231
We don't even have anything closely
resembling a comprehensive law library

149
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,517
and this fleet is not exactly brimming
with legal talent.

150
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,309
You bring lawyers into this, they're
gonna drag you around for months.

151
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,392
Wasn't your father
an attorney on Caprica?

152
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,313
Yes. l told you
l didn't get along with him very well.

153
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,038
Oh, right, OK.

154
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,554
l'm ready to set up
an organising committee,

155
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,156
but frankly, trying to get a room
full of legal scholars to stay on task

156
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,995
is like herding cats, and so l need
to set up a chairman of this committee.

157
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,676
Somebody who can make a hard decision
and won't get seduced by all the legalese.

158
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,038
- Do you have a candidate?
- In fact, l do. l was thinking Lee.

159
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,839
Like grandfather, like grandson.
What do you think?

160
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,196
l'm not gonna say
he's incapable of handling it,

161
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,511
but he's never shown
any type of interest in law.

162
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,349
l know, but here's the thing.
We can use the lawyers to parse the law

163
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,194
but we need people who know
the difference between right and wrong.

164
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,555
- That's Lee.
- l'll talk to him.

165
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,312
Good.

166
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,436
Also, Admiral?

167
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,230
l was wondering if you'd mind if l stayed
on your ship for the rest of the day.

168
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,709
Please. By all means.

169
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,313
This is very difficult for me to say,
but l'm going to go to the gym.

170
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,158
Prepare yourself. On its best days
it smells like the inside of a shoe.

171
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,629
<i>(laughs)</i>

172
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,791
<i>(alarm)</i>

173
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,597
See if there's another patch. l want to
double up on this one, make sure it holds.

174
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,514
- Come on, Cal. Faster is better.
- l heard you the first time.

175
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,717
Sir.

176
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,595
Sir.

177
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,477
Admiral.

178
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,789
<i>(laughter)</i>

179
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,677
<i>(laughter stops)</i>

180
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,354
<i>(Carolanne) You're better</i>
<i>at ignoring all that.</i>

181
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,036
<i>That sudden hush, those sidelong</i>
<i>glances. That really used to get to you.</i>

182
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,918
l don't ever recall
being able to intimidate you.

183
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,709
That's right. But l knew you
long before you were the admiral.

184
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,429
Back when you were just Bill.
The husband who wasn't there.

185
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,671
The father who left.
Just Bill.

186
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,514
Who is Bill Adama, anyway?
It's still a good question.

187
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,433
<i>l wonder if l'll get an answer.</i>

188
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,913
49 days without a sighting.
Maybe we finally scared the toasters off.

189
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,313
Oh, yeah, Narcho. Your crap flying's
put the fear of the gods in 'em.

190
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,471
What's up, buddy?

191
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,635
What's the matter with you?

192
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,156
Sorry. l've got the weirdest rash.

193
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,151
Really?

194
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,629
Hope she was worth it, buddy.

195
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,591
Ten-hut!

196
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,431
<i>(Apollo)</i> At ease.

197
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,951
Before we get started,
l want a show of hands.

198
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,828
How many of you boneheads
know how to count?

199
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,717
l keep hearing numbers
thrown around the hangar deck.

200
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,439
47, then 48,

201
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,398
now 49 days
since our last enemy contact.

202
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,268
Now, l realise that any higher math's
probably beyond most of you,

203
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,319
so l'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

204
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,399
One is the only number
you need to remember.

205
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,430
Because all it takes is for one pilot
to let his guard down,

206
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,080
one ECO to miss a DRADIS contact,

207
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,436
and suddenly the Cylons
are on top of us.

208
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,149
That's when people die.

209
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,793
<i>(Adama) He's like both of us.</i>

210
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,114
Proud, stubborn and angry.

211
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,596
<i>But he's coming into his own,</i>
<i>especially in the last few months.</i>

212
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,830
<i>(Carolanne) Don't tell me.</i>

213
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,276
- Tell him.
- He knows.

214
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,874
Knows what?

215
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,669
That the admiral's going to give him
a good performance review?

216
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,149
<i>Or that his father loves him?</i>

217
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,316
Don't tell me the admiral's façade
extends to Lee, too.

218
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,750
<i>(Apollo)</i> Formation flying.
Deflection shooting.

219
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,755
Tactics. Doing touch-and-gos until
every last one of you hits an OK-three.

220
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,719
Red and blue sections will go first.
Yellow and green will follow.

221
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,792
Skids up in ten minutes.
Dismissed.

222
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,794
Starbuck, if you've got a problem,
l don't want to hear about it.

223
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,032
My only problem is that you didn't
preach that sermon a week ago.

224
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,872
Find some new material, though.

225
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,555
The old man's been using that
"one fatal mistake" line since we got here.

226
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,235
If you're gonna steal,
steal from the best.

227
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,997
Sir.

228
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,191
Pretty tough on them today.

229
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,748
A kick in the butt
is worth a thousand words.

230
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,718
Gods know you kicked mine enough.

231
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,718
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, it's been one of those mornings.

232
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,758
The president wants
to fast-track Baltar's trial.

233
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,638
She wants someone
to take charge of the preliminaries,

234
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,794
help cobble together the legal framework.
She wants me to assign you.

235
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,317
You're kidding.

236
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,551
Interested?

237
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,519
Uh, more surprised.
Did she say why she asked for me?

238
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,273
She's gonna need someone
that she can trust.

239
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,235
You definitely fit that.

240
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,278
l remember when you were younger,
you'd go visit your grandfather's house.

241
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,319
You were fascinated
with his papers and his law books.

242
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,550
<i>(laughs)</i>

243
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,359
And there was me
thinking l was being sly,

244
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,513
sneaking off into his office
all by myself.

245
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,597
l guess it's a pipe dream now,

246
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,958
but for five minutes there
l really did consider lawyer

247
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:16,036
as one of a dozen careers that l could
go into before l joined the service.

248
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,709
Hm.

249
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,629
l never knew that.

250
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,153
Well, it was probably during
one of my, um..."angry at Dad" phases.

251
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,516
Anyway, it's impossible.

252
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,353
Even if l wanted to help out,
there's no way.

253
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,479
CAG's duty's already 24-7,
even on a light week.

254
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,556
Yeah. l assumed that.

255
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,790
<i>(Narcho)</i> Major? We're ready for you.

256
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,440
Excuse me.

257
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,791
<i>(alarm continues)</i>

258
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,913
Yeah, well, one's gonna have to do.
Seelix? Check the pressure.

259
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,074
If that patch holds, we'll equalise in
a few minutes and this door's gonna open.

260
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,950
<i>(hissing)</i>

261
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,955
Oh, my gods.

262
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,471
<i>(air escaping)</i>

263
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,678
- How are they doing?
- Still alive.

264
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,350
<i>(woman on PA) This is a condition three</i>
<i>alert. Hull breach on deck 14.</i>

265
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,559
Chief.

266
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,232
Admiral.

267
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,359
l seem to have turned this
into a full-blown FUBAR.

268
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,116
<i>You'd be doing us a hell of a favour</i>
<i>if you get those doors open.</i>

269
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,034
We gotta get them out of there.

270
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,354
Keep moving. Keep moving.

271
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,156
The airlock's designed to lock down
if the pressure decreases.

272
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,756
l know the system.
We have redundancies, we have backups.

273
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,834
The manual override is down. There is no
way of getting those inner doors to open.

274
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,799
- It must have taken heavy damage.
- The whole ship's taken a pounding.

275
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,192
We need six weeks just to hammer out
the dings, let alone the structural damage.

276
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,149
- How much time do they have?
- They'll be out of air in half an hour.

277
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,837
Those are blast doors. It would take
at least an hour to cut through them.

278
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,674
Why don't we put explosives
in the observation booth? Blow the glass.

279
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,320
No, the glass can withstand
a tylium explosion.

280
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,791
Anything strong enough to take out
the glass will take out Tyrol and Cally too.

281
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,838
l need a rescue plan,

282
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,150
not excuses.

283
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,196
- Seven seconds.
- And another ten to repressurise,

284
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,477
since we'll be doing this in open space.
That's pushing it.

285
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,109
All right. Has anyone ever tried
a rescue like this before?

286
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,715
- No one's ever been crazy enough.
- We're out of time. Prep for launch.

287
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,236
- We've only got 18 minutes left.
- All right. Let's go. We're on.

288
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,279
<i>(Cally)</i> Galen.

289
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,479
<i>(Adama) Airlock's still jammed, Chief.</i>

290
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,154
<i>Overrides are not responding.</i>

291
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,992
l guess we're kind of running out
of options.

292
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,675
<i>l'm gonna take you out</i>
<i>through the front door.</i>

293
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,356
You'll put a ship out there
and rig up some kind of docking collar?

294
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,275
<i>You'll be out of air in a few minutes.</i>
<i>There's no time for a collar.</i>

295
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,279
<i>Sir, if you're talking about an EVA</i>
<i>we don't have pressure suits.</i>

296
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,191
We don't have a choice.

297
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,034
Athena's gonna position her Raptor
in front of the airlock, hatch open.

298
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,509
We're gonna blow the bolts
off that door

299
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,831
and when it opens up,
you're gonna have to jump for it.

300
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,038
Now, listen to me, both of you.
You can do this.

301
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:14,309
<i>People have been able to live</i>
<i>up to a minute in exposure without a suit.</i>

302
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,437
- Admiral, l don't know.
- <i>We'll talk later.</i>

303
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,636
<i>Get ready.</i>

304
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,629
<i>(woman) Athena, you have priority</i>
<i>clearance. All other traffic is waved away.</i>

305
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,473
<i>(Cally) Wait. (sobs)</i>

306
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,950
- What about Nicky?
- Admiral's right.

307
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,235
We have to prep.

308
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,518
l'll move everything
away from here to the door.

309
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,195
Galen, we both know what happens
to kids in the fleet

310
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,510
when their parents
aren't there for them.

311
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,479
<i>Apollo and Dee.</i>
<i>They'll take care of him.</i>

312
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,199
<i>No. No pilots.</i>

313
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,078
<i>He's not going through this twice.</i>

314
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,757
Sir?

315
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,359
There's a civilian family.

316
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,833
Mother's name is Susan Settler.
She has a little girl.

317
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,198
- If anything happens to us...
- <i>l'll see to it.</i>

318
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,916
l was being selfish.

319
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,868
l wanted you with me,

320
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,428
like old times.

321
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,590
l didn't think about Nick.

322
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,551
<i>l'm sorry.</i>

323
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,192
Admiral's gonna get us
out of here, OK?

324
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,272
We're gonna take care of Nicky.

325
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,909
More than a few seconds out there,
we're talking severe exposure,

326
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,232
decompression sickness,
hypothermia - they could freeze to death.

327
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,472
Make sure Cottle's got
his hyperbaric chamber ready.

328
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,958
<i>(Cally) l'm sorry.</i>

329
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,989
<i>Galactica, Apollo. Bringing Raptor</i>
<i>into position at E mark 12.</i>

330
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,515
Put your mask on.

331
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,599
Listen up. We don't have time
to hang back until the airlock doors blow

332
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,276
so we're liable to experience some
turbulence, maybe some shrapnel hits.

333
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,716
Athena, you're going to have
to be ready to compensate.

334
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,588
l'm on it, Major. l'll hold position
until Chief and Cally are secured.

335
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,478
Let's just get this done.

336
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,069
<i>Galactica,</i> Apollo. Raptor door is open.
We're standing by. Ready to execute.

337
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,832
Chief, Cally.

338
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,795
<i>Raptor's in position.</i>
<i>We've got to go now.</i>

339
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,348
Get ready to blow the hatch,
on my mark.

340
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,552
OK.

341
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,871
No matter what,
you hold onto me.

342
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,908
And don't let go. OK.

343
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,350
Three.

344
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,632
<i>Two.</i>

345
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,790
One. Do it.

346
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,917
<i>(Apollo)</i> Whoa! Watch out!
Big break! Big break!

347
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,069
<i>(alarm)</i>

348
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,750
- <i>(Starbuck)</i> We're in position.
- Pull up your nose. Pull up!

349
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,230
- <i>(Sharon)</i> l've got it!
- <i>(Apollo)</i> Hold it right there.

350
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,519
<i>Galactica, Apollo. Raptor secured</i>
<i>and pressurised. They are both safe.</i>

351
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,114
<i>We've got to get them</i>
<i>to sickbay right away.</i>

352
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,751
Come in.

353
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,109
So, any word on Chief and Cally?

354
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,877
They're alive, but Doc Cottle's
still evaluating their condition.

355
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,238
So, are you gonna tell me
what's going on with you?

356
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,075
It's this day.

357
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,876
<i>(Apollo)</i> My gods,
your wedding anniversary.

358
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,076
l had totally forgotten.

359
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:52,076
Probably seems foolish, especially
the way that it all ended up, but...

360
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,151
still...

361
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,638
It still means something to me.

362
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,676
We've never talked about it.

363
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,751
The divorce.

364
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,475
Your mother.

365
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,716
It was a bad time for all of us.

366
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:15,591
Your mother gave you
and your brother a home. Stability.

367
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,999
Dad, l know you want
to believe that, but, um...

368
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,279
You know what? Forget it.
It was a long time ago.

369
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,716
- <i>(sighs)</i>
- You have something to say, just say it.

370
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,950
<i>(sighs)</i>

371
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,235
Dad, we had four walls.

372
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,910
But stability?

373
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,990
My gods, you know
what Mom was like.

374
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,550
l mean, the mood swings...
It's why you left her.

375
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,996
We had problems, but she cared deeply
for you and your brother.

376
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,548
Things changed after you left.

377
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,476
l mean, there were times
when she lost control.

378
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,519
- <i>(Carolanne) Don't listen to him.</i>
- <i>(Apollo) She would try and apologise.</i>

379
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,558
<i>She would promise</i>
<i>that she would make things better.</i>

380
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,551
<i>But then she would start drinking.</i>

381
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,792
And then all of her good intentions
would go flying out the frakking window.

382
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,555
- <i>(Adama)</i> Is that true?
- l can't believe you'd even ask me that!

383
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,234
Dammit. Is it true?

384
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,073
<i>(Apollo)</i> Then one day
the apologies even stopped.

385
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,549
That's enough.

386
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,555
You walked out on me!
You walked out on me!

387
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,633
The brilliant commander
who could lead all of his men into combat

388
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,871
but he couldn't find a way
to live with his own family!

389
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,554
We never lived anywhere
for more than six months.

390
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,111
Just following you around from one base
to another, waiting for you to come home!

391
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,192
But you weren't here for any of us!

392
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,478
It was always whatever was easiest
for the great Adama!

393
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,348
They needed you.
They were our children.

394
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,235
They needed a father.

395
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,914
All through your glorious career,

396
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,117
you have prided yourself
on being a leader of men,

397
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,113
judging people,
always making the hard call.

398
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,636
But when it came to
the biggest decision of your life...

399
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,712
Oh, Bill, you blew it.

400
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,231
We were wrong for each other from
day one, but you just couldn't accept that.

401
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,313
<i>That's it. That's why</i>
<i>you keep calling me back.</i>

402
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,598
<i>Because if you had made</i>
<i>that mistake...</i>

403
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,355
<i>it would just call into question</i>

404
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,829
<i>all of your other decisions.</i>

405
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,468
<i>(Adama) She was still your mother, Lee.</i>

406
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,831
l loved her.

407
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,309
<i>(Apollo)</i> l believe you.

408
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,834
l just don't think she ever loved you.

409
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,395
He's right over here.

410
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,231
Hey.

411
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,869
l dropped by daycare.
Somebody wanted to see you.

412
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,554
- Who's that?
- Hey, little man.

413
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,233
- How's she doing?
- Doc Cottle says she'll be OK,

414
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,790
but it's gonna be a while
before she's 100°/ª.

415
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,160
<i>(groans)</i>

416
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,271
Oh, careful.

417
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,196
- You all right?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

418
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,794
- <i>(Nicky cries)</i>
- Oh, l know.

419
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,075
- Come here.
- Oh...

420
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,958
l've got you.
Oh, come here.

421
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,708
You want to go see Mommy?
Go see Mommy?

422
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,518
Hey. Yeah.

423
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,989
Let's go see Mommy.
Come on.

424
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,753
She's over here. Yeah.

425
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,676
Cal.

426
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,638
Cal. Sweetie?

427
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,680
Look who's here.

428
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,114
Look who's here.

429
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,274
Seelix.

430
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:12,230
l don't know how we will manage,
but we'll find a balance, you and me.

431
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,074
We will take care of Nick. OK?

432
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,671
l love you.

433
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,198
Look. There's Mommy's hand.

434
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,754
There. There.

435
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,151
- Hey.
- Hey.

436
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,390
How are you?

437
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,152
Good.

438
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,073
- So, what's this?
- Oh, it was here when l got in.

439
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,355
It's from your father.

440
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,035
Is it ticking?

441
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,758
He left you a note.

442
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,629
<i>Caprican Criminal Codes.</i>

443
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,396
These were
my grandfather's law books.

444
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,236
Your dad must have had these
in storage all this time.

445
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,993
Why is he giving them to you now?

446
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,838
<i>(Apollo)</i> "For that day
when we all have the time."

447
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,429
<i>(Roslin) l have something for you.</i>

448
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,149
This was given to me by one of
the colonists down on New Caprica.

449
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,030
l forgot about it
and Tory found it in a pile of old clothes.

450
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,154
- <i>Blood Runs at Midnight.</i>
- Don't let that fool you.

451
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,800
It's a pretty good mystery.
l think you'll like it.

452
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,871
And it's not a loan.
It's a gift.

453
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,351
Do you ever think about the times much
on New Caprica?

454
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,715
l try to think about the good times.
Yes, l do.

455
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,237
One in particular
stands out in my mind.

456
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,790
You were wearing
a really bright red dress.

457
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,440
Said you wanted to build a cabin.

458
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,672
It was Baltar's
ground-breaking ceremony.

459
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,115
l got a little silly that night.

460
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,756
Ever wonder what would've happened
if the Cylons hadn't come back?

461
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,152
Well, l think given Baltar and the terrain
we couldn't have made a go of it.

462
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,597
Do you think you would have stayed
on <i>Galactica</i> or would you have settled?

463
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,990
It's pretty hypothetical. Isn't it?

464
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,478
It is, until it isn't.

465
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,592
<i>(laughs)</i>

466
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,950
- Did l just say that?
- It's worth just seeing you laugh like that.

467
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,828
We've been at war for so long,
we forget what we're fighting for.

468
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,038
To raise our kids in peace.
Enjoy one another's company.

469
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,159
- Live life as people again.
- Like that night on New Caprica.

470
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,313
That's really what we are talking about
here now, isn't it?

471
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,230
That, and other times.

472
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,557
So if the Cylons hadn't come back?

473
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,030
But they did.

474
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,513
We have certain responsibilities.

475
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,194
Yes, we do, sir. And, uh...

476
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:10,949
l will be back in a few days, and if you'd
like, we can talk more about that night.

477
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,271
Bill?

478
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,793
The answer is yes.

479
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,509
l absolutely would have built the cabin.

480
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,192
<i>(Carolanne) Go ahead. Put it away,</i>
<i>like you have after every anniversary.</i>

481
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,832
- Promise me you won't take it out again.
- <i>(Adama)</i> It'd be easier to hate you.

482
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,878
But that would be a lie, Carolanne.

483
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,395
And there's been enough of that
through our lives.

484
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,875
We had something, didn't we?

485
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,757
Yeah.

486
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,513
We had something.

487
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,395
See you next year.

488
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,434
This'll mark new territory.

489
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,158
Don't do it!
