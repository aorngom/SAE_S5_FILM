<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,113
- We all made sacrifices.
- Is that so?

3
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,713
Yes, that's right.

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,191
Then how come some Cylon lover
is holding down my post?

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,149
Hera's alive. l'm her mother and l'm going
to get her. l'm begging you to do this.

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,389
<i>(yells)</i>

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,472
You've put the entire fleet in jeopardy.
Are you aware of that?

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,190
l'm not a traitor. l did what l thought
was right. She'll get Hera.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,793
Let's go.

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,915
- No! Hold your fire!
- Get out of the way!

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,468
Throw that thing in the brig.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,190
l demand my rights as a Colonial citizen to
legal representation and full due process.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,156
Do you?

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,915
- So what happens next?
- We give him his trial.

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,272
They think they can squeeze these
into the starboard hangar?

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,955
That's why Helo's down here.
To manage the civilian refugees.

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,191
l've got the breakdown on the
<i>Thera Sita's</i> inhabitants coming aboard.

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,599
51 Sagittarons.

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,468
- Oh, boy.
- Helo may be overmatched down there.

20
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,832
Pretty rough night last night, huh?

21
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,230
Hey. l said you didn't sleep so well.

22
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,709
Oh, stupid dream. Whatever.

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,991
- So, you're OK?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,197
They're about to increase
the population down there by 300.

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,229
l don't know where l'll put 'em, but l'm
not walking around taking my own pulse.

26
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,038
- l'm fine.
- <i>(Apollo)</i> There he is.

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,032
- If it isn't the mayor of Dogsville.
- Cut him some slack.

28
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,634
Hear you got another shipload
of loyal subjects.

29
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,836
Helo, come here. l need a favour.

30
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,789
l have a date tonight with this ripped-
and-ready nugget that l want to break in.

31
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,872
Think you can wrangle me up
one of those sexy cubicles?

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,428
- Yeah, yeah.
- <i>(Apollo)</i> See you around, Helo.

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,512
Yeah. You guys
know where to find me.

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,151
- You're gonna check up on Hera, right?
- Yes. Babe, l'm gonna check up on Hera.

35
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,834
- Love you.
- Love you too.

36
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,955
l need you to keep moving.

37
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,873
You need to keep moving.

38
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,350
l know, l know. We'll deal
with your concerns. Keep moving.

39
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,750
Welcome aboard <i>Galactica.</i>
My name is Captain Karl Agathon.

40
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,469
l've been assigned
to look after your personal welfare.

41
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,189
- Where are you putting the Sagittarons?
- Arrangements haven't been made yet.

42
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,717
- We want to be with our own!
- You heard. Get your ass in motion! Move!

43
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,394
l got things under control here, Colonel.

44
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,313
Yeah. Sure you do.

45
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,960
Excuse me.
Could l have a brief look at your son?

46
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,679
No, no, no.
We're fine. We don't need a doctor.

47
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,433
l know.

48
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,479
We don't need a doctor. We're Sagittaron.
We don't believe in medicine.

49
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,791
It's all right. This is Dr Robert.
He's our civilian doctor.

50
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,475
He has nothing to do with the military.
We'll respect your traditions.

51
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,233
You can trust me. l'm Sagittaron.

52
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,436
It's OK.

53
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,995
It's OK.

54
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,716
OK? Can l feel that?

55
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,758
Would you open your mouth for me?
Open wide.

56
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,756
All right.

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,319
Look at this.

58
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,836
- Do you feel anything? How about here?
- <i>(groans)</i>

59
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,593
- <i>(mother)</i> That's enough.
- Get your hands off me!

60
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,911
That's enough. That's enough.
Thank you.

61
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,838
- Sir.
- Hey, keep your hands to yourself.

62
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,514
- OK.
- All right?

63
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,713
<i>(coughing)</i>

64
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,392
Mike. You braindead card cheat.
You still owe me that drink.

65
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,075
- Saul, get out of here. Now.
- Well, you're in a good mood today.

66
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,913
Hey, Doc. Some of these people,
they look, um...

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,275
- Sick.
- Sick, yeah.

68
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,718
<i>(Dualla)</i> Medic!

69
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,712
- Dr Robert!
- Leave, Saul.

70
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,270
- Get your hands off my son! No!
- <i>(Robert)</i> Got him. Got him.

71
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,753
- Where are they taking him?
- It's all right, ma'am. Just walk this way.

72
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,709
<i>(coughing)</i>

73
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,518
- So, what have we got here, Mike?
- Mellorak sickness.

74
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,630
It originates in the kidneys then attacks
the respiratory and the immune system.

75
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,551
It's a nasty bit of business.

76
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,998
If you don't treat the first symptoms in 48
hours, it will kill you in three to five days.

77
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,959
- How contagious is it?
- It's not airborne, so we lucked out there.

78
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,752
It's spread through human contact. Saliva,
sexual intercourse, through the skin...

79
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,957
Right now, it seems
confined to the Sagittarons.

80
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,395
That's good.
They're welcome to it.

81
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,631
It's spreading down there,
where we were working.

82
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,950
- It's curable?
- <i>(Cottle)</i> Absolutely.

83
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,032
A shot of bittamusin
and you're right as rain in a day or two.

84
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,315
And sedatives alleviate the symptoms.

85
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,789
l don't know how long
our stock will hold out,

86
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,158
so we should conserve it and only
inoculate after the first symptoms show.

87
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,232
<i>(Adama)</i> This is a civilian infection,
so it's in your hands.

88
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,235
But l want Tyrol and the crew
immunised before they get sick.

89
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,233
If we disinfect everything and stress
hygiene, some people won't get sick.

90
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,788
And they won't need the medicine.

91
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,350
Shouldn't we get everyone in
the showers? Especially the Sagittarons.

92
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,274
- We should make an announcement.
- No, we don't want to...

93
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,592
single them out more than we have to -
we'll have a riot on our hands.

94
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,275
If it were up to me, l would say
just get the Sagittarons settled,

95
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,796
and then deal with the civvies
that have already arrived.

96
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,873
You won't have to worry about having
enough medicine for the Sagittarons.

97
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,432
Yeah. Most of them are gonna refuse it.
People are gonna die.

98
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,751
For the last 3,000 years,
medicine's been the great curse.

99
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,310
They're a bunch of
stubborn root-sucking jackasses

100
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,996
holding on to traditions
that are a thousand years old.

101
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,151
<i>(chanting)</i>

102
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,309
Drink this.

103
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,075
Stink enough for you in here?

104
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,278
- Yeah, it's a really potent smell.
- Yeah.

105
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,992
That's burdock root.
The Sagittarons use it as a calmative.

106
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,150
- Does it work?
- Hell, l don't know.

107
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,708
They're all gonna die anyway.

108
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,396
<i>(Zarek) Tell me there won't be a trial.</i>

109
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,837
Gaius Baltar will be tried
for high crimes and treason.

110
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,596
A tribunal of judges will hear the evidence
against him. A verdict will be read.

111
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,550
He will be found guilty and he will be
finally held responsible for his actions.

112
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,030
If you can summon up a little patience,
as l have done,

113
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,111
we will get through this ordeal.

114
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,352
Listen to me.
Baltar will get his trial.

115
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,716
And this is what you'll get -
a hurricane.

116
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,679
The media will descend on you
and watch and question your every move.

117
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,196
You will have sectarian violence,
assassination attempts.

118
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,239
You will have civil unrest
on a scale we've never seen.

119
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,030
Work, labour, everyday routine in this fleet
will come to a complete halt.

120
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,159
This trial is going to
bring this entire fleet down.

121
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,516
Mr Vice President,
we have a security plan in order,

122
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,752
which includes rapid marine deployment,
increased CAP operations, security...

123
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,308
A hurricane, Laura.

124
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,269
If l were you,
l'd declare martial law during the trial.

125
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,911
You're going to need a lot more
than a little patience to survive.

126
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,594
l'm here if you need me.

127
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,633
Your best friend's your worst enemy.

128
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,320
l've never seen him like that.

129
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,154
He was truly frightened.

130
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,111
<i>We</i> are not sick. Sags brought
the sickness with them. Send them back!

131
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,398
- Where do you suggest l send them?
- l don't know. Figure it out.

132
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,395
OK. Your concerns have been noted.
We're gonna do the best we can.

133
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,349
Yes. Can l help you?

134
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,635
My son is dead.

135
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,320
l'm sorry.

136
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,193
It's a soma braid, right?

137
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,671
You Sagittarons believe
it's supposed to bring good health?

138
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,993
Look, l'm sorry. It's not enough. If you
don't treat the disease, it's fatal, OK?

139
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,470
- This didn't have to happen.
- Yes, it did.

140
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,552
He was killed.

141
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,349
No. Ma'am, he died. OK? He died
because he needed real medicine.

142
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,113
He died because l made a mistake.

143
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,999
OK.

144
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,231
OK. Good. Yeah.
Then, please, tell the others.

145
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,756
l will.
l will tell them not to trust him.

146
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,832
They warned me about him,
but l wouldn't listen.

147
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,153
l didn't want my son to die.
l took a chance. l went to Dr Robert.

148
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,313
l let the doctor
give the medicine to Willie.

149
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,955
Ma'am... you waited too long.

150
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,751
Willie had been sick
for less than 12 hours.

151
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,192
He was 19. He is dead.

152
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,592
That doctor killed my son.

153
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,435
<i>(sobs)</i>

154
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,714
- We lost another one last night.
- Yeah. Willie King.

155
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,237
No. A three-year-old girl
whose parents refused to let me treat her.

156
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,155
Willie King's mother lost Willie King.
It's a shame. The boy was a goner.

157
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,712
You saw him when he came in here.
He was at least three days symptomatic.

158
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,791
You explained this to the mother?

159
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,475
Yes, of course l did. What the hell
am l supposed to say to her?

160
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,032
"If you would have just turned the corner
sooner on this superstitious crap,

161
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,111
we could have saved your son"?

162
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,509
Get your shirt off, would you?

163
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,398
- Excuse me?
- l'm gonna vaccinate you.

164
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,471
l'm not sick. We're rationing.

165
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,632
Think l'm gonna wait
until you're on your back for a day?

166
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,711
Who else is gonna help me here?

167
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,075
OK. OK.

168
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,594
Oh, l talked to, uh, Tigh.

169
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,399
He was asking about you.

170
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,031
l told him you were doing a hell of a job.
l wouldn't wish this place on anybody.

171
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,190
- Come on. You ready?
- Yeah.

172
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,078
This might sting a bit.

173
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,149
You're done.

174
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,791
No!

175
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,030
Yeah!

176
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,396
All right, Hands of Stone.
Let me see what you've got.

177
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,278
Put it in the hole, Marge.

178
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,036
Want to know my secret, Connor?
l pretend this thing is your face.

179
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,877
Hey. It's Mellorak Man. Everybody run.

180
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,520
Relax. The doc dosed me.

181
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,319
l hear it's pretty rough down there, huh?

182
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,233
Only if you're a Sagittaron.

183
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,392
Dying, you know?
It just... it seems so senseless.

184
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,517
Yeah, well,
you'll get no tears from me.

185
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,516
Bad enough my gang's gotta
sweat through their stench.

186
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,513
One of these days, l'm gonna be
really pissed cos we're out of meds

187
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,955
cos those Sags saw the light
and we had to share.

188
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,190
You gonna babble or shoot?

189
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,429
Yeah!

190
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,229
None of those religious freaks
lifted a finger down on New Caprica.

191
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,757
- Chief, knock it off.
- A lot of good people lost their lives.

192
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,434
l said knock it off, all right?

193
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,317
Oh.

194
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,275
- Sorry, Dee.
- It's all right.

195
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,069
l have more of a reason to be mad at them
than you do. l am Sagittaron.

196
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,233
Most of them are paranoid,
pig-headed and argumentative.

197
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,232
They're sure making it miserable
for Dr Robert.

198
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,153
Medicine's an abomination.
It's a sin against the gods.

199
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,152
Physicians spread disease
cos they refuse to acknowledge

200
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,391
that the body
and the mind are myths.

201
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,199
This body is no myth.

202
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,954
- If l get sick, l'm gonna see Dr Robert.
- <i>(Apollo)</i> You're not getting sick.

203
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,838
Anyone but Cottle.
Near-sighted bastard.

204
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,708
He might as well use a spike
instead of a needle.

205
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,194
So they're treating you well, then?

206
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,475
Yeah. Well enough.

207
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,035
They take a while to get to the point,
though, don't they?

208
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,759
Look, Six...

209
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,434
l wanna thank you
for what you did.

210
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,990
l'm still not sure
why you did it, though.

211
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,355
Exactly.

212
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,438
What are we doing here?

213
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,877
How could you possibly throw yourself
on the mercy of these people?

214
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,952
- <i>(Sharon)</i> And now you're here.
- Yeah.

215
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,350
Your best chance of survival
is to work with them.

216
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,274
And that means to help them
expose Baltar for his crimes.

217
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,716
Look, l gotta go. So, um...

218
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,997
l'm gonna look into
some clothes for you.

219
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,674
Please, take care of yourself.

220
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,959
Hey.

221
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,749
Thank you for the visit.

222
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,353
<i>To have some company...</i>

223
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,351
<i>Thank you.</i>

224
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,670
<i>(Sharon) No. l care about you.</i>

225
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,110
<i>(Baltar)</i> Do you think
any of them care about you?

226
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,512
l imagine they don't.

227
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,789
So, what are you doing here again?

228
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,033
- l'm still trying to figure that out.
- So you're here to save them, are you?

229
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,509
l told you, l don't know.

230
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,795
You're here...

231
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,950
because you want to be human.

232
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,232
But there's a trick to being human.

233
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,509
You have to think

234
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,909
only about yourself.

235
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,708
- <i>(Roslin)</i> What do you think she's doing?
- l don't know.

236
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,796
She's talking to something or someone.
l don't know. l've seen her do it before.

237
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,758
<i>(shouting)</i>

238
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,200
<i>(man)</i> We can't let him do it!
He's a murderer!

239
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,477
- <i>(guard)</i> Stay back!
- <i>(man #2)</i> Get him!

240
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,474
<i>(guard)</i> Stay back!

241
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,118
Everybody back! Step away from him!
Everybody back!

242
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,794
Get off him! Now!
Move back, people!

243
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,916
Move back! Back away, now!

244
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,198
- He killed my father!
- l tried to help him, you ignorant fool!

245
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,636
- Get off me!
- OK. Get behind me.

246
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,118
So you immunised the old man,
but he still died.

247
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,637
What made him and his father change
their mind about getting immunised?

248
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,590
Who said they changed their mind?
l administered the bittamusin on my own.

249
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,353
Without their consent?

250
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,389
It was the middle of the night.
The old man was screaming in pain.

251
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,517
l mean, what was l supposed to do?

252
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,716
OK, I... l don't understand. Aren't we
rationing? It was well after the 48 hours.

253
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,439
Yeah, that's right.
But it's not exact.

254
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,195
Everybody's different.
OK, he was marginal.

255
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,478
Look. l'm not gonna sit here
and apologise to you for doing my job.

256
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,757
l've got two Picons
that are starting to show symptoms.

257
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,753
Now, l'm gonna go treat them,
if it's all right with you.

258
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,952
The doctor's version of when he gave
the drug greatly differed from Mrs King's.

259
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,439
Who?

260
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,273
The woman. King.
The one l told you about - Mrs King.

261
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,797
Her son showed symptoms. She took him
for treatment. The boy still died.

262
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,952
And Robert treated a Sagittaron
without the man's consent.

263
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,670
We should have done that in the first
place. The disease would have been gone.

264
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,639
The only reason we didn't is we're
respecting the customs of the Sagittarons.

265
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,111
But he didn't respect them. Sir, people
could be dying under Robert's care.

266
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,954
People die under my care every day.
It goes with the damn job.

267
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,600
- Killing doesn't.
- Killing?

268
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,549
You are way out of line.
Mike Robert deserves better than this.

269
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,315
Even if he isn't treating
some of these people unethically,

270
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,633
l'm concerned he's created
a situation down there. It's bad.

271
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,517
Captain...

272
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,270
l have the former president
of the Colonies sitting in a prison cell,

273
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,920
a Cylon woman is in custody,

274
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,312
and a population that would jump
at the chance to tear both of them apart.

275
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,075
My ship is overcrowded,
and l have an epidemic on my hands.

276
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,799
Now, the question is,

277
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,189
are you capable
of doing your job?

278
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,070
And are you gonna stop making
these unfounded accusations?

279
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,151
Are you?

280
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,713
- Yes, sir.
- Dismissed.

281
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,229
<i>(grunts)</i>

282
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,117
<i>(Tigh)</i> Agathon!

283
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,034
Why don't you knock it off, Helo?

284
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,588
Get your teeth out of the doc's ass.

285
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,514
- It's not doing you any good.
- With all due respect... sir,

286
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,636
l think Robert might be hurting people.

287
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,714
He is the only one to say anything good
about you in as long as l can remember.

288
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,952
You may as well take whatever credibility
you have left and chuck it out an airlock.

289
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,636
You want to stand up for these crazy
frakking people? What is it with you?

290
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,236
You just like being on the outside
looking in, don't you?

291
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,757
l don't know what you mean by that, sir.
Unless you're referring to my wife. Again.

292
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,958
Mike Robert is a stand-up guy.
A Caprican. One of our own.

293
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,794
A man l can trust. On New Caprica,
he worked with the Resistance.

294
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,952
He patched up my eye.
He fought the enemy.

295
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,113
While you were snuggled up in bed
with your Cylon wife every night.

296
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,997
Colonel!

297
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,311
You OK?

298
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,630
<i>(Tigh groans)</i>

299
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,998
So. You do give a frak
what your friends think.

300
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,469
Good for you.
That's how it should be.

301
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,157
But you know what? l give a frak, too.
About friends, about loyalty.

302
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,031
You keep soiling Mike Robert's
good name, and we are gonna finish this.

303
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,839
How does that sound to you?

304
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,356
You'd better have the doctor
look at that hand.

305
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,309
<i>(Helo)</i> Sorry,
you're gonna have to wait.

306
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,790
Excuse me. 15 minutes, people.
l'll be back in 15 minutes.

307
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,996
l'm sorry.

308
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,749
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sir, get your hands off me.

309
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,071
- Sharon.
- Helo.

310
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,673
- What's going on?
- How's Hera?

311
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,318
What do you mean?

312
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,358
She got sick about an hour ago.
They pulled me off CAP.

313
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,513
- What? No one told me.
- They sent her to Dr Robert.

314
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,476
I... l don't know if she needs this.

315
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,269
This is serious.
She could die from this.

316
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,995
Here we go. Here we go.

317
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,709
It's all right. Look at this.
Here. Here's your toy.

318
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,995
Good girl. Good girl.

319
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,191
Now, these are sedatives in pill form. Give
her a half every six hours. Just crush it up.

320
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,716
- OK. She'll be OK, though?
- She'll be fine. You can take her home.

321
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,236
- Thank you, Doctor.
- OK. Bye-bye.

322
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,672
- All right. Bye-bye.
- <i>(Sharon)</i> Say bye-bye.

323
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,557
Bye-bye.

324
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,514
She'll be fine.

325
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,999
All right?

326
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,472
OK.

327
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,597
Oh. Uh, listen.
Would you give this to Mrs King?

328
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,073
This is... uh... It belonged to her son.
l know she would want it back.

329
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,192
All right?

330
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,912
Hi.

331
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,912
Dr Robert gave me this
to give to you.

332
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,193
He gave you this? Huh.

333
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,109
How is your daughter?

334
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,839
- She's fine, thanks.
- Good.

335
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,509
Mrs King? Please.

336
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,114
l need to ask you something.

337
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,469
If you thought Dr Robert was dangerous,
why let him treat your son?

338
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,074
You said you were warned.

339
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,197
l couldn't believe anyone
could have that much hate in them.

340
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,272
- But you understand how...
- l'm through talking.

341
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,318
Talking isn't gonna bring Willie back.

342
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,594
l think you should leave now.

343
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,355
Mrs King, I...

344
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,869
l'm sorry.

345
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,199
You seem angry.

346
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,470
l'm not. l'm just...

347
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,118
Work.

348
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,314
It's OK that you hate your job.
It's OK... it's OK to admit it, too.

349
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,154
It's not the job. l know the job sucks.
l don't need to be reminded of it.

350
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,037
OK.

351
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,038
- Then what is it?
- Look.

352
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,192
It's what l see every day. OK?
It's hard to not see it.

353
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,475
See what?

354
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,233
- Talk to me, Karl.
- l don't know, l keep doing it.

355
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,154
l keep doing it. l keep ending up
on the wrong side of everything.

356
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,277
You know, maybe Tigh's right.
Maybe l want it that way.

357
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,750
What if l'm flying a desk
not because l'm good at it,

358
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,356
but because it's the right punishment
for the guy who crosses the line?

359
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,874
Maybe l belong in Dogsville.

360
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,155
So you're saying...

361
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,949
- Just leave it.
- What does that mean, "Just leave it"?

362
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,751
It means it's your job to manage these
people, Helo, and you've just gotta do it.

363
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,669
Yeah. You... you know what?

364
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,316
You're right. It's me.
It's all in my frakking head.

365
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,312
l didn't say that.

366
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,994
- Where are you going?
- l don't know.

367
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,711
<i>(sighs)</i>

368
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,317
Doc?

369
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,795
You ought to try a bed, Helo.
You'll get more sleep that way.

370
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,110
He's killing them. It's right here.

371
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,149
Get your ass outta here right now,
before l have the old man lock you up.

372
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,038
No, listen to me. He killed them.
On New Caprica.

373
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,997
Look.

374
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,548
Guy goes in for a cough,
dies of heart failure.

375
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,108
Here. See for yourself.
This one.

376
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,760
Woman had appendicitis,
died on the operating table.

377
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,876
Of the Picons he treated,
12% of them died.

378
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,919
Capricans. Oh, he likes Capricans.
The mortality rate was 6°/ª.

379
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,911
Sagittarons? 90°/ª.

380
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,437
- 90% of the Sagittarons died...
- l'm not going to listen to this.

381
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,718
- That man has his hands full down there.
- He's singling out Sagittarons.

382
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,552
- That doesn't bother you?
- What?

383
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,790
- That doesn't bother you?
- What is he doing?

384
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,316
- l don't know. l'm not a doctor.
- The first sensible thing you've said.

385
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:56,030
Listen. l don't think he's giving them
the medicine. He's doing something.

386
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,475
You're not gonna let it go, are you?

387
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,396
Please. Can you do an autopsy
on Mrs King's son to see how he died?

388
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,551
l'll let it go. l will. l promise.
l will let it go. Just check.

389
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,871
l did. l checked King's son.

390
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,795
Mellorak sickness.
He had bittamusin in his system.

391
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,395
All right? Now, that's it.
Now, you just leave it.

392
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,710
And get outta here!

393
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,996
Hey, Doc?

394
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,117
l don't really feel so good.

395
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,590
Think l could get
some of that bittamusin?

396
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,869
<i>(banging on door)</i>

397
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,993
<i>(Sharon whispers)</i> Who is it?

398
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,475
Hey, Hera. It's OK.

399
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,272
- Mrs King?
- Your friend, the soldier... Dualla?

400
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,113
She's sick.
She went to the doctor. She went...

401
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,794
- Slow down. What?
- You listen to me.

402
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,112
We lost two more tonight. Sagittarons
who let that murderer treat them.

403
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,954
- You have to do something.
- Excuse me. What is she doing here?

404
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,270
- There she is!
- You're not supposed to be here.

405
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,749
Let's go. Now.

406
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,116
Sorry, Captain. Frakking refugees.
l don't know how she snuck through.

407
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,555
Morning, sir.

408
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,835
Don't. Don't even think it.

409
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,912
Sharon, it's Dualla.
Dualla went down there.

410
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,878
- She has a husband.
- Yeah, and he's out flying CAP.

411
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,476
She'll be fine.
She'll take her meds. She'll be fine.

412
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,192
You know what's all over the ship?
You and the Sagittarons.

413
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,034
How you might actually
be listening to them.

414
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,917
That's my job.

415
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,514
They die because
they refuse medication.

416
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,160
You want me to look the other way,
is that it?

417
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,310
- Hera's OK. That's all that matters?
- No!

418
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,190
Or is it because as long as everyone hates
Sagittarons, they forget you're a Cylon?

419
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,669
You shut the frak up.

420
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,477
Yeah, look the other way. l have to fight
every day on this ship to be accepted.

421
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,949
This is nothing to do with you.

422
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,678
OK?

423
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,752
You think that's who l am?
That's my defining characteristic?

424
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,229
The guy married to a Cylon?

425
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,070
This guy's dirty. l think he's killing people
because he's a racist son of a bitch.

426
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,477
Make a hole! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

427
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,994
Dee. Dee.

428
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,877
Dualla?

429
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,317
Dualla?

430
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,359
No. No, no, no, no, no, no!

431
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,594
Dualla. Hey!

432
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,111
Oh, hey.
What are you doing down here?

433
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,509
Dr Robert.

434
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,830
He gave me something.

435
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,276
It kicked the frak out of me.

436
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,749
- Where's Lee?
- We're gonna go see him. Come on.

437
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,796
l'm gonna take you to Cottle.

438
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,154
- No.
- Yeah.

439
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,674
- l'm Hands of Stone.
- l know. l know. Come on.

440
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,433
- What are you doing?
- She's coming with me.

441
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,433
- She's in no condition to go anywhere.
- l'm taking her to Cottle just to be sure.

442
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,954
What do you mean?
Get the hell outta here!

443
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,919
Get the frak out of my way, Doctor! Now!

444
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,275
- Come on, Dee. Come on.
- No.

445
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,588
Security!

446
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,231
Agathon. He's lost it.
He's hurting one of my patients.

447
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,629
- l'm taking her to Cottle.
- Get the XO.

448
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,429
Leave me alone. No. Not Cottle.
Please just leave me alone!

449
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,640
- Captain. What's going on, sir?
- Leave me alone.

450
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,711
- Captain!
- l wanna sleep.

451
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,360
- No, no, Dee.
- <i>(guard)</i> She doesn't want to go.

452
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,036
- Sir! She says she doesn't want to go!
- Get your hand off me, Sergeant!

453
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,029
Get your gun outta my face!

454
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,188
- Get your gun outta my face, Sergeant!
- Cool it!

455
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,990
l don't know who you're trying to impress,
but it seriously is not working.

456
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,548
You're killing them.
l know you're doing it.

457
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,949
- Stand down!
- Saul.

458
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,312
- You didn't tell me he was dangerous!
- Shut the frak up!

459
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,828
How is she?

460
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,630
She's been sedated.
But she's OK.

461
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,111
You don't believe him, do you?
He's seriously delusional. He needs help.

462
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,590
Yeah. And we should have
given it to him.

463
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,876
Doc?

464
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,714
l didn't check Willie's blood
until a couple of hours ago.

465
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,679
l was exhausted, and l'll admit
the Sagittarons annoy the hell out of me.

466
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,035
l didn't want to go against my colleague.

467
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:24,591
But you were right. There was
no bittamusin in the King boy's body.

468
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,558
- He died because it was too late.
- No, he didn't.

469
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,395
He died of acute cell destruction. He was
injected with a toxic bisphosphonate.

470
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,392
You got a wrong reading.
l don't know what else...

471
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,234
No! The old man, Mr Buckminster,
died of the same thing.

472
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:45,316
- There was no bittamusin in his system.
- You killed them, you sick frak.

473
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,756
You ought to be on your knees thanking
me for saving your daughter's life.

474
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,389
For having the meds
to cure her of her illness.

475
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,878
You know how painful
this disease is at the end.

476
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,033
And they don't want our help. Now, why
waste time and meds and space on them

477
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,591
when all of those resources
could go to those who really deserve it?

478
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,399
Who gets the medication
when there's not enough?

479
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,553
A Sagittaron who won't even raise a finger
to defend his own race, or a Viper pilot?

480
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,916
What the hell happened
to "Do no harm", Doctor?

481
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,197
l intervened because
someone has to make the tough choices.

482
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,477
But it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter. Look at them.

483
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,997
They're gonna destroy themselves
anyway. l mean, look at them.

484
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,073
They're like worms
crawling on a hot rock.

485
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,994
Remember what you used to say, Saul?

486
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,157
Aside from a Cylon,

487
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,516
is there anything
that you hate more than a Sagittaron?

488
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,355
l'll tell you what l hate, Mike.
Being wrong.

489
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,396
- Captain Agathon.
- Sir.

490
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,632
Arrest this son of a bitch.
Gag him if you have to.

491
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,757
My pleasure, sir.

492
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,600
l didn't harm her.

493
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,592
Right. She's one of the good ones.

494
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,195
Sir. You wanted to see me?

495
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,674
Yes, Captain. Please, sit down.

496
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,192
There's hate, and there's allowing hate.

497
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,158
Two sides of the same coin, really.

498
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,038
We're guilty of both.

499
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,597
Somewhere, we got lost.

500
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,876
You being the Ione voice
in the wilderness,

501
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,555
we were bound to stay that way
for a while.

502
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,880
This is my ship.

503
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,713
And l owe you an apology.

504
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,508
- That's not necessary, sir.
- All the same...

505
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,589
you still have it.

506
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,149
That'll be all, Captain.

507
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,156
- l feel gloomy.
- OK.

508
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,559
Oh, my God!
