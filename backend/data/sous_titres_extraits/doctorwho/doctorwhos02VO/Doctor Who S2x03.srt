1
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:11,050  X1:078 X2:363 Y1:488 Y2:523
HE HUMS TO HIMSELF

2
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:20,688  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
What do you want? The nurse
sent me, sir. I was in English
and I got a headache.

3
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:25,201  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then don't bother me, go home.
I can't. Why? Is your mother at work?

4
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:28,360  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
I live in Ambrose Hill -
the children's home.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,396  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
No parents. No-one to miss you.

6
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:33,594  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
I see why the nurse sent you.

7
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:38,951  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
You poor child, poor. . .thin child.

8
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:40,464  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come inside.

9
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:45,386  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's nearly time for lunch.

10
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:51,775  X1:078 X2:283 Y1:488 Y2:523
LOUD SCREAMS

11
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:54,517  X1:078 X2:235 Y1:488 Y2:523
BELL RINGS

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,278  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good morning, class.

13
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:07,961  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are we sitting comfortably?

14
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:48,998  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
So. . . physics.

15
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:53,244  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:380 Y2:415
Physics, eh?

16
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:59,343  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Physics. Physics. Physics.

17
00:01:59,383 --> 00:02:00,983  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Physics. Physics. Physics.

18
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:04,379  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:380 Y2:415
Physics. Physics. Physics.

19
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,733  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, let's see what you know.

20
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:10,170  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Two identical strips of nylon are
charged with static electricity

21
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,324  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
and hung from a string so they can
swing freely. What would happen if
they were brought near each other?

22
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:16,684  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yes, er, what's your name? Milo.
Milo. Off you go.

23
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:19,161  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
They'd repel each other
because they have the same charge.

24
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:20,679  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Correctamundo.

25
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,959  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
A word I have never used before,
and hopefully never will again.

26
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:30,830  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
Question two, I coil up a thin piece
of nichrome wire and place it in
a glass of water, then I turn on

27
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,426  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
the electricity and measure to see
if the water temperature's affected.

28
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:38,466  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
My question is this - how do I
measure the electrical power going
into the coil? Someone else?

29
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:43,413  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, OK. Milo. Go for it.

30
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:45,652  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
You measure the current and PD
using an ammeter and a voltmeter.

31
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:47,370  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Two to Milo. Right, Milo.

32
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,165  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
True or false, greater the damping
on a cistern, the quicker
it loses energy?

33
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:56,680  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
False. What is non-coding DNA?
DNA that doesn't code for a protein.
65,983 x 5?

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,841  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
329,915.

35
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:04,370  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
How do you travel faster than light?
By a quantum tunnel with an FTL
factor of 36.7 recurring.

36
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:33,681  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Two days. Sorry, could you just. . . ?
There's a bit of gravy. . .

37
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:39,235  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
No, no, just there. Two days we've
been here. Blame your boyfriend,
he's the one that put us on to this.

38
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:43,793  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
And he was right.
Boy in class this morning - got a
knowledge way beyond planet Earth.

39
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,949  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Are you eating those chips?
Yeah, they're a bit. . .different.

40
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,464  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think they're gorgeous. I wish
I'd had school dinners like this.

41
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:52,104  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's very well behaved, this place.

42
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:55,061  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thought they'd all be
happy-slapping hoodies with ASBOs.

43
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,135  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Happy slapping hoodies with
ASBOs and ringtones, eh?

44
00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:00,053  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, yeah.
Don't tell me I don't fit in.

45
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:03,370  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
You are not permitted to leave
your station during a sitting.

46
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,407  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was just talking to this teacher.
Hello. He doesn't like the chips.

47
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:12,840  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:416 Y2:523
The menu has been specifically
designed by the headmaster to improve
concentration and performance.

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,038  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now, get back to work.

49
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:19,193  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
See, this is me. . .dinner lady.

50
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:21,855  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'll have the crumble.
I'm so going to kill you.

51
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,182  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Melissa, you'll be joining
my class for the next period.

52
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:34,219  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
Milo's failed me so it's time we
moved you up to the top class.
Kenny, not eating the chips?

53
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,746  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm not allowed.
Luke, extra class. Now.

54
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:52,398  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Careful. Keep it steady.

55
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:54,356  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't spill a drop.

56
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:59,673  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
I said, "Keep it steady. "
Careful. That's it.

57
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:01,390  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Easy now. Steady.

58
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,627  X1:078 X2:271 Y1:488 Y2:523
MOBILE RINGS

59
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:05,744  X1:078 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right, second barrel. Quickly now.

60
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:10,380  X1:078 X2:523 Y1:416 Y2:523
What have you got? Confirmation.
I just got into Army records. Three
months ago, massive UFO activity.

61
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,055  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
They logged over 40 sightings -
lights in the sky, all of that.

62
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:16,453  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can't get any photos cos then
it gets all classified and secret.

63
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:20,727  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Tell you what,
though, three months ago turns out
all the kitchen staff were replaced.

64
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,167  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
And this lot are weird. See, there's
definitely something going on.

65
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:24,963  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was right to call you home.

66
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:29,561  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thought maybe you called me home
just to, just to call me home.

67
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:32,718  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Do you think I'd just invent
an emergency? Could have done.

68
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:36,791  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
That's the last thing I'd do. Cos
every time I see you an emergency
just gets in the way.

69
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:39,349  X1:078 X2:317 Y1:488 Y2:523
WOMAN SCREAMS

70
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,442  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've gotta go! A-a-ah!

71
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:45,810  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is it?

72
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,874  X1:078 X2:335 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE DIALS NUMBER

73
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:56,772  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
What are you doing?
Calling an ambulance.

74
00:05:56,812 --> 00:05:58,820  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
No need. She's quite all right.

75
00:05:59,888 --> 00:06:02,686  X1:078 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
WOMAN SCREAMS LOUDLY

76
00:06:02,726 --> 00:06:05,837  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's fine. She does that.

77
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:18,707  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'd like you all to put your
headphones on now, please.

78
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:22,154  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, children,
the things you will see.

79
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:03,409  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
My improvements aren't confined
to the classroom, no, no.

80
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,046  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've introduced a new policy here -
school dinners are absolutely free.

81
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:09,682  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
But compulsory. Do try the chips.

82
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:11,242  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ooh, I'd love to. Thank you.

83
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:14,916  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
The transformation you've
brought about, it's amazing.

84
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:18,598  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Maybe you're working the children a
little bit too hard now and then.

85
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,990  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
But I think good results
are more important than anything.

86
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,908  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Exactly. You're a woman
of vision, Miss Smith.

87
00:07:23,948 --> 00:07:27,385  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can see everything,
Mr Finch. . .quite clearly.

88
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:32,499  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
Yesterday I had a 12-year-old
girl give me the exact height
of the walls of Troy in cubits.

89
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,776  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
And it's ever since the
new headmaster arrived?

90
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:38,889  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Finch arrive three months ago.
The next day half the staff got flu.

91
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:40,888  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Finch replaced them with that lot.

92
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:46,283  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
Except for the teacher you replaced
and that was just plain weird,
her winning the lottery like that.

93
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:47,801  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
How's that weird? She never played.

94
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:50,998  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Said the ticket was posted
through her door at midnight.

95
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,195  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
The world is very strange.

96
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:58,433  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Excuse me, colleagues,
a moment of your time.

97
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:01,109  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
May I introduce
Miss Sarah Jane Smith.

98
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:05,464  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
Miss Smith is a journalist
who is writing a profile about me
for The Sunday Times.

99
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:10,898  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
I thought it might be useful
for her to get a view from
the trenches, so to speak.

100
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:12,547  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't spare my blushes.

101
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:17,292  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello. Oh, I should think so.

102
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:19,329  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
And you are. . . ?

103
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:22,046  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hmm? Er, Smith. John Smith.

104
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:24,883  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
John Smith!

105
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:27,720  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I used to have a friend who
sometimes went by that name.

106
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,597  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, it's a very common name.

107
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:33,515  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
He was a very uncommon man.

108
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:38,149  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. Yes, very nice.
More than nice. Brilliant.

109
00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:41,308  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um, so, um,

110
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:45,380  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
have you worked here long?
No, um, it's only my second day.

111
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,217  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, you're new, then?

112
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:49,537  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
So what do you think of the school?

113
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:52,731  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
I mean, this new curriculum?
So many children getting ill.

114
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:54,411  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doesn't that strike you as odd?

115
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,649  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
You don't sound like
someone just doing a profile.

116
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:59,645  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, no harm in a little
investigation while I'm here.

117
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:01,205  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, good for you.

118
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:03,641  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good for you.

119
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:06,679  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, good for you, Sarah Jane Smith.

120
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:10,126  X1:078 X2:235 Y1:488 Y2:523
BELL RINGS

121
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:35,467  X1:320 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
STRANGE CRUNCHING

122
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:49,099  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
Argh!

123
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,629  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
This isn't your classroom, Kenny.

124
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:56,291  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now run along.

125
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:31,338  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, it's weird seeing school
at night. It just feels wrong.

126
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:36,421  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
When I was a kid I used to think
all the teachers slept in school.

127
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:42,135  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
Hiya, team ! Oh, I hate it
when you say "team", erm, gang,
erm. . .comrades.

128
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:46,533  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Er, anyway, Rose, go to the kitchen
and get a sample of that oil.

129
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:50,886  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
Mickey, the new staff are
all maths teachers, check the maths
department.

130
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:54,004  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm going to look in Finch's office.
Meet back here in ten minutes.

131
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:55,881  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you going to be all right?

132
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,920  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Me? ! Please.

133
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,481  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Infiltration and investigation
I'm an expert at this.

134
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:10,230  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where's the maths department?

135
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,263  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Down there, turn left, through
the fire doors on the right.

136
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:15,356  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

137
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:19,230  X1:472 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
A a ah!

138
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:29,755  X1:484 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
A a ah!

139
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:35,424  X1:102 X2:217 Y1:488 Y2:523
A a ah!

140
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:16,718  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello, Sarah Jane.

141
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:21,072  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's you. Doctor.

142
00:12:21,112 --> 00:12:23,290  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God, it's you, isn't it?

143
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,062  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've regenerated.

144
00:12:27,102 --> 00:12:30,621  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah. Half a dozen times
since we last met.

145
00:12:30,661 --> 00:12:35,459  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
You look. . .incredible.

146
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:38,055  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
So do you.

147
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:40,273  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
I got old.

148
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:47,884  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:416 Y2:523
What are you doing here?
A UFO sighting, a school
gets record results,

149
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:50,000  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:452 Y2:523
I couldn't resist.
What about you?

150
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,201  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Same.

151
00:12:53,241 --> 00:12:55,717  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
I thought you'd died.

152
00:12:55,757 --> 00:13:00,390  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
I waited for you, you didn't come
back and I thought you must've died.
I lived.

153
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,628  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everyone else died.

154
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:05,859  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
What do you mean?
Everyone died, Sarah.

155
00:13:07,343 --> 00:13:09,618  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't believe it's you.

156
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:10,977  X1:102 X2:197 Y1:488 Y2:523
ARGH!

157
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:14,253  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, now I can!

158
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:17,374  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did you hear that?

159
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:21,047  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who's she?
Rose, Sarah Jane. Sarah Jane, Rose.

160
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:23,684  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hi. Nice to meet you.

161
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:27,322  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can tell you're getting older,
your assistants are getting younger.

162
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:31,292  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm not his assistant!
No. . .Get you, Tiger.

163
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:38,550  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
Sorry, it's only me. You told me to
investigate so I started looking
through some of these cupboards

164
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,343  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
and all these fell
out on me. Oh, my God, they're rats.

165
00:13:42,383 --> 00:13:44,341  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dozens of rats.

166
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:45,982  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Vacuum packed rats.

167
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:48,898  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
And you decided to scream?
It took me by surprise.

168
00:13:48,938 --> 00:13:53,372  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Like a little girl. It was dark,
I was covered in rats. Nine years
old. Pigtails, frilly skirt.

169
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:56,532  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hello, can we focus? Does anyone
notice anything strange about this?

170
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:58,369  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rats in school.

171
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:01,326  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
They use them in biology lessons.
They dissect them.

172
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:04,163  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
. .Or maybe you haven't reached
that bit yet. How old are you?

173
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:08,238  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
Excuse me, no one dissects
rats in school any more, they
haven't done that for years.

174
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:10,637  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where are you from the Dark Ages?
Anyway, moving on!

175
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:12,875  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Everything started
when Mr Finch arrived.

176
00:14:12,915 --> 00:14:15,111  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
We should go and check his office.

177
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:19,106  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't mean to be rude or
anything, but who exactly are you?

178
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:22,262  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sarah Jane Smith.
I used to travel with the Doctor.

179
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:24,700  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, he's never mentioned you.

180
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,176  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sarah Jane
I mention her all the time.

181
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:29,894  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hold on. . . Sorry. . .

182
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:32,851  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
never. What? Not even once!

183
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:36,208  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:488 Y2:523
He didn't mention me once! Oh, mate.

184
00:14:36,248 --> 00:14:39,405  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
The missus and the ex, welcome
to every man's worst nightmare.

185
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,987  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Maybe those rats were food?
Food for what?

186
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:53,151  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose, you know you used to think all
the teachers slept in the school. . .

187
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:56,427  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
well. . .they do.

188
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,463  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
No way.

189
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:17,404  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm not going back in there. No way.
What about the teachers?

190
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:21,560  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
Since you arrived you brought
with you seven new teachers, four
dinner ladies and a nurse. 13.

191
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,878  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
13 big bat people. Come on.
You're kidding.

192
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:26,035  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
I need the Tardis
to analyse that oil.

193
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:29,516  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
I might be able to help you there.
I've got something to show you.

194
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:35,463  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
K9!

195
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:38,223  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose Tyler, Mickey Smith,
allow me to introduce K9.

196
00:15:38,263 --> 00:15:41,697  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well. . . K9 mark 3 to be precise.

197
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:43,855  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why does he look so. . .disco?

198
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:47,134  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oi! Listen, in the year 5000,
this was cutting edge.

199
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:49,332  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's happened to him?
One day, he just. . .

200
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:52,088  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nothing.
Didn't you try and get him repaired?

201
00:15:52,128 --> 00:15:54,285  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's not like getting
parts for a Mini Metro.

202
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:59,639  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Besides, the technology inside
him could rewrite human science.
I couldn't show him to anyone.

203
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,346  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's the nasty lady done to you?
Hey?

204
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:09,948  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
No offence, but can you two
just stop petting for a minute?

205
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:12,280  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
Never mind the tin dog. We're busy.

206
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:24,813  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
You see what's impressive
is that it's been nearly

207
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:27,130  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
an hour since we met her and I
still haven't said I told you so.

208
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,887  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm not listening to this. Though I
have prepared a little "I was right"
dance that I can show you later.

209
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:33,445  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Two quid, love.

210
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:41,318  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
All this time you've been giving it,
"He's different!" but the truth is
he's just like any other bloke.

211
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:43,075  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
You don't know what
you're talking about.

212
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:44,788  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maybe not.

213
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:49,179  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
But if I were you
I'd go easy on the chips.

214
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:56,341  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come to me.

215
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:58,878  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come to me.

216
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:12,162  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
I thought of you on Christmas Day.

217
00:17:12,202 --> 00:17:17,120  X1:078 X2:521 Y1:416 Y2:523
This Christmas just gone,
great big spaceship overhead,
I thought, "Bet he's up there."

218
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,045  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right on top of it, yeah?
And Rose? She was there, too.

219
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:29,782  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
Did I do something wrong? Because
you never came back for me,
you just dumped me. I told you,

220
00:17:29,822 --> 00:17:34,259  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
I was called back home and in those
days humans weren't allowed.
I waited for you.

221
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:40,243  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:416 Y2:523
I missed you. Oh, you didn't need me,
you were getting on with your life.
You were my life.

222
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,648  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
You know what the most
difficult thing was?

223
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:48,244  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Coping with what happens next
or with what doesn't happen next.

224
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:51,882  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
You took me to the furthest
reaches of the galaxy, you showed me

225
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:56,516  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
supernovas, intergalactic battles and
you just dropped me back on Earth.

226
00:17:56,556 --> 00:17:59,196  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
How could anything compare to that?

227
00:17:59,236 --> 00:18:05,504  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
All those things you saw, you want
me to apologise for that? No, but
we get a taste of that splendour

228
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:09,060  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
and then we have to go back!
Look at you, you were investigating.

229
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,458  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
You found that school, you were
doing what you always did.
You could have come back.

230
00:18:14,498 --> 00:18:17,370  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
I couldn't. Why not?

231
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:27,924  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
It wasn't Croydon, where you dropped
me off, it wasn't Croydon.
Where was it?

232
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:31,559  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Aberdeen! Right.

233
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,077  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's next to Croydon, isn't it?

234
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:36,394  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, right, now we're in business.

235
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:38,270  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Master!

236
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,229  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
He recognises me! Affirmative.

237
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:42,753  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose, give us the oil.

238
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:54,054  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
I wouldn't touch it though,
that dinner lady got all scorched.

239
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:57,217  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm no dinner lady.
And I don't often say that.

240
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:04,925  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here we go. Come on boy, here we go.

241
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:09,438  X1:126 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oil. Ex, ex, ex. . .
Extract, ana, ana. . . Analysing. .

242
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:12,640  X1:090 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Listen to him, man, that's a voice!

243
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,470  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Careful, that's my dog.
Confirmation of analysis.

244
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,987  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Substance is Krillitane oil.

245
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:21,304  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're Krillitanes. Is that bad?

246
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:27,417  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
Very. Think how bad things could
possibly be and add another suitcase
full of bad. What are Krillitanes?

247
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:31,815  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
They're a composite race. Just like
your culture is a mixture
of traditions from many countries,

248
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:34,213  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
people you've invaded
or been invaded by,

249
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:38,457  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
the Krillitanes are the same, an
amalgam of races they've conquered.

250
00:19:38,497 --> 00:19:40,966  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
But they take
physical aspects as well.

251
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:44,123  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
They cherry pick the best bits
from the people they destroy.

252
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:47,161  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's why I didn't recognise them.
The last time I saw Krillitanes

253
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:51,872  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
they looked just like us except
with really long necks. What are
they doing here?

254
00:19:51,912 --> 00:19:57,412  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's the children. They're
doing something to the children.

255
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,737  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
So what's the deal with the tin dog?

256
00:20:06,777 --> 00:20:09,494  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Doctor likes
travelling with an entourage.

257
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:15,648  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:416 Y2:523
Sometimes they're humans, sometimes
they're aliens and sometimes
they're tin dogs. What about you?

258
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:17,248  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where do you fit in the picture? Me?

259
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:20,729  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm their man in a van,
I'm their technical support, I'm. . .

260
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,323  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

261
00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:26,097  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm the tin dog.

262
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,459  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
On my command. . .

263
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:35,426  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
How many of us have there
been travelling with you?

264
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:38,661  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Does it matter? Yeah, it does, if
I'm just the latest in a long line.

265
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:41,739  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
As opposed to what?

266
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:44,385  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
I thought you and me were. . .

267
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:46,136  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
I obviously got it wrong.

268
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:49,541  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've been to the year 5 billion,
right, but this,

269
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,010  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
now this is really seeing the
future, you just leave us behind.

270
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:58,243  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
Is that what you're going to
do to me? No, not to you.
But Sarah Jane, you were

271
00:20:58,283 --> 00:21:00,641  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
that close to her once and now. . .

272
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:03,278  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
You never even mention her.

273
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:06,552  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why not? I don't age.

274
00:21:06,592 --> 00:21:09,558  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
I regenerate.

275
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:11,706  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
But humans decay.

276
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:13,873  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
You wither and you die.

277
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:17,503  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Imagine watching that happen
to someone who you. . .

278
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,266  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
What, Doctor?

279
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:23,519  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can spend the rest
of your life with me. . .

280
00:21:25,935 --> 00:21:28,451  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
But I can't spend the
rest of mine with you.

281
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:30,327  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
I have to live on.

282
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:31,851  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Alone.

283
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,322  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's the curse of the Time Lords.

284
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,937  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Time Lord.

285
00:21:47,628 --> 00:21:50,873  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Was that a Krillitane?

286
00:21:50,913 --> 00:21:53,933  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
It didn't even touch her, just
flew off. What did it do that for?

287
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:02,122  X1:078 X2:235 Y1:488 Y2:523
BELL RINGS

288
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:15,961  X1:078 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
Rose and Sarah, you go to the maths
room, crack open those computers.
I need to see the hardware inside.

289
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:20,720  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
You might need this. Mickey,
surveillance. I want you outside.
Just stand outside?

290
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,229  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Here, take these.
You can keep K9 company.

291
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:26,589  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:452 Y2:523
Leave the window open a crack. What?
He's metal. I didn't mean for him!

292
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:28,106  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you going to do?

293
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,233  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's time I had a
word with Mr Finch.

294
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:58,034  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who are you?
My name is Brother Lassar. And you?

295
00:22:58,074 --> 00:23:01,551  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Doctor. Since when did
Krillitanes have wings?

296
00:23:01,591 --> 00:23:05,025  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's been our form for nearly
10 generations now.

297
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:07,665  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Our ancestors invaded Bessan.

298
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:09,703  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
The people there had
some rather lovely wings.

299
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:13,299  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
They made a million widows
in one day, just imagine.

300
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:17,094  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
And now your shape's human.
A personal favourite, that's all.

301
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:20,213  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
And the others?
My brothers remain in bat form.

302
00:23:20,253 --> 00:23:22,490  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
What you see is a
simple morphic illusion.

303
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,892  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Scratch the surface and the
true Krillitane lies beneath.

304
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:28,645  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
And what of the Time Lords?

305
00:23:28,685 --> 00:23:31,001  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
I always thought of you
as such a pompous race.

306
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:36,432  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ancient, dusty senators.
So frightened of change and. . .

307
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:38,157  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
chaos.

308
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:41,590  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
And of course,
they're all but extinct.

309
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,106  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Only you. The last.

310
00:23:44,146 --> 00:23:46,824  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
This plan of yours, what is it?

311
00:23:46,864 --> 00:23:49,701  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
You don't know?
That's why I'm asking.

312
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:51,381  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, show me how clever you are.

313
00:23:51,421 --> 00:23:54,495  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Work it out. If I don't like it,

314
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:58,172  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
then it will stop. Fascinating.

315
00:23:58,212 --> 00:24:02,494  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Your people were peaceful
to the point of indolence.

316
00:24:02,534 --> 00:24:05,682  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
You seem to be something new.

317
00:24:05,722 --> 00:24:08,767  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
Would you declare war on us, Doctor?

318
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:10,496  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm so old now.

319
00:24:12,114 --> 00:24:14,582  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
I used to have so much mercy.

320
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:18,915  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
You get one warning.

321
00:24:20,468 --> 00:24:25,786  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
That was it. But we're not even
enemies. Soon, you will embrace us.

322
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:28,459  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
The next time we meet,

323
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:30,347  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
you will join with me.

324
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:33,417  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
I promise you.

325
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:42,485  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
"Surveillance." You ask me,
it's just another way of saying,

326
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:46,251  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
"Sit at the back of the class with
the safety scissors and glitter."

327
00:24:49,516 --> 00:24:52,667  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
That'll be me talking
to a metal dog, then.

328
00:24:56,232 --> 00:24:59,743  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's not working. Give it to me.

329
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:02,267  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Used to work first time, in my day.

330
00:25:02,307 --> 00:25:04,342  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, things were a
lot simpler back then.

331
00:25:04,382 --> 00:25:08,341  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose, can I give you a bit of advice?
I've got a feeling you're about to.

332
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:12,732  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
I know how intense a relationship
with the Doctor can be. And I don't
want you to feel I'm intruding. . .

333
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:15,849  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't feel threatened by you,
if that's what you mean. Good.

334
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,407  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm not interested
in picking up where we left off.

335
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:22,364  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
No? Big sad eyes and the robot dog,
what else were you doing last night?

336
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:25,840  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was just saying how hard it was,
adjusting to life back on Earth.

337
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,391  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thing is, when you two met, they'd
only just got rid of rationing.

338
00:25:30,431 --> 00:25:33,434  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
No wonder all that space stuff
was a bit too much for you.

339
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:36,586  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
I had no problem with space stuff.
I saw things you wouldn't believe.

340
00:25:36,626 --> 00:25:40,343  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Try me. Mummies. I've met ghosts.
Robots. Lots of robots.

341
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:42,979  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
Slitheen, in Downing Street. Daleks.

342
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:45,937  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Met the Emperor. Anti matter
monsters! Gas mask zombies!

343
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,254  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Real living dinosaurs!
Real living werewolf!

344
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:51,462  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Loch Ness Monster! Seriously?

345
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,402  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Listen to us.

346
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:03,595  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's like me and my mate Shareen.
The only time we fell
out was over a man.

347
00:26:03,635 --> 00:26:06,098  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
And we're arguing over the Doctor.

348
00:26:09,394 --> 00:26:14,983  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
With you, did he do that thing where
he'd explain something at like 90mph
and you'd go, "What?"

349
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:21,058  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
And he'd look at you like you just
dribbled on your shirt?
All the time!

350
00:26:21,098 --> 00:26:24,456  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Does he still stroke bits of
the Tardis? Yes! Yes, he does!

351
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:27,973  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm like, "Do you two
want to be alone?"

352
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:30,850  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
How's it going?

353
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,004  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
What? Listen, I need to find out
what's programmed inside these.

354
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:36,764  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

355
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,288  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stop it!

356
00:26:40,438 --> 00:26:42,834  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Brothers, we must
initiate the final phase.

357
00:26:42,874 --> 00:26:45,632  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Get the children inside
and seal the school.

358
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:47,790  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Our time has come, my brothers.

359
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,157  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Today, we shall become gods.

360
00:26:55,623 --> 00:26:58,220  X1:078 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
TANNOY:
'All pupils to class immediately.

361
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:03,635  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
'And would all members of staff
please congregate in the staff room.'

362
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:06,131  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Break time's finished early!

363
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:07,655  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Isn't that fantastic?

364
00:27:19,757 --> 00:27:21,955  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, no,
this classroom's out of bounds.

365
00:27:21,995 --> 00:27:26,671  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've all got to go to the
South Hall. Off you go, South Hall.

366
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,905  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is it now, Mr Finch?

367
00:27:28,945 --> 00:27:32,022  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Slight change in the timetable.
We're having an early lunch.

368
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:42,483  X1:078 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
SCREECHING AND SCREAMING

369
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:50,008  X1:078 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can't shift it. Thought the sonic
screwdriver could open anything.

370
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:55,082  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
Except a deadlock seal, there's got
to be something inside here. What
are they teaching those kids?

371
00:28:08,783 --> 00:28:10,717  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Close the school.

372
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:15,939  X1:078 X2:217 Y1:488 Y2:523
HE BURPS

373
00:28:44,944 --> 00:28:47,777  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
You wanted the program.
There it is.

374
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:56,966  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Some sort of code.

375
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:28,816  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

376
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:33,695  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, they can't be.

377
00:29:33,735 --> 00:29:36,892  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
They've taken them all! What?
They've taken all the children!

378
00:29:44,121 --> 00:29:45,770  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on, I need some help!

379
00:29:47,758 --> 00:29:52,234  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Systems restarting.
All primary drives functioning.

380
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:55,232  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK, no time to explain,
we need to get inside the school.

381
00:29:55,272 --> 00:29:57,708  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do you have a lock picking device?

382
00:29:57,748 --> 00:29:59,428  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
We are in a car.

383
00:29:59,468 --> 00:30:01,105  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maybe a drill attachment?

384
00:30:01,145 --> 00:30:02,662  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
We are in a car.

385
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:04,660  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fat lot of good you are.

386
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
We are in a car.

387
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,337  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wait a sec. We're in a car.

388
00:30:08,377 --> 00:30:10,857  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get back!

389
00:30:10,897 --> 00:30:15,010  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Skasis Paradigm. They're
trying to crack the Skasis Paradigm.

390
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,968  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Skasis what? The God Maker.

391
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:22,762  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
The Universal Theory. Crack that
equation and you've got control over
the building blocks of the universe.

392
00:30:22,802 --> 00:30:28,115  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
Time and space and matter, yours
to control. What, and the kids are
like a giant computer?

393
00:30:28,155 --> 00:30:32,310  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yes! And their learning power is
being accelerated by the oil!

394
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,986  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
That oil from the kitchens, it works
as a conducting agent.
Makes the kids cleverer.

395
00:30:37,026 --> 00:30:39,624  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
That oil's on the chips, I've eaten
them. What's 59 x 35?

396
00:30:39,664 --> 00:30:43,699  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
2, 065. Oh, my God! But why use
children, can't they use adults?

397
00:30:43,739 --> 00:30:46,819  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, it's got to be children. The God
Maker needs imagination to crack it.

398
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:50,535  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're not just using the
children's brains to break the code,

399
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:52,378  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
they're using their souls.

400
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:56,047  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let the lesson begin.

401
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,643  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Think of it, Doctor.

402
00:30:57,683 --> 00:31:01,201  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
With the Paradigm solved,
reality becomes clay in our hands.

403
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:03,318  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
We can shape the universe,
and improve it.

404
00:31:03,358 --> 00:31:06,555  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, yeah. The whole of creation
with the face of Mr Finch.

405
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:08,872  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Call me old fashioned,
I like things as they are.

406
00:31:08,912 --> 00:31:13,069  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:416 Y2:523
You act like such a radical
and yet all you want do is
preserve the old order.

407
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:16,186  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
Think of the changes that could be
made if the power was used for good.

408
00:31:16,226 --> 00:31:17,743  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
What, by someone like you? No.

409
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:19,900  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Someone like you.

410
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,896  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Paradigm gives us power,
but you could give us wisdom.

411
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:26,733  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Become a God,

412
00:31:26,773 --> 00:31:28,971  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
at my side.

413
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:33,087  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Imagine what you could do, think
of the civilisations you could save.

414
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:36,082  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Perganon, Ascinta,
your own people, Doctor.

415
00:31:36,122 --> 00:31:38,240  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Standing tall.

416
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,035  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Time Lords, reborn.

417
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:45,634  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
Doctor, don't listen to him.
And you could be with him
throughout eternity.

418
00:31:45,674 --> 00:31:48,071  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Young, fresh.

419
00:31:48,111 --> 00:31:50,588  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Never wither, never age, never die.

420
00:31:50,628 --> 00:31:53,904  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Their lives are so fleeting.
So many goodbyes.

421
00:31:53,944 --> 00:31:56,982  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
How lonely you must be, Doctor.

422
00:31:57,022 --> 00:31:59,580  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Join us.

423
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,456  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
I could save everyone. Yes.

424
00:32:02,496 --> 00:32:04,504  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
I could stop the war.

425
00:32:06,253 --> 00:32:10,210  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:488 Y2:523
No. The universe has to move forward.

426
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,521  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Pain and loss, they define us
as much as happiness or love.

427
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:17,641  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Whether it's a world,
or a relationship.

428
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:19,437  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everything has its time.

429
00:32:19,477 --> 00:32:21,041  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
And everything ends.

430
00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:44,104  X1:308 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
C'mon!

431
00:32:45,212 --> 00:32:48,124  X1:078 X2:271 Y1:488 Y2:523
HE SCREECHES

432
00:33:07,828 --> 00:33:09,307  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is going on?

433
00:33:32,202 --> 00:33:34,999  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are they my teachers? Yeah. Sorry.

434
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,685  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
We need the Doctor alive.
As for the others, you can feast.

435
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:55,297  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Brother!

436
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:59,452  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
K9! Suggest that you engage
running mode, Mistress.

437
00:33:59,492 --> 00:34:02,292  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on! K9, Hold them back!

438
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:06,682  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Affirmative, master.

439
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:09,059  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maximum defence mode!

440
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,430  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Power supply failing.

441
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:22,189  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Forget the shootie dog thing.

442
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,998  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Power supply failing.

443
00:34:29,462 --> 00:34:32,660  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's the oil! Krillitane life forms
can't handle the oil, that's it!

444
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,333  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
They've changed their physiology so
often, their oil is toxic to them.

445
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:39,609  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
How much was there in the kitchens?
Barrels of it.

446
00:34:43,325 --> 00:34:46,202  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK, we need to
get to the kitchens. Mickey!

447
00:34:46,242 --> 00:34:50,036  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hold the coats? Get the children
unplugged and out of the school.

448
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:52,504  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now then, bats, bats, bats. . .
How do we fight bats?

449
00:34:53,276 --> 00:34:56,188  X1:078 X2:325 Y1:488 Y2:523
FIRE ALARM RINGS

450
00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:10,702  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get after them!

451
00:35:14,652 --> 00:35:17,132  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Master.

452
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:19,606  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
C'mon on, boy! Good boy.

453
00:35:19,646 --> 00:35:22,439  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK, listen, everyone.
We've got to get out of here.

454
00:35:35,112 --> 00:35:37,230  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
They've been deadlock sealed.

455
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,705  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Finch must have done it.
I can't open them!

456
00:35:39,745 --> 00:35:44,780  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
The vats would not withstand
a direct hit from my laser,
but my batteries are failing.

457
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,977  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right, everyone out of the
back door. K9, stay with me.

458
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,947  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everyone, get out. Now!

459
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:18,519  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on! Move! Let's go, let's go!

460
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:38,481  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Capacity for only one shot,
Master.

461
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:41,837  X1:090 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
For maximum impact, I must be
stationed directly beside the vat.

462
00:36:41,877 --> 00:36:43,835  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
But you'll be trapped inside.

463
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:46,835  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
That is correct.
I can't let you do that.

464
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:49,622  X1:126 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
No alternative possible, Master.

465
00:36:55,106 --> 00:36:58,178  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
Goodbye, old friend.
Goodbye, Master.

466
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,197  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
You good dog. Affirmative.

467
00:37:13,286 --> 00:37:15,042  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where's K9?

468
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:16,680  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
We need to run.

469
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,120  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where is he? What have you done?

470
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,836  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
When we find him,

471
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:23,578  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
eat him if you must,
but bring me his brain.

472
00:37:32,705 --> 00:37:35,333  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
The little dog with the nasty bite.

473
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:39,325  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not so powerful now, are you?

474
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:46,098  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
C'mon, guys, let's go, let's go.

475
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,507  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Burning!

476
00:37:52,484 --> 00:37:54,800  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
You bad dog.

477
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,949  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Affirmative.

478
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:09,307  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes!

479
00:38:09,347 --> 00:38:12,263  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Did you have something to
do with it? Yeah, I did.

480
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:14,900  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

481
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,458  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Kenny blew up the school!
It was Kenny!

482
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:20,096  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ken ny! Ken ny! Ken ny!

483
00:38:23,612 --> 00:38:25,448  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry. It's all right.

484
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:30,238  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
He was just a daft metal dog.
Fine, really.

485
00:38:52,702 --> 00:38:55,330  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cuppa tea?

486
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:08,404  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've redecorated. D'you like it?

487
00:39:08,444 --> 00:39:10,522  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, I do.

488
00:39:10,562 --> 00:39:14,796  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah.
I preferred it as it was, but, er. . .

489
00:39:14,836 --> 00:39:17,633  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, it'll do. I love it.

490
00:39:17,673 --> 00:39:20,750  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hey you, what's 47 x 369?

491
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,387  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
No idea.
It's gone now, the oil's faded.

492
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,187  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
But you're still clever.
More than a match for him.

493
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:28,584  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
You and me both.

494
00:39:28,624 --> 00:39:31,291  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor?

495
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:35,415  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're about to head off, but. . .

496
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:37,303  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
you could come with us.

497
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,283  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't do this any more.

498
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:47,960  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Besides, I've got a much
bigger adventure ahead.

499
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,558  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Time I stopped waiting for you
and found a life of my own.

500
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:56,071  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can I come?

501
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:58,552  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not with you, I mean. . .With you.

502
00:39:58,592 --> 00:40:02,865  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cos I'm not the tin dog
and I want to see what's out there.

503
00:40:02,905 --> 00:40:06,142  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, go on, Doctor.
Sarah Jane Smith and Mickey Smith.

504
00:40:06,182 --> 00:40:08,460  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
You need a Smith on board.

505
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,473  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, then. I could do with a laugh.

506
00:40:12,256 --> 00:40:14,571  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose, is that OK? No, great.

507
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:16,254  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why not?

508
00:40:19,128 --> 00:40:21,790  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, I'd better go.

509
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:27,999  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do I do?

510
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:30,595  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do I stay with him? Yes.

511
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:35,430  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Some things are
worth getting your heart broken for.

512
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:47,368  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Find me, if you need to, one day.
Find me.

513
00:40:57,967 --> 00:41:03,041  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's daft, but I haven't ever thanked
you for that time. And, like I said,

514
00:41:03,081 --> 00:41:05,598  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

515
00:41:05,638 --> 00:41:07,198  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Something to tell the grandkids.

516
00:41:07,238 --> 00:41:10,315  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Er, I think it'll be
someone else's grandkids now.

517
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:12,551  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right, yes.

518
00:41:12,591 --> 00:41:15,509  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sorry, I didn't get a chance to ask.
You haven't. . .

519
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:17,786  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
There hasn't been anyone,

520
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:21,783  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
you know?
Well, there was this one guy.

521
00:41:21,823 --> 00:41:28,014  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I travelled with him for a while,
but he was a tough act to follow.

522
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:31,171  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Goodbye, Doctor.
Oh, it's not goodbye. . .

523
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:35,085  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Say it, please. This time, say it.

524
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,325  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Goodbye.

525
00:41:37,365 --> 00:41:39,088  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
My Sarah Jane.

526
00:42:10,768 --> 00:42:12,887  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
K9!

527
00:42:12,927 --> 00:42:15,284  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mistress.

528
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,362  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
But. . . You were blown up.
The master rebuilt me.

529
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:21,917  X1:150 X2:613 Y1:416 Y2:523
My systems are much improved with
new omniflexible
hyperlink facilities.

530
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:24,875  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
He replaced you with a
brand new model. Affirmative.

531
00:42:24,915 --> 00:42:26,515  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

532
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:28,632  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
He does that.

533
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:30,472  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on, you. Home.

534
00:42:30,512 --> 00:42:33,418  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
We've got work to do. Affirmative.

535
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:47,411  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:308 Y2:379
We are under attack! There are
creatures! We can't stop them!

536
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:49,849  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
We need to find out what they're
looking for.

537
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:51,688  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are inside my mind.

538
00:42:51,728 --> 00:42:56,240  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
A spaceship from the 51st century
stalking a woman from the 18th.

539
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,131  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
They found the right time window.
Now it's time to send in the troops.

540
00:43:05,754 --> 00:43:07,554  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
The clock on the mantle is broken.

541
00:43:07,594 --> 00:43:09,268  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
It is time.

542
00:43:09,308 --> 00:43:12,214  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor! Doctor!

543
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:34,162  X1:112 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
