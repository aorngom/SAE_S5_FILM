1
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:21,018  X1:078 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Have you got everything? I've got
everything. Don't worry. Be careful.

2
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:23,805  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
You'll have to call Mo about. . .
Oh, never mind Mo.

3
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,206  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK, I'm going now. I love you.
I love you. Love you.

4
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:39,172  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
I love you. Bye.

5
00:01:00,454 --> 00:01:05,448  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
So where are we going?
Further than we've ever gone before.

6
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:51,604  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's the year 5,000,000,023.

7
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:56,553  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:344 Y2:415
We're in the Galaxy M87
and this. . . this is New Earth.

8
00:01:57,997 --> 00:01:59,931  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's just. . .

9
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:03,470  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's just. . .

10
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:06,423  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not bad. Not bad at all.

11
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:09,303  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's amazing.

12
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:11,780  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll never get used to this, never.

13
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,897  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Different ground beneath my feet,

14
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:15,454  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
different sky.

15
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:16,978  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's that smell?

16
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:21,010  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Apple grass. Apple grass. Yeah.

17
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,687  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's beautiful.

18
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,364  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, I love this.

19
00:02:25,404 --> 00:02:27,522  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can I just say?

20
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:30,522  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Travelling with you, I love it!

21
00:02:30,562 --> 00:02:32,080  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Me too!

22
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:33,957  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on.

23
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:40,477  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Human! She's pure-blood human.

24
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:44,843  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Closer, closer.

25
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:55,691  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
So, the year 5,000,000,000, the Sun
expands, the Earth gets roasted.

26
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:58,728  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
That was our first date.
We had chips.

27
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:04,843  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
So anyway, planet gone, all rocks
and dust, but the human race lives
on, spread out across the stars.

28
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:11,596  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
As soon as the Earth burns up, oh,
they get all nostalgic, big revival
movement. They find this place,

29
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:14,074  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
same size as the Earth, same air,
same orbit, lovely.

30
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:17,472  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
The call goes out, the humans
move in. What's the city called?

31
00:03:17,512 --> 00:03:19,546  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
New New York. Oh, come on. It is!

32
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:26,219  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
The City of New New York.
Strictly speaking, it's the 15th
New York since the original, so that

33
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:31,418  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:452 Y2:523
makes it New New New New New New New
New New New New New New New York.

34
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:35,557  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
What? You're so different.
New new Doctor.

35
00:03:38,728 --> 00:03:41,525  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Impossible. I recognise that child.

36
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:43,721  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Her face, show me her face.

37
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:48,306  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Closer, closer. Face, face, face.

38
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:53,073  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can we go and visit New New York -
so good they named it twice?

39
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:56,748  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, I thought we might go there
first.

40
00:03:56,788 --> 00:03:59,344  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why, what is it?
Some sort of hospital.

41
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:03,298  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
The green moon on the side, that's
the universal symbol for hospitals.

42
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:04,938  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
I got this. . .

43
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,295  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
a message on the psychic paper.

44
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:08,895  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Someone wants to see me.

45
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:15,769  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
Oh, and I thought we were just
sightseeing. Come on, then.
Let's go and buy some grapes.

46
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:19,122  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh! Rose Tyler, I knew it!

47
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:24,280  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
That dirty blonde assassin.
She's coming here, mistress.
But this is beyond coincidence.

48
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,958  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is destiny. At last,
I can be revenged on that little. . .

49
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:31,191  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
Bit rich, coming from you.
I can't help it, I don't like
hospitals. They give me the creeps.

50
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:34,146  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
ON PA: The pleasure gardens
will now take visitors

51
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:38,421  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:416 Y2:523
carrying green or blue
identification
cards for the next 15 minutes.

52
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:42,657  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
Visitors are reminded
that cuttings from the gardens
are not permitted.

53
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:44,617  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Very smart.

54
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:48,131  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not exactly NHS.
No shop. I like the little shop.

55
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:52,967  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523
I thought this far in the future,
they'd have cured everything.
The human race moves on - so do viruses.

56
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:55,605  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's an ongoing war.

57
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,129  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hope, harmony and health.

58
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:04,916  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
They're cats. Now, don't stare.
Think what you look like to them -
all pink and yellow.

59
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:08,067  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's where I'd put the shop,
right there.

60
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:12,227  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ward 26, thanks.

61
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,463  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Override controls.

62
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:15,823  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hold on, hold on.

63
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:19,141  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can't, too late. I'm going up.
It's OK, there's another lift.

64
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:22,098  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ward 26,
and watch out for the disinfectant.

65
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:24,815  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
Watch out for what? The disinfectant!
The what?

66
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:26,339  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
The dis. . . Oh, you'll find out.

67
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:35,991  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um. . .ward 26, thanks.

68
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:44,355  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Commence stage one disinfection.'

69
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:50,255  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Commence stage one disinfection.'

70
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:24,309  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
The human child is clean.

71
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:27,867  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um, I'm looking for ward 26.

72
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:29,710  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
This way, Rose Tyler.

73
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:49,643  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nice place. No shop downstairs -
I'd have a shop.

74
00:06:49,683 --> 00:06:53,000  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not a big one, just a shop.
So people can shop.

75
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,118  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
The hospital is a place of healing.
A shop does some people
the world of good.

76
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:59,416  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not me, other people.

77
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:05,618  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Sisters of Plenitude take
a lifelong vow to help and to mend.

78
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:09,419  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Excuse me!

79
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:14,696  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
Members of the public may only gaze
upon the Duke of Manhattan
with written permission

80
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:18,811  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
from the Senate of New New York.
That's petrifold regression, right?
I'm dying, sir,

81
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:22,327  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
a lifetime of charity and abstinence

82
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,845  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
and it ends like this. Any statement
made by the Duke of Manhattan

83
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:29,121  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
may not be made public without
official clearance. Frau Clovis!

84
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,069  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm so weak. Sister Jatt,
a little privacy, please.

85
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:43,104  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
. .He'll be up and about in no time.
I doubt it. Petrifold regression -
he's turning to stone.

86
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:47,461  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
There won't be a cure for, oh,
a thousand years. He might be up
and about but only as a statue.

87
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:51,415  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523
Have faith in the Sisterhood.
But is there no-one
here you recognise?

88
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:55,411  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's rather unusual, to visit
without knowing the patient.

89
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:57,754  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, I think I've found him.

90
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,606  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Novice Hame, if I can leave
this gentleman in your care.

91
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:07,399  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, I think my friend got lost. Rose
Tyler - could you ask at reception?

92
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,923  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Certainly, sir.

93
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,954  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm afraid the Face of Boe's asleep.

94
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:17,107  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's all he tends to do
these days. Are you a friend?

95
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:20,586  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:452 Y2:523
We met just the once on
Platform One. What's wrong with him?

96
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:24,259  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm so sorry, I thought you knew.

97
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:26,859  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Face of Boe is dying.

98
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:29,975  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Of what? Old age,

99
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:31,893  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
the one thing we can't cure.

100
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:38,646  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523
He's thousands of years old,
some people say millions,
although that's impossible.

101
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,388  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, I don't know. I like impossible.

102
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:49,336  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm here. I look a bit different,
but it's me, it's the Doctor.

103
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,961  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, you never know what your life
is going to be like, ever!

104
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,796  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm bored with this drink.

105
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:28,514  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Anyway. . . Oh, hello, darling! Oh!

106
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:32,348  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't, now stop it!
Wait a minute, that's. . .

107
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:34,265  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Peekaboo!

108
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:36,065  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't you come anywhere
near me, Cassandra.

109
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:39,102  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why, what do you think
I'm going to do? Flap you to death?

110
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:40,859  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, but what about Gollum?

111
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:43,536  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, that's just Chip, he's my pet.

112
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:45,136  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
I worship the mistress.

113
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:47,104  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Moisturise me, moisturise me!

114
00:09:48,611 --> 00:09:51,771  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's not even a proper life form,
he's a force-grown clone.

115
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:56,683  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I modelled him on my favourite
pattern. But he's so faithful.

116
00:09:56,723 --> 00:09:58,561  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Chip sees to my physical needs.

117
00:09:58,601 --> 00:10:00,519  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
I hope that means food.

118
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,034  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
But how comes you're still alive?
After you murdered me?
That was your own fault.

119
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:11,426  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
The brain of my mistress survived,
and her pretty blue eyes
were salvaged from the bin.

120
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:14,223  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
But what about the skin? I saw it,

121
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:16,181  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
you got ripped apart.

122
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:19,021  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
That piece of skin was taken
from the front of my body.

123
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:20,818  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
This piece is the back.

124
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:25,412  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
Right, so you're talking out of your...
Ask not!  The mistress was lucky to survive.

125
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:28,089  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Chip secreted my lady
into the hospital.

126
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:31,695  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
So they don't know you're here?
Chip steals medicine, helps my lady,

127
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:35,363  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
soothes her, strokes her.

128
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:42,037  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
You can stop right there, Chip.
But I'm so alone, hidden down here,
the last human in existence.

129
00:10:42,077 --> 00:10:44,711  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't start that!
They've called this planet New Earth.

130
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:50,705  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
A vegetable patch. And there's
millions of humans out there,
millions of them. Mutant stock.

131
00:10:50,745 --> 00:10:54,659  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
They evolved, Cassandra,
they just evolved, like they should.

132
00:10:54,699 --> 00:11:00,015  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
You stayed still, you got yourself
all pickled and preserved,
and what good did it do you?

133
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:03,370  X1:078 X2:463 Y1:452 Y2:523
I remember that night, drinks
for the Ambassador of Thrace.

134
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,010  X1:114 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
'. .How very kind you are. . .'

135
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,447  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
That was the last time
anyone told me I was beautiful.

136
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:12,084  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
After that,
it all became such hard work.

137
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:14,962  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, you've got a knack
for survival, I'll give you that.

138
00:11:15,002 --> 00:11:20,196  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
But I've not been idle, Rose.
Tucked away underneath
this hospital, I've been listening.

139
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:22,550  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Sisters are hiding something.

140
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,547  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
What do you mean?
Oh, these cats have secrets.

141
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:29,863  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hush, let me whisper. Come close.

142
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:33,140  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
You must be joking if you think
I'm coming anywhere near you.

143
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,214  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Chip, activate the psychograft.
I can't move!

144
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:38,943  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cassandra, let me go!

145
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:43,169  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
What are you doing?
The lady's moving on.

146
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:47,310  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's goodbye, trampoline,
and hello, blondie!

147
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,260  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mistress?
CASSANDRA'S ACCENT: Moisturise me.

148
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:11,098  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
How bizarre,

149
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:13,336  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
arms,

150
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:14,894  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
fingers, hair!

151
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:20,410  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let me see, let me see.

152
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,847  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

153
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:25,964  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm a chav!

154
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:28,762  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hope, harmony and health.

155
00:12:28,802 --> 00:12:31,598  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hope, harmony and health.

156
00:12:31,638 --> 00:12:34,872  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's very kind, there's no need.

157
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:36,550  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're the one working.

158
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,750  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's not much to do,
just maintain his smoke.

159
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:44,623  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
And I suppose I'm company.
I can hear him singing sometimes,

160
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,860  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
in my mind,

161
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,778  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
such ancient songs.
Am I the only visitor?

162
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:54,292  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
The rest of Boekind became extinct,
long ago.

163
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:56,052  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's the only one left.

164
00:12:56,092 --> 00:13:00,208  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Legend says that the Face of Boe
has watched the universe grow old.

165
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:04,722  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's all sorts of superstitions
around him.

166
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:08,284  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
One story
says that just before his death,

167
00:13:08,324 --> 00:13:11,273  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
the Face of Boe will impart
his great secret,

168
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:15,748  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
that he will speak those words
only to one like himself.

169
00:13:15,788 --> 00:13:18,708  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
What does that mean?
It's just a story.

170
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:22,901  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tell me the rest.
It's said he'll talk to a wanderer,

171
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:25,179  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
to the man without a home,

172
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:26,703  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
the lonely god.

173
00:13:32,253 --> 00:13:36,327  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look at me! From class to brass.

174
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,249  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Although. . .

175
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:41,565  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ooh. . .curves.

176
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:43,361  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, baby!

177
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:47,118  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's like living inside a bouncy
castle. The mistress is beautiful.

178
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:48,672  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Absolument.

179
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:50,401  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, but look.

180
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,906  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
The brain meat expired.

181
00:13:55,946 --> 00:13:57,703  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
My old mistress has gone.

182
00:13:57,743 --> 00:14:01,023  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
But safe and sound in here.

183
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:03,580  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
But what of the Rose child's mind?

184
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,497  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, tucked away.

185
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:08,000  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can just about access
the surface memory, she's. . .

186
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:13,154  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gosh, she's with the Doctor.

187
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,926  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
That man,

188
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:22,159  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
he's the Doctor, the same Doctor,
with a new face.

189
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,274  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
That hypocrite. . . ! Though I must get
the name of his surgeon.

190
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:28,194  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
I could do with a little work.

191
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,752  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Although. . .

192
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:34,055  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice rear bumper.

193
00:14:36,145 --> 00:14:38,581  X1:078 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
MOBILE RINGS
Oh, it seems to be ringing.

194
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:40,339  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is it meant to ring?

195
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,456  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
A primitive communications device.
DOCTOR: Rose? Where are you?

196
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:46,333  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
How does she speak?

197
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:48,551  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Old Earth cockney. Um. . .

198
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,127  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:452 Y2:523
Wotcha. Where've you been? How long
does it take to get to ward 26?

199
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:55,044  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm on my way, guvnor.

200
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:59,600  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
I shall proceed
up the apples and pears.

201
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,432  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
You'll never guess, I'm with
the Face of Boe. Remember him?

202
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:07,508  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Of course I do. That big old. . .

203
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:10,507  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
boat race.
Better go. See you in a minute.

204
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:13,983  X1:078 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
DUKE OF MANHATTAN LAUGHS
Didn't think I was going to make it!

205
00:15:14,023 --> 00:15:19,257  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's that man again. He's my good
luck charm. Come in, don't be shy.

206
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:24,494  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Any friendship expressed
by the Duke of Manhattan does not
constitute a form of legal contract.

207
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:26,416  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Winch me up.

208
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,885  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hup! Look at me.
No sign of infection. Champagne, sir?

209
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:34,722  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, thanks.

210
00:15:34,762 --> 00:15:41,480  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
You had petrifold regression, right?
Had being the operative word,
past tense! Completely cured.

211
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:47,067  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
But that's impossible. Primitive
species would accuse us of magic

212
00:15:47,107 --> 00:15:50,105  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
but it's merely
the tender application of science.

213
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:53,542  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
How on earth did you cure him?
How on New Earth, you might say.

214
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:56,539  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's in that solution?
A simple remedy.

215
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,179  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then tell me what it is.

216
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:01,015  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry - patient confidentiality.

217
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:03,052  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't believe we've met.

218
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:04,809  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
My name is Matron Casp.

219
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:06,328  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm The Doctor.

220
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:08,487  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think you will find that
WE'RE the doctors here.

221
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:12,298  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Matron Casp, you're needed in
intensive care. If you'd excuse me.

222
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:17,715  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's happened again,
one of the patients is conscious.

223
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:19,808  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, we can't have that.

224
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:26,226  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
This Doctor man is dangerous.
Dangerous and clever.
I might need a mind like his.

225
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:28,023  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Sisterhood is up to something.

226
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:32,179  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Remember that Old Earth saying,
never trust a nun,

227
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:36,137  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
never trust a nurse,
and never trust a cat.

228
00:16:36,177 --> 00:16:37,946  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Perfume?

229
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:49,329  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
It was having a perfectly normal
blood-wash, then all of a sudden,
it started crying. It's this one.

230
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:54,993  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Please. . .help me.
Look at its eyes, so alive.

231
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:56,593  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Positively sparkling.

232
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,989  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Please, where am I?

233
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:00,628  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
And speech!

234
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:02,668  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
How can it even have a vocabulary?

235
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:08,422  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
Sister Corvin has written a thesis
on the migration of sentience,
she calls it the echo of life.

236
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:10,182  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's well worth a read.

237
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:11,899  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Help me.

238
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,412  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've seen enough, thank you.

239
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:18,690  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
If this happens again, we might
have to review our brainstem policy.

240
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,331  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
And what should we do
with the patient?

241
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:21,851  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Standard procedure.

242
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:23,091  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Incinerate.

243
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:27,532  X1:078 X2:209 Y1:488 Y2:523
SCREAMS

244
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:39,186  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
'Ambient temperature is 14 degrees
composite, a temperature designed
to promote healing and well-being.'

245
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:43,066  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
There you are!
Come and look at this patient.

246
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:45,663  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Marconi's disease,
should take years to recover.

247
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:48,060  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Two days.
I've never seen anything like it.

248
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,577  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
They've invented a cell-washing
cascade, it's amazing.

249
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:53,574  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
Their medical science
is way advanced.

250
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:58,409  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
And this one, pallidome pancrosis.
Kills you in ten minutes -
and he's fine.

251
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:02,365  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
I need to find a terminal. Gotta see
how they do this.

252
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:06,596  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
If they've got the best medicine in
the world, why's it such a secret?

253
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:08,756  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't Adam and Eve it.

254
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,353  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
What. . . ? What's with the voice?

255
00:18:11,393 --> 00:18:14,390  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't know, just larking about.

256
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,257  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
New Earth. . .new me.

257
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:21,305  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, I can talk - new new Doctor.

258
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:23,637  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mmm, aren't you just?

259
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:34,695  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
T-Terminal's this way.

260
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:41,243  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
FALSETTO: Yup,

261
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:42,403  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
still got it.

262
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:47,714  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nope, nothing odd.
Surgery, post-op, nanodentistry.

263
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:51,589  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
No sign of a shop,
they should have a shop.
No, it's missing something else.

264
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:57,105  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
When I was downstairs, those
nurse cat nuns were talking about
intensive care, but where is it?

265
00:18:57,145 --> 00:18:58,702  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're right, well done.

266
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:02,060  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why would they
hide a whole department?

267
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,817  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's got to be there somewhere,
search the subframe.

268
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:06,934  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
What if the subframe's locked?

269
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:09,055  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Try the installation protocol.

270
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:11,558  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, course, sorry. Hold on.

271
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,033  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Intensive care. . .

272
00:19:26,073 --> 00:19:28,331  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Certainly looks intensive.

273
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:10,788  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's disgusting.

274
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:13,743  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's wrong with him?

275
00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:16,420  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

276
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,274  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm so sorry.

277
00:20:34,002 --> 00:20:36,239  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
What disease is that?

278
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:41,312  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
All of them. Every single disease
in the galaxy. They've been
infected with everything.

279
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:44,949  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
What about us,

280
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:47,986  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
are we safe? The air's sterile.
Just don't touch them.

281
00:20:54,938 --> 00:20:57,459  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
How many patients are there?

282
00:20:57,499 --> 00:20:59,256  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're not patients.

283
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:00,896  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
But they're sick.

284
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:03,373  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
They were born sick.
They're meant to be sick.

285
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:05,209  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
They exist to be sick.

286
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:08,686  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Lab rats. No wonder the Sisters
have a cure for everything,

287
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:13,238  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
they've built the ultimate
research laboratory - a human farm!

288
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:15,397  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why don't they just die?

289
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:18,194  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Plague carriers,

290
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:21,031  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
the last to go.
It's for the greater cause.

291
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,103  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Novice Hame.

292
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,383  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
When you took your vows,
did you agree to this?

293
00:21:27,423 --> 00:21:29,703  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Sisterhood has sworn to help.

294
00:21:29,743 --> 00:21:32,219  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
What, by killing?
But they're not real people.

295
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:37,614  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're specially grown,
they have no proper existence.

296
00:21:37,654 --> 00:21:39,491  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's the turnover?

297
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,291  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:488 Y2:523
A thousand a day? Thousand the next?

298
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:44,288  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thousand the next?
How many thousands?

299
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:46,765  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
For how many years? HOW MANY?

300
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:51,759  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
Mankind needed us. They came
to this planet with so many
illnesses, we couldn't cope.

301
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:54,476  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
We did try,

302
00:21:54,516 --> 00:22:01,627  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
we tried everything. We tried
using clone-meat and biocattle.
The results were too slow.

303
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:05,024  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
So the Sisterhood grew its own flesh,

304
00:22:05,064 --> 00:22:07,621  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
that's all they are, flesh.

305
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,258  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
These people are alive.

306
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:12,299  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
But think of those humans out there,

307
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:15,415  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
healthy and happy because of us.

308
00:22:15,455 --> 00:22:19,173  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
If they live because of this,
then life is worthless.

309
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,010  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
But who are you to decide that?

310
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,926  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm the Doctor.

311
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:27,160  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
And if you don't like it,
if you want to take it to a higher
authority, there isn't one.

312
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,797  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
It stops with me.

313
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:34,751  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
Just to confirm,
none of the humans in the city
actually know about this?

314
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:38,229  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
We thought it best not. Hold on.
I can understand the bodies.

315
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:41,426  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can understand your vows,
but one thing I can't understand.

316
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:45,740  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
What have you done to Rose?
I don't know what you mean.
And I'm being very, very calm -

317
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,060  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
you want to beware of that -
very, very calm.

318
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,374  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:416 Y2:523
And the only reason I'm being
so very, very calm is that
the brain is a delicate thing.

319
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:57,411  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523
Whatever you've done to Rose's head,
I want it reversed.
We haven't done anything.

320
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:59,287  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm perfectly fine.

321
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:03,124  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
These people are dying.
And Rose would care.

322
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:06,118  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, all right, cleverclogs. . .

323
00:23:06,158 --> 00:23:08,166  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
smartypants. . .

324
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:17,026  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
ladykiller. What's happened to you?
I knew something was going on in
this hospital but I needed this body

325
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:19,984  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
and your mind to find it out.

326
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:25,498  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who are you? The last human.

327
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:28,444  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cassandra?
Wake up and smell the perfume.

328
00:23:31,973 --> 00:23:34,009  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've hurt him! I don't understand.

329
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:35,689  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll have to fetch matron.

330
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:39,989  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
You do that - cos I want to see her.
Now run along! Sound the alarm!

331
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:46,996  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Matron, it's that man and the girl.

332
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:50,272  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
We heard the alarm. Now go back
to work, tend to your patients.

333
00:23:58,382 --> 00:23:59,982  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let me out! Let me out!

334
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:03,217  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Aren't you lucky there was a spare.

335
00:24:03,257 --> 00:24:06,497  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Standing room only.
You've stolen Rose's body.

336
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:11,290  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Over the years, I've thought of
a thousand ways to kill you, Doctor,

337
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,967  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
and now that's exactly what
I've got - one thousand diseases.

338
00:24:15,007 --> 00:24:20,599  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
They pump the patients with a top-up
every ten minutes, you've got
about three minutes left.

339
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:26,953  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
Enjoy. Just let Rose go, Cassandra.
I will, as soon as I find
someone younger and. . .

340
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:32,187  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
less common. Then I'll junk her
with the waste.
Now, hushabye - it's showtime.

341
00:24:32,227 --> 00:24:34,704  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Anything we can do to help?

342
00:24:34,744 --> 00:24:38,305  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Straight to the point, Whiskers.
I want money.

343
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:42,935  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Sisterhood is a charity,
we don't give money, we only accept.

344
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:47,251  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
The humans across the water
pay you a fortune
and that's exactly what I need.

345
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:50,089  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
A one-off payment,
that's all I want.

346
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:51,566  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
And perhaps a yacht.

347
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:56,519  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523
In return for which,
I will tell the city nothing
of your institutional murder.

348
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,076  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that a deal?

349
00:24:59,116 --> 00:25:02,874  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm afraid not. I'd really
advise you to think about this.

350
00:25:02,914 --> 00:25:05,471  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's no need. I have to decline.

351
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:07,748  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'll tell them,
and you've no way of stopping me!

352
00:25:07,788 --> 00:25:11,026  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're not exactly nuns with guns.
You're not even armed.

353
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:14,712  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who needs arms when we have claws?

354
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,883  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, well. Nice try. . .Chip! Plan B.

355
00:25:29,168 --> 00:25:30,841  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
What have you done?

356
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:33,042  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Gave the system a shot
of adrenalin just to wake 'em up.

357
00:25:33,082 --> 00:25:34,758  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
See ya. Don't touch them!

358
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:37,476  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whatever you do, don't touch.

359
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:39,593  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Please, save us.

360
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:41,633  X1:078 X2:197 Y1:488 Y2:523
Save us.

361
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,030  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think we should withdraw.

362
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,067  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
We understood what you did to us.

363
00:25:47,107 --> 00:25:49,664  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
As part of the machine,

364
00:25:49,704 --> 00:25:51,422  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
we know the machine.

365
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:55,101  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Fascinating! It's actually
constructing an argument.

366
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:58,093  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
And we will end it.

367
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:21,389  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're free!

368
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:25,371  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
By the Goddess Santori,
the Flesh is free!

369
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,884  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
You caused the pain.

370
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:46,842  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, my God!
What the hell have you done?

371
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:50,479  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
It wasn't me. One touch and you get
every disease in the world! And
I want that body safe, Cassandra.

372
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,635  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've got to go down.
But there's thousands of them.

373
00:26:52,675 --> 00:26:55,172  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Run! Down, down, go down!

374
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:01,187  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Quarantine the building!

375
00:27:01,227 --> 00:27:03,155  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
'This building is under quarantine.'

376
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:08,900  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Repeat.
This building is under quarantine.

377
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,895  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
'No-one may leave the premises.
Repeat. . .

378
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:16,731  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
'No-one may leave the premises. . .'

379
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:19,803  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Keep going, going down!

380
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,707  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Help me! (Help us. . .)

381
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:50,297  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
No, the lifts have closed down.
That's the quarantine -
nothing's moving. This way!

382
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:57,408  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh-h!
Someone will touch him! Leave him!

383
00:27:57,448 --> 00:28:00,324  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's a clone thing, he's only got
a half-life, come on. Mistress!

384
00:28:00,364 --> 00:28:02,682  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry, I can't let her escape.

385
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,240  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
My mistress!

386
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:16,161  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Excuse me,
can we get some service?

387
00:28:32,892 --> 00:28:35,768  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're trapped!
What are we going to do?

388
00:28:35,808 --> 00:28:38,522  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, for starters,
you're going to leave that body.

389
00:28:38,562 --> 00:28:41,320  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
That psychograft is banned
on every civilised planet.

390
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,120  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're compressing Rose to death.

391
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,633  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
But I've got nowhere to go.
My original skin's dead.

392
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:48,392  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not my problem.

393
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:51,475  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can float as atoms in the air.
Now get out.

394
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:56,376  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
Give her back to me.
You asked for it.

395
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:08,152  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my head. Where did she go?

396
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,490  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my, this is. . .different.

397
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,644  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cassandra?

398
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:15,164  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Goodness me, I'm a man!

399
00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:17,521  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yum. So many parts!

400
00:29:17,561 --> 00:29:19,569  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
And hardly used.

401
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:23,395  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ah-h. . . ! Two hearts!

402
00:29:23,435 --> 00:29:26,032  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, baby, I'm beating out a samba.

403
00:29:26,072 --> 00:29:28,709  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get out of him! Hmm, he's slim

404
00:29:28,749 --> 00:29:30,506  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
and a little bit foxy.

405
00:29:30,546 --> 00:29:32,666  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
You thought so too,

406
00:29:32,706 --> 00:29:34,703  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've been inside your head.

407
00:29:34,743 --> 00:29:37,461  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've been looking.

408
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:39,383  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
You like it.

409
00:29:40,498 --> 00:29:44,015  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
What do we do? What would he do?
The Doctor,
what the hell would he do?

410
00:29:44,055 --> 00:29:46,212  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ladder, we've got to get up.

411
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,291  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Out of the way, blondie.

412
00:29:48,331 --> 00:29:53,160  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
(Help us. Please. . .help us.)

413
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:21,736  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
If you get out of the Doctor's
body, he can think of something.
Oh, "Yap yap yap" (!)

414
00:30:21,776 --> 00:30:25,173  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
God, it was tedious
inside your head - Hormone City(!)

415
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:27,086  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
We'll die if. . .

416
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:30,004  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
GET OFF!

417
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:37,079  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
All our good work, all that healing,
the good name of the Sisterhood -
you have destroyed everything.

418
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,472  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Go and play with a ball of string.
Everywhere - disease.

419
00:30:40,512 --> 00:30:43,470  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is the human world - sickness.

420
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,688  X1:078 X2:235 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE YOWLS

421
00:30:52,023 --> 00:30:53,581  X1:078 X2:263 Y1:488 Y2:523
THUD ECHOES

422
00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:57,815  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Move!

423
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:59,975  X1:078 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
ON PA: Maximum quarantine

424
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:01,863  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Divert all shuttles.

425
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:04,645  X1:102 X2:243 Y1:488 Y2:523
(Help us.)

426
00:31:04,685 --> 00:31:10,879  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
Now what do we do? Use the sonic
screwdriver. You mean this thing?
Yes, I mean that thing!

427
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,757  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
But I don't know how, that Doctor's
hidden away all his thoughts.

428
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:18,717  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
Cassandra, go back into me.
The Doctor can open it. Do it!
Hold on tight.

429
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:26,904  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, chavtastic again(!)

430
00:31:26,944 --> 00:31:29,862  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Open it! Not till you get out
of her. We need the Doctor.

431
00:31:29,902 --> 00:31:31,375  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
I order you to leave her!

432
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:38,334  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:416 Y2:523
No matter how difficult
the situation,
there is no need to shout.

433
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:40,486  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cassandra, get out of him!

434
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:44,547  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
But if I go into you, he
simply refuses. He's so rude.
I don't care, just do something!

435
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:47,573  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm so going to regret this.

436
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:55,392  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, sweet Lord(!) I look disgusting.

437
00:31:55,432 --> 00:31:57,551  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice to have you back.

438
00:31:57,591 --> 00:31:58,995  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
No you don't!

439
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:04,304  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
That was your last
warning, Cassandra.

440
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:06,238  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Inside her head. . .

441
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,818  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're so alone.

442
00:32:09,858 --> 00:32:13,675  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
They keep reaching out
just to hold us.

443
00:32:14,614 --> 00:32:18,710  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
All their lives,
and they've never been touched.

444
00:32:29,757 --> 00:32:32,055  X1:078 X2:333 Y1:488 Y2:523
BANGING ON DOOR

445
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:40,825  X1:078 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're safe, we're safe, we're safe!

446
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:43,262  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're clean, we're clean!
Look, look. Show me your skin.

447
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:50,455  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
Look, clean. Look. If we'd been
touched, we'd be dead. So how's it
going up here, what's the status?

448
00:32:50,495 --> 00:32:55,566  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
Silence from the other wards. I think
we're the only ones left. I've been
trying to override the quarantine.

449
00:32:55,606 --> 00:33:00,004  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
If I can trip a signal
over to New New York, they can send
a private executive squad. You can't.

450
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:04,918  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
If they forced entry, they'd break
quarantine. I'm not dying here! We
can't let a particle of disease out.

451
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:10,152  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
There's 10 million people in that
city. They'd all be at risk. Now
turn it off! Not if it gets me out.

452
00:33:10,192 --> 00:33:16,906  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
OK, fine. I have to stop you lot as
well. Suits me. Rose, Novice Hame,
everyone! . .Excuse me, your Grace.

453
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:20,387  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Get me the intravenous solutions
for every single disease. Move it!

454
00:33:34,365 --> 00:33:37,762  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
How's that? Will that do?
I don't know! Will it do for what?

455
00:33:37,802 --> 00:33:41,920  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
The lifts aren't working.
Not MOVING. Different thing.

456
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,016  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Here we go.
But you're not going to. . .

457
00:33:48,154 --> 00:33:49,990  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you think you're doing?

458
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,423  X1:078 X2:377 Y1:488 Y2:523
MUFFLED: Going down!

459
00:33:54,588 --> 00:33:56,228  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on.

460
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:58,142  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not in a million years.

461
00:33:58,182 --> 00:34:03,459  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
I need another pair of hands.
What do you think? If you're
so desperate to stay alive,

462
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,903  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
why don't you live a little?

463
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:07,294  X1:102 X2:291 Y1:488 Y2:523
Seal the door!

464
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:10,286  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
(Help. . . ! Please. . . !)

465
00:34:13,643 --> 00:34:15,361  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're completely mad.

466
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:18,641  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can see why she likes you.
Going down.

467
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,792  X1:078 X2:365 Y1:452 Y2:523
DOCTOR WHOOPS
CASSANDRA SCREAMS

468
00:34:32,226 --> 00:34:33,866  X1:078 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, that's one way to lose weight.

469
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,584  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now listen, when I say so
take hold of this lever.

470
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:38,180  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
But there's still a
quarantine down there, we can't. . .

471
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,778  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
HOLD THAT LEVER!
I'm cooking up a cocktail.

472
00:34:40,818 --> 00:34:43,110  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know a bit about medicine myself.

473
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:55,479  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now that lever's gonna resist,
but keep it in position.

474
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:00,690  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
Hold on to it with everything you've
got. What about you? I've got an
appointment. "The Doctor is in."

475
00:35:08,347 --> 00:35:11,544  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm in here. Come on.
Don't TELL them! Hold that lever.

476
00:35:13,741 --> 00:35:16,899  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come and get me, come on.
I'm in here, come on.

477
00:35:16,939 --> 00:35:21,689  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
LIFT: Commence stage one disinfection.
Hurry up, Come on!

478
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,408  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on. Come on.

479
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,638  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
All they want to do is pass it on.

480
00:35:34,678 --> 00:35:37,676  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
PASS IT ON! Pass on what?

481
00:35:37,716 --> 00:35:40,713  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Pass on what? PASS IT ON!

482
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:20,551  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
What did they pass on?
Did you kill them? All of them?

483
00:36:20,591 --> 00:36:23,998  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, that's YOUR way of doing things.

484
00:36:25,865 --> 00:36:28,732  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm the Doctor, and I cured them.

485
00:36:32,379 --> 00:36:35,255  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's right, h-hey!

486
00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:36,975  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
There we go, sweetheart.

487
00:36:37,015 --> 00:36:38,690  X1:328 X2:391 Y1:488 Y2:523
Eh?

488
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,726  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
You go to him,

489
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:43,524  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
go on, that's it,

490
00:36:43,564 --> 00:36:47,962  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's a new sub-species, Cassandra,
a brand new form of life.

491
00:36:48,002 --> 00:36:50,798  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
New humans. Look at them. Look!

492
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:59,188  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Run by cats,
kept in the dark, fed by tubes,
but completely, completely alive.

493
00:36:59,228 --> 00:37:01,486  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can't deny them,
cos you helped create them.

494
00:37:02,986 --> 00:37:06,701  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
The human race just keeps on going,
keeps on changing.

495
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:08,740  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Life will out!

496
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,378  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ha!

497
00:37:11,377 --> 00:37:14,694  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
'This is the NNYPD.
Please step away from the showers.'

498
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:18,245  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:416 Y2:523
'All staff will present
themselves to the officers
for immediate arrest.

499
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:20,806  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
'I repeat - immediate arrest.

500
00:37:20,846 --> 00:37:24,920  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
'All new life-forms will be
catalogued and taken into care.

501
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,713  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
'All visitors to the hospital
will be required to make
a statement to the NNYPD.'

502
00:37:30,753 --> 00:37:32,931  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Face of Boe!

503
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:45,065  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
You were supposed to be dying.

504
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:48,416  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
'There are better things to do
today. Dying can wait.'

505
00:37:48,456 --> 00:37:51,011  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, I hate telepathy.

506
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:55,087  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just what I need,
a headful of big face. Shh!

507
00:37:55,127 --> 00:37:59,763  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
'I had grown tired with
the universe, Doctor, but you
have taught me to look at it anew.'

508
00:37:59,803 --> 00:38:02,441  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
There are legends, you know,

509
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:05,238  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
saying that you're
millions of years old.

510
00:38:05,278 --> 00:38:08,074  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
That would be impossible.
Wouldn't it just(? )

511
00:38:08,114 --> 00:38:11,792  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
I got the impression there was
something you wanted to tell me.

512
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:15,386  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
The great secret.
So the legend says.

513
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:18,106  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
It can wait. Oh, does it have to?

514
00:38:18,146 --> 00:38:20,263  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
We shall meet again, Doctor.

515
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:22,860  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
For the third time,
for the last time.

516
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,057  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
And the truth shall be told.

517
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,900  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Until that day. . .

518
00:38:32,328 --> 00:38:34,524  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
That is enigmatic.

519
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:36,822  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
That. . . That is textbook enigmatic.

520
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,292  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
And now for you.

521
00:38:42,517 --> 00:38:44,756  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
But. . .everything's happy,

522
00:38:44,796 --> 00:38:48,153  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
everything's fine,
can't you just leave me?

523
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:49,950  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've lived long enough.

524
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,681  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Leave that body and end it,
Cassandra.

525
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:56,944  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't want to die.

526
00:38:56,984 --> 00:38:59,301  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
No-one does. Help me!

527
00:38:59,341 --> 00:39:01,061  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't. Mistress!

528
00:39:01,101 --> 00:39:03,139  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're alive!

529
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:06,570  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
I kept myself safe -
for you, mistress.

530
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,730  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
A body!

531
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:12,046  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
And not just that, a volunteer.

532
00:39:12,086 --> 00:39:18,601  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
Don't you dare! He's got a life of
his own. But I worship the mistress,
I welcome her. You can't, Cassandra.

533
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:20,080  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
You. . .

534
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,515  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
All right?

535
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:25,672  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whoa!

536
00:39:25,712 --> 00:39:27,196  X1:326 X2:393 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK?

537
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:29,744  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

538
00:39:31,545 --> 00:39:34,463  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello. Hello. Welcome back.

539
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:39,860  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Oh, sweet lord, I'm a walking
doodle. You can't stay in there.
I'm sorry, Cassandra, it's not fair.

540
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,810  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
I can take you to the city, they can
build you a skintank and you can
stand trial for what you've done.

541
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,087  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, that would be rather dramatic.

542
00:39:47,127 --> 00:39:51,405  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
Possibly my finest hour -
certainly my finest hat.
But I'm afraid we don't have time.

543
00:39:51,445 --> 00:39:58,316  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
Poor little Chip, he's only
a half-life, and he's been through
so much, his heart is racing so.

544
00:39:58,356 --> 00:40:01,228  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's failing.
I don't think he's going to last. . .

545
00:40:01,954 --> 00:40:03,433  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you all right? I'm fine.

546
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:11,667  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm dying, but that's fine.

547
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:15,339  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can take you to the city.

548
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,339  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, you won't.

549
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:19,412  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everything's new on this planet.

550
00:40:19,452 --> 00:40:21,300  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's no place
for Chip and me any more.

551
00:40:24,807 --> 00:40:28,698  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
You were right, Doctor,
it's time to die.

552
00:40:32,361 --> 00:40:33,885  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's good.

553
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:38,971  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come on.
There's one last thing I can do.

554
00:40:49,705 --> 00:40:52,460  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
For Bodeley's sake,
don't do that. He'll be livid.

555
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,294  X1:078 X2:389 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh no, don't! Stop it!
GIGGLES

556
00:40:57,334 --> 00:40:59,451  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's simply not true. Tiny!

557
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:02,127  X1:078 X2:351 Y1:488 Y2:523
Egypt was so dismal.

558
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:04,285  X1:078 X2:349 Y1:452 Y2:523
And the mosquitoes,
I can't tell you. . . . !

559
00:41:04,325 --> 00:41:09,642  X1:258 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thank you. Just go -
and don't look back.

560
00:41:09,682 --> 00:41:11,166  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good luck.

561
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,387  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
. .And if you actually see them,
you're shocked.

562
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:25,515  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
But don't quote me on that.

563
00:41:25,555 --> 00:41:27,262  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, you naughty people! A bientot.

564
00:41:27,302 --> 00:41:28,902  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Excuse me, the Lady Cassandra?

565
00:41:28,942 --> 00:41:32,899  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sorry, I don't need anything
right now, I'm fine, thank you.

566
00:41:32,939 --> 00:41:35,766  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, I just wanted to say.
You look beautiful.

567
00:41:36,932 --> 00:41:41,366  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, that's very kind,
you strange little thing.

568
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:44,517  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you very much. I mean it.

569
00:41:49,528 --> 00:41:52,474  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
You look. . .

570
00:41:52,514 --> 00:41:53,953  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
so beautiful.

571
00:41:58,509 --> 00:42:00,067  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

572
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:07,302  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, my Lord! Are you all right?
What is it, what's wrong?

573
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:10,457  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Someone get some help.
Call a medic or something,

574
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:13,941  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
quickly! Who is he?
I don't know, he just came up to me.

575
00:42:13,981 --> 00:42:16,728  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't even know his name.
He just collapsed.

576
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:20,135  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think he's dying!
Someone do something.

577
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:22,682  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got you, sweetheart.
It's all right.

578
00:42:22,722 --> 00:42:25,888  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
There you are. There you are. I've
got you.

579
00:42:25,928 --> 00:42:30,348  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
It'll be all right. There, there.
You poor little thing.

580
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:47,061  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:344 Y2:415
Might I introduce
Her Majesty, Queen Victoria?

581
00:42:53,173 --> 00:42:55,577  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Every full moon the howling
rings through the valley.

582
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:57,964  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is a man who becomes an animal.

583
00:42:58,004 --> 00:43:00,964  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
A werewolf?
It can't be an actual wolf.

584
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:02,443  X1:494 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
GROWLS

585
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:09,525  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
THERE!

586
00:43:09,565 --> 00:43:11,857  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bullets can't stop it.
