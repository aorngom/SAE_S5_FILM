1
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:13,604  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:344 Y2:415
I wonder what's wrong with her.
She's sort of queasy.

2
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:15,838  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:344 Y2:415
Indigestion.
Like she didn't want to land.

3
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:20,548  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
If you think there's gonna be
trouble, we could always get back
inside and go somewhere else.

4
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:28,945  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think we've landed
inside a cupboard. Here we go.

5
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:31,503  X1:078 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
SYNTHESISED VOICE: 'Open door 15.'
WIND HOWLS

6
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:34,780  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Some sort of base.
Moon base, sea base, space base.

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,218  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
They build these things out of kits.
Glad we're indoors.

8
00:00:37,258 --> 00:00:39,777  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sounds like a storm out there.

9
00:00:39,817 --> 00:00:41,897  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Open door 16.'

10
00:00:41,937 --> 00:00:44,211  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Human design
you've got a thing about kits.

11
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:48,092  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's put together like a flatpack
wardrobe, only bigger. And easier.

12
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:49,884  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Open door 17.'

13
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,799  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, it's a sanctuary base!

14
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:56,235  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
'Close door 17'
Deep space exploration. We've gone
way out. And listen to that.

15
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:59,398  X1:078 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
CONTINUOUS WHIRRING
Underneath. Someone's drilling.

16
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:04,271  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
"Welcome to hell".
Oh, it's not that bad.

17
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:05,795  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, over there.

18
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:13,275  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hold on. What does that say?

19
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,412  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's weird. It won't translate.

20
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:24,813  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thought the Tardis translated
everything, writing as well.

21
00:01:24,853 --> 00:01:27,527  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
I should see English. Exactly.

22
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:31,079  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
And if that's not working,
then it means

23
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,459  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
this writing is OLD. Very old.

24
00:01:36,832 --> 00:01:38,352  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Impossibly old.

25
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:40,149  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
We should find out who's in charge.

26
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:43,311  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've gone beyond the reach of the
Tardis' knowledge. Not a good move.

27
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,266  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
If someone's looking, we
shouldn't. . . Oh!

28
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:50,940  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right. Hello.
Sorry. I was just saying, nice base.

29
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,937  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
We must feed. You've got to what?

30
00:01:53,977 --> 00:01:58,372  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
We must feed. Yeah
I think they mean us. We must feed.

31
00:01:58,412 --> 00:02:01,967  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
We must feed. We must feed.

32
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:04,406  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
We must feed.

33
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:07,404  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
We must feed. We must feed.

34
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:13,914  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
IN UNISON: We must feed. We must
feed. We must feed. We must feed.
We must feed.

35
00:02:13,954 --> 00:02:17,645  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
We must feed. We must feed.
We must feed. . .

36
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,647  X1:078 X2:469 Y1:452 Y2:523
We must feed. . .
GLOBE RATTLES

37
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,395  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
. .you, if you are hungry.

38
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,464  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:344 Y2:379
Sorry? We apologise.

39
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:07,582  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:344 Y2:415
Electromagnetics have interfered
with speech systems.

40
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:10,098  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:344 Y2:379
Would you like some refreshment?

41
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:12,430  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um. . . 'Open door 18.'

42
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:15,904  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell?

43
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,129  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
How did. . . ?

44
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,715  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Captain, you're not gonna believe
this. We've got people.

45
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:29,875  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
Out of nowhere. I mean real people.

46
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:36,070  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
I mean two living people, just
standing here right in front of me.

47
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,105  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Don't be stupid.
That's impossible.'

48
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:40,063  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
I suggest telling them that.

49
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:42,102  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
But you're a space base.

50
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:44,418  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
You must have visitors.
It can't be that impossible.

51
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:48,777  X1:142 X2:603 Y1:416 Y2:523
Are you telling me you don't know where you are?
No idea! More fun, that way!

52
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:51,254  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Stand by, everyone.
Buckle down. We have incoming.

53
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:55,288  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
'And it's a big one.
Quake 0.5 on its way.'

54
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:57,164  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Through here. Now.

55
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,688  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Quickly! Come on. Move!

56
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:08,181  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Keep moving!
Keep moving! Come on! Move it!

57
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:24,938  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God, you meant it.

58
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:27,575  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
People. Look at that! Real people!

59
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:30,173  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's us. Hooray!
Yeah, definitely real.

60
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:34,087  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
My name's Rose,
Rose Tyler, and this is the Doctor.

61
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:37,124  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on, the oxygen must be offline.

62
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:40,877  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're hallucinating, they
can't be. . . No, they're real!

63
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:42,755  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come on,
we're in the middle of an alert.

64
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:44,555  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Danny, strap up,
the quake's coming in.

65
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:49,749  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Impact in 30 seconds. . .Sorry, you
two, whoever you are, just hold on.

66
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,867  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tight! Hold on to what? Anything.
I don't care, just hold on.

67
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:54,783  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ood, are we fixed?

68
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:57,703  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Your kindness in this emergency
is much appreciated.

69
00:04:57,743 --> 00:05:02,288  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
What's this planet called, anyway?
Don't be stupid. It hasn't got
a name. How could it have a name?

70
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:06,991  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
You really don't know, do you?
And. . .impact!

71
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:13,737  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, well. That wasn't so. . .

72
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:28,242  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's it. Everyone all right?

73
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:32,463  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Speak to me, Ida? Yeah, yeah.

74
00:05:32,503 --> 00:05:34,782  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Danny? Fine. Toby?

75
00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:37,459  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Fine. Scooti?
No damage. Jefferson? Check!

76
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:40,059  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're fine, thanks.
Don't worry about us.

77
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:44,131  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Surface caved in. I deflected it
onto Storage five through eight,

78
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:45,890  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
we've lost them completely.

79
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,490  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Toby, go and check the rocket link.

80
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,683  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's not my department.

81
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:52,363  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just do as I say, yeah?

82
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:54,786  X1:078 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
METAL CREAKS AND GROANS

83
00:05:57,318 --> 00:06:01,232  X1:078 X2:513 Y1:416 Y2:523
Oxygen holding.
METALLIC CREAKS
Internal gravity at 56.6.

84
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:03,112  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
We should be OK.

85
00:06:03,152 --> 00:06:05,749  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
Never mind the earthquake, that's. . .

86
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:09,225  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's one hell of a storm.
What is that, a hurricane?

87
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:14,061  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
You need an atmosphere for a
hurricane. There's no air out there.
It's a complete vacuum.

88
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:17,538  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then what's shaking the roof?
You're not joking.

89
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:21,054  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
You really don't know. Well.

90
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:22,851  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Introductions!

91
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:28,641  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
FYI, as they said in the olden days,
I'm Ida Scott, Science Officer.

92
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:31,920  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
Zachary Cross Flane,
Acting Captain, sir!

93
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,357  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
You've met Mr Jefferson,
he's Head of Security.
Danny Bartock, Ethics Committee.

94
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,235  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not as boring as it sounds.

95
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:43,628  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
And that man who just left, that's
Toby Zed, Archaeology, and this. . .

96
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:47,345  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
Scooti Manista, Trainee Maintenance,

97
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:49,438  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
and this. . .

98
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:53,498  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is home.

99
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,336  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Brace yourselves.

100
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:57,475  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
The sight of it
sends some people mad.

101
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,947  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's a black hole.

102
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:23,946  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's impossible. . .

103
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:27,383  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
I did warn you.
We're standing under a black hole!

104
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:29,620  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
In orbit. We can't be.

105
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,872  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can see for yourself.
We're in orbit.

106
00:07:33,698 --> 00:07:35,298  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
But we can't be.

107
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:40,965  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
"This lump of rock is suspended
in perpetual geostationary orbit
around that black hole

108
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:42,923  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
"without falling in

109
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,043  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
"discuss" (!)

110
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,886  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
And that's bad, yeah?

111
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,834  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
Bad doesn't cover it. A black hole's
a dead star, it collapses in
on itself, in and in and in,

112
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:57,032  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:416 Y2:523
until the matter's so dense
and tight it starts to pull
everything else in too.

113
00:07:57,072 --> 00:07:59,148  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nothing in the universe
can escape it.

114
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:03,905  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Light, gravity, time
everything gets pulled inside.

115
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:05,942  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
And crushed.

116
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:08,138  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
So there can't be an orbit?

117
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:10,296  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
We should be pulled right in?

118
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:12,097  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
We should be dead. And yet

119
00:08:12,137 --> 00:08:13,852  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
here we are,

120
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:17,210  X1:078 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
beyond the laws of physics.
THUDS AND CREAKS

121
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,445  X1:078 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Welcome on board. But if there's no
atmosphere out there, what's that?

122
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,841  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stars breaking up.

123
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:25,441  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gas clouds.

124
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:30,115  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
We have whole solar systems
being ripped apart above our heads,

125
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:32,591  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
before falling into that thing.

126
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:34,589  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
So a bit worse than a storm, then?

127
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:36,398  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just a bit. Just a bit, yeah.

128
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,158  X1:078 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
WHISPERY ECHO: Toby y y y. . .

129
00:08:57,407 --> 00:09:00,319  X1:078 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
ELECTRICS FIZZ AND POP

130
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,559  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who's that?

131
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:09,318  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Danny?

132
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:18,773  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Close Door one.'
The rocket link's fine.

133
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:26,775  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's the black hole,
officially designated K 3 7 Gem 5.

134
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:29,254  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
In the scriptures of the Veltino,

135
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:33,809  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
this planet's called Krop Tor. . .
The bitter pill.

136
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:41,199  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
And the black hole is supposed
to be a mighty demon who was
tricked into devouring the planet

137
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:43,317  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
only to spit it out

138
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:44,836  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
because it was poison.

139
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,192  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
"The Bitter Pill." I like that.

140
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:49,031  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're so far out.

141
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:52,431  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Lost in the drifts of the universe.
How did you even get here?

142
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:55,387  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
We flew in, d'you see?

143
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:58,701  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
This planet's generating
a gravity field.

144
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:00,859  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
We don't know how, we've no idea.

145
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,657  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
But it's kept in constant balance
against the black hole.

146
00:10:04,697 --> 00:10:08,093  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
And the field extends out there,

147
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:10,847  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
as a funnel, a distinct. . .

148
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:14,844  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
gravity funnel, reaching out into
clear space. That was our way in.

149
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:17,120  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
You flew down that thing?

150
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,679  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like a rollercoaster.

151
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,318  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
By rights, the ship
should've been torn apart.

152
00:10:21,358 --> 00:10:24,474  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
We lost the captain,
which is what put me in charge.

153
00:10:24,514 --> 00:10:27,869  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
And you're doing a good job.
Yeah, well. Needs must.

154
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:31,904  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
But if that gravity funnel closes,
there's no way out.

155
00:10:31,944 --> 00:10:34,264  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, we have fun
speculating about that.

156
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:36,503  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, that's the word, fun.

157
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:40,657  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
But that field would take
phenomenal amounts of power.

158
00:10:40,697 --> 00:10:42,894  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not just big, but off the scale!

159
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,054  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can I?

160
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:46,056  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sure, help yourself.

161
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:50,885  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Your refreshment.

162
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:53,041  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you!

163
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:55,040  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry, what was your name?

164
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,119  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
We have no titles.

165
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,595  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
We are as one.

166
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:02,634  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um. . . What are they called?

167
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:05,869  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, come on! Where've you
been living? Everyone's got one!

168
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:08,346  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, not me. So what are they?

169
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:10,785  X1:078 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're the Ood.
The Ood?

170
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:14,902  X1:078 X2:449 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Ood.
That's. . .Ood.

171
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,217  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Very Ood. But handy!

172
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:23,208  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
They work the mineshaft, all the
drilling and stuff, supervision
and maintenance. They're born for it.

173
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:26,287  X1:078 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
Basic slave race.
You've got slaves?

174
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:28,364  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't start! She's like one of
that lot, the Friends of the Ood.

175
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:32,040  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, maybe I am, yeah.
Since when did humans need slaves?

176
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,998  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
But the Ood offer themselves.

177
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:38,193  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you don't give them orders,
they just pine away and die.

178
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:41,713  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Seriously?
You like being ordered about?

179
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:44,508  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:452 Y2:523
It is all we crave.
Why's that, then?

180
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:46,106  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
We have nothing else in life.

181
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:49,267  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, well.
I used to think like that.

182
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:52,504  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Long time ago.
There we go! D'you see?

183
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:54,580  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
To generate that gravity field and
the funnel you need a power source

184
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,650  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
with an inverted self extrapolating
reflex of six to the power of six
every six seconds. All the sixes.

185
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,247  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
And it's impossible. It took us
two years to work that out.

186
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:03,846  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm very good.

187
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:06,005  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
But that's why we're here.

188
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:10,760  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
This power source is ten miles
below, through solid rock.

189
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,037  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Point Zero. We're drilling down
to try and find it.

190
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:18,353  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's giving off readings of over
90 Statts on the Blazen Scale. It
could revolutionise modern science.

191
00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:20,110  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
We could use it to fuel the Empire.

192
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,788  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or start a war.

193
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:25,944  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's buried beneath us. . .
In the darkness. Waiting.

194
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:26,944  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's your job?

195
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:28,344  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Chief dramatist?

196
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:32,338  X1:218 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
Whatever it is down there,
it's not a natural phenomenon.

197
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,176  X1:208 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
This planet once supported life,

198
00:12:34,216 --> 00:12:37,489  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
aeons ago, before the human race
had even learned to walk.

199
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:41,728  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
I saw that lettering on the wall.
Did you do that? I copied it
from fragments we've found,

200
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:45,642  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
unearthed by the drilling. I can't
translate it. No, neither can I.

201
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,837  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
And that's saying something. There
was some form of civilisation.

202
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:54,036  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
They buried something.
And now it's reaching out,

203
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:57,311  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
calling us in. And you came.

204
00:12:57,351 --> 00:12:59,509  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
How could we not?

205
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:03,067  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
So when it comes right down to it,
why did you come here?

206
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:04,903  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why did you do that? Why?

207
00:13:04,943 --> 00:13:06,981  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll tell you why.

208
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:10,021  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Because it was there! Brilliant!

209
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:11,778  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Scuse me. . . Er, Zack, wasn't it?

210
00:13:11,818 --> 00:13:17,169  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's me. Just stand there, cos I'm
gonna. . .HUG you. Is that all right?

211
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:19,797  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Suppose so. Here we go. Coming in.

212
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:26,178  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Human beings. You are amazing!

213
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,997  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

214
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:35,951  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
Not at all. You're also completely
mad. You should pack your bags, get
on that ship and fly for your lives!

215
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:38,427  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can talk.
How the hell did YOU get here?

216
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,306  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've got this. . .

217
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:44,221  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Um. . .this. . .ship. It's hard to
explain, it just sort of appears.

218
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:49,697  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
We can show you. We parked
down the corridor from uh. . . What's
it called? Habitation Area. . .

219
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:50,777  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Three. Three.

220
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:52,850  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
D'you mean Storage Six?

221
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,372  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523

00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,592  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
It just eats.

337
00:22:59,632 --> 00:23:01,640  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Long way from home.

338
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,703  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go that way.

339
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:08,860  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Turn right. Keep going for, er. . .

340
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,025  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
about 500 years,
then you'll reach the Earth.

341
00:23:17,492 --> 00:23:21,250  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
No signal. That's the first time
we've gone out of range.

342
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,854  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mind you, even if I could. . .

343
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,327  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
What would I tell her?

344
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,613  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can you build another Tardis?

345
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:35,434  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
They were grown, not built.

346
00:23:35,474 --> 00:23:37,686  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
And with my home planet gone. . .

347
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:41,188  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
we're kind of stuck.

348
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:44,983  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, could be worse.
This lot said they'd give us a lift.

349
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:49,817  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
And then what? I dunno.

350
00:23:49,857 --> 00:23:51,377  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Find a planet.

351
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:53,013  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get a job. Live a life.

352
00:23:53,053 --> 00:23:55,011  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Same as the rest of the universe.

353
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:57,890  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'd have to settle down.

354
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,608  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Get a house or something.
A proper house with. . .

355
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,605  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doors and things. Carpets.

356
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:06,081  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
Me! Living in a house! Now, THAT. . .

357
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:08,598  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
That. . . That is terrifying!

358
00:24:08,638 --> 00:24:13,393  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
You'd have to get a mortgage!
No! Oh, yes! I'm dying.
That's it, I'm dying, it's all over.

359
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:16,114  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
What about me?
I'd have to get one, too!

360
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:20,743  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I dunno, could be the same one,
we could both. . .

361
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:23,540  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
I dunno, share.

362
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,898  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or not. Whatever. I dunno.

363
00:24:25,938 --> 00:24:28,640  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
All sorts of. . . Anyway! We'll see.

364
00:24:32,531 --> 00:24:35,034  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I promised Jackie
I'd always take you back home.

365
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:40,207  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everyone leaves home in the end.

366
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:42,963  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not to end up stuck here.

367
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:48,076  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, but stuck with you,
that's not so bad. . .Yeah?

368
00:24:48,116 --> 00:24:49,156  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes.

369
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,193  X1:078 X2:271 Y1:488 Y2:523
MOBILE RINGS

370
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,401  X1:078 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
DEEP VOICE: He is awake.

371
00:25:05,017 --> 00:25:06,577  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Evening!

372
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:08,773  X1:078 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
Only us.
The mysterious couple.

373
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:13,009  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
How are you, then, settling in?
Yeah, sorry, straight to business.
The Ood,

374
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:18,564  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
how do they communicate? I mean,
with each other. Oh, just empaths.

375
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:21,644  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's a low level
telepathic field connecting them.

376
00:25:21,684 --> 00:25:27,834  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
Not that that does THEM much good,
they're basically a herd race. Like
cattle. This telepathic field,

377
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:34,104  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
can it pick up messages? Cos I was
having dinner and one of the Ood
said something. . .well, odd.

378
00:25:34,144 --> 00:25:38,901  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
An odd Ood. And then I got
something else on my er. . .

379
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:41,858  X1:198 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
Communicator thing.
Well, be fair.

380
00:25:41,898 --> 00:25:46,293  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've got whole star systems
burning up around us.

381
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:50,649  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's all sorts of stray
transmissions. Probably nothing.

382
00:25:50,689 --> 00:25:54,326  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look, if there was
something wrong, it would show.

383
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:58,601  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
We monitor the telepathic field.
It's the only way to look after them.

384
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:02,758  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're so stupid, they don't
even tell us when they're ill.

385
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:05,155  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:452 Y2:523
Monitor the field.
That's this thing?

386
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:08,232  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, but like I said,
it's low level telepathy.

387
00:26:08,272 --> 00:26:10,189  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
They only register basic 5.

388
00:26:10,229 --> 00:26:12,817  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's not basic 5. 10. . .

389
00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:15,506  X1:320 X2:399 Y1:488 Y2:523
20. . .

390
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:18,460  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
They've gone up to basic 30.

391
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,098  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
But they can't!
Doctor, the Ood.

392
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,891  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
What does basic 30 mean?

393
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:30,368  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
It means that they're shouting.
Screaming inside their heads.

394
00:26:30,408 --> 00:26:32,845  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or something's shouting at them.

395
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,962  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
But where's it coming from?
What's it saying?

396
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:39,960  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
What did it say to you? Something
about the "beast" and the "pit".

397
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,747  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
What about your communicator,
what did that say?

398
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:46,871  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
"He is awake."

399
00:26:46,911 --> 00:26:49,425  X1:158 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
ALL OOD: And you will worship him.

400
00:26:49,465 --> 00:26:52,225  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell? He is awake.

401
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:54,662  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
And you will worship him.

402
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:56,311  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Worship who?

403
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:00,933  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who's talking to you? Who is it?

404
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:03,561  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Toby, I've got your expenditure.

405
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,087  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Open door 41.'

406
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,214  X1:078 X2:461 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Close Door 41.'
DOOR MECHANISM HISSES

407
00:27:13,002 --> 00:27:14,122  X1:324 X2:393 Y1:488 Y2:523
41? !

408
00:27:14,162 --> 00:27:16,454  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Close Door 40.'

409
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,475  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Computer, did you open
and close Door 41? 'Confirmed.'

410
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:25,029  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
But. . .that's the airlock.
Why would you open the airlock?

411
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:26,709  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's the night shift,
we're not allowed outside.

412
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:30,063  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
Has someone gone out? 'Confirmed.'

413
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:32,805  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
But who was it? 'Cannot confirm.'

414
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,974  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK. Right, hold on, I know. Tell me
whose space suit's been logged out.

415
00:27:38,014 --> 00:27:45,088  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
'No space suit has been logged out.'
But. . . You're not making any sense.
You can't go outside without. . .

416
00:27:45,128 --> 00:27:50,443  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
Zack, I think we've got a breakdown
on Door 41, it's saying somebody's
gone out onto the planet's surface.

417
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:53,200  X1:078 X2:403 Y1:452 Y2:523
STATIC HISS
Zack?

418
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,394  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Zack?

419
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,238  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Computer, trace fault.
'There is no fault.'

420
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:00,914  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
Tell me, who went through that door?

421
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:02,988  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
'He is awake.'

422
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:05,286  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
What? 'He is awake.'

423
00:28:06,783 --> 00:28:11,129  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's that supposed to mean?
'He bathes in the black sun.'

424
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,959  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Toby?

425
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:37,951  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's no air, there's no. . .

426
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,282  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
No! Stop it! You can't be.

427
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:13,074  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Open door 40!
Open door 40! Open door 40!

428
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:15,674  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
OPEN DOOR 40!

429
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,437  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Open door 40! Open. . .

430
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:24,900  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Emergency, hull breach.'

431
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,540  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Emergency, hull breach.
Emergency, hull breach.'

432
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,891  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Which section? Everyone, evacuate
11 to 13. We've got a breach.

433
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:38,442  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Base is open, repeat,
the Base is open!

434
00:29:42,486 --> 00:29:44,909  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Open door 19.'

435
00:29:46,482 --> 00:29:48,599  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Close Door 19.'

436
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:53,952  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can't contain the oxygen field,
we're gonna lose it! COME ON!

437
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,954  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
KEEP MOVING!

438
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:59,074  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
And you, sunshine, get in!

439
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:04,419  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Breach sealed. Breach sealed.'
What happened? What was it?

440
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:07,775  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hull breach. We were open
to the elements.

441
00:30:07,815 --> 00:30:13,213  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
Another minute, we'd be inspecting
that black hole close up. That
wasn't a quake. What caused it?

442
00:30:13,253 --> 00:30:17,526  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've lost sections 11 to 13.
Everyone all right?

443
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,284  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
We've got everyone except Scooti.

444
00:30:20,324 --> 00:30:21,603  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Scooti, report.

445
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:26,078  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Scooti Manista, this is an order.

00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:30,235  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
She's all right, I've picked up her
biochip, she's in habitation three.

447
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:34,066  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:416 Y2:523
Better go and check.
If she's not responding,
she might be unconscious.

448
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:37,622  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:488 Y2:523
But how about that, eh? We survived!

449
00:30:37,662 --> 00:30:42,700  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Habitation three, come on.
I don't often say this, but I think
we could all do with a drink.

450
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,420  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on.

451
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:50,570  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
What happened? I I don't know.
I was working, and then
I can't remember.

452
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:54,448  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
A All that noise. The room was
falling apart. There was no air. . .

453
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:58,123  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come on. Up you get,
come and have some protein 1.

454
00:30:58,163 --> 00:31:03,359  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
Ooh! You've gone native. Oi,
don't knock it, it's nice.
Protein 1 with just a dash of '3.

455
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:07,154  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Check habitation four. . . There's
no sign, but the biochip says
she's in this area.

456
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:12,825  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Scooti, please respond. If you
can hear this, please respond.
Habitation six? Nowhere here. . .

457
00:31:12,865 --> 00:31:14,985  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Zack, we've got a problem,
Scooti's still missing.

458
00:31:15,025 --> 00:31:17,062  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
ZACK: But it says habitation three.

459
00:31:17,102 --> 00:31:19,659  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, well that's where I am, and
I'm telling you, she's not here.

460
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:22,538  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've found her.

461
00:31:22,578 --> 00:31:23,846  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

462
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,983  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

467
00:31:54,064 --> 00:31:55,952  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
She was 20.

00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,973  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523

475
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,999  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
What was it? The drill.

476
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:49,643  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've stopped drilling.
We've made it. Point Zero.

480
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:01,870  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bring systems online now!

481
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:07,823  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Reporting as volunteer for the
expeditionary force, sir! Doctor,
this breaks every single protocol.

482
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:11,461  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
We don't even know who you are.
Yeah, but you trust me, don't you?

483
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:16,538  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
And you can't let Ida go down there
on her own. Go on.

484
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:20,371  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look me in the eye.
Yes, you do. I can see it. Trust.

485
00:33:20,411 --> 00:33:26,605  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
I should be going down. The captain
doesn't lead the mission.
He stays here, in charge.

486
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:28,903  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not much good at it, am I?

487
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,357  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Positions! We're going down in two!

488
00:33:34,397 --> 00:33:36,634  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everyone, positions!

489
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:39,591  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Jefferson,
I want maximum systems. . .

490
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:43,226  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oxygen. Nitrobalance. Gravity.
It's ages since I wore one of these.

491
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:47,583  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
I want that spacesuit back in
one piece, you got that? Yes, sir.

492
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:54,504  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
S'funny, cos, people back home think
that space travel's gonna be all. . .

493
00:33:54,544 --> 00:33:56,052  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
whizzing about and. . .

494
00:33:56,092 --> 00:33:58,395  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
teleports, anti gravity.

495
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:02,207  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
But it's not, is it? It's tough.

496
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:04,050  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll see you later.

497
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,263  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not if I see you first.

498
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:16,750  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
You will remain here.

499
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,827  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
No command can override this.

500
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,984  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Have you got that?

501
00:34:22,024 --> 00:34:25,511  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
My instructions only.

502
00:34:28,421 --> 00:34:30,673  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523

507
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:32,385  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've gone beyond the oxygen field.
You're on your own.

508
00:35:41,148 --> 00:35:42,699  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't forget to breathe.

509
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:44,619  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Breathing's good.

510
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:47,816  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose, stay off the comm. No chance.

Doctor?

513
00:36:19,782 --> 00:36:22,017  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor, are you all right?

514
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:26,214  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ida. Report to me. . .Doctor?

515
00:36:26,254 --> 00:36:29,490  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's all right. We've made it. We're
getting out of the capsule now.

516
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:37,443  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
'What's it like down there?'

517
00:36:37,483 --> 00:36:40,043  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hard to tell.

518
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:44,273  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Some sort of. . .cave, cavern.
It's massive.

519
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:46,031  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
This should help.

520
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,635  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gravity globe.

521
00:36:56,221 --> 00:36:59,668  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's. . . That's. . .

522
00:37:01,496 --> 00:37:04,659  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God. That's beautiful.

523
00:37:06,253 --> 00:37:07,413  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose. . .

524
00:37:07,453 --> 00:37:09,426  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
You can tell Toby. . .

525
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:13,713  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
we've found his civilisation.

526
00:37:15,564 --> 00:37:18,996  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oi, Toby, sounds like
you've got plenty of work.

527
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,315  X1:078 X2:367 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good, good. . . . Good.

528
00:37:22,355 --> 00:37:28,467  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
Concentrate now, people,
keep on the mission. Ida,
what about the power source?

529
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:32,343  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're close. Energy signature
indicates north north west.

530
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:36,061  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you getting pictures up there?

531
00:37:36,101 --> 00:37:37,738  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Too much interference.

532
00:37:37,778 --> 00:37:39,298  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're in your hands.

533
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:43,252  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, we've come this far.
There's no turning back.

534
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:46,532  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, did you have to?
"No turning back"? !

535
00:37:46,572 --> 00:37:49,525  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's almost as bad as
"nothing can possibly go wrong", or,

536
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:54,519  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
"It's gonna be the best Christmas
Walford's ever had". Have you
finished(?)

537
00:37:55,836 --> 00:37:57,690  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah. I've finished.

538
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:09,942  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Captain, sir, there's something
happening with the Ood.

539
00:38:09,982 --> 00:38:11,982  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are they doing?

540
00:38:12,022 --> 00:38:16,257  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're staring at me. I've told
them to stop, but they won't.

541
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:20,533  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Danny, you're a big boy, I think
you can take being stared at.

542
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:26,527  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
But the telepathic field, sir,
it's at basic 100. I've checked,

543
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:28,485  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
but there isn't any fault.

544
00:38:28,525 --> 00:38:30,684  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's definitely 100.

545
00:38:30,724 --> 00:38:33,119  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
But that's impossible.
What's basic 100 mean?

546
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:36,440  X1:138 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
They should be dead.
Basic 100 is brain death.

547
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,512  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
But they're safe?
They're not actually moving?

548
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:41,190  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, sir. Keep watching them.

549
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:46,467  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
And you, Jefferson, keep a guard
on the Ood. Officer at arms.

550
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:49,145  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can't fire a gun in here.
What if you hit a wall?

551
00:38:49,185 --> 00:38:55,095  X1:150 X2:613 Y1:416 Y2:523
Firing stock 15 only impacts upon
organics. Keep watch! Guard them!
Yes, sir.

552
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:58,176  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is everything all right up there?
Yeah, yeah. It's fine(!)

553
00:38:58,216 --> 00:38:59,211  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Great!

554
00:39:03,129 --> 00:39:05,169  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
We've found something.

555
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,603  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
It looks like metal,
like some sort of seal

556
00:39:08,643 --> 00:39:12,598  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got a nasty feeling
the word might be "trapdoor".

557
00:39:12,638 --> 00:39:15,952  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not a good word, "trapdoor".
Never met a trapdoor I liked.

558
00:39:15,992 --> 00:39:21,710  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
The edge is covered with those
symbols. D'you think it opens?
That's what trapdoors tend to do.

559
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,946  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Trapdoor doesn't do it justice.
It's massive, Zack.

560
00:39:24,986 --> 00:39:28,503  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
About 30 feet in diameter.

561
00:39:28,543 --> 00:39:33,256  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Any way of opening it? Don't know.
I can't see any sort of mechanism.

562
00:39:33,296 --> 00:39:36,377  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
I suppose that's the writing.
It'll tell us what to do.

563
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:39,371  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
The letters that defy translation.

564
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:41,410  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Toby, did you get anywhere
decoding it?

565
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:44,885  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Toby, they need to know that
lettering, does it make any sense?

566
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:47,802  X1:078 X2:463 Y1:452 Y2:523
I know what it says.
Then tell them!

567
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:50,876  X1:078 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
When did you work that out?
Just tell them!

568
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:54,791  X1:078 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
DEEP VOICE: These are the words
of the Beast.

569
00:39:54,831 --> 00:40:02,305  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
And he has woken. He is the heart
that beats in the darkness, he is
the blood that will never cease.

570
00:40:02,345 --> 00:40:04,942  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
And now he will rise.

571
00:40:04,982 --> 00:40:08,019  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Officer, you will stand down.
Stand down!

572
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:10,216  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
What is it? What's he done?
What's happening?

573
00:40:10,256 --> 00:40:11,855  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose? What going on?

574
00:40:11,895 --> 00:40:15,570  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jefferson, report. . . ! Report!

575
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,926  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523
Officer, you've compromised security.
You will stand down and be confined
immediately!

576
00:40:19,966 --> 00:40:22,924  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Jefferson, tell me, sir. . .

577
00:40:22,964 --> 00:40:25,427  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
did your wife ever forgive you?

578
00:40:27,038 --> 00:40:28,837  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't know what you mean.

579
00:40:28,877 --> 00:40:32,978  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Let me tell you a secret.
She never did.

580
00:40:34,752 --> 00:40:38,667  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Officer! You will stand down
and be confined!

581
00:40:38,707 --> 00:40:40,627  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or what?

582
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:43,583  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Under Condition Red,
I'm authorised to shoot you.

583
00:40:43,623 --> 00:40:46,416  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
But how many can you kill?

584
00:41:05,557 --> 00:41:09,434  X1:078 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
IN UNISON: We are
the Legion of the Beast.

585
00:41:09,474 --> 00:41:13,388  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose? What is it, Rose?

586
00:41:13,428 --> 00:41:17,346  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm going back up.
ZACK: Report! Report!

587
00:41:17,386 --> 00:41:18,942  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jefferson, report!

588
00:41:18,982 --> 00:41:21,399  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
SOMEONE REPORT!

589
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:27,976  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Legion shall be many,
and the Legion shall be few.

590
00:41:28,016 --> 00:41:29,773  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's the Ood.

591
00:41:29,813 --> 00:41:32,850  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sir, we have contamination
of the livestock.

592
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,928  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doctor, I don't know what it is.
It's like they're possessed.

593
00:41:34,968 --> 00:41:37,244  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
They won't listen to us.

594
00:41:37,284 --> 00:41:42,078  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
He has woven himself
through the fabric of your life

595
00:41:42,118 --> 00:41:44,154  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
since the dawn of time.

596
00:41:44,194 --> 00:41:49,708  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Some may call him Abbadon,
some may call him Krop Tor.

597
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:52,387  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Some may call him Satan or. . .

598
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,786  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Captain, it's the Ood.
They're out of control!

599
00:41:54,826 --> 00:41:57,183  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
. .King Of Despair,

600
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:02,223  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
the Deathless Prince,
the Bringer of Night.

601
00:42:04,815 --> 00:42:08,785  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
These are the words
that shall set him free.

602
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:14,685  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Back up to the door!
I am become manifest.

603
00:42:14,725 --> 00:42:17,280  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
I shall walk in the light.
To the door!

604
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,115  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
And my legions will swarm. . .
Get out! . .across the worlds.

605
00:42:30,189 --> 00:42:31,872  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor!

606
00:42:32,945 --> 00:42:34,788  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's opening!

607
00:42:36,979 --> 00:42:39,019  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're moving!

608
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:43,274  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
The whole thing's moving,
the planet's moving!

609
00:43:02,472 --> 00:43:05,030  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
I am the sin
and the temptation

610
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,347  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
and the desire.

611
00:43:07,387 --> 00:43:11,408  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
I am the pain and the loss and the
death of hope. Get that door open!

612
00:43:20,254 --> 00:43:22,972  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
The gravity field, it's going!

613
00:43:23,012 --> 00:43:25,884  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're losing orbit!

614
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:29,986  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're gonna fall
into the black hole!

615
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:37,445  X1:078 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
DEEP VOICE:
I have been imprisoned for eternity,

616
00:43:38,597 --> 00:43:40,192  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
But no more.

617
00:43:40,232 --> 00:43:41,232  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Door seal.'

618
00:43:41,272 --> 00:43:42,836  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Move! 'Door seal.'

619
00:43:44,909 --> 00:43:46,433  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Pit is open.

620
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,662  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I am free.

621
00:43:50,702 --> 00:43:52,186  X1:078 X2:237 Y1:488 Y2:523
EVIL LAUGH

622
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:17,532  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523

623
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:50,214  X1:078 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's the Ood they've gone mad.

624
00:44:52,915 --> 00:44:56,472  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doctor, can you hear me?
Doctor, Ida, are you there?

625
00:44:56,512 --> 00:44:59,953  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Danny, turn right. That thing
is playing on very basic fears.

626
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:05,508  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
The cable's snapped. Get out!

627
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,432  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
You will die. And I will live.
