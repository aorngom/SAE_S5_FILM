1
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:49,531  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maeve? You OK?

2
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:51,646  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, love. I'm not.

3
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:53,286  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
You want me to call a doctor?

4
00:00:53,326 --> 00:00:55,046  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor can't help.

5
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:58,916  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can't...can't you feel it, Trish?

6
00:00:58,956 --> 00:01:00,645  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't feel anything.

7
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:04,710  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Boys... get indoors!

8
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,111  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get inside! Get 'em inside!

9
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:11,377  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's up with you? They ain't doing
nothing wrong. It's happening again!

10
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:15,702  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:487
# ..in the old gum tree

11
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:20,138  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
# Merry, merry king of the bush
is he

12
00:01:20,178 --> 00:01:24,173  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
# Laugh, kookaburra
Laugh, kookaburra

13
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:27,415  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Gay your life must be. #

14
00:01:33,044 --> 00:01:35,158  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're not safe!
They're in the garden!

15
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:39,835  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
That's what it likes!
It likes it when they're playing!
Get 'em in! I'm begging you!

16
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:44,312  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
# Merry, merry king of the bush
is he

17
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:47,054  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Laugh, kookaburra

18
00:01:47,185 --> 00:01:49,665  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Laugh, kookaburra

19
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:52,424  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Gay your life must be. #

20
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:57,214  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right, I've got my beady eyes
on 'em. Come on, come on.

21
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,537  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
No! Tom?

22
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:03,535  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you? Where's he gone?

23
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:06,769  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
'What do you want
with our children?'

24
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:09,192  X1:078 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE HUMS THE KOOKABURRA SONG

25
00:02:57,716 --> 00:02:59,684  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ah.

26
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:11,108  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Aah!

27
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,529  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
So, near future, yeah?

28
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,441  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I had a passing fancy.
Only it didn't pass. It stopped.

29
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:28,040  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thirtieth Olympiad.

30
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,517  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
No way! Why didn't I think of this?
That's great.        Only seems like
yesterday a few naked Greek blokes.

31
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:35,235  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
were tossing a discus about,

32
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:39,549  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:308 Y2:379
wrestling with each other in the sand
as the crowds stood around baying...

33
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:42,109  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, wait a minute, that was Club Med.

34
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:44,625  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just in time for the opening
ceremony tonight.

35
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:46,819  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Last one they had in London
was dynamite.

36
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:51,300  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
Wembley, 1948. I loved it so much
that I went back and watched it all
over again.

37
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,376  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Fella carrying the torch.
Lovely chap. What was his...?

38
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:58,204  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
John, Mark? Legs like pipe-cleaners
but strong as a whippet... Doctor.

39
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:01,005  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
In those days, everyone had
a tea-party to go to. Doctor!

40
00:04:01,045 --> 00:04:05,318  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
You ever have cakes with crunchy ball-bearings on top? 
Doctor! You should see this!
You know... ?

41
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:11,836  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
Nobody else in this entire
galaxy has ever bothered to make
edible ball-bearings. Genius!

42
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,054  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's taking them do you think?

43
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:21,027  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Snatching children from a
thoroughly ordinary street like this.

44
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,981  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
And why's it so cold?

45
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:26,141  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:488 Y2:523
Something's reducing the temperature.

46
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:28,928  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
Says they all went
missing this week.

47
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:33,616  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why would a person do
something like this?

48
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:36,073  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
What makes you think it's a person?

49
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:40,799  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Whatever it is, it's got the
whole street scared to death.

50
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,097  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor, what...?

51
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:09,894  X1:078 X2:315 Y1:488 Y2:523
CAR WON'T START

52
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:14,887  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
There you go! Fifth today!
That's not natural, is it?

53
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:17,202  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
I had it serviced
less than a month ago.

54
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:19,602  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't even try and explain it, mate.

55
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:22,679  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
All the cars are doing it
and you know what, it's bonkers.

56
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:24,240  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bonkers.

57
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,117  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come on, then, pal,
I'll help you shift it.

58
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:30,914  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Quicker you're on your way,
the happier you'll be.

59
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:32,831  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
There we go.

60
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:35,904  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do you want a hand?

61
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:38,424  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, we're all right, love.

62
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:41,370  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, you're not.
I'm tougher than I look, honest.

63
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,250  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Does this happen a lot?
Cheers, mate.

64
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,683  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Been doing it all week. Since those
children started going missing?

65
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:58,470  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah. Suppose so.

66
00:06:00,758 --> 00:06:02,328  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hmm, tickles.

67
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:09,792  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's your game?

68
00:06:09,832 --> 00:06:12,029  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
My, um... Snakes And Ladders?

69
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,545  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Quite good at squash... Reasonable.

70
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:18,501  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm being facetious, aren't I?

71
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,660  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's no call for it.

72
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,174  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Every car cuts out.
Council are going nuts.

73
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:27,728  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
They've given this street
the works - renamed it. I've been
Tarmacking every pothole.

74
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:29,729  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look at that. Beauty, innit?

75
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:35,283  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Yep, and this is all because that
Olympic torch comes right by the
end of this close. Just down there.

76
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:37,839  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
Everything's gotta
be perfect, ain't it?

77
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,197  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Only it ain't.
It takes 'em when they're playing.

78
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:45,991  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
What takes them?
Danny, Jane, Dale...snatched
in the blink of an eye.

79
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:51,226  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
No, I'm not a liar, I'm a
police officer. That's what I am.
I've got a badge and a police car.

80
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:56,101  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
I can prove it. We've had coppers
poking around here and you don't
look or sound like any of 'em.

81
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:57,779  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
See? Look! I've got a colleague!

82
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,095  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Lewis! She looks less like a copper
than you do! Training.

83
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:03,810  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
It was either that or
hair-dressing, so... Voila!

84
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:10,164  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
What are you going to do?
The police have knocked on every
door - no clues, no leads, nothing!

85
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:14,561  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
Kids run off sometimes, all right?
That's what they do.
I saw it with my own eyes.

86
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:20,636  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
Dale Hicks in your garden
playing with your Tommy and
then...right in front of me.

87
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:27,149  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
Like he was never there. There's no
need to look any further than this
street. It's right here amongst us!

88
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:29,667  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why don't we...?
Why don't we start with him?

89
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:34,461  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
There's been all sorts
in this street, day and night.
Fixing things up for the Olympics!

90
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:37,458  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
And taking a long time about it!
I'm of the opinion...

91
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,852  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's slander!
I don't care what it is!

92
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,332  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think we need to just...
I want an apology!

93
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:44,769  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Stop picking on him!
Yeah, stop picking on me!

94
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:49,403  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
And stop pretending to be blind!
It's evil! I don't believe in evil.

95
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:52,760  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
You believe in Tarmackers with
kidnapped kiddies in their van!

96
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,437  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's not what she's saying!
Stop ganging up on me?

97
00:07:55,477 --> 00:07:58,964  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Feeling guilty, are we?
FINGERS ON LIPS!

98
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:11,263  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
In the last six days, three of
your children have been stolen.

99
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:13,390  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Snatched out of thin air, right?

100
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:18,025  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Er, can I...?

101
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,447  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look around you.

102
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:24,527  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
This was a safe street till it came.

103
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,964  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's not a person.

104
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:29,798  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll say it if no-one else will.

105
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:32,479  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Maybe you're coppers
and maybe you're not.

106
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,006  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't care who you are,
can you please help us?

107
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:47,960  X1:078 X2:207 Y1:488 Y2:523
SNIFFING

108
00:08:56,772 --> 00:08:58,286  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
You want a hanky?

109
00:08:58,326 --> 00:09:00,446  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can you smell it?

110
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:02,565  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's it remind you of?

111
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:05,762  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sort of...metal? Mm-hmm! Oh!

112
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:11,714  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Danny Edwards cycled in one end
but never came out the other.

113
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:17,071  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:416 Y2:523
Whoa, there it goes again.
Look at the hairs on the back
of my manly hairy hand.

114
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:22,581  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
And there's that smell. It's like
a...a burnt fuse plug or something.

115
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:26,142  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's a residual energy in the
spots where the kids vanished.

116
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:30,522  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Whatever it was, it used an
awful lot of power to do this.

117
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:40,765  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
You have to come down some time,
Chloe...

118
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:43,242  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm busy, Mum.

119
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,199  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look at it in here. You must've
used up half a rainforest.

120
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,723  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's Dale.

121
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,709  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why did you draw him so sad?

122
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:55,670  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
I didn't draw him like that.

123
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,107  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dale made himself sad.

124
00:09:59,147 --> 00:10:01,024  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
So I'm going to draw him a friend.

125
00:10:01,064 --> 00:10:04,869  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's what he needs - more friends.

126
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:09,852  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Have you seen the TV?

127
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:13,052  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look, this'll cheer you up.
The torch is getting close.

128
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,129  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
It'll pass right by our street.

129
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:17,803  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:487
Tonight they'll light
the Olympic flame in the stadium

130
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:20,964  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
and the whole world
will be looking at our city.

131
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:26,243  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
I mean, doesn't that make you feel
part of something? ..Sweetheart?

132
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:30,034  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Chloe? I'm busy, Mum.

133
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:32,082  X1:328 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK.

134
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:40,063  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're tired, Chloe.

135
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:43,459  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
I heard you calling out again
last night. It's fine. Nightmares?

136
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:46,775  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm drawing!

137
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:48,491  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whatever they are...

138
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:52,284  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
they're just dreams,
you do know that?

139
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:54,245  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
They can't hurt you.

140
00:10:54,285 --> 00:11:00,059  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm busy! Unless you want me
to draw you...Mum.

141
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:04,354  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you want to stay cooped up
in here, fine. I'll leave you to it.

142
00:11:07,873 --> 00:11:10,111  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, aren't you a beautiful boy!

143
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:12,791  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thanks.
I'm experimenting with back-combing.

144
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:15,214  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh. I used to have one like you.

145
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,061  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

146
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:24,015  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm not really a cat person.
Once you've been threatened
by one in a nun's wimple,

147
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:26,028  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
it kind of takes the joy out of it.

148
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:29,445  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come here, puss.

149
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:32,937  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
What d'you want to go in there for?

150
00:11:36,282 --> 00:11:38,944  X1:078 X2:307 Y1:488 Y2:523
FAINT MIAOWING

151
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:45,148  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor!

152
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:53,316  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ohh! Whoa! Hoo-hoo!

153
00:11:54,106 --> 00:12:00,934  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
Ion residue. Blimey! That takes
some doing. Just to snatch
a living organism out of space-time.

154
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:04,247  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
This baby's like, "I'm having
some of that!" I'm impressed.

155
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:08,889  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
So the cat's been transported.
It can harness huge reserves
of ionic power.

156
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,082  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
We need to find the source
of that power.

157
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:16,280  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Find the source and you will
find...whatever has taken to
stealing children and fluffy animals.

158
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,396  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
See what you can see.
Keep 'em peeled, Lewis.

159
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:23,310  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've given you friends
and you still moan.

160
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,230  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Moan, moan, moan. You're lucky.

161
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,664  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're all together. You don't
know what it is to be alone.

162
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:33,031  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
If you did, you'd be thanking me.

163
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:39,164  X1:078 X2:391 Y1:452 Y2:523
PENCIL LEAD SNAPS
NO!

164
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:52,277  X1:078 X2:159 Y1:488 Y2:523
THUD

165
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:54,495  X1:078 X2:241 Y1:488 Y2:523
CLATTERING

166
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:05,957  X1:078 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that you, puss cat? You trapped?

167
00:13:07,426 --> 00:13:10,213  X1:078 X2:301 Y1:488 Y2:523
METAL CLATTERS

168
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:13,101  X1:516 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
BANG!

169
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:18,998  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not gonna open it, not gonna
open it, not gonna open it...

170
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:41,716  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stay still!

171
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,224  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Okey-dokey?

172
00:13:48,264 --> 00:13:49,824  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah. Cheers.

173
00:13:49,864 --> 00:13:51,337  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
No probs.

174
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:58,490  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'll give you a fiver if you can
tell me what the hell it is
cos I haven't got the foggiest.

175
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,688  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, I can tell you you've just
killed it. It was never living.

176
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:06,005  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's animated by energy. The same
energy that's snatching people.
So dinky!

177
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,601  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
The go-anywhere creature.

178
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:13,038  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
Fits in the pocket.
Makes friends. Impresses your boss.
Breaks the ice at parties.

179
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:14,435  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hi, ho, here we go.

180
00:14:14,475 --> 00:14:15,959  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let's have a look.

181
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:20,281  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get out of here! What's it say?

182
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:28,144  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
It is!

183
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:30,818  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's graphite!

184
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:33,455  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Basically the same material
as an HB pencil.

185
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:37,093  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was attacked by a pencil
scribble?! A scribble creature,

186
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:39,129  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
brought into being with ionic energy.

187
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,966  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Whatever we're dealing with, it can
create things as well as take them.

188
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:47,116  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
But why make a scribble creature?
Maybe it was a mistake.

189
00:14:47,156 --> 00:14:51,954  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
I mean, you scribble over
something when you want to get
rid of it, like a drawing.

190
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:53,915  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like a...

191
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:56,630  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
child's...drawing.

192
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,864  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
You said it was in the street.

193
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:01,946  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Probably. The girl. Of course!
..What girl?

194
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:04,099  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Something about her
gave me the creeps.

195
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:08,016  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Even her own mum looked scared
of her. Are you deducting?

196
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:12,494  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think I am. Copper's hunch?
Permission to follow it up, Sarge?

197
00:15:12,534 --> 00:15:14,542  X1:078 X2:307 Y1:488 Y2:523
DOORBELL RINGS

198
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:21,868  X1:078 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
DOOR KNOCKER RATTLES

199
00:15:25,678 --> 00:15:32,072  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
Hello, I'm the Doctor and this is
Rose. Can we see your daughter?
No! You can't. OK. Bye.

200
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,710  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why? Why do you want to see Chloe?

201
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,947  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, there's some interesting
stuff going on in this street

202
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:43,897  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
and I just thought...
Well, we thought that she might
like to give us a hand.

203
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:45,855  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry to bother you. Yeah, sorry.

204
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:49,256  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
We'll let you get on with things.
On your own. Bye again.

205
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:51,569  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wait...

206
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:56,141  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can you help her?

207
00:15:57,643 --> 00:15:59,284  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, I can.

208
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:02,480  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
'The torch-bearer is running up
towards the Mall...'

209
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,153  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
She stays in her room
most of the time.

210
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:09,712  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
I try talking to her, but it's like
trying to speak to a brick wall.

211
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:13,748  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
She gives me nothing,
just asks to be left alone.

212
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:17,026  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
What about Chloe's dad?

213
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:20,540  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Chloe's dad died a year ago.
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,052  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
You wouldn't be if you'd known him.

215
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:25,414  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, let's go and say hi.

216
00:16:25,454 --> 00:16:29,091  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
I should check on her first,
she might be asleep.

217
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:31,673  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why are you afraid of her, Trish?

218
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:37,045  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
I want you to know, before you see
her, that she's really a great kid.

219
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:42,239  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm sure she is. She's never been
in trouble at school.
You should see her report

220
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,185  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
from last year. As and Bs.

221
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:48,433  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can I use your loo?

222
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:56,060  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's in the choir.

223
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,578  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
She sings in old folks' homes.

224
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,019  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
Any mum would be proud, you know?

225
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,333  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I want you to know these things
before you see her, Doctor,

226
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:05,915  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
because right now,
she's not herself.

227
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:22,899  X1:078 X2:373 Y1:488 Y2:523
FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS

228
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,561  X1:078 X2:277 Y1:488 Y2:523
DOOR RATTLES

229
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:15,190  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
All right there?

230
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,410  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm the Doctor.

231
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,890  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm Chloe Webber.
How are you doing, Chloe Webber?

232
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,087  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm busy. I'm making something.

233
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:28,679  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Aren't I, Mum?

234
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,881  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
And like I said,
she's not been sleeping.

235
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:33,441  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
But you've been drawing, though.

236
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:36,838  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm rubbish.
Stick men are about my limit.

237
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:38,515  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can do this though.

238
00:18:38,555 --> 00:18:41,667  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can you do that?

239
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:44,469  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
They don't stop moaning. Chloe?

240
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:47,818  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
I try to help them
but they don't stop moaning!

241
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:50,420  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who don't? We can be together.

242
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,210  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sweetheart... Don't touch me, Mum!

243
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:58,862  X1:504 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
THUDS

244
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:27,182  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
GROWLING: I'm coming!

245
00:19:27,222 --> 00:19:29,414  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm busy...Doctor.

246
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:34,093  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come on, Chloe, don't be a
spoil-sport. What's the big project?

247
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,692  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm dying to know.

248
00:19:35,732 --> 00:19:37,740  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you making up there? Doctor!

249
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:42,531  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
GROWLING: I'm coming to hurt you!

250
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,357  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look at it!

251
00:19:46,397 --> 00:19:48,558  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, ta. What the hell was that?

252
00:19:48,598 --> 00:19:53,230  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
A drawing - face of a man.
What face? Best not.
What have you been drawing?

253
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,592  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
I drew him yesterday. Who?

254
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:58,070  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dad. Your dad?

255
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,829  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
But he's long gone.

256
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:02,983  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Chloe, with all the lovely things
in the world, why him?

257
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:07,578  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
I dream about him...staring at me.
I thought we were
putting him behind us.

258
00:20:07,618 --> 00:20:09,695  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's the matter with you?

259
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:11,775  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
We need to stay together.
Yes, we do.

260
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:15,011  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, not you, us.

261
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:18,447  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
We need to stay together
and then it will be all right.

262
00:20:19,326 --> 00:20:23,803  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Trish...the drawings. Have you
seen what Chloe's drawings can do?

263
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:26,840  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who gave you permission to come
into her room? Get out!

264
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,672  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tell us about the drawings, Chloe.
No more.

265
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:32,674  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
But that drawing of her dad...
I heard a voice, he spoke!

266
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:35,826  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's dead! And these? They're
kids' pictures! Now get out!

267
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:41,063  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Chloe has a power and I don't know
how, but she's used it to take
Danny Edwards, Dale Hicks.

268
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:47,131  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
She's using it to snatch the kids!
Get out! Have you seen those
drawings move? No! Yes, you have.

269
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:48,813  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Out of the corner of your eye. No.

270
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:52,213  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
And you dismissed it
because you can't explain it.

271
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:56,928  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
If anyone mentions it, you get
angry, so it's never spoken of
ever again. She's a child.

272
00:20:56,968 --> 00:20:59,122  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
And you're terrified of her.

273
00:20:59,162 --> 00:21:03,399  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
But who's going to believe
the things you see
in the corner of your eye? No-one.

274
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,279  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Except me.

275
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,555  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who are you?

276
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:09,034  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm help.

277
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,463  X1:078 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
ROSE CLEARS HER THROAT

278
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:23,538  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Those pictures, they're alive.

279
00:21:23,578 --> 00:21:26,775  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
She draws people and they end up
in her pictures. Ionic energy.

280
00:21:26,815 --> 00:21:30,929  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
Chloe's harnessing it to place those
kids in a holding pen made up of
ionic power.

281
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:35,124  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
And what about the dad from hell
in her wardrobe? I've told you,
he's dead.

282
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:39,723  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, he's got a very loud voice
for a dead bloke.

283
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:45,332  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
If living things can become
drawings then maybe drawings
can become living things. ..Uh!

284
00:21:46,232 --> 00:21:50,031  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Chloe's real dad is dead. But not the
one who visits her in her nightmares.

285
00:21:50,071 --> 00:21:54,706  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
That dad seems very real,
and he's a heartbeat away
from crashing into this world.

286
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,263  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
She always got the worst of it
when he was alive.

287
00:21:57,303 --> 00:22:01,279  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doctor, how can a 12-year-old girl
be doing any of this?

288
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:04,781  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let's find out.

289
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:22,772  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice one.

290
00:22:32,663 --> 00:22:35,575  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
There we go. I can't let him...
Ssh, it's OK. Trust him.

291
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,696  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now we can talk.

292
00:22:39,736 --> 00:22:42,175  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
(I want Chloe!

293
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:45,611  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
(Wake her up! I want Chloe!)

294
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:49,287  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who are you? (I want Chloe Webber!)

295
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:54,404  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
What have you done to my
little girl? Doctor, what is it?
I'm speaking to you,

296
00:22:54,444 --> 00:22:57,841  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
the entity that is using
this human child.

297
00:22:57,881 --> 00:23:01,833  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I request parlez in compliance
with The Shadow Proclamation.

298
00:23:01,873 --> 00:23:04,793  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
(I don't care about shadows
or parlezes!)

299
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,626  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
So what do you care about?

300
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,383  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
(I want my friends!)

301
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:12,302  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're lonely, I know.

302
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:14,062  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Identify yourself.

303
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,658  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
(I am one of many.

304
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:18,177  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
(I travel
with my brothers and sisters.

305
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:22,928  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
(We take an endless journey.
A thousand of your lifetimes.

306
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:26,329  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
(But now I am alone. I hate it.
It's not fair

307
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:28,523  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:452 Y2:523
(and I hate it!)
Name yourself.

308
00:23:28,563 --> 00:23:29,797  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
(Isolus.)

309
00:23:30,883 --> 00:23:34,317  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're Isolus, of course!

310
00:23:34,357 --> 00:23:38,157  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Our journey began in the Deep
Realms when we were a family.

311
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:42,071  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's that? The Isolus mother,
drifting in deep space.

312
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:47,145  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
See, she jettisons millions of
fledgling spores - her children.

313
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:49,982  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Isolus are empathic beings
of intense emotion.

314
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:52,229  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
When they're cast off
from their mother,

315
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:55,176  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
their need for each other
is what sustains them.

316
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:58,303  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
They need to be together.
They cannot be alone.

317
00:23:58,343 --> 00:24:00,143  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Our journey is long.

318
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:03,049  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Isolus children travel,
each inside a pod.

319
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:05,845  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
They ride the heat and energy
of solar tides.

320
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:09,332  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
And it takes thousands and thousands
of years for them to grow up.

321
00:24:09,372 --> 00:24:12,881  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thousands of years just floating
through space? Poor things.

322
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:15,638  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't they go mad with boredom?

323
00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:17,118  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
We play.

324
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:19,793  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
You...play?

325
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,156  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
While they travel, they play games.

326
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:27,743  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
They use their ionic power
to literally create make-believe
worlds in which to play.

327
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:30,941  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
In-flight entertainment.
It helps keep them happy.

328
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:36,095  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
While they're happy they can feed
off each other's love. Without it,
they're lost.

329
00:24:37,771 --> 00:24:40,738  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why did you come to Earth?

330
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:42,535  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
We were too close!

331
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:47,843  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's a solar flare from your sun.

332
00:24:47,883 --> 00:24:52,368  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
Would have made a tidal wave
of solar energy that scattered
the Isolus pods.

333
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,928  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Only I fell to Earth.

334
00:24:53,968 --> 00:24:56,634  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
My brothers and sisters
are left up there

335
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:58,505  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
and I can not reach them.

336
00:24:58,545 --> 00:25:00,825  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
So alone!

337
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:03,265  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Your pod crashed? Where is it?

338
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:05,222  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
My pod was drawn to heat

339
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:07,281  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
and I was drawn to Chloe Webber.

340
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:14,132  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
She was like me - alone.

341
00:25:14,172 --> 00:25:17,260  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
She needed me and I her.

342
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:20,447  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
You empathized with her.

343
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:25,241  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
You wanted to be with her
because she was alone like you.
I want my family!

344
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:28,449  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's not fair! I understand,
you want to make a family.

345
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:31,876  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
But you can't stay
in this child, it's wrong.

346
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:36,069  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can't steal any more friends
for yourself. I am alone!

347
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:39,633  X1:078 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
CRASH AND GROWLING
I'm coming to hurt you.

348
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:43,220  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm coming!
Trish! How do you calm her? What?!

349
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,946  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:416 Y2:487
When she has nightmares, what do you
do? I... What do you DO? I sing.

350
00:25:46,986 --> 00:25:48,455  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Start singing.

351
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:50,815  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
GROWLING: Chloe, I'm coming.

352
00:25:50,855 --> 00:25:54,529  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
# Kookaburra sits
in the old gum tree

353
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:57,409  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
# Merry, merry king of the bush
is he

354
00:25:57,449 --> 00:26:00,116  X1:078 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
SINGING AND GROWLING CONTINUE

355
00:26:02,443 --> 00:26:05,517  X1:078 X2:311 Y1:488 Y2:523
GROWLING FADES

356
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:08,634  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
# ..kookaburra
Gay your life must be

357
00:26:09,638 --> 00:26:12,951  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
It came to her
because she was lonely.

358
00:26:12,991 --> 00:26:14,760  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, Chloe, I'm sorry.

359
00:26:17,463 --> 00:26:21,467  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Chloe usually got the brunt of
his temper, when he'd had a drink.

360
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:25,616  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
The day he crashed the car,
I thought we were free.
I thought it was over.

361
00:26:25,656 --> 00:26:27,581  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did you talk to her about it?

362
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:29,139  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
I didn't want to.

363
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:33,371  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
But maybe that's why Chloe
feels so alone.

364
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:38,884  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Because she has these
terrible dreams about her dad but
she can't talk to you about them.

365
00:26:38,924 --> 00:26:40,839  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Her and the Isolus -

366
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:42,879  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
two lonely kids who needed
each other.

367
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:45,359  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
It won't stop, will it, Doctor?

368
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:48,116  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
It'll just keep pulling kids in.

369
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:50,190  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's desperate to be loved.

370
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,546  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's used to a pretty big family.
How big?

371
00:26:54,504 --> 00:26:58,110  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Say around four billion?

372
00:27:01,377 --> 00:27:03,623  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:380 Y2:415
'The queue started a week ago

373
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:07,651  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
'for those desperate enough to be
inside - there are lots of them.

374
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:13,965  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
'We're expecting a capacity crowd
of 80,000 for this evening's
opening ceremony. There's been...'

375
00:27:14,005 --> 00:27:15,371  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
We need that pod.

376
00:27:15,411 --> 00:27:17,323  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
It crashed. Won't it be destroyed?

377
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:20,601  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's been sucking in heat.
That should keep it fit to launch.

378
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:24,391  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
It should have a weak energy
signature the Tardis can trace.

379
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:26,768  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Once we find it,
then we can stop the Isolus.

380
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:31,186  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's running a temperature.

381
00:27:31,226 --> 00:27:33,029  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
..I can't go into that now, Kirsty.

382
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,995  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, we've got a doctor.

383
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,065  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
..Yes, he said he can help her.

384
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:45,879  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
We can scan for the same trace I
picked up from the scribble creature.
Just need to widen the field a bit.

385
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:00,839  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
You knew the Isolus was lonely
before it told you. How?

386
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:05,347  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
I know what it's like to travel
a long way on your own. Give me
the steino-magnetic...

387
00:28:05,387 --> 00:28:08,587  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
the thing in your left hand.
Sounds like you're on its side.

388
00:28:08,627 --> 00:28:13,662  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
I sympathize, that's all.
The Isolus has caused a lot of pain
for these people. It's a child.

389
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:16,105  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's why it went to Chloe. Hmm.

390
00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:19,215  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Feels to me like a temper tantrum
cos it can't get its own way.

391
00:28:19,255 --> 00:28:22,099  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's scared. Come on,
you were a kid once. Binary dot.

392
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:26,809  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yes, and I know what kids can be
like. Right little...terrors.

393
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:35,997  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Gum. Hey, I've got cousins. Kids
can't have it all their own way.

394
00:28:36,037 --> 00:28:39,838  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's part of being a family. And
what about trying to understand them?

395
00:28:39,878 --> 00:28:42,231  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
Easy for you to say,
you don't have kids.

396
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:45,598  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was a dad... once.
What did you say?

397
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:48,663  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think we're there.

398
00:28:48,703 --> 00:28:51,263  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Fear. Loneliness.
They're the big ones, Rose.

399
00:28:51,303 --> 00:28:54,100  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Some terrible acts
have been inspired by them.

400
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,500  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
This isn't something
that wants to conquer or destroy.

401
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:03,415  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
There's a lot of things you need
to get across this universe -
warp drive, wormhole refractors.

402
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:08,684  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Do you know the thing you need most
of all? You need a hand to hold.

403
00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:10,936  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, look, I'm pointing.

404
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,439  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's the pod! It IS in the street!

405
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:17,202  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everything's coming up Doctor!

406
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:27,467  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's about two inches across. Dull
grey, like a gull's egg. Very light.

407
00:29:27,507 --> 00:29:33,461  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
So these pods, they travel from sun
to sun, using the heat, yeah? So
it's not all about love and stuff.

408
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:36,737  X1:078 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doesn't the pod just need heat?
GLASS SMASHES

409
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:38,335  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor?

410
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:42,200  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
DOCTOR!

411
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,900  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's OK,
I've taken all the pencils off her.

412
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:57,354  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Leave me alone!
I want to be with Chloe Webber!

413
00:29:57,394 --> 00:29:59,034  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
I love Chloe Webber.

414
00:29:59,074 --> 00:30:00,797  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bring him back now. No!

415
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:04,269  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't you realise what you've done?

416
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:09,832  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523
He was the only one who could
help you. Now bring him back! Leave
me alone! I love Chloe Webber!

417
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,229  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know.

418
00:30:17,017 --> 00:30:18,530  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know.

419
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:24,683  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Doctor, if you can hear me,
I'm going to get you out of there.
I'll find the pod.

420
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:27,083  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't leave her alone,
no matter what.

421
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:30,394  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:344 Y2:415
'The torchbearer is getting closer
to the Olympic Stadium,

422
00:30:30,434 --> 00:30:31,714  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:380 Y2:415
'heading down The Strand

423
00:30:31,754 --> 00:30:33,523  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
'before turning east...'

424
00:30:34,555 --> 00:30:36,309  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
Heat.

425
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:38,787  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
They travel on heat.

426
00:30:38,827 --> 00:30:42,142  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look at this finish.
Smooth as a baby's bottom.

427
00:30:42,182 --> 00:30:47,935  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:416 Y2:523
Not a bump or a lump. Kel, was there
anything in this street the last
few days giving off a lot of heat?

428
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:50,176  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
I mean,
you could eat your dinner off this.

429
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:53,690  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Beautiful. So you tell me why
the other one's got a lump in it

430
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,729  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
when I gave it the same
craftsmanship as I did this one?

431
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:00,725  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, when you've worked it out put
it in a big book about Tarmacking.

432
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:03,924  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
But before you do that,
think back six days.

433
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:05,681  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Six days?

434
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:09,396  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
When I was laying this
the first time round? What?

435
00:31:09,436 --> 00:31:14,508  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
That's when filled in this pothole
for the first time. Six days ago.
Yeah.

436
00:31:14,548 --> 00:31:16,423  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hot, fresh tar.

437
00:31:16,463 --> 00:31:18,704  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Blended to a secret council recipe.

438
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,228  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I don't keep it in the van.

439
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:24,487  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hey! That's a council van! Out!

440
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:27,859  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whoa! Wait a minute!

441
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,775  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've just removed a council axe
from a council van.

442
00:31:30,815 --> 00:31:33,292  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:416 Y2:487
Put it back. No, don't.
That's my van.

443
00:31:33,332 --> 00:31:37,805  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Give me the axe.
Wait! No! No! Stop!

444
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:40,607  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
You just took a council axe
from a council van

445
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:43,120  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
and now you're digging up
a council road!

446
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,577  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm reporting you to the council!

447
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,428  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
It went for the hottest thing
in the street - your tar!

448
00:31:53,468 --> 00:31:55,865  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is it? It's a spaceship!

449
00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:58,025  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not a council spaceship, I'm afraid.

450
00:31:58,065 --> 00:32:05,496  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
'We are live on BBC News 24.
The opening ceremony of the London
Olympics of 2012 is well under way.

00:32:05,536 --> 00:32:10,734  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:416 Y2:523
'Athletes are streaming into
the stadium right now.
They all have their dreams.

'They've all put in years
of hard work...'

453
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:15,768  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I found it!

454
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:20,000  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
Don't know what to do with it
but maybe the Isolus
will just hop on board.

455
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,518  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hang on, I told you
not to leave her.

456
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:24,633  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523

458
00:32:26,872 --> 00:32:31,907  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
I don't care if Snow White and the
Seven Dwarves buried under there,
you do not... Shut up!

465
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:51,769  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
A stadium won't be enough.

466
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:55,602  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Isolus has four billion
brothers and sisters.

and 13,000 athletes...'

468

Not enough. '..they're gone.

472
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:20,121  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
We'll have all of them. And then
we'll never feel alone ever again.

476

484
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:06,446  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've got your pod!

485
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:09,046  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
The pod is dead!
No, no. It only needs heat.

486
00:34:09,086 --> 00:34:11,002  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:488 Y2:523
It needs more than heat. What, then?

487
00:34:11,042 --> 00:34:14,357  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm not being funny or nothing...

488
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:16,405  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523

490

just energy left over by the Isolus.

scared that he's real. But you can
get shot of him, Chloe. Mummy!

00:38:59,575 --> 00:39:03,411  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
'80,000 athletes and spectators,
they disappeared, they've come back.

550
00:39:03,451 --> 00:39:06,570  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
'They've re-appeared.
It's quite incredible.

551
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,647  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Bob, this was certainly...'

552
00:39:08,687 --> 00:39:11,081  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
80,000 people,
so where's the Doctor?

553
00:39:11,121 --> 00:39:14,639  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
I need him!
'Hang on! The torch-bearer
seems to be in trouble.

554
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:20,278  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
'We did see a flash of lightning
earlier that seemed to strike him.

555
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:22,989  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:344 Y2:415
'Maybe he's injured.
He's definitely in trouble.

556
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:28,027  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Does this mean that
the Olympic dream is dead?'

557
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:29,625  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor...

558
00:39:29,665 --> 00:39:31,180  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
'There's a mystery man.

559
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,418  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
'He's picked up the flame
and we've no idea who he is.

560
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:39,736  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
'He's carrying the flame.
Yes, he's carrying the flame
and no-one wants to stop him.

561
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,212  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
'It's more than a flame now, Bob.

562
00:39:42,252 --> 00:39:44,769  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:344 Y2:415
'It's more than heat and light -
it's hope

563
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,762  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:380 Y2:415
and it's courage and it's love.

564
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:49,014  X1:078 X2:285 Y1:488 Y2:523
CROWD CHEERS

565
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,178  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

566
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:09,700  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Go on,
join your brothers and sisters.

567
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,157  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
They'll be waiting.

568
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,185  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cake?

569
00:40:45,105 --> 00:40:46,618  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Top banana!

570
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:54,373  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can't stress this enough -
ball-bearings you can eat.

571
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:57,212  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Masterpiece!

572
00:40:57,252 --> 00:41:00,089  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
I thought I'd lost you.

573
00:41:00,129 --> 00:41:01,883  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nah, not on a night like this.

574
00:41:01,923 --> 00:41:06,401  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is a night for lost things
being found. Come on. What now?

575
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:09,558  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
I want to go to the Games,
it's what we came for.

576
00:41:09,598 --> 00:41:11,795  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go on, give us a clue.

577
00:41:11,835 --> 00:41:13,832  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Which events do we do well in?

578
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:15,829  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
I will tell you this,

579
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:19,109  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Papua New Guinea surprise everyone
in the shot-put.

580
00:41:19,149 --> 00:41:21,866  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Really? You're joking, aren't you?

581
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:23,543  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor?

582
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:26,046  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Are you serious or are you joking?
Wait and see.

583
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:34,175  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
You know what?
They keep on trying to split us up,
but they never ever will.

584
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:37,524  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Never say "never ever".

585
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:40,027  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nah, we'll always be OK, you and me.

586
00:41:41,802 --> 00:41:43,611  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't you reckon, Doctor?

587
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,680  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Something in the air.
Something coming. What?

588
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,003  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
A storm's approaching.

589
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:02,662  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is the story of war on Earth.

590
00:42:02,702 --> 00:42:08,256  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
The valiant child who will die
in battle so very soon.

591
00:42:08,296 --> 00:42:11,852  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Said I was going to die
in battle. Then it lied.

592
00:42:11,892 --> 00:42:13,929  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Welcome to Torchwood!

593
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:18,444  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
I woke up one morning and there
they all were - ghosts everywhere.

594
00:42:18,484 --> 00:42:21,766  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oi, where are you taking that?

595
00:42:23,478 --> 00:42:25,634  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
If it's alien, it's ours.

596
00:42:25,674 --> 00:42:30,113  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
We've got a problem down here.
Yvonne, can you hear me? Send that
thing back into hell!

597
00:42:30,153 --> 00:42:33,986  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Doctor, assuming alien
authority over the rights of man.

598
00:42:34,026 --> 00:42:39,390  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
They're bleeding through the fault
lines, walking from their world
across the void and into yours.

599
00:42:40,421 --> 00:42:44,858  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:416 Y2:523
You can't stop us, Doctor.
This world is colliding
with another. Positions!

600
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:47,315  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who are they?

601
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:51,903  X1:078 X2:463 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cybermen! Uh!
SCREAMING

602
00:42:53,327 --> 00:42:56,082  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's when it all ended.

603
00:42:56,122 --> 00:42:58,710  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is the last story
I'll ever tell.

604
00:43:40,915 --> 00:43:47,084  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
