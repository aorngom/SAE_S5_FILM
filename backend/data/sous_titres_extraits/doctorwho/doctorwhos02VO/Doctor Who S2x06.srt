1
00:00:02,197 --> 00:00:06,348  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's happened? The time vortex has
gone! We've got to be somewhere.

2
00:00:06,388 --> 00:00:09,905  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's a parallel Earth with
zeppelins. I'm right, aren't I?

3
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:12,182  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
A world where my dad's still alive.

4
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:15,062  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose, he's not your father.
And she is not your mother.

5
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:17,216  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
What is that?
Mickey, we've got power!

6
00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:20,690  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're a fine businessman, John.
But you're not God.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,648  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
He is exactly the same.

8
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:27,886  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are they? Cybermen.

9
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:40,793  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's no need to damage us!

10
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,947  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're good stock. We volunteer
for the upgrade programme.

11
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:49,183  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Take us to be processed. You are
rogue elements. But we surrender.

12
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:52,777  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
You are incompatible.
But this is a surrender!

13
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:57,452  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
You will be deleted.
Listen to me, we surrender!

14
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:01,769  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
You are inferior
and will be reborn as Cybermen.

15
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:05,785  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
But you will perish
under maximum deletion.

16
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:10,244  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Delete, delete, delete.

17
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:53,275  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell was that? !

18
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:55,033  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or, how about instead, run!

19
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,081  X1:078 X2:307 Y1:380 Y2:415
CAR HORN BEEPS

20
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,463  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everybody! In!

21
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:05,781  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got to go back.
My wife's in there.

22
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,898  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Anyone inside that house is dead.

23
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:11,493  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't let her die for nothing,
come with us right now.

24
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:14,293  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on! Get a move on!

25
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,009  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose. She's not your mother.

26
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,533  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know. Come on.

27
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,774  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Finished chatting? Never seen
a slower getaway in my life!

28
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:41,903  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
What was that thing?

29
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:44,223  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Little bit of technology
from my home.

30
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:48,934  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Has it run out? It'll charge
back up in about four hours.

31
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:50,651  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
So we don't have a weapon. We do.

32
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:54,967  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
Might not work on those metal
things, but they're good enough
for men like him.

33
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,965  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Leave him alone!
What's he done wrong?

34
00:02:57,005 --> 00:03:00,801  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Laid a trap that's wiped out the
government and left Lumic in charge!

35
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:03,639  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
If I was part of that, do you think
I'd leave my wife inside?

36
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:06,796  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Maybe it went wrong. Still gives us
the right to execute you.

37
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:10,873  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523
Talk about executions,
you'll make me your enemy.
You don't want to do that.

38
00:03:10,913 --> 00:03:16,766  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
All the same, we have evidence
that says Pete Tyler's been
working for the Lumics since 20.5.

39
00:03:19,624 --> 00:03:20,613  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that true?

40
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:23,935  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Tell 'em, Mrs M.

41
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:26,896  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've got a government mole,
feeds us information.

42
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:30,649  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Lumic's private files, his
South American operations, the lot.

43
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,887  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Secret broadcasts twice a week.

44
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:35,687  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Broadcasts from Gemini?
And how do you know that?

45
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:38,403  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm Gemini! That's me!
You would say that.

46
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:42,081  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Encrypted wavelength 657
using binary nine.

47
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,914  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's the only reason I was working
for Lumic. To get information.

48
00:03:45,954 --> 00:03:48,792  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thought it was the
security services, what do I get?

49
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:51,229  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Scooby Doo gang!
They've even got the van!

50
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,665  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
No, no, but the Preachers
know what they're doing. Ricky
said he's London's most wanted.

51
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:57,582  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, that's not exactly. . .

52
00:03:57,622 --> 00:03:59,102  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not exactly what?

53
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:02,503  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm London's most wanted
for parking tickets.

54
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:05,411  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, great.

55
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:07,892  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was fighting the system!
Park anywhere.

56
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:09,728  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good policy. I do much the same.

57
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:12,445  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm the Doctor, by the way,
if anyone's interested.

58
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,802  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
And I'm Rose. Hello! Even better.
That's the name of my dog.

59
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:19,599  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Still, at least I've got
the catering staff on my side.

60
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,436  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
I knew you weren't a traitor.

61
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:23,040  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why's that then?

62
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:26,931  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
I just did.

63
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:29,991  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
They took my wife.

64
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:31,507  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
She might still be alive.

65
00:04:31,547 --> 00:04:33,187  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's even worse.

66
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:34,865  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cos that's what Lumic does.

67
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:37,338  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
He takes the living. . .

68
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:40,017  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
and turns them into those machines.

69
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:46,089  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
Cybermen. They're called Cybermen.
And I'd take those Ear Pods
off if I were you.

70
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:49,247  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
You never know,
Lumic could be listening.

71
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:53,785  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
But he's over reached himself,
he's a businessman
who's assassinated the President.

72
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:56,020  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
All we need to do
is inform the authorities.

73
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,887  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Because I promise you,
this ends tonight.

74
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:06,570  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
My everlasting children. Tell me,
how does it feel? We feel nothing.

75
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,007  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
But in your mind.
What do you think?

76
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,167  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
We think the same.

77
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:15,438  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
We are uniform.
But you think of what?

78
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:19,833  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
We think of the humans. We think
of their difference and their pain.

79
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:21,992  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
They suffer in the skin.

80
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:23,869  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
They must be upgraded.

81
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:27,787  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Excellent, then let's begin.

82
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,303  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Computer, identify John Lumic.

83
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:32,502  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Voice print acknowledged.'

84
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,780  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Activate Ear Pod Primary Sequence.

85
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,618  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Please state area of activation.'

86
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:43,051  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
The City of London.
I've just declared independence.

87
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,860  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Begin transmission!

88
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:52,493  X1:078 X2:265 Y1:488 Y2:523
ALARM BEEPS

89
00:06:05,827 --> 00:06:07,863  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
They will come to me.

90
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:09,542  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
My new children.

91
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:11,779  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
The immortal ones.

92
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,896  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
The whole of London
has been sealed off.

93
00:06:13,936 --> 00:06:15,576  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
There are reports of an army.

94
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:18,853  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
An army of metal men. All citizens
should remove their Ear Pods.

95
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:23,049  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
I repeat, remove all Ear Pods.
London has been placed
under martial law.

96
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:26,940  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you are hearing this, stay in your
homes. I repeat, stay in your homes.

97
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:30,678  X1:078 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
ELECTRICAL BUZZING, MAN GROANS

98
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:33,795  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, no, you don't!

99
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:37,233  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell? What's going on?

100
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:40,988  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's the Ear Pods, Lumic's
taken control. Can't we just. . .

101
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:43,308  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
I dunno, take them off? Don't!

102
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,144  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cause a brainstorm.

103
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:49,221  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:416 Y2:523
The human race
for such an intelligent lot,
you aren't half susceptible.

104
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:51,938  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Give anyone a chance to
take control and you submit!

105
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,495  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sometimes I think you like it
an easy life.

106
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:56,747  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hey! Come and see!

107
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,443  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where are they all going?

108
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:07,080  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know. Lumic must
have a base of operations.

109
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,315  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Battersea. That's where
he was building his prototypes.

110
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:14,351  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why's he doing it? He's dying.

111
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:18,189  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:416 Y2:523
This all started out
as a way of prolonging life,
keeping the brain alive.

112
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,586  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
At any cost. Thing is, I've seen
Cybermen before, haven't I?

113
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:24,783  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
The head, those handle shapes.
In Van Statten's Museum.

114
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:30,497  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
There are Cybermen in our universe.
They started on an ordinary world,
then swarmed across the galaxy.

115
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:33,533  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
This lot are starting from scratch,
right here on Earth.

116
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:34,813  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you on about?

117
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:37,691  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Never mind that,
we need to get out of the city.

118
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:40,608  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK, split up! Mrs Moore,
you look after that lot.

119
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:43,554  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Jake, distract them. We'll
meet back at Bridge Street. Move!

120
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:45,806  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm going with him.

121
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:49,119  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on! Let's go.

122
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,868  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
There!

123
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,333  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Which way?
I don't know where we are.

124
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:14,209  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Did they see us? Bet they've got
satellites. They saw us in the dark.

125
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:15,968  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
BOTH: They know where we are.

126
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:17,808  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't get it, what is it with you?

127
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:19,601  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're exactly like me.

128
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:22,320  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I dunno. Reckon you're braver.
Ten times.

129
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,718  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Still, your friends aren't bad.

130
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:27,914  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's the Doctor and Rose.
I just tag along behind.

131
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:29,834  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, then you're not that bad.

132
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:32,349  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do you think? Yeah, suppose.

133
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:34,237  X1:078 X2:351 Y1:488 Y2:523
METALLIC MARCHING

134
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:36,741  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cybermen!

135
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:39,091  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
BOTH: Split up!

136
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:15,863  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
(Go!)

137
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:28,969  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
TANNOY: 'Chamber 12 now closed
for sterilisation.

138
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:33,520  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
'All reject stock
will be in incinerated.'

139
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:53,263  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on!

140
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:55,181  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on!

141
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,741  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on!

142
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:57,861  X1:078 X2:249 Y1:488 Y2:523
HE SCREAMS

143
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,214  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
No!

144
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,356  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cyberman: This one is unprogrammed.

145
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:21,554  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Crane, I thought you
were one of the faithful.

146
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:23,030  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, that I am, sir.

147
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,228  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
My Ear Pod must have malfunctioned.

148
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:27,187  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
For which I apologise.

149
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,711  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
If I might?

150
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,419  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'd like to request an upgrade, sir.

151
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:38,216  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've seen the future
and its copyright Cybus Industries.

152
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:41,334  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sign me up! A willing volunteer?

153
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,330  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've known me a long time, sir.

154
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,968  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Quite a team, you and me.

155
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:47,244  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've been with you all the way.

156
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:48,962  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
But believe me, sir.

157
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:53,103  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Knowing you so well,
I know exactly what to do.

158
00:10:57,436 --> 00:10:59,245  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
No! No! Help me!

159
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,374  X1:326 X2:391 Y1:488 Y2:523
Die!

160
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:07,704  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Help me! You are in pain.

161
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:10,144  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
We can remove pain forever.

162
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:13,621  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
No. Not yet. I'm not ready!

163
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:15,978  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
We will give you immortality.

164
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:19,176  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've told you, I will upgrade. . .

165
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:20,934  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
only with my last breath.

166
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:24,449  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then breathe no more.

167
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:30,099  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, no! I command you! No!

168
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:37,232  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
I ran past the river,
you should've seen it
the whole city's on the march.

169
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:39,280  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hundreds of Cybermen
all down the Thames.

170
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:41,915  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here he is!

171
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:45,863  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Which one are you?

172
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:49,026  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm sorry. The Cybermen. . .
He couldn't. . . Are you Ricky?

173
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,262  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you Ricky?

174
00:11:51,302 --> 00:11:53,016  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey, that's you, isn't it?

175
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:54,825  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

176
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:01,484  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
He tried. He was running.

177
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:03,765  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
There was too many of them. Shut it.

178
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:07,199  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
There was nothing I could do.
I said just shut it!

179
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:09,360  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't even talk about him.

180
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,692  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're nothing, you are.

181
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:15,071  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nothing.

182
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:19,390  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
We can mourn him
when London is safe.

183
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,517  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
For now, we move on.

184
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:48,637  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
The whole of London's been sealed
off and the entire population's
been taken inside that place.

185
00:12:48,677 --> 00:12:51,074  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
To be converted.

186
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:53,232  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've got to get in there
and shut it down.

187
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,910  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
How do we do that?

188
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,750  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, I'll think of something.

189
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,106  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're just making this up
as you go along! Yep.

190
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,789  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
But I do it brilliantly.

191
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:07,184  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
MRS MOORE: That's a schematic
of the old factory.

192
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:11,574  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look, cooling tunnels
underneath the plant,

193
00:13:11,614 --> 00:13:16,088  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
big enough to walk through.
We go under,
then up into the control centre.

194
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,885  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's another way in.
Through the front door.

195
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:21,883  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
If they've taken Jackie,
that's how she'll get in.

196
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:24,160  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
We can't just go strolling up.

197
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,716  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, we could. With these.

198
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:29,952  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fake Ear Pods.

199
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:34,748  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
Dead, no signal, but put them on
and the Cybermen would mistake you
for one of the crowd.

200
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:36,347  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then that's my job.

201
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:39,862  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
You'd have to show no emotion.
Any sign of emotion gives you away.

202
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,142  X1:078 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
How many of those have you got?
Just two sets.

203
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:43,978  X1:328 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK.

204
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:48,496  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
If that's the best way of finding
Jackie, then I'm coming with you.

205
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:53,167  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
Why does she matter to you?
We haven't got time.
Doctor, I'm going with him.

206
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,767  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
No stopping you, is there?

207
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:56,963  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nope.

208
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,242  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tell you what, we can attack
the Ear Pods at the same time.

209
00:14:00,282 --> 00:14:06,545  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Give people their minds back,
so they don't walk into that place
like sheep. Jakey boy. . .

210
00:14:09,592 --> 00:14:13,483  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Lumic's transmitting the control
signal. It must be from over there.

211
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:18,303  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
There it is.
On the zeppelin, do you see?

212
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:22,378  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Great big transmitter. It's a good
thing Lumic likes showing off.

213
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:24,178  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Reckon you can take it out?

214
00:14:24,218 --> 00:14:26,854  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Consider it done.

215
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:30,806  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Mrs Moore,
would you care to accompany me
into the cooling tunnels?

216
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:34,046  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
How could I refuse?
We attack on three sides.

217
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:39,799  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Above, between, below. Into the
control centre, stop the conversion
machines. What about me?

218
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,594  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey, you can, um. . .

219
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,554  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
What? Stay out of trouble?
Be the tin dog?

220
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,151  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, those days are over.

221
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,628  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm going with Jake.
I don't need you, idiot.

222
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:53,345  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm not an idiot. You got that?

223
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:54,903  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm offering to help.

224
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:58,710  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whatever.

225
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:03,096  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey!

226
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,416  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good luck.

227
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:06,290  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, you too.

228
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,367  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose, I'll see you later.
Yeah! You'd better.

229
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:11,744  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
If we survive,
I'll see you at the Tardis.

230
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,936  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's a promise.

231
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:25,237  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good luck.

232
00:15:40,578 --> 00:15:43,331  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's freezing.

233
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:46,050  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Any sign of a light switch?

234
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,327  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can't see a thing.
But I've got these.

235
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:51,163  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
A device for every occasion. Ooh!

236
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:52,516  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Put it on.

237
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,919  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Haven't got a hot dog in there,
have you? I'm starving.

238
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,790  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Of all the things to wish for,
that's mechanically recovered meat.

239
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,989  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
I know, it's the Cyberman of food.
But it's tasty!

240
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,104  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
A proper torch as well.

241
00:16:08,144 --> 00:16:09,662  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let's see where we are.

242
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:18,234  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Already converted, just put on ice.
Come on.

243
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,163  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let's go slowly.

244
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:36,380  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Keep an eye out for trip systems.

245
00:16:56,855 --> 00:16:59,927  X1:078 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
TANNOY MAKES AN ANNOUNCEMENT

246
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,435  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just put them on.
Don't show any emotion.

247
00:17:16,475 --> 00:17:18,471  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
No signs, nothing. OK?

248
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:21,108  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't worry. We can do it.

249
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:23,946  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
We could die in there.
Why you doing this?

250
00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:26,688  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Let's just say I'm doing it
for my mum and dad.

251
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,714  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right, let's go.

252
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:35,170  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
TANNOY: 'Chamber eight now
open for human upgrading.

253
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:41,084  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Chamber nine now open

254
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:46,408  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Chamber ten now open

255
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:56,163  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Chamber 11 now open

256
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:31,235  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Two guards. We can take them.

257
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:33,312  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't kill them.
Who put you in charge?

258
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:37,123  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
If you kill them,
what's the difference between you
and a Cyberman?

259
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:41,123  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, I suppose we could use these.

260
00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:44,219  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Smelling salts?

261
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:47,817  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Bit stronger than that.
One of Mrs Moore's little tricks.

262
00:18:47,857 --> 00:18:49,811  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Should knock 'em out.

263
00:18:49,851 --> 00:18:52,393  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
(Three, two, one.)

264
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:07,934  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's got to be more guards
on board.

265
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:10,272  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then let's go get them.

266
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:17,505  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
How did you get into this, then?

267
00:19:17,545 --> 00:19:19,982  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rattling along with the Preachers.

268
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:23,259  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, I used to be ordinary!

269
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:26,933  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Worked at Cybus Industries,
nine to five.

270
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:31,167  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Till one day I find something
I'm not supposed to.

271
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:33,646  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
A file on the mainframe.

272
00:19:33,686 --> 00:19:36,083  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
All I did was read it.

273
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:40,998  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then suddenly I've got men with guns
knocking in the middle of the night.

274
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:43,035  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
A life on the run.

275
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:45,955  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then I found the Preachers.

276
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:48,633  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
They needed a techie, so I. . .

277
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:51,189  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
just sat down
and taught myself everything.

278
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:53,145  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
What about Mr Moore?

279
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:55,158  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, he's not called Moore.

280
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:58,420  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
I got that from a book,

281
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,860  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mrs Moore.

282
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,158  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's safer not to use real names.

283
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:09,088  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
But he thinks I'm dead.
It was the only way to keep him safe.

284
00:20:09,128 --> 00:20:10,897  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Him and the kids.

285
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:14,522  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
What about you,

286
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:16,040  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
got any family?

287
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,240  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who needs family?

288
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,877  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got the whole world
on my shoulders.

289
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:24,914  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go on then, what's your real name?

290
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:27,791  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Angela Price.

291
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:29,387  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't tell a soul.

292
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,400  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not a word.

293
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:45,276  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Movement in Deepcold Six.

294
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,263  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Awaken the army.

295
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:53,841  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor? Did that one move?

296
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:56,118  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's just the torchlight.

297
00:20:56,158 --> 00:20:57,678  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Keep going, come on.

298
00:20:57,718 --> 00:20:59,851  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're waking up! Run!

299
00:21:12,224 --> 00:21:15,180  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get up! Quick, they're coming!

300
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,655  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Open it! Open it!

301
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,251  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get up, quick!

302
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,628  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Quick! Angela! Come on!

303
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,026  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523

I recognise you. I went first
my name was Jacqueline Tyler.

316

No! What?
They are unprogrammed. Restrain.

317
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,456  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523

you're not my Jackie.

320
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:15,374  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
But you can't be.

321
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,608  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not her. . .
Her brain is inside this body.

322
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,804  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jacks. I came to save you!

323
00:23:21,844 --> 00:23:26,479  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
This man worked with Cybus
Industries to create our species.

324
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,436  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
He will be rewarded by force.

325
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:31,724  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Take them to Cybercontrol.

326
00:23:33,953 --> 00:23:36,110  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
They killed her.

327
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,227  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
They took her and killed her.
Maybe there's a chance.

328
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:41,744  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know, maybe we can reverse
it. There's nothing we can do.

329
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:43,792  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
But if she remembers. . .

330
00:23:46,018 --> 00:23:48,851  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where is she?
Which one was it? Which one was her?

331
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:53,350  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
They all look the same.

332
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:59,643  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice one, nobody's home.

333
00:23:59,683 --> 00:24:01,561  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Find the controls.
What do they look like?

334
00:24:01,601 --> 00:24:05,452  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
They might have transmitter controls
written in red letters, just look!

335
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:14,769  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whoa! Cyberman!

336
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:35,005  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's dead.

337
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:36,893  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't think it was ever alive.

338
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,190  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's empty. No brain, just
the robot suit. It's for display.

339
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:49,748  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Transmitter!

340
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:00,818  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are not upgraded.

341
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:03,651  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, well, upgrade this.

342
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:14,684  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
What the hell was that thing?
Electromagnetic bomb.

343
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:18,641  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
It takes out computers,
I figured it might stop a cybersuit.

344
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:21,197  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, you figured right.
Now let's have a look.

345
00:25:21,237 --> 00:25:25,152  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Know your enemy. They've even
got the logo on the front.

346
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:28,019  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Lumic's turned them into a brand.

347
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:32,198  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Heart of steel.

348
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:36,377  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
But look. . .

349
00:25:38,977 --> 00:25:41,894  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that flesh? Mmm.

350
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:43,734  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
A central nervous system.

351
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:47,248  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
Artificially grown, threaded
through the suit so it responds
like a living thing.

352
00:25:47,288 --> 00:25:50,726  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, it is a living thing.

353
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:52,330  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, but look!

354
00:25:53,363 --> 00:25:55,599  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Emotional inhibitor.

355
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,440  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stops them feeling anything.

356
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,437  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
But why?

357
00:25:59,477 --> 00:26:00,955  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's still got a human brain.

358
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:02,675  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Imagine its reaction

359
00:26:02,715 --> 00:26:06,712  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
if it could see itself,
realise itself, inside this thing.

360
00:26:06,752 --> 00:26:09,428  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
It would go insane.

361
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:12,504  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
So they cut out the one
thing that makes them human.

362
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:14,859  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Because they have to.

363
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:17,936  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why. . .am I. . .cold?

364
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,172  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God, it's alive.

365
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,171  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
It can feel. We broke the inhibitor.

366
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:24,730  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

367
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,967  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why so cold?

368
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:28,607  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can you remember your name?

369
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:32,043  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sally. Sally Phelan.

370
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:33,681  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're a woman.

371
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:35,998  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where's Gareth?

372
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:37,638  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who's Gareth?

373
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:40,036  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
He can't see me.

374
00:26:40,076 --> 00:26:43,712  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's unlucky the night before.

375
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:45,990  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're getting married?

376
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,903  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm cold.

377
00:26:47,943 --> 00:26:51,180  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm so cold.

378
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,976  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's all right.
You sleep now, Sally.

379
00:26:55,016 --> 00:26:57,763  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just go to sleep.

380
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:04,249  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sally Phelan didn't die for nothing.

381
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,886  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Because that's the key,

382
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,683  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
the emotional inhibitor.

383
00:27:08,723 --> 00:27:12,120  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
If we can find the cancellation
code, feed it throughout the system

384
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,197  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
into every Cyberman's head,
they'd realise what they are.

385
00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:17,594  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
And what happens then?

386
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:19,107  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think it would kill them.

387
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,592  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can we do that?

388
00:27:22,632 --> 00:27:26,073  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've got to.
Before they kill everyone else.

389
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:29,699  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's no choice, Doctor.

390
00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:32,042  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's got to be done.

391
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:41,808  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
No! No, you didn't have to kill her!

392
00:27:41,848 --> 00:27:44,925  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sensors detect
a binary vascular system.

393
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:47,242  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are an unknown upgrade.

394
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:50,564  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
You will be taken for analysis.

395
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:02,422  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
The transmitter controls are sealed
behind here, we need oxy acetylene.

396
00:28:02,462 --> 00:28:05,301  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, and I forgot to bring it with me.
Then what do we do?

397
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:06,541  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
We crash the zeppelin.

398
00:28:06,581 --> 00:28:09,978  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
With us inside it? We could set it
on automatic and then just leg it.

399
00:28:10,018 --> 00:28:11,627  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let's have a look.

400
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:19,526  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's locked.
There's gotta be an override.

401
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:22,404  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Let me have a go.
I'm good with computers, trust me.

402
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:46,457  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've been captured, but don't worry,
Rose and Pete are still out there,

403
00:28:46,497 --> 00:28:48,617  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
they can rescue me.
Never mind. You OK?

404
00:28:48,657 --> 00:28:50,454  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

405
00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:52,131  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
But they got Jackie.

406
00:28:52,171 --> 00:28:54,411  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
We were too late. Lumic killed her.

407
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:56,007  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then where is he?

408
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:58,046  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
The famous Mr Lumic.

409
00:28:58,086 --> 00:29:00,885  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't we get the chance
to meet our lord and master?

410
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:03,521  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
He has been upgraded.

411
00:29:03,561 --> 00:29:06,719  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
So he's just like you.
He is superior.

412
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:11,179  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Lumic unit has been designated
Cybercontroller.

413
00:29:19,745 --> 00:29:22,021  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is the Age of Steel.

414
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:24,603  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I am its creator.

415
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:31,853  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm almost there.

416
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:33,901  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not bad work.

417
00:29:38,804 --> 00:29:40,567  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's moving!

418
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,801  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
You said it was dead!

419
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:45,718  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
A robot suit's still a good robot!
Wait!

420
00:29:45,758 --> 00:29:47,481  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hey, Cyberman! Over here!

421
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:52,739  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come on, you brainless lump
of metal! Come and have a go!

422
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:06,174  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, no!

423
00:30:06,214 --> 00:30:08,267  X1:078 X2:265 Y1:488 Y2:523
THEY SCREAM

424
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,614  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
The transmitter's down!

425
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,520  X1:078 X2:331 Y1:488 Y2:523
MUFFLED SCREAMS

426
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,357  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's my friends at work.
Good boys!

427
00:30:24,397 --> 00:30:27,951  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Lumic, I think that's
a vote for free will!

428
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:32,584  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
I have factories waiting
on seven continents.

429
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:39,058  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
If the Ear Pods have failed, then the
Cybermen will take humanity by force.

430
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:42,255  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
London has fallen.

431
00:30:42,295 --> 00:30:44,612  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
So shall the world.

432
00:30:44,652 --> 00:30:49,490  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
Hold on, I've logged on to
Cybercontrol. They're alive!
The Doctor and Rose, there they are!

433
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,127  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell is that thing?

434
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:53,804  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Shh! Has this thing got sound?

435
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:57,482  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
'I will bring peace to the world.

436
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,238  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Everlasting peace. . .'

437
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:03,075  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
and unity and uniformity.

438
00:31:03,115 --> 00:31:04,912  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
And imagination? What about that?

439
00:31:04,952 --> 00:31:08,947  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
The one thing that led you here,
imagination, you're killing it dead.

440
00:31:08,987 --> 00:31:11,023  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is your name?

441
00:31:11,063 --> 00:31:13,581  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm the Doctor. A redundant title.

442
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,540  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctors need not exist.

443
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,417  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cybermen never sicken.

444
00:31:17,457 --> 00:31:20,815  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, but that's it,
that's exactly the point.

445
00:31:20,855 --> 00:31:22,692  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, Lumic, you're a clever man.

446
00:31:22,732 --> 00:31:26,608  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'd call you a genius, except I'm
here. Everything you've invented,

447
00:31:26,648 --> 00:31:29,006  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
you did to fight your sickness
brilliant.

448
00:31:29,046 --> 00:31:30,726  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
That is so human.

449
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:36,561  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
But once you get rid of
sickness and mortality, then
what's there to strive for? Eh?

450
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:38,557  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Cybermen won't advance.

451
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,114  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
You'll just stop.

452
00:31:40,154 --> 00:31:42,274  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
You'll stay like this for ever.

453
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:46,265  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
A metal Earth
with metal men and metal thoughts.

454
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:50,421  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Lacking the one thing that makes
this planet so alive. People!

455
00:31:50,461 --> 00:31:54,220  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ordinary, stupid, brilliant, people!

456
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,136  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are proud of your emotions?

457
00:31:57,176 --> 00:31:58,296  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, yes!

458
00:31:58,336 --> 00:32:00,213  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then tell me, Doctor,

459
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:01,889  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
have you known grief?

460
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:04,208  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
And rage? And pain?

461
00:32:04,248 --> 00:32:06,287  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes. Yes, I have.

462
00:32:06,327 --> 00:32:08,044  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
And they hurt?

463
00:32:08,084 --> 00:32:09,844  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, yes.

464
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:12,040  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can set you free.

465
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,840  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Would you not want that?

466
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,758  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
A life without pain.

467
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:17,794  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
You might as well kill me.

468
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:20,633  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then I take that option.

469
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:22,466  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's not yours to take!

470
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:24,106  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're a Cybercontroller.

471
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:26,824  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
You don't control me,
or anything with a heart.

472
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:29,460  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
You have no means of stopping me.

473
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,818  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
I have an army. A species of my own.

474
00:32:33,858 --> 00:32:36,135  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
You just don't get it, do you?

475
00:32:36,175 --> 00:32:37,852  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
An army's nothing.

476
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:42,849  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
Cos those ordinary people,
they're the key. The most ordinary
person can change the world.

477
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:44,649  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Some ordinary man or woman,

478
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:49,484  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
some idiot. All it takes is for him
to find, say, the right numbers. . .

479
00:32:49,524 --> 00:32:54,197  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
Say, the right code, say,
for example, the code behind
the emotional inhibitor.

480
00:32:54,237 --> 00:32:58,631  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
The code right in front of him.
Cos even an idiot knows
his computers, these days.

481
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:02,825  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Knows how to get past
firewalls and passwords.

482
00:33:02,865 --> 00:33:07,820  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
How to find something encrypted in
the Lumic Family database, under
what was it, Pete, binary what?

483
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,857  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Binary nine. Binary nine! !
An idiot could find that code!

484
00:33:11,897 --> 00:33:18,931  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
A cancellation code. He'd keep
on typing, keep on fighting,
anything to save his friends.

485
00:33:18,971 --> 00:33:21,088  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Your words are irrelevant.

486
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:23,805  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, talk too much,
that's my problem.

487
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:26,761  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Lucky I got you that cheap tariff,
Rose. For all our chats.

488
00:33:26,801 --> 00:33:29,319  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
On your phone. The phone!

489
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,996  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
You will be deleted.

490
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:33,355  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes. Delete. Control. Hash.

491
00:33:33,395 --> 00:33:35,873  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then, of course, my particular
favourite. Send!

492
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:40,744  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Let's not forget how you seduced
all those ordinary people.

493
00:33:40,784 --> 00:33:43,461  X1:078 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
MESSAGE ALERT
By making technology
compatible with everything else.

494
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:44,501  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's for you!

495
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:46,059  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like this!

496
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:57,724  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes!

497
00:34:08,521 --> 00:34:10,159  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

498
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:22,620  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
What have you done?
I gave them back their souls.

499
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,740  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
They can see what you've done,
Lumic.

500
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,214  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
And it's killing them.
Delete! Delete! Delete!

501
00:34:28,254 --> 00:34:31,331  X1:078 X2:281 Y1:488 Y2:523
LUMIC GROANS

502
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:46,357  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's no way out!

503
00:34:47,156 --> 00:34:51,351  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
What are you doing?
If that factory blows, this
balloon'll ignite. Take it back!

504
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:53,808  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mickey, they've had it.
I said, take it back!

505
00:34:57,426 --> 00:34:59,621  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're not leaving them behind.

506
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:02,124  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's no way
we are leaving them behind.

507
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,895  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hold it!

508
00:35:12,848 --> 00:35:15,013  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose, can you hear me?
Head for the roof!

509
00:35:15,053 --> 00:35:16,742  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
He says head for the roof.

510
00:35:30,989 --> 00:35:33,037  X1:078 X2:237 Y1:488 Y2:523
HE GROANS

511
00:35:34,427 --> 00:35:37,499  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
No!

512
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:51,015  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mickey, where did you learn
to fly that thing? !

513
00:35:51,055 --> 00:35:54,246  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Playstation! Just hold on, Rose,
I'm coming to get you.

514
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:05,910  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
You can't go any lower! I've got to!

515
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,267  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're gonna crush them!

516
00:36:08,307 --> 00:36:10,985  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's gotta be something,
there's got to be.

517
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:12,259  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, yes!

518
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:19,801  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've got to be kidding.
Rose, get on!

519
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:25,233  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hold on tight, we're going up!

520
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:30,055  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Welcome to Mickey Smith airlines,
please enjoy your flight!

521
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,206  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
We did it! We did it!

522
00:36:45,229 --> 00:36:47,277  X1:078 X2:253 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE SHRIEKS

523
00:37:04,249 --> 00:37:07,082  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Pete! Take this!

524
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:09,609  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Use it!

525
00:37:09,649 --> 00:37:13,500  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hold the button down and press
it against the rope. Just do it!

526
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:17,796  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jackie Tyler.

527
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,798  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is for her.

528
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:33,878  X1:078 X2:249 Y1:488 Y2:523
HE SCREAMS

529
00:38:14,163 --> 00:38:17,433  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
So, what happens inside that thing
then? Do you want to see?

530
00:38:17,473 --> 00:38:18,957  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't think so.

531
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:24,184  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
But you two,
all that stuff you said.

532
00:38:24,224 --> 00:38:26,038  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
About different worlds.

533
00:38:27,749 --> 00:38:29,262  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who are you?

534
00:38:31,024 --> 00:38:33,732  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's like you said.

535
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:37,729  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Imagine there are different worlds,

536
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:39,446  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
parallel worlds.

537
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:42,244  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Worlds with another Pete Tyler.

538
00:38:43,732 --> 00:38:46,281  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
And Jackie Tyler, still alive.

539
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:48,533  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
And their daughter.

540
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:54,160  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got to go.
But if you just look inside. . .

541
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,508  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
I can't. There's all those
Lumic factories out there,
all those Cybermen in storage.

542
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:02,875  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Someone's got to tell
the authorities what happened.

543
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:08,666  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose, I've only got
five minutes of power.

544
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:14,137  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
We've got to go.
The Doctor could show you.
Thank you. . .for everything.

545
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:15,661  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dad. . .

546
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:20,157  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't. Just don't.

547
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:36,812  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here it is.

548
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,788  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
I found it, not a crease.

549
00:39:40,828 --> 00:39:43,944  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
My suit! Good man!

550
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:47,140  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now then, Jake, we've got to run,
but one more thing.

551
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,376  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mrs Moore.
Her real name was Angela Price.

552
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:52,853  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
She's got a husband out there,
and children.

553
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:56,330  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Find them. Tell them how
she died saving the world.

554
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,167  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah. Course I will.

555
00:39:58,207 --> 00:39:59,727  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Off we go then.

556
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:01,524  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um. . .

557
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:03,082  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thing is, I'm staying.

558
00:40:03,122 --> 00:40:06,200  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're doing what?

559
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,037  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
But you can't.
It sort of balances out.

560
00:40:09,077 --> 00:40:12,074  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cos this world lost its Ricky,
but there's me.

561
00:40:12,114 --> 00:40:15,512  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
And there's work to be done with
all those Cybermen still out there.

562
00:40:15,552 --> 00:40:18,671  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
But you can't stay.

563
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:20,309  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose, my gran's here.

564
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,499  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
She's still alive.
My old gran, remember her? Yeah.

565
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:27,976  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
She needs me.

566
00:40:28,016 --> 00:40:30,373  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
What about me, what if I need you?

567
00:40:30,413 --> 00:40:32,373  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, but Rose,

568
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:34,369  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
you don't.

569
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:36,667  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's just you and him, isn't it?

570
00:40:39,923 --> 00:40:42,322  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
We had something
a long time ago, but. . .

571
00:40:42,362 --> 00:40:44,721  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
not any more.

572
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:46,877  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, we'll come back.

573
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:49,395  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
We can travel anywhere!
Come and see you, yeah?

574
00:40:49,435 --> 00:40:50,919  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
We can't.

575
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:56,709  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
I told you, travel between
parallel worlds is impossible.

576
00:40:56,749 --> 00:40:59,506  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
We got here by accident.
We fell through a crack in time.

577
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:02,168  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
When we leave, I've got to close it.

578
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:06,544  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
We can't ever return.

579
00:41:12,611 --> 00:41:14,829  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor.

580
00:41:15,128 --> 00:41:18,245  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Take Rose's phone.
It's got the Code, get it out there,

581
00:41:18,285 --> 00:41:20,338  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
stop those factories.

582
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:24,162  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
And good luck. . .

583
00:41:25,956 --> 00:41:28,993  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey the Idiot. Watch it!

584
00:41:42,098 --> 00:41:43,656  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thanks.

585
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:47,932  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've had a laugh though,
haven't we?

586
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,184  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Seen it all. Been there and back.

587
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:57,344  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
Who'd have thought
me and you off that old estate,
flying through the stars.

588
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:59,551  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
All those years, just sitting there.

589
00:42:01,015 --> 00:42:04,531  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Imagining what we'd do one day.

590
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:06,954  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
We never saw this, did we?

591
00:42:14,803 --> 00:42:16,441  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go on. Don't miss your flight.

592
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,747  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jake, you want to watch this.

593
00:42:49,925 --> 00:42:52,598  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell? !

594
00:42:52,638 --> 00:42:55,556  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's the Doctor. In the Tardis.

595
00:42:55,596 --> 00:42:57,569  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
With Rose Tyler.

596
00:43:05,067 --> 00:43:07,115  X1:078 X2:311 Y1:488 Y2:523
TARDIS PULSATES

597
00:43:12,138 --> 00:43:14,098  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're alive!

598
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:16,174  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, Mum, you're alive!

599
00:43:16,214 --> 00:43:18,731  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, I was the last time I looked.

600
00:43:18,771 --> 00:43:21,333  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
What is it?
What happened, sweetheart?

601
00:43:21,373 --> 00:43:23,766  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's wrong? Where did you go?

602
00:43:23,806 --> 00:43:29,197  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Far away. That was. . .far away.

603
00:43:29,237 --> 00:43:31,825  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where's Mickey? He's gone home.

604
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:47,862  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
I know it's not easy, with my
face looking exactly like Ricky.

605
00:43:47,902 --> 00:43:50,180  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
But I'm different,
I'm not replacing him.

606
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,377  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
But we can remember him,
by fighting in his name.

607
00:43:55,253 --> 00:43:59,328  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:416 Y2:523
All those cyberfactories
out there, do you think
there'd be one in Paris?

608
00:43:59,368 --> 00:44:02,008  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah. Then let's go
and liberate Paris!

609
00:44:02,048 --> 00:44:04,590  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
What, you and me? In a van?

610
00:44:05,365 --> 00:44:07,319  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nothing wrong with a van!

611
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,436  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
I once saved the universe
with a big yellow truck!

612
00:44:30,936 --> 00:44:33,932  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:344 Y2:415
There you go, sir.
All wired up for the grand occasion.

613
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:35,900  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
WOMAN: Someone help me please!

614
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:39,991  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Ordinary people are being struck
down and changed and the only
new thing is a television.

615
00:44:48,873 --> 00:44:50,794  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Men in black?

616
00:44:50,834 --> 00:44:52,392  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Vanishing police cars?

617
00:44:52,432 --> 00:44:55,269  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is Churchill's England,
not Stalin's Russia!

618
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:58,145  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you sitting comfortably? Good.

619
00:44:58,185 --> 00:45:00,113  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then we'll begin.

620
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:17,532  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
