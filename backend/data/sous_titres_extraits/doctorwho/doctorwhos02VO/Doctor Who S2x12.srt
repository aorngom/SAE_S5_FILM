out. D'you remember that?

92
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,923  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, you've got to make an effort.
You've got to want it, sweetheart.

93
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,725  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
And the more you want
it, the stronger it gets?

94
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:05,325  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sort of, yeah.

95
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:11,034  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
Like a psychic link. Of course you
want your old dad to be alive, but
you're wishing him into existence.

96
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:14,390  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
The ghosts are using that to pull
themselves in. You're spoiling it.

97
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,904  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm sorry, Jackie, but there's
no smell, there's no cigarettes.

98
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:21,024  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just the memory. If they're
not ghosts, what are they, then?

99
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:24,739  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, but they're human!
You can see them! They look human!

00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,337  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
She's got a point.
I mean, they're all sort of blurred,
but they're definitely people.

101
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:31,693  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maybe not.

102
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:35,009  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're pressing themselves
into the surface of the world.

103
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:37,967  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
But a footprint
doesn't look like a boot.

104
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:40,964  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
So what have we got?
Any sign of that power loss?

105
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:43,201  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
No problems. Must've been a glitch.

106
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:45,918  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523

109
00:07:52,392 --> 00:07:54,559  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523

Did they tell you?

111
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:02,059  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
R&D came up with a new
spectrometer yesterday.

112
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,137  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Barged in here,
all full of themselves.

113
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:11,011  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
Said they could detect
the heat off a single protozoa
through half a mile of steel.

114
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:13,448  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
And what did they find?

115
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:17,685  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nothing. It gave them nothing.

116
00:08:17,725 --> 00:08:19,525  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Same as ever.

117
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,801  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
The machines keep saying
that the Sphere can't exist.

118
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:27,273  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
But there it is.

119
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:28,871  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Anything we can do?'

120
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:31,228  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, I'm all right.

121
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:32,948  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's just...

122
00:08:32,988 --> 00:08:34,946  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gets into your head, this thing.

123
00:08:34,986 --> 00:08:37,702  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like it's staring at you.

124
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:40,819  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
'We'll catch up later. Thanks, Raj.'
Yeah.

125
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:19,578  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
Matt, get on to
hospitality, send Rajesh something,
he's going mad down there.

126
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:21,057  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not alcohol!

127
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:01,519  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yvonne, I'm gonna double-check the
stacks. Just in case. Sure.

128
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:08,406  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yvonne, I'm gonna cross-reference
the levels with the Sphere.

129
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:10,484  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, fine.

130
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:12,720  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
And they think we haven't noticed.

131
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,114  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come on, we'll be all right down
here. Just two minutes.

132
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,673  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
This out of bounds.

133
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:23,429  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
Yeah, and that's the point.
It's completely safe,
they're just building new offices.

134
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:26,707  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
What about the workmen? They're
allocated somewhere else.

135
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:28,823  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's not worth it for a snog!

136
00:10:28,863 --> 00:10:32,429  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
It is! Come on!

137
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:44,889  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gareth?

138
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:48,245  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't be daft. Where have you gone?

139
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:49,928  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gareth?!

140
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,642  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look, I'm gonna head back.
I'm seeing you tonight anyway.

141
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,638  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gareth?

142
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:01,715  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm gonna go back to work.

143
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:08,277  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is it. ..I'm going.

144
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:14,721  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
See ya.

145
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:25,761  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now stop it. Gareth.

146
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:27,820  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm not kidding, just stop it.

147
00:11:32,715 --> 00:11:35,473  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sorry, I'm just
looking for my friend.

148
00:11:35,513 --> 00:11:38,465  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did anyone come down here?

149
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:44,518  X1:078 X2:265 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE SCREAMS

150
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:49,178  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
According to the paper, they've
elected a ghost as MP for Leeds.

151
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:52,018  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now, don't tell me you're gonna do
nothing.

152
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:54,691  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
# Who ya gonna call?
Ghostbusters!

153
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:56,955  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
# I ain't 'fraid of no ghosts! #

154
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:05,760  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
When's the next shift? Quarter to.

155
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,477  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
But don't go causing trouble.
What's that lot do?

156
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:12,754  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Triangulates their point of origin.
I don't suppose it's the Gelth? Nah!

157
00:12:12,794 --> 00:12:17,387  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
They came through one little rift.
This lot are transposing
themselves over the whole planet.

158
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:19,106  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like tracing paper.

159
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:22,662  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're always doing this. Reducing
it to science. Why can't it be real?

160
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:24,660  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just think of it, though.

161
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,540  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
All the people we've lost,
our families, coming back home.

162
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,256  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't you think it's beautiful?

163
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:32,893  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think it's horrific.

164
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:35,191  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose! Give us a hand.

165
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:48,236  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Soon as the cone's activated, if
that line goes into the red, press
that button. If it doesn't stop...

166
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:52,231  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Setting 15B, hold it against
the port, eight seconds and stop.
15B, eight seconds.

167
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:56,107  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523
If it goes into the blue,
activate the deep scan.
Hang on a minute, I know...

168
00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:58,664  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's that one. Close.

169
00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:00,882  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
That one? Now you'vejust killed us.

170
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:06,178  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Er, it's that one. Yep! Now what
have we got? Two minutes to go.

171
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:09,573  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Two minutes till the next shift,
let's make it a good one, people.

172
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:13,100  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come on, you two! Sorry we're late.
Save it till later. Sorry we're late.

173
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:15,700  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
And powering up!

174
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:22,808  X1:078 X2:387 Y1:488 Y2:523
INTERMITTENT BEEPING

175
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,537  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's the line doing?
It's all right, it's holding!

176
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:47,973  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
You even look like him.

177
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:50,290  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
How d'you mean?

178
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,848  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
S'pose I do, yeah.

179
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:57,083  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've changed so much.
For the better. I suppose.

180
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:59,759  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mum, I used to work in a shop!

181
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:03,237  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've worked in shops, what's wrong
with that? No, I didn't mean...

182
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:05,993  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
I know what you meant.
What happens when I'm gone?

183
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:10,068  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't talk like that. No, but really.

184
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:15,702  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
When I'm dead and buried, you won't
have any reason to come back home.
What happens then? I don't know.

185
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:17,385  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
D'you think you'd ever settle down?

186
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,059  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Doctor never will, so I can't.

187
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:22,619  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll just keep on travelling.

188
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:25,295  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
And you'll keep on changing.

189
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:31,367  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
In 40 years time, 50, there'll be
this woman, this strange woman,
walking through the marketplace,

190
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:34,680  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
on some planet,
a billion miles from Earth.

191
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,274  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
But she's not Rose Tyler...not
any more. She's not even human.

192
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,287  X1:102 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
THE DOCTOR: Here we go!

193
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:48,148  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Scanner's working!
It says, delta one six!

194
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:51,913  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on then. You beauty!

195
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:57,620  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
And...we're into Ghost Shift.

196
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,248  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523

197
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:35,335  X1:078 X2:281 Y1:488 Y2:523
ALARM BUZZES

198
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:39,496  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
What have we got?

199
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:41,893  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Something's interfering
with the Ghost Field.

200
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:45,169  X1:066 X2:459 Y1:452 Y2:523
- Location?
- It's close, it's within the city.

201
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:50,202  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't like that much, do you?

202
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:53,599  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who are you?
Where are you coming from?

203
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,036  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
OH-H! That's more like it!
Not so friendly now, are you?

204
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:59,392  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Close it down! Close it down!

205
00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:00,950  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523

206
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:15,057  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
It was a very specific
excitation of the Ghost Field,

207
00:16:15,097 --> 00:16:17,335  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
but that makes it easy to pinpoint.

208
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,332  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Almost there.

209
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,252  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
South London,

210
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:23,565  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
South-East 15.

211
00:16:23,605 --> 00:16:27,524  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's a council estate,
the Powell Estate.

212
00:16:27,564 --> 00:16:29,719  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
SE15 7GO.

213
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,996  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
It was a public area.

214
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:34,034  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can
we patch into the CCTV network?

215
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:35,433  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doing it now.

216
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:43,197  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Here we go.
We've got a camera within 50 yards.

217
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:47,061  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God!

218
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:49,059  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is it him?

219
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:51,232  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's him.

220
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,495  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Those ghosts are being forced into
existence from one specific point!

221
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:57,588  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
And I can track down the source!
Allons-y!

222
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,678  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's coming.

223
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,217  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rajesh! It's him!

224
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:26,621  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now we've got you.

225
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:30,058  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
I like that, allons-y. I should say
allons-y more often. Allons-y!

226
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:31,815  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look sharp, Rose Tyler, allons-y!

227
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:34,532  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
It would be brilliant
if I met someone called Alonso.

228
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:38,526  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
Cos then I could say,
"Allons-y, Alonso!" every time!
You're staring at me!

229
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:40,574  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
My mum's still on board.

230
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:45,314  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
If we end up on Mars,
I'm gonna kill you.

231
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,809  X1:078 X2:365 Y1:488 Y2:523
INDISTINCT SHOUTING

232
00:17:58,106 --> 00:18:01,504  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
There goes the
advantage of surprise.

233
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:03,422  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Still, cuts to the chase.

234
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:05,059  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stay in here, look after Jackie.

235
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:06,857  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am not looking after my mum!

236
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:10,693  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, you brought her!
I was kidnapped!

237
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,571  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor! They've got guns.

238
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:16,569  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
And I haven't, which makes me
the better person, don't you think?

239
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:19,403  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
They can shoot me dead, but the
moral high ground is mine!

240
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:22,602  X1:102 X2:331 Y1:488 Y2:523
SOLDIER: Hold it!

241
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:25,344  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh...

242
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,508  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, how marvellous!

243
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:37,025  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, very good!

244
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:39,732  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Superb. Happy day!

245
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,858  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um. Thanks.

246
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:46,655  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice to meet you. I'm the Doctor.

247
00:18:46,695 --> 00:18:48,748  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, I should say. Hooray!

248
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,689  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
You... You've heard of me, then?

249
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:59,440  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Well, of course we have.
And I have to say, if it wasn't for
you, none of us would be here.

250
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,579  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Doctor AND the Tardis!

251
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,147  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
And... And... And you are?
Oh, plenty of time for that.

252
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:15,586  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
According to the records,
you don't travel alone.

253
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:19,382  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Doctor and his companion,
that's the pattern, isn't that right?

254
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:24,217  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
No point in hiding anything.
Not from us. So, where is she?

255
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:29,008  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yes, sorry, good point.
She's just a bit shy, that's all.

256
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:31,431  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
But here she is - Rose Tyler!

257
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:34,562  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's not the best I've ever had.

258
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:37,878  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Bit too blonde. Not too steady
on her pins. Lot of that...

259
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:41,556  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
And just last week, she stared
into the heart of the Time Vortex

260
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,474  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
and aged 57 years, but she'll do.

261
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:46,273  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm 40! Deluded. Bless.

262
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:50,267  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'll have to trade her in, d'you
need anyone? She's very good at tea.

263
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:52,585  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, I say very good,
I mean not bad.

264
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,901  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, I say not bad...
Anyway! Lead on! Allons-y!

265
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:58,019  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
But not too fast, her ankle's going.

266
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,317  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'll show you where
my ankle's going!

267
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,767  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
It was only a matter of
time until you found us.

268
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,723  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
And at last you've made it!

269
00:20:10,763 --> 00:20:12,523  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'd like to welcome you, Doctor.

270
00:20:12,563 --> 00:20:15,265  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Welcome to Torchwood.

271
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:23,122  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's a Jathaa Sun Glider.

272
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:27,229  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Came down to Earth off the
Shetland Islands, ten years ago.

273
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,306  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
What, did it crash?
No, we shot it down.

274
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:32,023  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
They violated our earthspace.
Then we stripped it bare.

275
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:35,260  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
The weapon that destroyed
the Sycorax, on Christmas Day?

276
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,387  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
That was us.
Now if you'd like to come with me.

277
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,015  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Torchwood Institute has a motto.

278
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:43,209  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
"If it's alien, it's ours."

279
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:48,525  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
Anything that comes from the sky,
we strip it down, and we use it,
for the good of the British Empire.

280
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:52,440  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:416 Y2:523
The good of the what?
The British Empire.
There isn't a British Empire.

281
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,636  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not yet. Excuse me,
now if you wouldn't mind...

282
00:20:56,676 --> 00:20:59,913  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
D'you recognise this, Doctor?
That's a particle gun.

283
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:02,631  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Good, isn't it? Took us
eight years to get it to work.

284
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:05,587  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's the 21st century.
You can't have particle guns!

285
00:21:05,627 --> 00:21:10,542  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
We must defend our border
against the alien. ..Thank you.
Sebastian, isn't it? Yes, ma'am.

286
00:21:10,582 --> 00:21:13,938  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thank you. ..It's very
important to know everyone by name.

287
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:16,136  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Torchwood is a very
modern organisation.

288
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:20,369  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:416 Y2:523
People skills, that's what
it's all about these days.
I'm a people person.

289
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:24,445  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Have you got anyone called Alonso?
I don't think so. Is that important?

290
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:27,004  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
I s'pose not, what was your name?

291
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:28,960  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yvonne, Yvonne Hartman.

292
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,722  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ah, yes,
now we're rather fond of these.

293
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:36,035  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Magna-clamp, found in a spaceship
buried at the base of Mount Snowdon.

294
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:38,552  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Attach this to an object,
and it cancels the mass.

295
00:21:38,592 --> 00:21:41,748  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
I could use it to lift two tons
of weight with a single hand.

296
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:45,347  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's an Imperial Ton, by the way,
Torchwood refuses to go metric.

297
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,703  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
I could do with that
to carry the shopping.

298
00:21:47,743 --> 00:21:51,560  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
All these devices are for Torchwood's
benefit. Not the general public's.

299
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:55,407  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
So what about these ghosts?

300
00:21:57,011 --> 00:22:01,486  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ah, yes, the ghosts. They're
what you might call a side effect.

301
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:04,882  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Of what? All in good time, Doctor!
There is an itinerary, trust me.

302
00:22:04,922 --> 00:22:07,320  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oi, where are you taking that?

303
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,416  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
If it's alien, it's ours. You'll
never get inside it. Etcetera.

304
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:32,731  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Psychic paper, psychic paper.

305
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:49,712  X1:078 X2:241 Y1:488 Y2:523
HE MOUTHS

306
00:23:08,658 --> 00:23:12,012  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
But all the times I've been on
Earth, I've never heard of you.

307
00:23:12,052 --> 00:23:14,129  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, of course not!
You're the enemy.

308
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:18,724  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
You're actually named in the
Torchwood Foundation Charter of
1879, as an enemy of the Crown.

309
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,603  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
1879? That was called Torchwood,
that house in Scotland.

310
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:24,638  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right. Where you encountered
Queen Victoria and the werewolf.

311
00:23:24,678 --> 00:23:26,117  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think he makes half of it up.

312
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:31,312  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
Her Majesty created the Torchwood
Institute for the express intention
of keeping Britain great,

313
00:23:31,352 --> 00:23:33,391  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
and fighting the alien horde.

314
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:37,425  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
But if I'm the enemy, does that mean
I'm a prisoner? Oh, yes.

315
00:23:37,465 --> 00:23:42,102  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
But we'll make you perfectly
comfortable, and there is so much
you can teach us.

316
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:44,195  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
..Starting with this.

317
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:53,843  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now, what d'you make of that?

318
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:00,239  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
You must be The Doctor.

319
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:04,005  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rajesh Singh, it's an honour, sir.
Yeah...

320
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:07,953  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
What is that thing?
We've got no idea.

321
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:10,190  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's wrong with it?

322
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,388  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
What makes you think there's
something wrong with it? I dunno.

323
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:16,427  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
It feels weird. The Sphere
has that effect on everyone.

324
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:18,063  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Makes you want to run and hide.

325
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:20,181  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like it's forbidden.

326
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:23,178  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've tried analysing it,
using every device imaginable.

327
00:24:23,218 --> 00:24:26,813  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
But according to our instruments,
the Sphere doesn't exist.

328
00:24:26,853 --> 00:24:29,369  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
It weighs nothing. It doesn't age.

329
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:32,486  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
No heat, no radiation

330
00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:34,084  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
and has no atomic mass.

331
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:36,001  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
But I can see it.

332
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:40,598  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523
Fascinating, isn't it?
It upsets people,
because it gives off nothing.

333
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:42,796  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
It is absent.

334
00:24:42,836 --> 00:24:44,954  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, Doctor?

335
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:46,717  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is a Void Ship.

336
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,508  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
And what is that?

337
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:53,545  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, it's impossible, for starters.

338
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:56,624  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
I always thought it was
just a theory, but...

339
00:24:56,664 --> 00:24:59,779  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's a vessel designed to exist
outside time and space.

340
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:03,590  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Travelling through the Void.

341
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:07,088  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
And what's the Void?

342
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:12,164  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
The space between dimensions.
There's all sorts of realities
around us, different dimensions,

343
00:25:12,204 --> 00:25:17,678  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
billions of parallel universes,
all stacked up against each other.
The Void is the space in between.

344
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:20,075  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Containing absolutely nothing.

345
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:22,273  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can you imagine that? Nothing.

346
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,991  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
No light, no dark, no up, no down.

347
00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:26,310  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
No life. No time.

348
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,834  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Without end.

349
00:25:29,388 --> 00:25:32,789  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
My people called it the Void,
the Eternals called it the Howling.

350
00:25:34,025 --> 00:25:37,299  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
But some people call it Hell.

351
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:41,371  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
But someone built the Sphere,
what for? Why go there?

352
00:25:41,411 --> 00:25:43,290  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
To explore.

353
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,010  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
To escape?

354
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,603  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
You could sit inside it and eternity
would pass you by. The Big Bang...

355
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:53,041  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:416 Y2:523
the end of the universe,
start of the next, wouldn't
even touch the sides.

356
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:55,478  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
You'd exist outside
the whole of creation.

357
00:25:55,518 --> 00:25:58,320  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
You see, we were right.
There is something inside it.

358
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,832  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, yes.

359
00:26:00,872 --> 00:26:03,072  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
So how do we get in there?
We don't.

360
00:26:03,112 --> 00:26:06,189  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
We send it back into hell. How did
it get here in the first place?

361
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:08,747  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Sphere came through,
into this world.

362
00:26:08,787 --> 00:26:11,489  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
And the ghosts followed in its wake.
Show me.

363
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,058  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, Doctor!

364
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:26,526  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't get it. What is it?
What am I supposed to be looking for?

365
00:26:26,566 --> 00:26:28,494  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just go to the left.

366
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,479  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yvonne's gonna be back any minute.

367
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:35,960  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just go to the left.

368
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:39,666  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
What d'you mean, in here?

369
00:26:45,826 --> 00:26:48,568  X1:078 X2:285 Y1:488 Y2:523
MATT SCREAMS

370
00:27:54,913 --> 00:27:57,192  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Sphere came through here -

371
00:27:57,232 --> 00:27:59,365  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
a hole in the world.

372
00:28:00,865 --> 00:28:05,981  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
Not active at the moment.
But when we fire particle engines at
that exact spot, the breach opens up.

373
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:11,053  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
How did you even find it?
We'd been getting warning signs
for years, a radar black spot.

374
00:28:11,093 --> 00:28:13,650  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
So we built this place,
the Torchwood Tower.

375
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,048  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:452 Y2:523
The breach was 600ft above sea level,
it was the only way to reach it.

376
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:21,565  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
You built a skyscraper?
Just to reach a spatial disturbance?
How much money have you got?

377
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:23,078  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
Enough.

378
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,475  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hold on a minute.
We're in Canary Wharf. Must be.

379
00:28:30,515 --> 00:28:32,393  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
This building, it's Canary Wharf!

380
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:34,270  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
That is the public name for it.

381
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,866  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
To those in the know, it's Torchwood.
So you find the breach. Probe it.

382
00:28:37,906 --> 00:28:40,424  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Sphere comes through,
600ft above London, bam!

383
00:28:40,464 --> 00:28:45,975  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
It leaves a hole in the fabric of
reality, and that hole, you think,
ooh, shall we leave it alone?

384
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:50,091  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
Shall we back off?
Shall we play it safe?
No, you think, let's make it bigger!

385
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:52,129  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's a massive source of energy.

386
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:56,045  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
If we can harness that power,
we need never depend
on the Middle East again.

387
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:58,523  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
Britain will become
truly independent.

388
00:28:58,563 --> 00:29:01,919  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
But you can see for yourself. The
next Ghost Shift's in two minutes.

389
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:06,075  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cancel it. I don't think so.
I'm warning you. Cancel it.

390
00:29:06,115 --> 00:29:08,114  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
Exactly as the legends would have it!

391
00:29:08,154 --> 00:29:11,592  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Doctor, assuming alien authority
over the rights of Man.

392
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:15,153  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Let me show you.
Sphere comes through.

393
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:22,500  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:344 Y2:415
But when it made the hole,
it cracked the world around it.

394
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,016  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:344 Y2:415
The entire surface of
this dimension, splintered.

395
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:29,250  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
And that's how the ghosts
get through, they're bleeding
through the fault lines.

396
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,568  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Walking from their world,
across the Void, and into yours.

397
00:29:32,608 --> 00:29:38,996  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
With the human race hoping and
wishing and helping them along.
But too many ghosts, and...

398
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:44,996  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, in that case, we'll
have to be more careful.

399
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:47,433  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Positions! Ghost Shift in one minute.

400
00:29:47,473 --> 00:29:49,190  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Miss Hartman, please don't do it.

401
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,190  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
We have done this a thousand times.

402
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,147  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then stop, at a thousand.
We're in control of the ghosts.

403
00:29:54,187 --> 00:29:58,197  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
The levers can open the breach,
but, equally, they can close it.

404
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:01,935  X1:328 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK!

405
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:06,050  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sorry? Never mind! As you were.
What, is that it?

406
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,529  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, fair enough,
I've said my bit, don't mind me!

407
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:10,286  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Any chance of a cup of tea?

408
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:12,803  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ghost Shift in 20 seconds.

409
00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:15,564  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can't wait to see it!
You can't stop us, Doctor.

410
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:18,837  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
Absolutely not. Pull up a chair,
Rose. Come and watch the fireworks.

411
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:21,438  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ghost Shift in ten seconds.

412
00:30:21,478 --> 00:30:25,312  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nine, eight, seven,

413
00:30:25,352 --> 00:30:30,749  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
six, five, four, three, two...

414
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:34,196  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stop the Shift. I said stop!

415
00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:37,297  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you. I suppose it makes sense

416
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,457  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
to get as much intelligence
as possible.

417
00:30:39,497 --> 00:30:43,051  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:452 Y2:523
But the programme will recommence, as
soon as you've explained everything.

418
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,647  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm glad to be of help.
And someone clear up this glass.

419
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:50,014  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
They did warn me, Doctor. They
said you liked to make a mess.

420
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:57,095  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on.

421
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:30,976  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can I help you? I wasjust...

422
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:34,376  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Try not to look.
It does that to everyone.

423
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:36,890  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you want? Sorry, um...

424
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,410  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
They sent me from personnel.

425
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,884  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
They said some man had been taken
prisoner, some sort of Doctor.

426
00:32:41,924 --> 00:32:44,364  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm just
checking the lines of communication.

427
00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:47,959  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Did they tell you anything?
Can I see your authorisation?

428
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,278  X1:318 X2:399 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sure.

429
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:54,195  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, that's lucky.

430
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:57,432  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Everyone in Torchwood has at least
a basic level of psychic training.

431
00:32:57,472 --> 00:33:01,546  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
This paper is blank
and you're a fake.

432
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:03,943  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Seal the room. And call security.

433
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,745  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Samuel?

434
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:08,217  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can you check the door locks?
She walked right in.

435
00:33:08,257 --> 00:33:09,741  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doing it now, sir.

436
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,751  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well,
if you'd like to take a seat...

437
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:23,322  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
So these ghosts, whatever they are,
did they build the Sphere?

438
00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:27,241  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Must have. Aimed it at this
dimension like a cannonball.

439
00:33:27,281 --> 00:33:29,237  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Yvonne?
I think you should see this.

440
00:33:29,277 --> 00:33:32,034  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
'We've got a visitor.
I don't know who she is,

441
00:33:32,074 --> 00:33:35,435  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
'but funnily enough, she arrived
at the same time as the Doctor.'

442
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:39,387  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is she one of yours?

443
00:33:39,427 --> 00:33:41,261  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Never seen her before in my life.

444
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:43,139  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good, then we can have her shot.

445
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:46,619  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, all right, then,
it was worth a try.

446
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:48,493  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's... That's Rose Tyler.

447
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,053  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry.

448
00:33:50,093 --> 00:33:51,850  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello!

449
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,448  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, if that's Rose Tyler,
who's she?

450
00:33:54,488 --> 00:33:57,487  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm her mother.
Oh, you travel with her mother?

451
00:33:57,527 --> 00:34:01,242  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
He kidnapped me. When Torchwood
comes to write my complete history,

452
00:34:01,282 --> 00:34:05,717  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
don't tell people
that I time travelled
with her mother. Oh, charming.

453
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:09,075  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got a reputation to uphold.
Excuse me, everyone!

454
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:11,873  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thought I said,
stop the Ghost Shift.

455
00:34:11,913 --> 00:34:15,069  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who started the programme?
I ordered you to stop.

456
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:18,426  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who's doing that? Right, step away
from your monitors, everyone.

457
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:22,112  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Gareth? Adi?
Stop what you're doing, right now.

458
00:34:23,018 --> 00:34:26,055  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Matt! Step away from your desk,
that's an order.

459
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:29,809  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Stop the levers. Andrew!
Stop the levers! What's she doing?

460
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:32,529  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Adi, step away from the desk.

461
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:35,646  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Listen to me, step away from
the desk! She can't hear you.

462
00:34:35,686 --> 00:34:38,433  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're overriding the system.

463
00:34:39,603 --> 00:34:42,026  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're going into Ghost Shift.

464
00:34:45,557 --> 00:34:49,071  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yvonne, I thought you said the
next Ghost Shift was cancelled.

465
00:34:49,111 --> 00:34:52,723  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's going on? Yvonne?

466
00:34:54,345 --> 00:34:56,154  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
It can't be...

467
00:35:04,017 --> 00:35:07,130  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's active.
It's the earpiece. Controlling them.

468
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,450  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've seen this before.

469
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,367  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

470
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:13,415  X1:078 X2:221 Y1:488 Y2:523
THEY YELL

471
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:18,199  X1:078 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
What happened, what did you just do?

472
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,719  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're dead. You killed them.

473
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:23,553  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:416 Y2:523
Someone else did that.
But you killed them.
I haven't got time for this!

474
00:35:23,593 --> 00:35:28,950  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
What are these earpieces? Don't.
How does it control them?
Trust me, leave them alone.

475
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,510  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
But what are they?

476
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:33,263  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ugh! Oh, God!

477
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:35,301  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
It goes inside their brain!

478
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:40,459  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
What about the Ghost Shift?
90% there, and still running.
Can't you stop it?

479
00:35:40,499 --> 00:35:44,452  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523
They're still controlling it,
they've hijacked the system.
Who's "they"?

480
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:48,686  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Might be a remote transmitter,
but it's got to be close by. I can
trace it! Jackie, stay here.

481
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:51,598  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Keep those levers down!
Keep them offline!

482
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:57,600  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
We've got a problem down here.
Yvonne, can you hear me? Yvonne,
for God's sake,

483
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,954  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
the Sphere is active,
the readings are going wild,

484
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:05,950  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
it's got weight, it's got mass and
an electromagnetic field, it exists!

485
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,068  X1:078 X2:207 Y1:488 Y2:523
BANGING

486
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:12,164  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
The door's sealed. Automatic
quarantine. We can't get out.

487
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:18,934  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's OK. We've beaten them before,
we can beat them again.
That why I'm here. The fight goes on.

488
00:36:18,974 --> 00:36:20,454  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
The fight against what?

489
00:36:20,494 --> 00:36:22,297  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
What d'you think?

490
00:36:31,443 --> 00:36:35,095  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:523
You two! You come with us! This way.

491
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:47,664  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's down here?

492
00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:50,941  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know, I think it's
building work, it's just renovations.

493
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:53,193  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
You should go back. Think again.

494
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:07,124  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is it?

495
00:37:07,164 --> 00:37:08,727  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's down here?

496
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:12,241  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Earpieces. Ear Pods. This
world is colliding with another.

497
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:14,573  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I think I know which one.

498
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:21,385  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
What are they?
They came through first.

499
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:25,833  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
The advance guard.

500
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,173  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cybermen! Oh!

501
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:40,009  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
We had them beaten,
but then they escaped.

502
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,806  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Cybermen just vanished.

503
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:45,565  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
They found their way through
to this world, but so did we.

504
00:37:45,605 --> 00:37:47,563  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Doctor said that was impossible.

505
00:37:47,603 --> 00:37:51,797  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:416 Y2:523
Yeah, it's not the first
time he's been wrong.
What's inside that Sphere?

506
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:55,993  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
No-one knows. Cyber leader.
Cyber King. Emperor of the Cybermen.

507
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:58,711  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whatever it is, he's dead meat.

508
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:00,551  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's good to see you.

509
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:02,599  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah! It's good to see you too.

510
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:08,619  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Get away from the machines.
Do what they say, don't fight them.

511
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:10,776  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't shoot!

512
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:13,293  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Arrgh! Ah-arrgh!

513
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,133  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are they?

514
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:17,670  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
We are the Cybermen.

515
00:38:18,727 --> 00:38:23,107  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Ghost Shift
will be increased to 100%.

516
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:28,717  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
COMPUTER: Online.

517
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:31,220  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here come the ghosts.

518
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:43,064  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's extraordinary.

519
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:48,057  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
There are more ghosts then we've
ever seen before and it's happening
all over the world.

520
00:38:48,097 --> 00:38:52,118  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
As far as we know, the increase
in ghost activity is harmless.

521
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:57,271  X1:078 X2:225 Y1:488 Y2:523
MARCHING

522
00:39:01,163 --> 00:39:03,402  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can anyone hear me?

523
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:05,280  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on, I need help down here!

524
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,797  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
I need...

525
00:39:06,837 --> 00:39:09,504  X1:078 X2:379 Y1:488 Y2:523
SCREECHING, BANGING

526
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:14,710  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here we go.

527
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,737  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
But these Cybermen, what
have they got to do with the ghosts?

528
00:39:26,777 --> 00:39:29,413  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't you listen? A footprint
doesn't look like a boot.

529
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:33,291  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Achieving full transfer.

530
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:35,847  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're Cybermen.

531
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:39,499  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
All the ghosts are Cybermen!
Millions of them!

532
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,981  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right across the world.

533
00:39:56,304 --> 00:39:58,352  X1:078 X2:295 Y1:488 Y2:523
PEOPLE SCREAM

534
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:09,372  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're not ghosts,
they're metal men! Ar-r-rgh!

535
00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:11,670  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
I urge you, stay in your homes.

536
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,528  X1:078 X2:265 Y1:488 Y2:523
THEY SCREAM

537
00:40:31,587 --> 00:40:34,225  X1:078 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're invading the whole planet.

538
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,859  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's not an invasion.
It's too late for that.

539
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:39,737  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's a victory.

540
00:40:41,336 --> 00:40:42,974  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
COMPUTER: They're activated.

541
00:40:43,014 --> 00:40:47,210  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're activated.
They're activated.

542
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,383  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're activated.

543
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:57,695  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
I know what's in there. And I'm ready
for them. I've got just the thing.

544
00:41:03,115 --> 00:41:06,509  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is gonna blast them to hell.
Samuel? What are you doing?

545
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:08,426  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
The name's Mickey.

546
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,020  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey Smith. Defending the Earth!

547
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:19,815  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
The Cybermen don't have the
technology to build a
