1
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:07,281  X1:078 X2:237 Y1:488 Y2:523
SCREAMING

2
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:15,802  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
We are under attack.

3
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:17,442  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
There are creatures.

4
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:19,039  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't even think they're human.

5
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:21,117  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
We can't stop them.
The clock is broken.

6
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:22,637  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's coming.

7
00:00:22,677 --> 00:00:26,114  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did you hear what I said?

8
00:00:26,154 --> 00:00:27,634  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Listen to me.

9
00:00:27,674 --> 00:00:29,790  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
There is a man coming to Versailles.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,224  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
He has watched over me my whole life
and he will not desert me tonight.

11
00:00:33,264 --> 00:00:35,304  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
What are you talking about?
What man?

12
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:38,258  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
The only man, save you,
I have ever loved.

13
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:41,775  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, don't look like that, there's no
time. You have your duties.

14
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:45,290  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am your mistress, go to your Queen.

15
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,453  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you there? Can you hear me?

16
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,324  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
I need you now, you promised.

17
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:54,241  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
The clock on the mantel is broken!

18
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:55,801  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
It is time!

19
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:58,338  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor! Doctor!

20
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:51,061  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's a space ship. Brilliant!

21
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:53,140  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:344 Y2:379
I got a space ship on my first go!

22
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,900  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:344 Y2:379
Looks kind of abandoned.

23
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,816  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:344 Y2:379
Anyone on board? Nah, nothing here.

24
00:01:56,856 --> 00:01:58,613  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:344 Y2:379
Well, nothing dangerous.

25
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:00,690  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:344 Y2:379
Well, not that dangerous.

26
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,167  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
You know what?
I'll just have a quick scan. . .

27
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,484  X1:162 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
in case there's anything dangerous.

28
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:09,484  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
So, what's the date?
How far have we gone?

29
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:14,277  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
About 3, 000 years into
your future, give or take.

30
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:15,837  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
The 51st Century.

31
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:19,551  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Dagmar Cluster.
You're a long way from home, Mickey!

32
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:21,789  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Two and a half galaxies!

33
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:24,390  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey Smith, meet the universe.

34
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,186  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
. .See anything you like?

35
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:31,857  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's so. . .realistic!
Dear me, had some cowboys in here.

36
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:35,415  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Been a ton of repair work going on.

37
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,491  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now, that's odd, look at that!

38
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:41,448  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
All the warp engines are going.

39
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:47,443  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
Full capacity! There's enough
power running through this ship
to punch a hole in the universe.

40
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:49,239  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
And we're not moving.

41
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:53,317  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
So where's all that power going?
Where'd all the crew go?

42
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:55,115  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Good question.
No life readings on board.

43
00:02:55,155 --> 00:02:58,991  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, we're in deep space, they
didn't just nip out for a quick fag.

44
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:01,828  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, I've checked
all the smoking pods.

45
00:03:01,868 --> 00:03:03,585  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
You smell that?

46
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,657  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah. Someone's cooking.
Sunday roast, definitely.

47
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:17,331  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now, there's something you don't
see in your average space ship.

48
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:20,247  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
18th Century. French.

49
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:23,044  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice mantel.

50
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:25,840  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not a hologram.

51
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,039  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Not even a reproduction.
This actually is an 18th Century
French fireplace. Double sided.

52
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,996  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's another room through there.

53
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:35,792  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
It can't be, that's the outer
hull of the ship. Look! Hello.

54
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:39,187  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello. What's your name? Reinette.

55
00:03:39,227 --> 00:03:41,227  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Reinette? That's a lovely name.

56
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:43,461  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can you tell me where you
are, at the moment, Reinette?

57
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:48,538  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:452 Y2:523
In my bedroom. Where's your bedroom?
Where do you live, Reinette?

58
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:51,735  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Paris, of course. Paris! Right.

59
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:54,893  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Monsieur,
what are you doing in my fireplace?

60
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:58,325  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, just a routine. . .fire check.

61
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:03,283  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can you tell me what year it is?
Of course I can! 1727.

62
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:05,560  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right, lovely, one of my favourites.

63
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,035  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
August is rubbish though
stay indoors.

64
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:11,275  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK, that's all for now,
thanks for your help.

65
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:13,631  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hope you enjoy the rest of the fire.
Night night!

66
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:15,589  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good night, Monsieur.

67
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,909  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
You said this was the 51st Century.

68
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:22,102  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
I also said this ship was generating
enough power to punch a hole in the
universe. We just found the hole.

69
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:24,017  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Must be a spatio temporal hyperlink.

70
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:27,017  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's that?
No idea, just made it up.

71
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:28,533  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Didn't want to say "magic door".

72
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:33,251  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
And on the other side of the. . .
"magic door", it's France in 1727?

73
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,728  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, she was speaking French.

74
00:04:35,768 --> 00:04:39,282  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right period French too. She was
speaking English, I heard her.

75
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,322  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's the Tardis,
translates for you. Even French?

76
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:43,038  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yep!

77
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:44,926  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gotcha! Doctor!

78
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:10,488  X1:078 X2:317 Y1:488 Y2:523
HORSE WHINNEYS

79
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:15,983  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's OK! Don't scream, it's me.
It's the fireplace man, look!

80
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:20,560  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
We were talking. Just a moment ago.
I was in your fireplace.

81
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,009  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Monsieur, that was weeks ago.
That was months. Really?

82
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:32,108  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Must be a loose connection.

83
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:36,141  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Need to get a man in. Who are you
and what are you doing here?

84
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:39,060  X1:078 X2:189 Y1:488 Y2:523
TICKING

85
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,620  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK. That's scary.

86
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,254  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're scared of a broken clock?

87
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:44,574  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just a bit scared, yeah,
just a little tiny bit.

88
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:47,771  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cos you see, if this clock's broken,

89
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:50,308  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
and it's the only clock in
the room. . .then what's that?

90
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,999  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cos you see, that's not a clock.

91
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,156  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
You can tell by the resonance.

92
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,680  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
Too big.

93
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:10,228  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Six feet, I'd say. . .size of a man.

94
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:14,382  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is it? Now. Let's think.

95
00:06:14,422 --> 00:06:16,938  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
If you were a thing that ticked
and you were hiding in someone's
bedroom, first thing you'd do

96
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:20,908  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
break the clock. No one notices the
sound of one clock ticking, but two?

97
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:26,415  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
You might start to wonder if
you're really alone.

98
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:31,164  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
Stay on the bed.
Right in the middle.

99
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:33,541  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't put your hands
or feet over the edge!

100
00:06:58,014 --> 00:07:00,972  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Reinette, don't look round.

101
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:05,310  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
You stay exactly where you are.

102
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:12,600  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hold still, let me look.

103
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,163  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've been scanning her brain!

104
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:21,594  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
What, you've crossed two
galaxies and thousands of years
just to scan a child's brain?

105
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:25,744  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:416 Y2:523
What could there be in a little
girl's mind worth blowing
a hole in the universe?

106
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:27,462  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't understand.

107
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:29,461  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
It wants me?

108
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:32,178  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
You want me?

109
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,738  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not yet. You are incomplete.

110
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:35,295  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Incomplete?

111
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:37,333  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's that mean, incomplete?

112
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:41,064  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can answer her, you can answer
me. What do you mean, incomplete?

113
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:47,323  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Monsieur, be careful!

114
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:50,401  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's just a nightmare,
Reinette, don't worry about it.
Everyone has nightmares.

115
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:54,835  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:452 Y2:523
Even monsters from under the bed
have nightmares. Don't you, monster?

116
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,805  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
What do monsters have
nightmares about? Me! Ha!

117
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:03,875  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor!

118
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:16,371  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Excellent! Ice gun!

119
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:19,449  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
Fire extinguisher.
Where'd that thing come from? Here.

120
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,051  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
So why's it dressed like that?

121
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:24,046  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Field trip to France. Some kind
of basic camouflage protocol.

122
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,563  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nice needle work.
Shame about the face!

123
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:30,270  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, you are beautiful!

124
00:08:32,117 --> 00:08:34,313  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, really, you are!
You're gorgeous!

125
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:37,071  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look at that! Space age clockwork!

126
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:39,146  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
I Love it! I've got chills!

127
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,745  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Listen, seriously,
I mean this from the heart,

128
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:48,819  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
and by the way, count those, it
would be a crime, it would be an act
of vandalism, to disassemble you.

129
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:51,356  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
But that won't stop me!

130
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,845  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
Short range teleport. Can't have
gone far. Could still be on board.
What is it? Don't go looking for it.

131
00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:03,473  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where you going? Back in a sec.

132
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:10,798  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
He said not to look for it.

133
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:12,356  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, he did.

134
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:19,898  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now you're getting it!

135
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:26,218  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Reinette?

136
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:27,776  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just checking you're OK.

137
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,766  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hmm hmm.

138
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:41,763  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh! Hello!

139
00:09:41,803 --> 00:09:44,480  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was just looking for Reinette.

140
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,074  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is still her room, isn't it?

141
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:50,716  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've been away, not sure how long.

142
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,468  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Reinette? We are ready to go!

143
00:09:53,508 --> 00:09:56,301  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Go to the carriage, mother,
I will join you there.

144
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:04,457  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:416 Y2:523
It is customary, I think,
to have an imaginary friend
only during one's childhood.

145
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:07,414  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
You are to be congratulated
on your persistence.

146
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:11,691  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Reinette. Well!

147
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:14,087  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Goodness! How you've grown.

148
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:17,365  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
And you do not appear to
have aged a single day.

149
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:20,002  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
That is tremendously impolite of you.

150
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:22,719  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right, yeah, sorry.

151
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,036  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um, um, um. . .

152
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:27,954  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Listen, lovely to catch up, but
better be off, eh?

153
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,948  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't want your mother finding you
up here with a strange man, do we?

154
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:33,905  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Strange?
How could you be a stranger to me?

155
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:35,984  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've known you since
I was seven years old.

156
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:38,381  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, I suppose you have.

157
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,030  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
I came the quick route.

158
00:10:44,455 --> 00:10:49,850  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
Well, you seem to be flesh and blood
at any rate. But this is absurd.
Reason tells me you cannot be real.

159
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,567  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, you never want
to listen to reason.

160
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:55,243  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mademoiselle?

161
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:57,161  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Your mother grows impatient.

162
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:59,801  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
A moment!

163
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:01,557  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
So many questions.

164
00:11:01,597 --> 00:11:03,570  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
So little time.

165
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:14,901  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mademoiselle! Poisson!

166
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:27,730  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Poisson!

167
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:31,964  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Reinette Poisson! No!

168
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:33,843  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, no, no!

169
00:11:33,883 --> 00:11:36,243  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
No way! Reinette Poisson!
Later Madame d'Etoiles? !

170
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:39,281  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Later still mistress of Louis XV!
Uncrowned Queen of France!

171
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:44,890  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Actress, artist, musician, dancer,
courtesan, fantastic gardener.

172
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:48,865  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who the hell are you?

173
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:52,756  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm The Doctor! And I just
snogged Madame de Pompadour!

174
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,296  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose?

175
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:02,172  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey? Every time! Every time!

176
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:04,450  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's rule one. . .don't wander off!

177
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,317  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
I tell them, I do! Rule one! There
could be anything on this ship!

178
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:13,096  X1:078 X2:255 Y1:488 Y2:523
IT WHINNEYS

179
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:28,954  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you looking at me?

180
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,884  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ah! Look at this!

181
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:38,753  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's an eye in there.

182
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:41,540  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's a real eye.

183
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,767  X1:078 X2:345 Y1:488 Y2:523
RHYTHMIC PUMPING

184
00:12:56,498 --> 00:12:58,851  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is that?

185
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:02,008  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's that in the middle there?
It's like it's wired in.

186
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,806  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's a heart.

187
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:07,742  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey, it's a human heart.

188
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,473  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose?

189
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:19,311  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Will you stop following me?

190
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:21,120  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm not your mother!

191
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:28,088  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
So this is where you
came from, eh, horsey?

192
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:36,473  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, Katherine, you are too wicked.

193
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:42,965  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
Speaking of wicked, I hear
Madame de Chateauroux is ill
and close to death.

194
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:45,722  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, I am devastated.

195
00:13:45,762 --> 00:13:50,439  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, indeed. I, myself, am
frequently inconsolable.

196
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:55,352  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
The King will, therefore,
be requiring a new mistress.
You love the King, of course.

197
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:58,869  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
He is the King and I love
him with all my heart.

198
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:00,917  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I look forward to meeting him.

199
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:07,541  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is something wrong, my dear?

200
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,145  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not wrong, no.

201
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:13,372  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Every woman in Paris
knows your ambitions.

202
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,849  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Every woman in Paris shares them.

203
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,976  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
You know, of course, that the King
is to attend the Yew Tree ball. . .

204
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:26,238  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maybe it wasn't a real heart.

205
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:27,762  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Of course it was a real heart.

206
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:31,115  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is this, like, normal for you?

207
00:14:31,155 --> 00:14:33,791  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is this an average day?
Life with The Doctor, Mickey.

208
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,869  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
No more average days.

209
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:39,385  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's France again.
We can see France.

210
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:41,353  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think we're looking
through a mirror.

211
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:46,379  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Blimey, look at this guy!
Who does he think he is?

212
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,976  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
The King of France.

213
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:51,091  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:416 Y2:523
Oh, here's trouble!
What you been up to?
Oh, this and that.

214
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:55,648  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
Became the imaginary friend of
a future French aristocrat,
picked a fight with a clockwork man.

215
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:58,485  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, and I met a horse.

216
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:00,802  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's a horse doing
on a space ship?

217
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:03,999  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Mickey, what's pre revolutionary
France doing on a space ship?
Get a little perspective!

218
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,516  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
See these? They're all over the
place, on every deck.

219
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:10,112  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gateways to history.

220
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:12,030  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
But not just any old history.

221
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,587  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hers. Time windows.

222
00:15:15,627 --> 00:15:18,425  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Deliberately arranged along the
life of one particular woman.

223
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:23,661  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
A space ship from the 51st Century
stalking a woman from the 18th!

224
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:25,458  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why? Who is she?

225
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:27,492  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jean Antoinette Poisson!

226
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:30,449  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Known to her friends as Reinette.
One of the most accomplished
women who ever lived.

227
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:32,447  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
So she got plans
on being Queen then?

228
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:36,043  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, he's already got a queen. She's
got plans on being his mistress.

229
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:40,521  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, I get it. Camilla!

230
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:42,277  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think this is the night they met.

231
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:46,235  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
The night of the Yew Tree Ball.

232
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:50,073  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
In no time flat she'll get herself
established as his official mistress
with her own rooms at the palace.

233
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:53,315  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Even her own title
Madame de Pompadour.

234
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:59,180  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Queen must have loved her.

235
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,340  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, she did. They got on very well.

236
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,814  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
The King's wife and the
King's girlfriend? France.

237
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:06,623  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's a different planet.

238
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,239  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
How long have you been
standing there? Show yourself!

239
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,281  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hello, Reinette, hasn't time flown!
Fireplace man!

240
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:32,388  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's it doing? Switching back on.

241
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:34,265  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Melting the ice. And then what?

242
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:36,142  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then it kills everyone in the room.

243
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:38,017  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Focuses the mind, doesn't it?

244
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:41,136  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who are you? Identify yourself!

245
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:42,856  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Order it to answer me.

246
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,609  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why should it listen to me?

247
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:47,170  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know,
but it did when you were a child.

248
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,927  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let's see if you've still got it.

249
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,603  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Answer his question.

250
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:55,414  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
Answer any and all
questions put to you.

251
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:00,835  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am Repair Droid Seven.

252
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,631  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
So what happened to the ship then?

253
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:05,152  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
There was a lot of damage.

254
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,869  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ion storm. 82% systems failure.

255
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:10,306  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
That ship hasn't moved in over a
year. What's taken you so long?

256
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:12,843  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
We did not have the parts.

257
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,260  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Always comes down to that,
doesn't it? The parts.

258
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,051  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
What happened to the crew? Where
are they? We did not have the parts.

259
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:25,409  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
There should've been over 50 people
on your ship. Where did they go?
We did not have the parts.

260
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,912  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
50 people don't just disappear. . .

261
00:17:28,685 --> 00:17:31,083  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh. . .

262
00:17:31,123 --> 00:17:35,557  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
you didn't have the parts.
So you used the crew.

263
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:38,477  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
The crew? !

264
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:41,274  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
We found a camera with an eye in it.

265
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:47,146  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
And there was a heart
wired into machinery.

266
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:54,019  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's just doing what it's programmed
to. . .repairing the ship any way it
can, with whatever it can find.

267
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,612  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
No one told it the crew
weren't on the menu.

268
00:17:56,652 --> 00:17:59,160  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
What did you say the
flight deck smelled of?

269
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:04,888  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
. .Someone cooking. . .
Flesh plus heat.

270
00:18:04,928 --> 00:18:06,606  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Barbecue.

271
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:09,761  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
But what are you doing here?

272
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:12,479  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've opened up time windows,
that takes colossal energy.

273
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:15,234  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why come here, you could've
gone to your repair yard.

274
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:17,753  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Instead you come to
18th century France. Why?

275
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:20,210  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
One more part is required.

276
00:18:24,426 --> 00:18:26,542  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then why haven't you taken it?

277
00:18:26,582 --> 00:18:28,305  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
She is incomplete.

278
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:31,578  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
What? So that's the plan then?

279
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:37,373  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
You just keep opening up more and
more time windows, scanning her
brain, checking if she's done yet?

280
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:39,369  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why her?

281
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:45,562  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you've got all of history to
choose from, why specifically her?

282
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:47,480  X1:102 X2:335 Y1:488 Y2:523
We are the same.

283
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,280  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
We are not the same!
We are in no sense the same!

284
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,433  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
We are the same.
Get out of here! Get out
of here this instant! Reinette, no!

285
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:57,551  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's back on the ship!
Rose, take Mickey and Arthur,

286
00:18:57,591 --> 00:19:02,948  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
don't approach it, just watch what
it does. Arthur? Good name for a
horse. You're not keeping the horse!

287
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:05,485  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
I let you keep Mickey.
Now go, go, go!

288
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:13,132  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
You must trust me. I need to find
out what they're looking for.
There's only one way to do that.

289
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:15,225  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Won't hurt a bit.

290
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,207  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fireplace man!

291
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:21,804  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are inside my mind.

292
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:24,042  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, dear, Reinette.

293
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:26,357  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've had some cowboys in here!

294
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:28,639  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
So! That Doctor, eh?

295
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,156  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you talking about?

296
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:34,513  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, Madame de Pompadour,
Sarah Jane Smith. . . Cleopatra. . .

297
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:38,324  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Oh, Cleopatra! He mentioned her
once! Yeah, but he called her Cleo.
Mickey!

298
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:51,173  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
You are in my memories.
You walk among them.

299
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:55,143  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
If there's anything you don't want
me to see, just imagine a door
and close it. I won't look.

300
00:19:57,725 --> 00:20:01,564  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Actually there's a door just there,
you might want to close.

301
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:03,320  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Actually, several.

302
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,718  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
To walk among the memories
of another living soul.
Do you ever get used to this?

303
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:10,234  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't make a habit of it.

304
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:13,231  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
How can you resist? What age are you?

305
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:17,706  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
So impertinent a question,
so early in the conversation.

306
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:19,546  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
How promising. Not my question.

307
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,582  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Theirs. You're 23.

308
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:23,657  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
And for some reason that
means you're not old enough.

309
00:20:23,697 --> 00:20:28,413  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sorry. You might find old
memories reawakening. Side effect.

310
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:30,531  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, such a lonely childhood!

311
00:20:30,571 --> 00:20:32,294  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
It'll pass. Stay with me.

312
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:36,205  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, Doctor! So lonely.

313
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:37,961  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
So very, very alone.

314
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:41,482  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
What do you mean, alone? You've
never been alone in your life.

315
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:43,759  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
When did you start
calling me Doctor?

316
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,995  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Such a lonely little boy!

317
00:20:46,035 --> 00:20:48,452  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Lonely then and lonelier now.

318
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,230  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
How can you bear it?
How did you do that?

319
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:57,121  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
A door, once opened, may be
stepped through in either direction.

320
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:01,140  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, Doctor!

321
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,789  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
My lonely Doctor. . .

322
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:08,928  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
dance with me. I can't.

323
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,449  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dance with me!

324
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:12,766  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is the night
you dance with the King.

325
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:14,962  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then first I shall make him jealous.

326
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:18,760  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't. Doctor.

327
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,273  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor who?

328
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:26,315  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's more than just
a secret, isn't it?

329
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:29,511  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
What did you see?

330
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:32,029  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
That there comes a time, Time Lord,

331
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:36,045  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
when every lonely little boy
must learn how to dance.

332
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:51,084  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
What is this?
What's going on? Doctor?

333
00:21:51,124 --> 00:21:54,042  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose!

334
00:21:54,082 --> 00:21:56,439  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're going to chop us up.
Just like the crew!

335
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:58,719  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're going to chop us and stick
us all over their stupid space ship!

336
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:02,354  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
And where's The Doctor?
Where's the precious Doctor now?

337
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:07,724  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Been gone for flippin' hours, that's
where he is! You are compatible.

338
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:16,219  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Well, you might want to think about
that. You really, really might,
because me and Mickey,

339
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:20,016  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
we didn't come here alone. Oh, no,
and trust me, you wouldn't want

340
00:22:20,056 --> 00:22:22,029  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
to mess with our designated driver.

341
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:31,084  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ever heard of the Daleks?
Remember them?

342
00:22:31,124 --> 00:22:32,764  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
They had a name for our friend.

343
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:35,440  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:488 Y2:523
They had myths about him and a name.

344
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,878  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
They called him the. . .

345
00:22:37,918 --> 00:22:41,193  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
# I could have danced all night
I could have danced all night. . . ! #

346
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:43,151  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
They called him the. . .

347
00:22:43,191 --> 00:22:47,426  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
# And still have begged for more!

348
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,747  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
# I could have spread my wings

349
00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:53,098  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
# And done a thousand. . .
Have you met the French?

350
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,697  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:488 Y2:523
# My God, they know how to party! #

351
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:58,815  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, look at what the cat
dragged in. The oncoming storm!

352
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:02,408  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
Ooh, you sound just like your
mother! What have you been doing?
Where have you been?

353
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:08,361  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
Well, among other things, I think
I just invented the Banana Daiquiri
a couple of centuries early.

354
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:11,482  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
D'you know, they'd never
even seen a banana before?

355
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:15,676  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Always take a banana to a
party, Rose. Bananas are good!

356
00:23:15,716 --> 00:23:18,474  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, brilliant!

357
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:20,310  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's you!

358
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,630  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're my favourite, you are!

359
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,748  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are the best! You know why?

360
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:27,545  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cos you're so thick!

361
00:23:27,585 --> 00:23:33,735  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:416 Y2:523
You're Mr Thick,
Thick, Thicketty, Thick face
from Thick town, Thickania.

362
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:35,493  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
And so's your Dad!

363
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:37,414  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Do you know what they were
scanning Reinette's brain for?

364
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:41,368  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Her mileometer.

365
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:43,248  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
They wanted to know how old she is.

366
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:47,642  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Know why?
Cos this ship is 37 years old.

367
00:23:47,682 --> 00:23:54,156  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
And they think when Reinette
is 37, when she's "complete",
then her brain will be compatible.

368
00:23:54,196 --> 00:23:59,631  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
Cos that's what you're
missing, isn't it, mmm? The
command circuit from your computer.

369
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,749  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Your ship needs a brain.

370
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:07,901  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
And for some reason,
God knows what, only the brain
of Madame de Pompadour will do.

371
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:10,017  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
The brain is compatible.

372
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,895  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Compatible?

373
00:24:11,935 --> 00:24:15,786  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:416 Y2:523
If you believe that then
you probably believe
this is a glass of wine.

374
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:26,399  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Multi grade anti oil.

375
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:28,208  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
"If it moves, it doesn't."

376
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:35,032  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right, you two, that's
enough lying about.

377
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,312  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Time we got the rest
of the ship turned off.

378
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,948  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Those things safe? Yep, safe.

379
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:41,703  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Safe and thick. Way I like 'em.

380
00:24:41,743 --> 00:24:43,303  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK, all the time windows
are controlled from here.

381
00:24:43,343 --> 00:24:46,939  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
Need to close them all down.
Zeus plugs, where are my Zeus plugs?

382
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:49,336  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Had them a minute ago, I
was using them as castanets.

383
00:24:49,376 --> 00:24:51,813  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why didn't they just open a
time window to when she was 37?

384
00:24:51,853 --> 00:24:55,371  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
Amount of damage in these circuits,
they did well to hit the right
century. Trial and error after that.

385
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:58,088  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
The windows aren't closing.

386
00:24:58,128 --> 00:25:00,324  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why won't they close?

387
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:02,282  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's that? I dunno.

388
00:25:02,322 --> 00:25:04,480  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Incoming message? From who?

389
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,875  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
Report from the field.
One of them must still be out there
with Reinette.

390
00:25:08,915 --> 00:25:12,356  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's why I can't close the
windows, there's an override.

391
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,386  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh. That was a bit clever.

392
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,258  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right,
many things about this are not good.

393
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:30,172  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Message from one of your little
friends? Anything interesting?

394
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:33,039  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
She is complete. It begins.

395
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:38,563  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's happening?

396
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,842  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
One of them must have found
the right time window.
Now it's time to send in the troops.

397
00:25:41,882 --> 00:25:44,094  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
And this time they're
bringing back her head.

398
00:25:56,469 --> 00:25:58,861  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Madame de Pompadour. . .
Please, don't scream or anything.

399
00:25:58,901 --> 00:26:03,657  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
We haven't got a lot of time!
I have come to warn you that
they will be here in five years.

400
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:08,415  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Five years?
Some time after your 37th birthday.

401
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:13,648  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can't give you an exact date, it's
a bit random. But they're coming.

402
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:15,925  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's gonna happen.

403
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:19,802  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
In a way. . .for us. . .it's
already happening.

404
00:26:19,842 --> 00:26:23,916  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm sorry, it's hard to explain
The Doctor does this better.

405
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:27,353  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then be exact and I will be
attentive. There isn't time.

406
00:26:27,393 --> 00:26:29,114  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
There are five years.

407
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,270  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
For you. I haven't got five minutes.

408
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,602  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then also be concise.

409
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:41,536  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um. . .there's a. . .vessel.

410
00:26:41,576 --> 00:26:44,135  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
A ship. A sort of sky ship.

411
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:48,889  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
And it's full of. . .well, you.

412
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:55,083  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
Different bits of your life, in
different rooms all jumbled up. I
told you it was complicated. Sorry.

413
00:26:55,123 --> 00:26:58,878  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
There is a vessel in your world,

414
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:03,954  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
where the days of my life are pressed
together, like the chapters of a
book, so that he may step from one

415
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:06,832  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
to the other without increase of age,

416
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:11,424  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
while I, weary traveller,
must always take the slower path.

417
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:14,261  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
He was right about you!

418
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,540  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
So! In five years these
creatures will return.

419
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,337  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
What can be done?
The Doctor says, keep them talking.

420
00:27:19,377 --> 00:27:21,894  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're kind of
programmed to respond to you.

421
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:26,210  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
Now, you won't be able to stop them,
but you might be able to delay them
a bit. Until?

422
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,807  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Until The Doctor can get there.

423
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,325  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's coming then? He promises.

424
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:34,960  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
But he cannot
make his promises in person?

425
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,236  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
He'll be there when you need him.
That's the way

426
00:27:39,276 --> 00:27:41,514  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
it's got to be.
It's the way it has always been.

427
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:44,593  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
The monsters and The Doctor.

428
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:47,269  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
It seems you cannot have
one without the other.

429
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:49,504  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Tell me about it.

430
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:54,459  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
The thing is,
you weren't supposed to have either.

431
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:57,815  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Those creatures are
messing with history.

432
00:27:57,855 --> 00:28:01,172  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
None of this was ever supposed to
happen to you. Supposed to happen?

433
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,812  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
What does that mean?

434
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:07,605  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
It happened, child, and I would
not have had it any other way.

435
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:11,291  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
One may tolerate a world of
demons for the sake of an angel.

436
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,796  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose? Rose?

437
00:28:17,836 --> 00:28:19,714  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose?

438
00:28:19,754 --> 00:28:21,632  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Time Window where she's 37.

439
00:28:21,672 --> 00:28:23,475  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
We've found it,
right under our noses!

440
00:28:27,062 --> 00:28:28,942  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, you can't go in there!

441
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:30,455  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Doctor will go mad!

442
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,371  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
So this is his world.

443
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:44,367  X1:078 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
SCREAMING
What was that? The Time Window.

444
00:28:44,407 --> 00:28:47,244  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Doctor fixed
an audio link. Those screams.

445
00:28:47,284 --> 00:28:49,361  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that my future?

446
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:50,961  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes. I'm sorry.

447
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:53,838  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then I must take the slower path.

448
00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:56,236  X1:078 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
REINETTE'S VOICE:
'Are you there? Can you hear me?

449
00:28:56,276 --> 00:29:00,425  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
'I need you now, you promised!
The clock on the mantel is broken!
It is time!'

450
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:03,664  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's my voice. Rose, come on,
we've got to go.

451
00:29:03,704 --> 00:29:06,736  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's a problem! Give me a moment!

452
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:17,011  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you OK? No. I am very afraid.

453
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:19,808  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
But you and I both know,
don't we, Rose?

454
00:29:19,848 --> 00:29:22,356  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Doctor is worth the monsters.

455
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:32,437  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Doctor! Doctor!'

456
00:29:32,477 --> 00:29:35,349  X1:078 X2:295 Y1:488 Y2:523
PEOPLE SCREAM

457
00:29:48,498 --> 00:29:49,934  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor!

458
00:29:49,974 --> 00:29:53,256  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
We must go!
No one is coming to help us.

459
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:04,750  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are complete. You will come.

460
00:30:12,795 --> 00:30:16,946  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
You found it, then! They knew I
was coming, they've blocked it off.

461
00:30:16,986 --> 00:30:19,785  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where are we going?
The teleport has limited range.

462
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:22,502  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
We must have proximity
to the time portal.

463
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:24,259  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Your words mean nothing.

464
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:25,817  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are nothing.

465
00:30:27,817 --> 00:30:31,093  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
I don't get it. How come they got
in there? They teleported, you saw
them. As long as the ship

466
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,571  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
and the ballroom are linked, their
short range teleports
will do the trick.

467
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:37,887  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
We'll go in the Tardis! I can't use
the Tardis, we're part of events
now! Can't we just smash through?

468
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:40,045  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hyperplex this side, plate glass
the other. We'd need a truck.

469
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:43,761  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
We don't have a truck!
I know we don't have a truck! Well,
we've got to try something!

470
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:46,759  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, smash the glass, smash the
Time Window, there'd be no way back.

471
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,912  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Could everyone just calm down!
Please!

472
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:56,267  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Such a commotion,
such distressing noise.

473
00:30:56,307 --> 00:30:59,864  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Kindly remember
that this is Versailles.

474
00:30:59,904 --> 00:31:03,140  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is the Royal Court.
And we are French.

475
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:10,531  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
I have made a decision.

476
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:13,247  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
And my decision is "no".

477
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:15,606  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
I shall not be going with you today.

478
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:20,804  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
I have seen your world, I have no
desire to set foot there again.

479
00:31:20,844 --> 00:31:23,181  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
We do not require your feet.

480
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:27,166  X1:078 X2:245 Y1:488 Y2:523
ALL SCREAM

481
00:31:32,949 --> 00:31:35,825  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
You think I fear you,

482
00:31:35,865 --> 00:31:38,223  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
but I do not fear you even now.

483
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:42,375  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
You are merely the nightmare
of my childhood.

484
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:44,652  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
The monster from under my bed.

485
00:31:44,692 --> 00:31:49,689  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
And if my nightmare can return to
plague me, then rest assured,
so will yours!

486
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:52,647  X1:078 X2:277 Y1:488 Y2:523
HORSE NEIGHS

487
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:57,053  X1:078 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
HORSE GALLOPS IN DISTANCE

488
00:32:22,537 --> 00:32:24,212  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Madame de Pompadour.

489
00:32:24,252 --> 00:32:26,093  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
You look younger ever day.

490
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:28,169  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell is going on?

491
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:29,809  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh!

492
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:33,764  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is my lover, the King of France.

493
00:32:33,804 --> 00:32:35,447  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, well I'm the Lord of Time.

494
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,731  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I'm here to fix the clock!

495
00:32:42,515 --> 00:32:45,709  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Forget it. It's over.

496
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:47,746  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
For you and for me.

497
00:32:47,786 --> 00:32:50,704  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Talk about seven years' bad luck.

498
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:54,386  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Try three thousand!

499
00:33:00,217 --> 00:33:02,292  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
What happened?

500
00:33:02,332 --> 00:33:04,652  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where did the Time Window go?

501
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,176  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
How's he gonna get back?

502
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:24,929  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
The link with the ship is broken.

503
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,846  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
No way back.

504
00:33:26,886 --> 00:33:30,843  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
You don't have the parts.

505
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:34,317  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
How many ticks left in that
clockwork heart?

506
00:33:34,357 --> 00:33:38,993  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
A day? An hour? It's over.

507
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:41,672  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Accept that.

508
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:44,509  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm not winding you up.

509
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:46,033  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
You all right?

510
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,102  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's happened to them?

511
00:34:05,605 --> 00:34:08,482  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
They've stopped.

512
00:34:08,522 --> 00:34:10,370  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
They have no purpose now.

513
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,147  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
We can't fly the Tardis without him.

514
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,081  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
How is he going to get back?

515
00:34:42,086 --> 00:34:45,123  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
You know all their names, don't you?

516
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:48,040  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
I saw that in your mind.

517
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,798  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
The name of every star.

518
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,274  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
What's in a name?
Names are just titles.
Titles don't tell you anything.

519
00:34:53,314 --> 00:34:55,792  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like "The Doctor"?

520
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:57,726  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like "Madame de Pompadour".

521
00:35:00,468 --> 00:35:03,585  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
I have often wished to see
those stars a little closer.

522
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:06,342  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just as you have, I think.

523
00:35:06,382 --> 00:35:08,142  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
From time to time.

524
00:35:08,182 --> 00:35:11,177  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
In saving me, you trapped yourself.

525
00:35:11,217 --> 00:35:13,771  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did you know that would happen?

526
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:17,170  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Pretty much. Yet still you came.

527
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,765  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

528
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:22,966  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Catch me doing that again!

529
00:35:23,006 --> 00:35:25,962  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
There were many doors
between my world and yours.

530
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:27,599  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can you not use one of the others?

531
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:31,753  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
When the mirror broke,
the shock would've
severed all the links with the ship.

532
00:35:31,793 --> 00:35:36,229  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
There'll be
a few more broken mirrors and torn
tapestries around here, I'm afraid.

533
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:38,547  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wherever there was a time window.

534
00:35:38,587 --> 00:35:41,254  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll, I'll pay for any damage.

535
00:35:43,582 --> 00:35:47,617  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
That's a thought, I'm
going to need money. Always been a
bit vague about money.

536
00:35:47,657 --> 00:35:50,573  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
. .Where do you get money?

537
00:35:50,613 --> 00:35:53,091  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
So here you are.

538
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:55,647  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
My lonely angel.

539
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,887  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stuck on the slow path with me.

540
00:35:57,927 --> 00:36:01,401  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yep! The slow path!

541
00:36:01,441 --> 00:36:03,084  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here's to the slow path.

542
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:13,232  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's a pity. I think
I would have enjoyed the slow path.

543
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:16,190  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

544
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,748  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, aren't you?

545
00:36:19,383 --> 00:36:21,112  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Take my hand.

546
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,317  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
It is not a copy, it is the original.

547
00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:48,844  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
I had it moved here and
was exact in every detail.

548
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:51,869  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
The fireplace.

549
00:36:55,065 --> 00:37:01,299  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
The fireplace from your bedroom!
. .When did you do this?

550
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:03,496  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Many years ago.

551
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:08,047  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
In the hope that a door once
opened may some day open again.

552
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,971  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
One never quite knows when
one needs one's doctor.

553
00:37:14,924 --> 00:37:17,761  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
It appears undamaged.
Do you think it will still work?

554
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:20,279  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
You broke the bond with
the ship when you moved it.

555
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:23,726  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Which means it was off line when the
mirror broke, that's what saved it.

556
00:37:27,353 --> 00:37:30,429  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
But the link is basically physical,

557
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:33,426  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
and it's still physically here,

558
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:36,303  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
which might just mean, if I'm lucky,

559
00:37:36,343 --> 00:37:40,524  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
if I'm very, very, very,
very lucky. . .

560
00:37:41,975 --> 00:37:44,932  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
A ha! What? Loose connection!

561
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:47,309  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
Need to get a man in! Wish me luck!

562
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,054  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

563
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,797  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Madame de Pompadour?
. .Still want to see those stars?

564
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:04,474  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
More than anything.
Gimme two minutes. Pack a bag!

565
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,154  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Am I going somewhere?

566
00:38:06,194 --> 00:38:08,975  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Go to the window. Pick a star.
Any star.

567
00:38:21,572 --> 00:38:24,050  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
How long did you wait?
51/2 hours. Great!

568
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,729  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Always wait 51/2 hours.

569
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,801  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where've you been? Explain later,
into the Tardis. With you in a sec!

570
00:38:31,205 --> 00:38:34,277  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Reinette, are you there? Reinette?

571
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:49,067  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Reinette?

572
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:51,863  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, hello!

573
00:38:51,903 --> 00:38:54,140  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
You just missed her.

574
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,414  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
She'll be in Paris by six.

575
00:38:56,454 --> 00:38:58,097  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh.

576
00:39:00,532 --> 00:39:03,248  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good Lord!

577
00:39:03,288 --> 00:39:04,772  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
She was right.

578
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:08,882  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
She said you never
looked a day older.

579
00:39:08,922 --> 00:39:12,693  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
So many years since I saw you last,
but not a day of it on your face.

580
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:27,665  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
She spoke of you many times.

581
00:39:27,705 --> 00:39:30,663  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Often wished you would visit again.

582
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:33,860  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
You know how women are.

583
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:37,920  X1:078 X2:277 Y1:488 Y2:523
HORSE NEIGHS

584
00:39:45,164 --> 00:39:47,561  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
And there she goes.

585
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:50,223  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:452 Y2:523
Leaving Versailles
for the last time.

586
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,091  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Only 43 when she died.

587
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,273  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Too young.

588
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,956  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Too young.

589
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:04,587  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Illness took her in the end.

590
00:40:04,627 --> 00:40:06,714  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
She always did work too hard.

591
00:40:13,132 --> 00:40:14,656  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
What does she say?

592
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,800  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Of course.

593
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,313  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Quite right.

594
00:40:47,897 --> 00:40:49,785  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why her?

595
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:55,051  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Why did they think they could
repair the ship with the
head of Madame de Pompadour?

596
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:57,007  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
We'll probably never know.

597
00:40:57,047 --> 00:41:01,602  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
There's massive damage in
the computer memory decks,
it probably got confused.

598
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:06,158  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Tardis can close down the Time
Windows, now the droids have gone

599
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:08,581  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
should stop it causing
any more trouble.

600
00:41:11,634 --> 00:41:13,443  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
You all right?

601
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,469  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm always all right.

602
00:41:22,864 --> 00:41:25,526  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come on, Rose, time you showed
me round the rest of this place.

603
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:47,280  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
"My dear Doctor.

604
00:41:48,794 --> 00:41:54,110  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:452 Y2:523
"The path has never seemed more slow
and yet I fear I am nearing its end.

605
00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:00,781  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
"Reason tells me that you and I
are unlikely to meet again, but I
think I shall not listen to reason.

606
00:42:00,821 --> 00:42:05,615  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:416 Y2:523
"I have seen the world inside
your head, and know that
all things are possible.

607
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:08,332  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
"Hurry though, my love.

608
00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:12,289  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
"My days grow shorter now,
and I am so very weak.

609
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,462  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
"Godspeed, my lonely angel."

610
00:43:20,538 --> 00:43:23,532  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:308 Y2:379
So this is London. An
alternative to our world,

611
00:43:23,572 --> 00:43:25,989  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
where everything's the same
but a little bit different.

612
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:30,526  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Loads of people are disappearing!

613
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,362  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's been going on for months!

614
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:36,320  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
What are they all doing?
It's the earpieces. . .

615
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,434  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
The prototype has passed every test,
sir. It's working!

616
00:43:41,474 --> 00:43:44,551  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've seen them before. . .
What are they?

617
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:50,307  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
A skin of metal and a body
that will never age!

618
00:43:57,736 --> 00:44:04,294  X1:112 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
