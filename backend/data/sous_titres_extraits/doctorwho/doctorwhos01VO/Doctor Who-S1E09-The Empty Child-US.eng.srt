1
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:06,693  X1:078 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's the emergency? It's mauve.

2
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:09,082  X1:302 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mauve?

3
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:13,117  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Universally recognised colour
for danger. What happened to red?

4
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:16,436  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's just humans. By everyone
else's standards, red's camp.

5
00:00:16,476 --> 00:00:20,750  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, the misunderstandings! All
those red alerts, all that dancing!

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:26,199  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523
I've hacked into the computer,
slaved the TARDIS. Wherever it goes,
we go! And that's safe? Totally.

7
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:32,256  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK - reasonably.
Should have said "reasonably" there.

8
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:37,969  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
No! It's jumping time tracks,
getting away from us!
What exactly is this thing?

9
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:44,272  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
No idea. Then why are we chasing it?
It's mauve and dangerous, and 30
seconds from the centre of London.

10
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,831  X1:078 X2:385 Y1:488 Y2:523
WHOOSHING OF TARDIS

11
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:36,837  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
D'you know how long you can
knock around space without
happening to bump into Earth?

12
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:39,668  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:344 Y2:415
Five days? Or is that just
when we're out of milk?

13
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:43,877  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:344 Y2:415
All the species in all the universe,
and it has to come out of a cow!

14
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:48,215  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Must've come down
somewhere quite close,

15
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:52,370  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:344 Y2:415
within a mile. And it can't have
been more than a month ago.

16
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,856  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:380 Y2:415
A month? We were right behind it.

17
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:59,723  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
It was jumping time tracks.
We're bound to be a little bit out.
Do YOU wanna drive?

18
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:02,160  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah. How much is a little?

19
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,005  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
A bit. Is that exactly a bit? Ish.

20
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:10,072  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's the plan, then?
You gonna do a scan for alien tech?

21
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:14,668  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose, it hit the middle of London
with a loud bang. I'm gonna ask.

22
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,462  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
"Dr John Smith,
Ministry of Asteroids."

23
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:21,300  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's psychic paper, it tells you. . .
whatever you want it to tell me.

24
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,497  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not very Spock, is it, just asking?

25
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:29,657  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Door, music, people - what do you
think? I think you should do
a scan for alien tech.

26
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:32,488  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Gimme some Spock for once!
Would it kill ya?

27
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,405  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
You sure about that T-shirt?

28
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:39,402  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Too early to say.
I'm taking it out for a spin.

29
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:42,963  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523

30
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,929  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mummy!

31
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,870  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come on, if you're coming!
It won't take a minute.

32
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:56,093  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523

00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:03,379  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523

Doctor, there's a kid up there!

Excuse me! Excuse me, could
I have everybody's attention?

43
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:13,178  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523

00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:18,912  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
might seem like a stupid question,
but has anything fallen
from the sky recently?

45
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:24,470  X1:078 X2:247 Y1:488 Y2:523
THEY LAUGH

46

Mummy!

47
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:45,185  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, hang on, don't move!

48
00:04:56,302 --> 00:04:59,935  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry, have I said something funny?

49
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:04,965  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's just there's this thing
I need to find. Would've fallen
from the sky a couple of days ago.

50
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,482  X1:078 X2:277 Y1:488 Y2:523
SIREN SOUNDS

51
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:09,450  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Would've landed near here. . .

What's that about - ringing?
What am I supposed to do
with a ringing phone?

71
00:06:55,326 --> 00:06:57,322  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't answer it.

00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:46,395  X1:078 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
MORE BOMBS DROP NEARBY

114
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:05,368  X1:078 X2:269 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE WHISTLES

115
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:18,124  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Many kids out there?

116
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:22,122  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, Miss. . .Ah! Still carving.

117
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:23,642  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sit and wait.

118
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,238  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Got the whole air raid!

119
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:30,208  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look at that. Bet it's off
the black market. That's enough!

120
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:44,779  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wa-a-ah!

121
00:11:49,212 --> 00:11:51,488  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
AMERICAN ACCENT: OK, I've got you.

122
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:53,006  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who's got me?

123
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,805  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who's got me and, you know, how?

124
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:58,164  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm programming your descent pattern.

125
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:01,877  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Stay still and keep your hands
and feet inside the light field.

126
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:05,608  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Descent pattern? Oh, and can
you switch off your cell phone?

127
00:12:06,597 --> 00:12:10,068  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, seriously. It interferes
with my instruments.

128
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:12,980  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
You know no-one ever believes that?

129
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:15,982  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you, that's much better.

130
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:20,616  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
Oh, yeah, that's a real load off(!)
I'm hanging in the sky
in the middle of a German air raid,

131
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:24,613  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
with a Union Jack across my chest
but, hey, my mobile phone's off(!)

132
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:27,410  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Be with you in a moment.

133
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,647  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:416 Y2:523
COMPUTER: The mobile communication
device indicates non-contemporaneous
life form.

134
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:33,325  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's not from around here, no.

135
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:37,282  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ready for you. Hold tight! To what?

136
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:39,358  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fair point.

137
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:41,735  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wa-a-ah!

138
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:50,903  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got you. You're fine,
you're just fine.

139
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:54,964  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
The tractor beam, it can
scramble your head just a little.

140
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:57,819  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello.

141
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:59,934  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello.

142
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:02,612  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello.

143
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:05,928  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sorry.
There was "hello" twice there.

144
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:08,166  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dull but, you know, thorough.

145
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:10,714  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you all right? I'm fine.

146
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:15,999  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why, you expecting me to faint?
You look a little dizzy.

147
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:19,834  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
What about you?
You're not even in focus. . . !

148
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:22,257  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, boll. . . !

149
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:51,800  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's got to be black market. You
couldn't get all this on coupons.

150
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,675  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:416 Y2:523
Ernie, how many times? We're guests
in this house! We will not make
comments of that kind.

151
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:59,748  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Washing up! Oh, Nancy!

152
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:02,907  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Haven't seen you at one of these
before. He told me about it.

153
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:05,344  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sleeping rough? Yes, Miss.

154
00:14:05,384 --> 00:14:08,063  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
All right, then.

155
00:14:08,103 --> 00:14:12,217  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
One slice each. And I want
to see everybody chewing properly.

156
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:14,390  X1:198 X2:445 Y1:452 Y2:523
- Thank you, Miss.
- Thanks, Miss.

157
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:19,251  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you, Miss!

158
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,608  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thanks, Miss!

159
00:14:21,648 --> 00:14:25,246  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's all right,
everybody stay where they are!

160
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:28,720  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Good here, innit? Who's got
the salt? Back in your seats.

161
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,223  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
He shouldn't be here either.

162
00:14:33,436 --> 00:14:35,631  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
So, you lot,

163
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:37,871  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:523
what's the story? What do you mean?

164
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:41,308  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're homeless, right?
Living rough? Why do you wanna know?

165
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:44,145  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
You a copper?
Course I'm not a copper.

166
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:48,935  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's a copper gonna do with you
lot anyway? Arrest you for starving?

167
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:54,772  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
I make it 1941. You lot shouldn't
be in London. Should've been
evacuated to the country by now.

168
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:57,210  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was evacuated. Sent me to a farm.

169
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,527  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
So why'd you come back?
There was a man there. . . Yeah.

170
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,448  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Same with Ernie. Two homes ago.

171
00:15:01,488 --> 00:15:05,042  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Shut up! It's better on the
streets anyway. It's better food.

172
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:09,037  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nancy always gets the best food
for us. So that's what you do, Nancy?

173
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:12,913  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
What is? Soon as the sirens go,
you find a big family meal,

174
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,549  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
everyone's down
in the air raid shelter,

175
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:21,422  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
and - bingo - feeding frenzy
for the homeless kids of London!
As long as the bombs don't get you.

176
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,261  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Something wrong with that?
Wrong? It's brilliant.

177
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:30,013  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm not sure if it's Marxism
in action or a West End musical.
Why did you follow me?

178
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:34,492  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
What d'you want?
I want to know how a phone that
isn't a phone gets a phone call.

179
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:39,846  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
You seem to be the one to ask.
I did you a favour. I told you not
to answer it. That's all I'm sayin'.

180
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:43,282  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Great, thanks! And I wanna
find a blonde in a Union Jack.

181
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:50,314  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
I mean a specific one, I didn't just
wake up this morning with a craving.
Anybody seen a girl like that?

182
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:52,831  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
What've I done wrong?
You took two slices.

183
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:58,264  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
No blondes, no flags.
Anything else before you leave?
Yeah, there is, actually,

184
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:03,539  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
thanks for asking. Something
I'm looking for. Would've fallen
from the sky, but not a bomb.

185
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:08,296  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:416 Y2:523
Not the usual kind, anyway.
Wouldn't have exploded.
Probably just buried itself.

186
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:12,596  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
And it would've looked
something like. . .this.

187
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:19,795  X1:078 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
KNOCKING AT WINDOW
Mummy? Are you in there, Mummy?

188
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:23,918  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mummy?

189
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:29,512  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:416 Y2:523
Who was the last in? Him. Nah, he
came round the back. Who came in the
front? Me. Did you close the door?

190
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:32,470  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't. . . Did you close the door?

191
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,906  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mummy? Mummy?

192
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:38,103  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mum-my!

193
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:49,451  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
What's this? Never easy being the
only child left out in the cold.
I suppose you'd know!

194
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:51,848  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
I do actually, yes.

195
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:53,885  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's not exactly a child.

196
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:55,568  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mum-my!

197
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:01,298  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right, everybody out. Across
the back garden. . .Now! Go! Move!

198
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:07,271  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on, baby, we've got to go.

199
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:12,959  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's just like a game, just like
chasing. Take your coat, go on. Go!

200
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:18,030  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mummy? Mummy?
Please let me in, Mummy.

201
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:21,776  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Please let me in, Mummy.

202
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:24,688  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
You all right? Please let me in.

203
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,530  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
You mustn't let him touch you.
What happens if he touches me?

204
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:34,218  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
He'll make you like HIM.
And what's he like? I've gotta go.
Nancy, what's he like.

205
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:37,721  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's empty.

00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:41,156  X1:078 X2:419 Y1:452 Y2:523
PHONE RINGS
It's him.

207
00:17:41,196 --> 00:17:43,752  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
He can make phones ring. He can.

208
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:46,539  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just like with that police box,
you saw!

209
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,339  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Are you my Mummy?'

00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:40,603  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Please let me in, Mummy.
I'm scared of the bombs.

222
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,967  X1:328 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK.

223
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:47,219  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm opening the door now.

224
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,052  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Better now? You got lights in here?

225
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:26,085  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello. Hello. Hello.

226
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,202  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let's not start that again.

227
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:29,555  X1:328 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK.

228
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:35,709  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
So, um,
who are you supposed be, then?

229
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:42,864  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Captain Jack Harkness, 133 Squadron,
Royal Air Force, American volunteer.

230
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:47,499  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Liar. This is psychic paper,
it tells me whatever you want it to.

231
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:53,774  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
How d'you know? Two things.
One, I have a friend that uses this
all the time, and, two. . .

232
00:19:53,814 --> 00:19:57,490  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
you handed me a piece of paper
saying you're single and work out.

233
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,763  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Tricky thing, psychic paper.
Yeah. Can't let your mind wander
when you're handing it over.

234
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:06,601  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, you "sort of"
have a boyfriend called Mickey Smith

235
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:09,834  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
but you consider yourself
to be footloose and fancy free.

236
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:13,471  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
What? Actually the word you use
is "available".

237
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:18,706  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
No way! And another one - "very".
Shall we try and get along
without the psychic papers?

238
00:20:18,746 --> 00:20:21,243  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
That would be better, wouldn't it?

239
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:25,818  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice spaceship. Gets me around.

240
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,658  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Very. . .

241
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:31,454  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Spock. Who?

242
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:34,491  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
Guessing you're not
a local boy, then?

243
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:40,605  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
A cell phone, a liquid-crystal watch
and fabrics that won't be around
for at least another two decades.

244
00:20:40,645 --> 00:20:44,211  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Guessing you're not a local girl.
Guessing right.

245
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:49,233  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
Burn your hands on the rope? Yeah.

246
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:53,587  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're parked in mid-air.
Can't anyone down there see us? No.

247
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,808  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can I have a look at your hands
for a moment? Why? Please?

248
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:05,019  X1:078 X2:199 Y1:488 Y2:523
BUZZING

249
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:07,095  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
You can stop acting now.

250
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:09,412  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know exactly who you are.

251
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:12,330  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can spot a Time Agent a mile away.

252
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,407  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
A Time Agent? Mmm, I've been
expecting one of you guys to show up.

253
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:20,201  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Though not, I must say, by barrage
balloon! Often travel that way?

254
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:24,074  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sometimes I get swept off my feet.

255
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:26,472  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
B. . .by balloons!

256
00:21:26,512 --> 00:21:29,635  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
What are you doing?
Try to keep still.

257
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:35,466  X1:078 X2:213 Y1:488 Y2:523
BLEEPING

258
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:40,711  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nanogenes. Subatomic robots.
The air in here is full of them.

259
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:46,094  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
They just repaired three
layers of your skin.

260
00:21:46,134 --> 00:21:48,811  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh! Well, tell 'em, thanks.

261
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:52,088  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Shall we get down to business?
Business?

262
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:55,979  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Shall we have a drink on the balcony?

263
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,245  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bring up the glasses.

264
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:13,771  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know I'm standing on something. . .

265
00:22:22,777 --> 00:22:27,369  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK, you have
an invisible space ship. . . Yeah.

266
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:30,847  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
 .tethered up to Big Ben
for some reason!

267
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:33,243  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
First rule of active camouflage.

268
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:35,320  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Park somewhere you'll remember.

269
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,232  X1:078 X2:405 Y1:452 Y2:523
CORK POPS
Oooh!

270
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,304  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
How'd you follow me here? I'm good
at following. Got the nose for it!

271
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:32,219  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
People can't usually follow me.
My nose has special powers.

272
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:34,698  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah? Is that why it's so. . . What?

273
00:23:34,738 --> 00:23:36,738  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nothin'. What?

274
00:23:36,778 --> 00:23:38,813  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nothin'!

275
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:43,369  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Do your ears have special powers
too? What are you trying to say?
Good night, Mister.

276
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:47,803  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nancy. . .there's something
chasing you and the other kids.

277
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:53,118  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
It looks like a boy
and it isn't a boy. And it started
about a month ago. Right?

278
00:23:53,158 --> 00:23:58,151  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
The thing I'm looking for.
The thing that fell from the sky.
That's when it landed.

279
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:01,827  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
And you know what I'm talking about,
don't you? There was a bomb.

280
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:06,542  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
A bomb that wasn't a bomb.
Fell the other end of Limehouse
Green Station. Take me there.

281
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:09,340  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Soldiers guarding it. Barbed wire.

282
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,377  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
You'd never get through. Try me!

283
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:16,094  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sure you want to know what's going
on in there? I really wanna know.

284
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:20,448  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:416 Y2:523
Then there's someone
you need to talk to first.
And who might that be?

285
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:23,030  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
The doctor.

286
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:29,079  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's getting late.
I should be getting back.

287
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,837  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're discussing business.

288
00:24:30,877 --> 00:24:33,753  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
This isn't business,
this is champagne.

289
00:24:33,793 --> 00:24:37,390  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
I try never to discuss business
with a clear head.

290
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,266  X1:078 X2:303 Y1:488 Y2:523
BOMBS EXPLODE

291
00:24:40,306 --> 00:24:44,981  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Are you travelling alone? Are you
authorised to negotiate with me?

292
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:47,858  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
What would we be negotiating?

293
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:51,735  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
I have something for the Time Agency.
Something they'd like to buy.

294
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:54,172  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you empowered to make payment?

295
00:24:54,212 --> 00:24:56,649  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, I, I should talk to my. . .

296
00:24:56,689 --> 00:25:00,646  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
companion. "Companion"? I should
really be getting back to him.

297
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:04,377  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
"Him"? Do you have the time?

298
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,474  X1:078 X2:295 Y1:488 Y2:523
BIG BEN CHIMES

299
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:12,552  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, that was flash!

300
00:25:12,592 --> 00:25:15,429  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
That was on the flash side.

301
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:18,986  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
So, when you say your "companion",

302
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:23,500  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
just how disappointed should I be?
OK. We're standing in mid-air,

303
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,616  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
on a spaceship,
during a German air raid.

304
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:32,152  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Do you really think now's
a good time to be coming on to me?

305
00:25:32,192 --> 00:25:36,189  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Perhaps not.
Well, it was just a suggestion.

306
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:38,441  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do you like Glenn Miller?

307
00:25:40,423 --> 00:25:44,519  X1:078 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
MUSIC: "Moonlight Serenade"
by Glen Miller and His Orchestra.

308
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:51,251  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's 1941,

309
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:55,165  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
height of the London blitz, height
of the German bombing campaign.

310
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:58,721  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
And something else
has fallen on London -

311
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:02,159  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
a fully-equipped Chula warship,

312
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:06,396  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
the last one in existence.
Armed to the teeth.

313
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:08,632  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I know where it is,

314
00:26:08,672 --> 00:26:11,419  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
because I parked it.

315
00:26:12,431 --> 00:26:15,667  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
If the agency can name
the right price,

316
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,863  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can get it for you.

317
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:20,657  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
But in two hours,

318
00:26:20,697 --> 00:26:25,353  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
a German bomb is going to fall on it
and destroy it forever.

319
00:26:25,393 --> 00:26:28,631  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's your deadline.
That's the deal.

320
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,708  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now, shall we discuss payment?

321
00:26:30,748 --> 00:26:33,348  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
You know what I think? What?

322
00:26:33,388 --> 00:26:35,505  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think you were talking just there.

323
00:26:35,545 --> 00:26:40,059  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:416 Y2:523
Two hours, the bomb falls.
There'll be nothing left
but dust and a crater.

324
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,776  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Promises, promises!

325
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:43,817  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you listening to any of this?

326
00:26:43,857 --> 00:26:47,930  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
You used to be a Time Agent,
now you're some kind of freelancer.

327
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,090  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
A little harsh! I like to think
of myself as a criminal.

328
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,806  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll bet you do.

329
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:57,121  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
So this companion of yours,
does he handle the business?

330
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:59,878  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, I delegate
a lot of that, yeah.

331
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:03,991  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, maybe we should go find him.
And how you gonna do that?

332
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:07,597  X1:078 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Easy - I'll do a scan for alien tech.
BEEPING

333
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:12,699  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Finally - a professional!

334
00:27:22,214 --> 00:27:27,171  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
The bomb's under that tarpaulin.
They put the fence up overnight.

335
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:30,688  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
See that building? The hospital?

336
00:27:30,728 --> 00:27:33,162  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
What about it?

337
00:27:33,202 --> 00:27:35,130  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's where the doctor is.

338
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:42,590  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
You should talk to him.
For now, I'm more interested
in getting in THERE.

339
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,631  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Talk to the doctor first. Why?

340
00:27:45,671 --> 00:27:49,317  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Because then maybe
you won't wanna get inside.

341
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:53,394  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where you going?

342
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:59,773  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
There was a lot of food
in that house. I've got mouths
to feed. Should be safe enough now.

343
00:27:59,813 --> 00:28:03,172  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can I ask you a question?

344
00:28:03,212 --> 00:28:06,573  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who did you lose? What?

345
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:13,557  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
The way you look after all those
kids. It's cos you lost somebody,
isn't it?

346
00:28:13,597 --> 00:28:16,185  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're doing all this
to make up for it.

347
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:20,870  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
My little brother.

348
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,830  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jamie.

349
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:27,463  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
One night I went out looking for
food. Same night that thing fell.

350
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:30,703  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Told him not to follow me.
I told him it was dangerous.

351
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:33,300  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
But he just. . .

352
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,577  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
he just didn't like
being on his own. What happened?

353
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:41,116  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
In the middle of an air raid?
What d'you think happened?

354
00:28:45,485 --> 00:28:48,002  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Amazing! What is?

355
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:52,515  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
1941. Right now,
not very far from here,

356
00:28:52,555 --> 00:28:56,474  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
the German war machine
is rolling up the map of Europe.

357
00:28:56,514 --> 00:29:01,667  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:416 Y2:523
Country after country,
falling like dominoes.
Nothing can stop it, nothing.

358
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:04,145  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:488 Y2:523
Until one tiny, damp, little island

359
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:08,980  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
says, "No! No. . .not here."

360
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:14,010  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
A mouse in front of a lion.

361
00:29:15,495 --> 00:29:18,013  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're amazing, the lot of you.

362
00:29:18,053 --> 00:29:21,619  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Dunno what you do to Hitler.
You frighten the hell out of me!

363
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:26,520  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Off you go, then.
Do what you've got to do.

364
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,158  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Save the world.

365
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:15,922  X1:402 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
DOOR SQUEAKS

366
00:31:15,962 --> 00:31:18,239  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
You'll find them everywhere.

367
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:21,875  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
In every bed, in every ward.
Hundreds of them.

368
00:31:21,915 --> 00:31:23,435  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, I saw.

369
00:31:23,475 --> 00:31:26,790  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why are they still wearing
gas masks? They're not. Who are you?

370
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,950  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm. . . Are you the doctor?

371
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,147  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dr Constantine. And you are?

372
00:31:32,187 --> 00:31:35,024  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nancy sent me. Nancy?

373
00:31:35,064 --> 00:31:40,019  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
That means you must have been
asking about the bomb. Yes.

374
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:44,855  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
What do you know about it? Nothing.
Why I was asking. What do you know?

375
00:31:44,895 --> 00:31:49,888  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
Only what it's done.
These people, they were all
caught up in the blast?

376
00:31:49,928 --> 00:31:52,003  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
None of them were.

377
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,200  X1:078 X2:235 Y1:488 Y2:523
HE COUGHS

378
00:31:58,198 --> 00:32:00,115  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're very sick.

379
00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:05,190  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
Dying, I should think.
I just haven't been able
to find the time! Are you a doctor?

380
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,228  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
I have my moments.
Have you examined any of them yet?

381
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:11,903  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
No. Don't touch the flesh.

382
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:14,451  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Which one? ANY one.

383
00:32:20,537 --> 00:32:24,651  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Conclusions? Massive head trauma,
mostly to the left side.

384
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:27,291  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Partial collapse
of the chest cavity to the right.

385
00:32:27,331 --> 00:32:29,085  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Scarring on the back of the hand.

386
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:32,602  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
The gas mask seems to be fused to
the flesh but I can't see any burns.

387
00:32:32,642 --> 00:32:34,081  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Examine another one.

388
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,981  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
This isn't possible.
And examine another.

389
00:32:51,941 --> 00:32:56,098  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
This isn't possible! No.
They've all got the same injuries.

390
00:32:56,138 --> 00:33:01,172  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
Yes. Exactly the same! Yes.
Right down to the scar
on the back of the hand.

391
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:08,202  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
How did this happen? How did
it start? When that bomb dropped,
there was just ONE victim. Dead?

392
00:33:08,242 --> 00:33:12,277  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
At first.
His injuries were truly dreadful.

393
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:16,954  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
By the following morning every doctor
and nurse who had treated him,

394
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:18,991  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
who had touched him,

395
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:21,508  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
had those exact same injuries.

396
00:33:21,548 --> 00:33:26,304  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
By the morning after that
every patient on the same ward,
the exact same injuries.

397
00:33:26,344 --> 00:33:29,422  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Within a week, the entire hospital.

398
00:33:29,462 --> 00:33:34,056  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Physical injuries. . .as plague.

399
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:36,694  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can you explain that?

400
00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:40,891  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
What would you say
was the cause of death?

401
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:43,444  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
The head trauma. No. Asphyxiation?

402
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:47,562  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
No. The collapse of the chest cavity.
No. All right. . .

403
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:50,757  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
what was the cause of death?

404
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:53,476  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
There wasn't one.

405
00:33:53,516 --> 00:33:55,444  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're not dead.

406
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,543  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's all right, they're harmless.

407
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:08,381  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
They just sort of sit there.
There's no heartbeat,

408
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,697  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
no life signs of any kind.

409
00:34:10,737 --> 00:34:12,455  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
They just. . .

410
00:34:12,495 --> 00:34:14,135  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
don't die.

411
00:34:14,175 --> 00:34:20,646  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:416 Y2:523
They're just left here? Nobody's
DOING anything? I try and make them
comfortable. What else is there?

412
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:25,839  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
Just you? You're the only one here?
Before this war began I was
a father and a grandfather.

413
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:29,517  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now I'm neither.
But I'm still a doctor.

414
00:34:29,557 --> 00:34:34,551  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah. Know the feeling. I suspect
the plan is to blow up the hospital

415
00:34:34,591 --> 00:34:36,628  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
and blame it on a German bomb.

416
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:39,628  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Probably too late. I know.

417
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:43,702  X1:078 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
There are isolated cases. . .
HE COUGHS

418
00:34:43,742 --> 00:34:47,620  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
 .isolated cases breaking out. . .
all over. . .London.

419
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,043  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stay back! Stay back!

420
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:53,333  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Listen to me!

421
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:56,925  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Top floor, Room 802.

422
00:34:56,965 --> 00:35:00,764  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's where they took the first
victim, the one from the crash site.

423
00:35:00,804 --> 00:35:03,682  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
And you must find Nancy again. Nancy?

424
00:35:03,722 --> 00:35:07,435  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
It was her brother.
She knows more than she's saying.

425
00:35:07,475 --> 00:35:10,097  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
She won't tell me,
but she m. . .

426
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,687  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mum-meee. . .

427
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:22,940  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
are... you... 

428
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,081  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
my. . .mummy?

429
00:35:53,628 --> 00:35:55,186  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Her brother!

430
00:35:56,144 --> 00:35:59,541  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello? Hello?

431
00:35:59,581 --> 00:36:01,475  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello?

432
00:36:04,657 --> 00:36:09,490  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
Good evening. Hope we're not
interrupting. Jack Harkness.
I've been hearing all about you.

433
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:13,210  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
He knows. I had to tell him.
 .About us being Time Agents.

434
00:36:14,723 --> 00:36:18,454  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
And it's a real pleasure
to meet you, Mr Spock.

435
00:36:19,918 --> 00:36:23,474  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Spock? What was I supposed
to say? You don't have a name.

436
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:27,990  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:416 Y2:523
Don't you ever get tired
of "Doctor" Dr WHO? !
Nine centuries in, I'm coping.

437
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:31,507  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where have you been?
It's not a good time for a stroll!

438
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:34,344  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who's strollin'?
I went by barrage balloon.

439
00:36:34,384 --> 00:36:36,621  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Only way to see an air raid. What?

440
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,794  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Listen, what's a Chula warship?

441
00:36:39,861 --> 00:36:41,670  X1:310 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
Chula?

442
00:36:48,046 --> 00:36:51,406  X1:078 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
VOICE FROM RADIO:
Please, Mummy. Please let me in.

443
00:36:51,446 --> 00:36:55,297  X1:138 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm scared of the bombs, Mummy.
A DOOR SHUTS

444
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:59,437  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
VOICE IN THE HOUSE: Mummy?

445
00:36:59,477 --> 00:37:01,894  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mummy!

446
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:20,496  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
This just isn't possible.
How did this happen?

447
00:37:20,536 --> 00:37:24,767  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
What kind of Chula ship landed here?
What? He said it was a warship.

448
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:30,325  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
He stole it, parked it somewhere,
somewhere a bomb's gonna to fall on
it. Unless we make him an offer.

449
00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:35,955  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
What kind of warship? Does it
matter? It's got nothing to do with
this. This started at the bomb site.

450
00:37:35,995 --> 00:37:40,632  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's got everything to do with it.
What kind of warship? An ambulance!

451
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:44,510  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look, this is what chased you
through the time vortex.

452
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,144  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's space junk.
I wanted to kid you it was valuable.

453
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,100  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's empty. I made sure of it.
Nothing but a shell.

454
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,378  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
I threw it at you,
saw your time-travel vehicle -

455
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:57,815  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
love the retro look, by the way -

456
00:37:57,855 --> 00:38:03,449  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
threw you the bait. . . Bait? I wanted
to sell it to you, then destroy it
before you found out it was junk.

457
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,976  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
You said it was a warship.
They have ambulances in wars.

458
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,156  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's a con. I was conning you.
That's what I am, I'm a con man!

459
00:38:14,196 --> 00:38:18,791  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
Thought you were Time Agents.
You're not, are you?
Just a couple more freelancers.

460
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:23,228  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
I should've known, the way you guys
are blending with the local colour!

461
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:26,662  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Flag Girl was bad enough,
but U-Boat Captain? !

462
00:38:26,702 --> 00:38:31,298  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Anyway, whatever's happening here
has got nothing to do with that ship.

463
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:34,496  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
What IS happening here, Doctor?

464
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:37,133  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Human DNA is being rewritten.

465
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:39,487  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
By an idiot. What do you mean?

466
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:44,962  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
I don't know, some kind of virus
converting human beings
into these things. But why?

467
00:38:45,002 --> 00:38:46,611  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's the point?

468
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:50,847  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mummy?

469
00:38:53,035 --> 00:38:56,031  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where's my mummy?

470
00:38:56,071 --> 00:38:58,534  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mum-my!

471
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:26,308  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you my mummy?

472
00:39:31,074 --> 00:39:35,090  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
ALL: Mummy! Mum-my! Mummy?

473
00:39:37,348 --> 00:39:39,805  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's happening? I don't know.

474
00:39:43,942 --> 00:39:46,379  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mummy?

475
00:39:46,419 --> 00:39:48,536  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's me - Nancy!

476
00:39:48,576 --> 00:39:53,529  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
ALL: Mummy! Mummy!
Don't let 'em touch you!
What happens if they touch us?

477
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:56,406  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're looking at it!

478
00:39:56,446 --> 00:40:01,036  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Are you my mummy?
It's Nancy, your sister.

479
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:06,715  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're dead, Jamie. You're dead.

480
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:11,631  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mum-my! Mum-my!

481
00:40:11,671 --> 00:40:15,362  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
ALL: Mum-my! Mummy! Mum-my!

482
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:05,255  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Believe me I'd nothing to do with it!

483
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:10,567  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'll tell you what's happening,
you forgot to set your alarm clock.
It's Volcano Day! Ooooh!

484
00:41:10,607 --> 00:41:15,245  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
That door should hold it for a bit.
The door? ! The wall didn't stop it!

485
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:18,321  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Halt! Don't move!
Go on ask me anything, I'm on fire!

486
00:41:18,361 --> 00:41:22,994  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
You've got the moves, show me
your moves. The world doesn't end
cos The Doctor dances.

487
00:41:23,034 --> 00:41:24,674  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stay back!

488
00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:27,948  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mummy! Doctor!

489
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:30,107  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Secure those gates! Just do it!

490
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:35,102  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
All that weapons tech
in the hands of a four-year-old
looking for his mummy

491
00:41:35,142 --> 00:41:38,048  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
and nothing in the world
can stop it!

492
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,127  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:432 Y2:523
