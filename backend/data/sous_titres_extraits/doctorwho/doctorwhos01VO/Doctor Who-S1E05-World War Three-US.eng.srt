00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:35,881  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
They'll help to identify the bodies.

They're inside Downing Street.

00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:57,468  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Wait! They're still in there - the

22
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:28,545  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
I called for help,

23
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:34,814  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:416 Y2:523
there was this. . .lightning,
this kind of, um, electricity,
and they all collapsed.

24
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,056  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think they're all dead.
That's what I'm saying.

00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:42,971  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523

26
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:45,269  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Prime Minister is an alien

27
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:51,242  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's never gonna work, is it? No.

28
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:52,925  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fair enough.

00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:09,505  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Under the jurisdiction of the

you to execute this man!

31
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:12,902  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, now, yes, you see, er,

32
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:17,814  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
If I was gonna execute someone by
backing him up against the wall,

33
00:04:17,854 --> 00:04:21,625  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
little word of advice -
don't stand him against the lift.

You will disregard all

42
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:12,236  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
We should evacuate the building.

43
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:16,430  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sergeant, have you, um,
read the Emergency Protocols?

44
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,631  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, sir. Then don't question me.

45
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:22,067  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Seal off Number Ten,
secure the ground floor,

46
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:28,540  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
and if the Doctor makes it
downstairs, shoot on sight!

47
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:33,015  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
You heard him, move out!

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,436  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
I need to be naked. Rejoice in it.

51
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:52,042  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523

We'll keep this floor

00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:03,477  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523

67
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:17,741  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stale perfume and brittle bones.

68
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:22,896  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
And a ripe youngster,
all hormones and adrenalin.

69
00:07:22,936 --> 00:07:26,912  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523

00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:36,277  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523

00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,864  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523

are in there.

75
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:57,526  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Harriet Jones, I like you.
I think I like you too.

00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:28,824  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
One move and my device'll triplicate

00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:30,633  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523

78
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:35,099  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right, then, question time.

00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,773  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523

80
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:38,934  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're aliens.
Yes, I got that, thanks.

81
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:41,010  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who are you, if not human?

82
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,247  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who? He's not human. He's not?
Could I have a bit of hush? Sorry.

83
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,804  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
So, what's the plan?

84
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:49,760  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
But he's got a northern accent.
Lots of planets have a north. Hush!

85
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on!

86
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,078  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've got a spaceship hidden

00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:57,355  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523

88
00:08:57,395 --> 00:09:00,312  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why would we invade this

00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:02,669  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523

00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,904  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Slitheen race?
Slitheen is not our species.

91
00:09:07,944 --> 00:09:10,340  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Slitheen is our surname.

93
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:17,371  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
So you're family? A family business.

94
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:19,729  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then you're out to make a profit.

95
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,617  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
How can you do that on a rock?

96
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:29,039  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
Aaaaaaah, excuse me.
Your device will do what -
"triplicate the flammability"?

97
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:33,237  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's what I said? You're making
it up. Oh, well. Nice try.

98
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:35,274  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Have a drink. You're gonna need it.

99
00:09:35,314 --> 00:09:37,831  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
You pass it to the left first.
Sorry.

100
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:42,508  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thanks. Now we can end this
hunt. . .with a slaughter.

101
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,425  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't you think we should run?

102
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:48,022  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fascinating history, Downing Street.

103
00:09:48,062 --> 00:09:50,299  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:523
2, 000 years ago, this was marshland.

104
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,577  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
1730, it was occupied by a
Mr Chicken. He was a nice man.

105
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:56,530  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
1796, this was the Cabinet Room.

106
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,446  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
If the Cabinet's in danger,

107
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:02,917  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
these are about the safest walls
in Britain. End of lesson.

108
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:11,876  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Installed in 1991. Three inches
of steel, lining every single wall.

109
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,663  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
They'll never get in.
And how do we get out?

110
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:18,747  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ah.

111
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:20,545  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's safely contained.

112
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:24,223  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now cut off the communications,
then summon up the family!

113
00:10:24,263 --> 00:10:29,047  X1:102 X2:455 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's time we finished with
this insane planet for good.

115
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:55,933  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
And there's still no word from
inside Downing Street, though we
are getting even more new arrivals.

116
00:10:56,987 --> 00:11:04,382  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
That's Group Captain Tennant James
of the RAF, though why
he's been summoned, we've no idea.

117
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:07,257  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
And that's Ewan McAllister,

118
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:11,009  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Deputy Secretary for
the Scottish Parliament.

119
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:13,527  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
And this is most unusual -

120
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:20,640  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm told that is Sylvia Dillane,
chairman of the North Sea
Boating Club.

121
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,201  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
Quite what connects all these people,
we have no idea.

122
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:27,632  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Group Captain.

123
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:30,553  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Delighted you could make it.
We're meeting upstairs.

124
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:33,149  X1:078 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
HE FARTS
That's the spirit, off you go.

125
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:37,040  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good to see you. Come on through.

126
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:46,252  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
Ah, Sergeant. Now that the Doctor's
been neutralised, the upper levels
are out of bounds to everyone.

127
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,448  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then who are they? Need to
know, Sergeant, need to know.

128
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:51,966  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
I want you to liaise
with Communications.

129
00:11:52,006 --> 00:11:54,846  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Acting Prime Minister will
be making an address.

130
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:57,588  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
He will speak to
the nations of the world!

131
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,713  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you'd just like to go through
and get changed.

132
00:12:07,831 --> 00:12:11,268  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now, if you'd like to head down to
the end of the corridor,

133
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:12,864  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
it's first on the left.

134
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:14,388  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

135
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:21,653  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Got anything stronger? No chance.

136
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:24,094  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
This ain't time for a conga!

137
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:25,730  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
We've gotta tell someone!

138
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:31,128  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
Who do we trust?
For all we know, they've all got
big bog monsters inside of 'em.

139
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,004  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
I mean this is what he does, Jacks.

140
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:37,758  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
That Doctor bloke, everywhere he
goes, death and destruction, and
he's got Rose in it.

141
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,875  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Has he got a great big
green thing inside him, then?

142
00:12:40,915 --> 00:12:43,232  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
I wouldn't put it past him.

143
00:12:43,272 --> 00:12:46,668  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
But he's the only person who knows
how to fight these things!

144
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,011  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
I thought I was gonna die.

145
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:58,014  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on, yeah?

146
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:00,175  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
If anyone's gonna
cry, it's gonna be me.

147
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:01,891  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now, you're safe in my flat.

148
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:05,169  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
No-one's gonna look for you here,
since you hate me so much!

149
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:09,165  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
You saved my life!
God, that's embarrassing!

150
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,111  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Telling me!

151
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:15,679  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
He wanted me dead.

152
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:18,797  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
And he's still out there, Mickey.

153
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:22,972  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
That policeman. . .that thing!

154
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,625  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right, you head off.

155
00:13:29,665 --> 00:13:33,261  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Inform control I've one or two
things that still need doing.

156
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:36,662  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
I haven't quite finished
with Mrs Tyler yet.

157
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:45,086  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is that all of us?

158
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:50,251  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
All the family except Sip Fel Fotch.
He's found a hunt of his own. Ah.

159
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,754  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
What was his name?

160
00:13:55,794 --> 00:14:00,593  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who? This one. The, er, secretary,
or whatever he was called.

161
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:03,549  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't know. I talked to him.

162
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:05,987  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
I brought him a cup of coffee.

163
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:07,705  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
I never asked his name.

164
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:12,300  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry.

165
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:17,492  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right, what have we got?
Any terminals, anything?

166
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:19,648  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nope, this place is antique.

167
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:25,006  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
When they killed the Prime Minister,
why didn't they use him as
a disguise? He's too slim.

168
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:27,363  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
They need to fit inside big humans.

169
00:14:27,403 --> 00:14:30,756  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
But the Slitheen are eight feet.
How do they squeeze inside?

170
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:35,112  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's the device round their
necks, it shrinks them down a bit.

171
00:14:35,152 --> 00:14:37,511  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's why there's all that gas.

172
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:40,187  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wish I had a compression field.

173
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:43,943  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Excuse me, people are dead!
This is not the time for jokes.

174
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,942  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
You get used to this
stuff when you're friends with him.

175
00:14:46,982 --> 00:14:48,856  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, that's a strange friendship.

176
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:51,176  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Harriet Jones. I've heard that name
before.

177
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:53,653  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're not famous for anything,
are you?

178
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:57,129  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hardly! Rings a bell. Harriet Jones?

179
00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:00,006  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Lifelong backbencher and a fat lot
of use of I am now.

180
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:01,723  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Protocols are redundant.

181
00:15:01,763 --> 00:15:04,481  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
They list people who could help
and they're dead.

182
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:08,758  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Couldn't we just
launch a nuclear bomb at them?

183
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:10,915  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're a very violent young woman.

184
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:14,032  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm serious, we could!
There's nothing like that in here.

185
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:19,150  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Nuclear strikes do need a release
code, yes, but it's kept secret
by the United Nations.

186
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,466  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Say that again.
What, about the codes?

187
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:23,660  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Anything, all of it.

188
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:29,536  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
The British Isles can't gain access
to atomic weapons without
a Special Resolution from the UN.

189
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:35,610  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Like that's ever stopped 'em.
Exactly, given our past record. . .
and I voted against that.

190
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,682  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
The codes have been given to the UN.
Is it important?

191
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:43,323  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Everything's important. If only
we knew what the Slitheen wanted.

192
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:47,595  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm saying Slitheen as if it's
normal! What do they want, though?

193
00:15:47,635 --> 00:15:51,551  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're just one family,
so it's not an invasion.

194
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:56,026  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're out to make money.
They want to use something on Earth.

195
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:58,424  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Some kind of asset. Like gold?

196
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:00,385  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oil? Water?

197
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:02,978  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're very good at this.

198
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:06,373  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thank you. Harriet Jones,
why do I know that name?

199
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:09,773  X1:078 X2:525 Y1:416 Y2:523
PHONE BEEPS
Oh, that's me.
How did you get a signal?

200
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:12,210  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
He zapped it. Super phone.

201
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,246  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then we can phone your contacts!

202
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:15,964  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dead downstairs, yeah.

203
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:17,845  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's Mickey.

204
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:20,280  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, tell your stupid
boyfriend we're busy.

205
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,293  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, he's not so stupid after all.

206
00:16:27,274 --> 00:16:29,872  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, no, not just alien,

207
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:33,906  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
but like, proper alien, all stinking
and wet and disgusting,

208
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:37,107  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
and more to the point,
it wanted to kill us!

209
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:39,740  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
I could have died!
Is she all right though?

210
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,300  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't put her on, just tell me.

211
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,095  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is that Ricky?
Just go to your computer.

212
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:45,651  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's Mickey, and why should I?

213
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:50,532  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Mickey, the idiot,
I might just choke before I finish
this sentence, but. . .I need you.

214
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,325  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
It says "password?"

215
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:55,962  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Say again.

216
00:16:56,002 --> 00:16:57,521  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's asking for the password.

217
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:59,719  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Buffalo. Two Fs, one L.

218
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,562  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
So what's that website?

219
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:05,913  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
All the secret
information known to mankind.

220
00:17:05,953 --> 00:17:09,747  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
See, they've known about aliens for
years. They just kept us in the dark.

221
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:11,468  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mickey, you were born in the dark.

222
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:13,308  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, leave him alone.
Thank you.

223
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:15,924  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Password again.
Just repeat it, every time.

224
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,373  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Big Ben. Why did the Slitheen go
and hit Big Ben?

225
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,693  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
You said to gather the experts,
to kill them.

226
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:28,210  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
That lot would've gathered for a
weather balloon. You don't need to
crash-land in the middle of London.

227
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,363  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
The Slitheen are hiding,
but then they put the entire
planet on red alert. Why?

228
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:35,961  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, listen to her(!)
Oi! At least I'm trying.

229
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,997  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'VE got a question,
if you don't mind.

230
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:42,235  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Since that man walked
into our lives,
I've been attacked in the streets,

231
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:45,869  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've had creatures from the pits
of hell in my own living room

232
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:50,785  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
and my daughter disappear off the
face of the Earth. I told you
what happened. I'm talking to HIM!

233
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:54,497  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cos I've seen this life of yours,
Doctor, and maybe you get off on it,

234
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:59,933  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
and maybe you think it's all
clever and smart, but you tell me -
just answer me this -

235
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:02,650  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
is my daughter safe?

236
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,648  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm fine.

237
00:18:04,688 --> 00:18:06,685  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is she safe? !

238
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:11,315  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Will she always be safe,
can you promise me that?

239
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:17,776  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, what's the answer?

240
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,270  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're in.

241
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,187  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now, then. On the left, at the top,

242
00:18:25,227 --> 00:18:29,317  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
there's a tab, an icon, little
concentric circles, click on that.

243
00:18:32,218 --> 00:18:34,535  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
What is it? The Slitheen have got
a spaceship in the North Sea

244
00:18:34,575 --> 00:18:37,812  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
transmitting that signal. Now, hush,
let me work out what it's saying.

245
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:41,251  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
He'll have to answer me one day.
Hush! It's some sort of message.

246
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,328  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's it say? Don't know,
it's on a loop, keeps repeating.

247
00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:46,844  X1:078 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
BUZZ!
Hush! That's not me!

248
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:52,942  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
Go and see who that is.
It's three o'clock in the morning.
Well, go and tell THEM that!

249
00:18:53,036 --> 00:18:55,948  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's beaming out into space.
Who's it for?

250
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,453  X1:078 X2:421 Y1:452 Y2:523
DOORBELL BUZZES
All right!

251
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,517  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mrs Tyler.

252
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,787  X1:322 X2:397 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ooh!

253
00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:10,857  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's him, it's the thing! It's
the Slickeen! They've found us!

254
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:15,614  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
Mickey, I need that signal.
Never mind the signal, get out!
Mum just get out!

255
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,151  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
We can't, it's by the front door.

256
00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:29,959  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

257
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:32,996  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's unmasking. It's gonna kill us.

258
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:37,710  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:416 Y2:523
There's got to be some way of
stopping them! You're supposed to be
the expert - think of something!

259
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,310  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm trying!

260
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,184  X1:078 X2:495 Y1:416 Y2:523
RUMBLES AND SQUELCHES
I'll take it on, Jackie.
You just run.

261
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,221  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't look back. Just run.

262
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:49,338  X1:078 X2:479 Y1:452 Y2:523
CLATTERS AND THUDS
That's my mother.

263
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:54,332  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Right! If we're gonna find
their weakness, we need to find out
where they're from, which planet.

264
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:58,007  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Their basic shape, that narrows it
down to 5, 000 nearby planets.

265
00:19:58,047 --> 00:20:02,562  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
What else do we know about them?
Information! They're green! Narrows
it down. Good sense of smell.

266
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:06,598  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Narrows it down. They can smell
adrenaline. Narrows it down.
Pig technology. Narrows it down.

267
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,795  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Spaceship in the Thames.
Slipstream engine. Narrows it down.

268
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:12,201  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's getting in!

269
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:18,469  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
They hunt, like a ritual. Narrows
it down. Wait, did you notice. . . ?

270
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:23,699  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
When they fart, if you'll pardon
the word, it doesn't just smell like
a fart, if you'll pardon the word,

271
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:29,934  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:416 Y2:523
it's something else? What? It's more
like, um. . . Bad breath! That's it!
Calcium decay! THAT narrows it down!

272
00:20:29,974 --> 00:20:31,743  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're getting there, Mum! Too late!

273
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:39,364  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
Calcium phosphate, organic calcium,
living calcium, creatures made
out of living calcium. What else?

274
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,321  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hyphenated surname! YES!
That narrows it down to one planet!

275
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:44,439  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Raxacoricofallapatorius!

276
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,248  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Great, we can write 'em a letter(!)

277
00:20:48,677 --> 00:20:50,929  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get into the kitchen!

278
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:59,501  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, God, it's going to rip us apart!

279
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,298  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
Calcium weakened by the compression
field. . . Acetic acid! Vinegar!

280
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:06,853  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Just like Hannibal! Just like
Hannibal! Mickey, have you got
any vinegar? How should I know?!

281
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:09,092  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's your kitchen!
Cupboard by the sink, middle shelf!

282
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:12,409  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, give it here. What d'you need?
Anything with vinegar.

283
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:14,486  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gherkins!

284
00:21:14,526 --> 00:21:16,326  X1:078 X2:303 Y1:488 Y2:523
SLITHEEN ROARS

285
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:18,874  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, pickled onion!

286
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:22,991  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
Pickled eggs!
 .You KISS this man?

287
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:27,154  X1:078 X2:261 Y1:488 Y2:523
IT SCREECHES

288
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:29,327  X1:078 X2:209 Y1:488 Y2:523
IT HISSES

289
00:21:33,229 --> 00:21:34,901  X1:078 X2:237 Y1:488 Y2:523
PHRRRRRT!

290
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:50,807  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hannibal?

291
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:56,006  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hannibal crossed the Alps
by dissolving boulders with vinegar.

292
00:21:57,122 --> 00:21:59,135  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh. Well, there you go, then.

293
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:12,665  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's dead. Sip Fel Fotch
Pasameer-Day Slitheen is dead.

294
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:14,145  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
I felt it.

295
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:15,738  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
How could that happen?

296
00:22:15,778 --> 00:22:17,859  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Somebody must've got lucky.

297
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:22,728  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's the last piece of luck
anyone on this rock will ever have.

298
00:22:32,322 --> 00:22:34,320  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ladies and gentlemen. . .

299
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,880  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
nations of the world.

300
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,676  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Humankind.

301
00:22:38,716 --> 00:22:44,032  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:416 Y2:523
The greatest experts
in extraterrestrial events
came here tonight.

302
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,588  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
They gathered in the common cause.

303
00:22:46,628 --> 00:22:52,222  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
But the news I bring you now is
grave indeed.

304
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:55,815  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
The experts are dead.

305
00:22:55,855 --> 00:23:00,534  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Murdered, right in front of me,
by alien hands.

306
00:23:00,574 --> 00:23:03,011  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
Peoples of the Earth, heed my words.

307
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:07,045  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
These "visitors"
do not come in peace.

308
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,884  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Listen to this!

309
00:23:08,924 --> 00:23:14,279  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Our inspectors have searched
the sky above our heads.'

310
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,116  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
And they have found. . .

311
00:23:16,156 --> 00:23:19,116  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
MASSIVE weapons of destruction

312
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:24,029  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
'capable of being deployed
within 45 seconds. . .' What?

313
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:29,981  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Our technicians can baffle
the alien probes,

314
00:23:30,021 --> 00:23:32,097  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
but not for long.

315
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:35,135  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
'We are facing extinction.

316
00:23:35,175 --> 00:23:38,047  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Unless we strike first!'

317
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:45,325  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
'The United Kingdom stands directly
beneath the belly of the mothership.'

318
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:48,404  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
I beg of the United Nations.

319
00:23:48,444 --> 00:23:52,917  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Pass an emergency resolution.
Give us the access codes.

320
00:23:52,957 --> 00:23:58,670  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
A nuclear strike at the heart of the
beast is our only chance of survival.

321
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,679  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Because. . .

322
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:03,025  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
from this moment on,

323
00:24:03,065 --> 00:24:07,166  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
it is my solemn duty to inform you. . .

324
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,935  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
planet Earth is at war.

325
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:17,050  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523
He's making it up! There's no weapon
up there, no threat. He invented it!
Do you think they'll believe him?

326
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,567  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
You did last time. That's why
the Slitheen went for spectacle.
They want the whole world panicking

327
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:26,800  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:416 Y2:523
cos you lot, you get scared, you
lash out. . . Release the defence
codes. The Slitheen go nuclear. Why?

328
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,765  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
You get the codes, release
the missiles. But not into space -

329
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:36,354  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
there's nothing there. You attack
every other country on Earth.
They fight back.

330
00:24:36,394 --> 00:24:39,584  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
World War Three.
Whole planet gets nuked.

331
00:24:39,624 --> 00:24:42,024  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
And we sit through it, safe in our
spaceship, waiting in the Thames.

332
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:46,858  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not crashed, just parked.
Barely two minutes away.

333
00:24:46,898 --> 00:24:50,495  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
But you'll destroy the planet.
This beautiful place. What for?

334
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:54,418  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Profit. That's what the signal is,
beaming into space. An advert.

335
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:59,445  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sale of the century! We reduce the
Earth to molten slag, then sell it.

336
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:01,972  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Piece by piece.

337
00:25:02,012 --> 00:25:03,840  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Radioactive chunks

338
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,916  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
capable of powering every cut-price
starliner and budget cargo ship.

339
00:25:07,956 --> 00:25:11,674  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's a recession out there,
Doctor. People are buying cheap.

340
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:14,271  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
This rock becomes raw fuel.

341
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:16,108  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
At the cost of five billion lives.

342
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,945  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Huh! Bargain.

343
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:21,472  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
I give you a choice. Leave this
planet, or I'll stop you.

344
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:26,907  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
What? You?

345
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:29,824  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Trapped in your box?

346
00:25:31,093 --> 00:25:32,936  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes. Me.

347
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:59,419  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yesterday saw the start
of a brave new world.

348
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:01,523  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Today might see it end.

349
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:04,814  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
The streets are deserted.

350
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,620  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everyone's home, just waiting,

351
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,340  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
as the future is decided
in New York.

352
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:17,442  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
AMERICAN REPORTER: It's midnight
here in New York.

353
00:26:17,482 --> 00:26:19,368  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
The United Nations has gathered.

354
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:25,593  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
England has provided them with
absolute proof that the massive
weapons of destruction do exist.

355
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:28,872  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
'The Security Council will make the
resolution in a matter of minutes.

356
00:26:28,912 --> 00:26:31,633  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
'And once the codes are released,

357
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:36,013  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
'humanity's first
interplanetary war begins.'

358
00:26:45,973 --> 00:26:49,250  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sergeant!

359
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,968  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
We'll take the call
in the Prime Minister's office.

360
00:26:52,008 --> 00:26:54,765  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maintain your positions.

361
00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:56,983  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good luck.

362
00:27:03,244 --> 00:27:05,272  X1:078 X2:291 Y1:488 Y2:523
EXCITED BUSTLE

363
00:27:05,312 --> 00:27:09,003  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:308 Y2:379
Look at that!
The telephone is actually red!

364
00:27:10,186 --> 00:27:11,704  X1:078 X2:203 Y1:488 Y2:523
PHRRRT!

365
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,660  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:344 Y2:379
How long till they phone?

366
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,958  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:380 Y2:415
Counting down. . .

367
00:27:18,822 --> 00:27:23,051  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
OK, Doctor.
I'm not saying I trust you, but
there must be something you can do.

368
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:26,097  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
If we could ferment the port,
we could make acetic acid.

369
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:28,966  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mickey, any luck?
There's loads of emergency numbers.

370
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:32,803  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're all on voicemail.
Voicemail dooms us all.

371
00:27:32,843 --> 00:27:38,085  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
If we could just get out of here.
There's a way out. What?
There's always been a way out.

372
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,874  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then why don't we use it?

373
00:27:40,914 --> 00:27:46,664  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
Because I can't guarantee your
daughter will be safe. Don't dare!
Whatever it is, don't you dare!

374
00:27:46,704 --> 00:27:51,465  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's the thing. If I don't dare,
everyone dies. Do it.

375
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:57,693  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
You don't even know what it is.
You'd just let me? Yeah.

376
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:03,770  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Please, Doctor, please!
She's my daughter, she's just a kid.

377
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:09,083  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
Do you think I don't know that?
Cos this is my life, Jackie.
It's not fun, it's not smart,

378
00:28:09,123 --> 00:28:13,964  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
it's standing up and making a
decision. Because nobody else will.
Then what are you waiting for?

379
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:17,332  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
I could save the world,
but lose you.

380
00:28:26,383 --> 00:28:31,140  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Except it's not your decision,
Doctor. It's mine.

381
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,494  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
And who the hell are you? Harriet
Jones, MP for Flydale North.

382
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:39,968  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
The only elected representative
in this room. Chosen by the people
for the people,

383
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:43,859  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
and on behalf of the people,
I command you. Do it.

384
00:28:47,283 --> 00:28:49,167  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Victory. . .

385
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:51,909  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
should be naked!

386
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,907  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
How do we get out?
We don't. We stay here.

387
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:12,845  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Council is voting. The result
should be known any second now.

388
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:23,023  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Use the buffalo password,
it overrides everything.

389
00:29:24,084 --> 00:29:26,640  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you doing?

390
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,653  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hacking into the Royal Navy.

391
00:29:29,438 --> 00:29:33,315  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're in! Here it is, HMS Taurean,
Trafalgar Class submarine,

392
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:37,393  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
ten miles off the coast of Plymouth.
Right, we need to select a missile.

393
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:39,586  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
We can't go nuclear.
We don't have the defence codes.

394
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:43,539  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
We don't need it, just an ordinary
missile. What's the first category?

395
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:47,617  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sub harpoon, UGM-84A.
That's the one! Select!

396
00:29:47,657 --> 00:29:50,199  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
I could stop you.

397
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,499  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do it then.

398
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:56,308  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ready for this?

399
00:29:58,285 --> 00:29:59,400  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

400
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:07,716  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mickey the idiot,
the world is in your hands.

401
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:09,399  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fire!

402
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:20,593  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
(Oh, my God.)

403
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:29,604  X1:078 X2:263 Y1:488 Y2:523
STEADY BLIPS

404
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:33,767  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
How solid are these?

405
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:38,803  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523
Not solid enough.
Built for short-range attack,
nothing this big. All right. . .

406
00:30:38,843 --> 00:30:43,244  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'M making a decision. I'm not gonna
die. We're gonna ride this one out.

407
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:47,354  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
With earthquakes, you can survive
by standing under a doorframe.

408
00:30:47,394 --> 00:30:51,165  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
This cupboard's small, so it's
strong. Come and help. Come on!

409
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:58,819  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
The vote is in.

410
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:01,083  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Council says. . .

411
00:31:02,183 --> 00:31:03,303  X1:326 X2:393 Y1:488 Y2:523
yes.

412
00:31:03,343 --> 00:31:06,170  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
They are releasing the codes.

413
00:31:07,174 --> 00:31:09,211  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ring, damn you!

414
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:11,288  X1:078 X2:445 Y1:452 Y2:523
RAPID BLIPS
It's on radar!

415
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,211  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Counter defence 556.

416
00:31:13,251 --> 00:31:17,056  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Stop them intercepting it!
I'm doing it now! Good boy.

417
00:31:19,406 --> 00:31:21,249  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
556 neutralised.

418
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,937  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you mean, "incoming"?

419
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:43,924  X1:078 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
ALARM SHRIEKS
Everybody out! Now! Now!

420
00:31:44,732 --> 00:31:47,569  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell is that for?

421
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:50,646  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sir, there's a missile. . .

422
00:31:50,686 --> 00:31:52,170  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry!

423
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:09,309  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's mine. You've got mine!

424
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:11,383  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Disguise me, disguise me!

425
00:32:11,423 --> 00:32:16,218  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
No, you're the blonde.
I want the other one, take it off!

426
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:20,894  X1:078 X2:465 Y1:452 Y2:523
GUNSHOT
Everybody, run!

427
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:23,451  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Run! Let's get out of here!

428
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:27,057  X1:078 X2:335 Y1:488 Y2:523
MISSILE SCREECHES

429
00:32:30,245 --> 00:32:32,082  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here we go.

430
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:34,425  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, nice knowing you both.

431
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,469  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hannibal!

432
00:32:37,683 --> 00:32:39,241  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, bol. . .

433
00:33:12,843 --> 00:33:14,677  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Made in Britain!

434
00:33:14,717 --> 00:33:17,074  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

435
00:33:17,114 --> 00:33:21,348  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Harriet Jones, MP, Flydale North.
Contact the UN immediately.

436
00:33:21,388 --> 00:33:26,382  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
Tell the ambassadors the crisis
is over, they can step down.
Go on, tell the news!

437
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:30,380  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yes, ma'am. Someone's got a hell
of a job sorting this lot out.

438
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,417  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, Lord! We haven't even got
a Prime Minister!

439
00:33:33,457 --> 00:33:36,895  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Maybe you should have a go.
Me! I'm only a backbencher.

440
00:33:36,935 --> 00:33:39,967  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'd vote for ya.
Now, don't be silly.

441
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:43,209  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'd better go and see if I can help.

442
00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:45,996  X1:078 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
EMERGENCY SIRENS APPROACH
Hang on!

443
00:33:48,203 --> 00:33:51,809  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're safe - the Earth is safe!

444
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:55,275  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sergeant!

445
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:57,510  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
I thought I knew the name.

446
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,787  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Harriet Jones.

447
00:33:59,827 --> 00:34:06,261  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Future Prime Minister, elected
for three successive terms. The
architect of Britain's Golden Age.

448
00:34:06,301 --> 00:34:09,615  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
THE CRISIS HAS PASSED!

449
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:13,267  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ladies and gentlemen, I have
something to say to you all. . .

450
00:34:14,573 --> 00:34:16,929  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here today. . .

451
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:20,727  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .mankind stands tall -

452
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,403  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
proud and undefeated!

453
00:34:23,443 --> 00:34:26,486  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
God bless the human race.

454
00:34:51,854 --> 00:34:54,731  X1:078 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
TARDIS CLANKS AND WHEEZES

455
00:34:54,771 --> 00:34:58,804  X1:078 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
HARRIET ON TV:
'Mankind stands tall. . .'

456
00:34:58,844 --> 00:35:01,966  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Harriet Jones -
who does she think she is?

457
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:05,999  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look at her, taking all the credit.
It should be you on there.

458
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:09,910  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
MY DAUGHTER saved the world!
I think the Doctor helped a bit(!)

459
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,950  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
All right, then, him too.

460
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,063  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
You should be given knighthoods.
It's not the way he does things.

461
00:35:17,103 --> 00:35:21,782  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
No fuss, he just moves on. He's not
that bad, if you gave him a chance.

462
00:35:21,822 --> 00:35:27,015  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's good in a crisis, I'll give him
that. Oh-h-h! The world HAS changed.

463
00:35:27,055 --> 00:35:32,332  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
You're saying nice things about him.
I've no choice. There's no getting
rid of him, since you're infatuated.

464
00:35:32,372 --> 00:35:34,086  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm not infatuated!

465
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:36,887  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
What does he eat? How d'you mean?

466
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:41,999  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was gonna do shepherd's pie.
All of us, proper sit-down.

467
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,637  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cos. . .

468
00:35:43,677 --> 00:35:48,831  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm ready to listen.
I wanna learn about you and 'im
and that life you lead.

469
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:54,585  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Only, I dunno, he's an alien.
For all I know he eats
grass and safety pins and things.

470
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:59,699  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
He'll have shepherds pie. . .
You're gonna cook for him?
What's wrong with that?

471
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:02,176  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's finally met his match.

472
00:36:02,216 --> 00:36:05,214  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're not too old for a slap,
you know!

473
00:36:05,254 --> 00:36:07,933  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
We can go and visit your gran
tomorrow.

474
00:36:07,973 --> 00:36:11,729  X1:078 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
PHONE RINGS
Better learn some French.
I told her you were in France.

475
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,562  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
I said you were au-pairing. . .

476
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:17,325  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello?

477
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:21,278  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right, I'll be a couple of hours,
then we can go. You've got a phone!

478
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:26,233  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
You think I can travel through space
and time and I haven't got a phone?
Like I said, couple of hours.

479
00:36:26,273 --> 00:36:28,668  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've just got to send a dispersal. . .

480
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:34,064  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
There, that's cancelling
out the Slitheens' advert in case
any bargains hunters turn up.

481
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:36,261  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Um, my mother's cooking.

482
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:41,455  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Good, put her on a slow heat
and let her simmer. She's cooking
tea. For us. I don't do that.

483
00:36:41,495 --> 00:36:47,209  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
She wants to get to know you.
Tough, I've better things to do.
It's just tea. Not to me, it isn't.

484
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:54,163  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
She's my mother. Well, she's
not MINE. That's not fair. Well,
you can stay there if you want.

485
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:57,517  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
But here's this plasma storm
brewing in the Horsehead Nebula.

486
00:36:57,557 --> 00:37:00,394  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Fires are burning,
ten million miles wide.

487
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:05,188  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
I could fly the Tardis
into the heart of it then ride
the shockwave all the way out,

488
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:08,840  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
hurtle right across the sky
and end up anywhere.

489
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:12,271  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Your choice.

490
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:27,168  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose? I was thinking,

491
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:32,947  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got that bottle of Amaretto
from New Year's Eve. Does he drink?

492
00:37:37,114 --> 00:37:40,550  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was wondering whether he drinks
or not. Yeah, he does.

493
00:37:45,907 --> 00:37:48,104  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't go, sweetheart.

494
00:37:48,144 --> 00:37:51,016  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Please don't go.

495
00:38:06,605 --> 00:38:10,985  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Good lad. Graffiti that again
and I'll 'ave ya. Now, beat it.

496
00:38:15,915 --> 00:38:18,471  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
I just went down the shop.

497
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:23,105  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
And I was thinking, y'know,
like, the whole world's changed.

498
00:38:23,145 --> 00:38:25,744  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Aliens and spaceships all in public.

499
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:28,420  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
And here it is.

500
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,857  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
How can they do that? They SAW it!
You're just not ready.

501
00:38:31,897 --> 00:38:36,334  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
You're happy to believe in something
that's invisible, but if it's
staring you in the face - "Nope,

502
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:40,509  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
"can't see it!" There's a scientific
explanation for that - you're thick.

503
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:46,562  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're just idiots.
Well, not all of you. Yeah?

504
00:38:46,602 --> 00:38:48,680  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Present for you, Mickey.

505
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,752  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
That's a virus. Put it online,
it'll destroy every mention of me.
I'll cease to exist.

506
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:58,746  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
What d'you wanna do that for?
Cos you're right. I AM dangerous.
I don't want anybody following me.

507
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:03,064  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
How can you say that,
and then take her with you?

508
00:39:03,104 --> 00:39:06,180  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
You could look after her.
Come with us.

509
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,297  X1:310 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't.

510
00:39:08,337 --> 00:39:10,575  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
This life of yours. . .

511
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:13,203  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
it's just too much, I couldn't do it.

512
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:16,329  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't tell her I said that.

513
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:19,885  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'll get a proper job. I'll work
weekends, I'll pass my test.

514
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:24,043  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:416 Y2:523
If Jim comes round again,
I'll say no, I really will.
I'm not leaving cos of you.

515
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:27,874  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm travelling, that's all, and then
I'll come back. But it's not safe.

516
00:39:27,914 --> 00:39:32,140  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mum. If you saw it out there,
you'd never stay home.

517
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:39,025  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
Got enough stuff(? )
The first time I stepped in there,
it was spur-of-the-moment.

518
00:39:39,065 --> 00:39:42,142  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now I'm signing up.
You're stuck with me.

519
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:46,976  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come with us.
There's plenty of room.

520
00:39:47,016 --> 00:39:50,253  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
No chance. He's a liability,
I'm not having him on board.

521
00:39:50,293 --> 00:39:53,495  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
We'd be dead without him. My
decision is final.

522
00:39:55,447 --> 00:39:56,800  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry.

523
00:39:59,444 --> 00:40:01,562  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good luck, yeah?

524
00:40:01,602 --> 00:40:06,275  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
You still can't promise me. What if
she gets lost? What if something
happens to YOU, Doctor,

525
00:40:06,315 --> 00:40:11,830  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
and she's left all alone, standing
on some moon a million light years
away? How long do I wait then?

526
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:15,544  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mum, you're forgetting -
it's a time machine.

527
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:20,420  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:416 Y2:523
I could travel round suns
and planets all the way out
to the edge of the universe,

528
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:25,535  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
and by the time I get back, yeah,
ten seconds would've passed.
Just ten seconds.

529
00:40:25,575 --> 00:40:28,012  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
So stop worrying.

530
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:31,618  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'll see you in ten seconds' time,
yeah?

531
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:14,605  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ten seconds.

532
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:39,415  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:344 Y2:415
 .It's a great big museum. An alien
museum. Someone's got a hobby.

533
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:44,291  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
The cage contains my one living
specimen. . . . .It must've fallen
through time, the only survivor.

534
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:45,729  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's killing him. Do something!

535
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:49,845  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
I swear no-one on this base is safe.
 .You've gotta keep it in that cell.

536
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:53,566  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
 .It can't get out. That lock's
got a billion combinations. . .

537
00:41:53,606 --> 00:41:55,046  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .Civilians - let 'em through!

538
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:57,837  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
 .That thing is gonna kill
every one of us!

539
00:41:57,877 --> 00:42:01,354  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
The nearest town? Salt Lake City.
Population? One million. All dead.

540
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,191  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
If you want orders, follow this one.

541
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:04,628  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .Why don't you just DIE? !

542
00:42:04,668 --> 00:42:06,268  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .We're nearly there! Two seconds.

543
00:42:06,308 --> 00:42:08,625  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've come to help. I'm The Doctor.

544
00:42:08,665 --> 00:42:09,985  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
