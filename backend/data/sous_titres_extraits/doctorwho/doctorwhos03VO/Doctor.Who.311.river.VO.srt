1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,560
Cardiff! Cardiff?! Ah! But!
Thing about Cardiff,

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,760
it's built on a rift in time
and space, just like California

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,560
on the San Andreas fault...
but the rift bleeds energy.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,600
I open up the engines, soak up the
energy AND use it as fuel.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,720
So it's a pit stop? Exactly!

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,840
Should only take 20 seconds.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,640
The rift's been active.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,440
Wait. They had an earthquake in Cardiff,
couple of years ago. Was that you?

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,240
Doctor!

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,600
Finito, all powered up.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,160
What's that?!

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,280
We're accelerating into
the future. The year one billion.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
Five billion. Five trillion!

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,560
50 trillion? What?!

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,200
The year 100 trillion?!

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
That's impossible!
Why, what happens then?

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,680
We're going to the end
of the universe.

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,920
Doctor!

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,120
Humans.

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,040
Humans are coming.

21
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't...

22
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,840
I just want to go. Please, let me go.

23
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,920
Huuuuuu-maaan!

24
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,600
Huuuuuu-maaan!
Huuuuuu-maaan!

25
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,360
THEY GROWL AND GRUNT

26
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,600
Hunt! Hunt!

27
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,320
Hunt! Hunt!

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,240
There's movement on the surface.

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,920
Another human hunt, God help him.

30
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,560
Chan, should I alert the guards,
tho? No, no, we can't spare them.

31
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,160
Poor beggar's on his own. One more
lost soul, dreaming of Utopia.

32
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,000
Chan, you mustn't talk as though
you've given up, tho.

33
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,880
No, no, indeed. Here's to it.

34
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Utopia.

35
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,720
Where, it is to be hoped,
the coffee is a little less sour.

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,160
Will you join me? I am happy
drinking my own internal milk, tho.

37
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,280
Yes, well that's quite enough
information, thank you.

38
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,760
'Professor Yana?

39
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,560
'Don't want to rush you,
but how are we doing? '

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,440
Yes, yes, working! Yes, almost there!

41
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,320
'How's it looking on the Footprint? '

42
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,440
It's good, yes, fine, excellent.

43
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:52,960
There's no problem as such,
we've accelerated the calculation

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,040
matrix, but it's going to take time
to harmonise though.

45
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
We're trying a new reversal process,
we'll have a definite

46
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,720
result in approximately
two hours, though.

47
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,640
Chan, professor...

48
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,320
VOICE DROWNED OUT BY LOUD DRUMMING
Chan, professor Yana, tho.

49
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
Chan, professor tho.

50
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,840
Yes, yes, yes, working.

51
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,680
Chan, it's the surface scanner,
Professor, it seems to be detecting
a different signal, tho.

52
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,920
Well that's not a standard reading.

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,320
I can't make it out. It would
seem, something new has arrived.

54
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,040
Well... we've landed.

55
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,280
So what's out there? I don't know.

56
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,400
Ooh, say that again, that's rare.

57
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Not even the Time Lords
came this far.

58
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,760
We should leave.

59
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,560
We should go.
We should really, really...

60
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,000
go.

61
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,880
Oh, my God.

62
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,200
Can't get a pulse. Hold on,
you've got that medical kit thing.

63
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,760
Hello again.

64
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,920
Ohh, I'm sorry. Here we go.

65
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,120
Get out the way. It's a bit odd,
not very hundred trillion,
that coat's more like World War Two.

66
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,600
I think he came with us. From Earth?
Must've been clinging to the Tardis,

67
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,960
all the way through the vortex.
Well, that's very him.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,280
D' you know him? Friend of mine.
Used to travel with me.

69
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Back in the old days.

70
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,640
But he's...

71
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,560
I'm sorry, there's no heartbeat,
there's nothing.

72
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
He's dead.

73
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,600
Oh, well so much for me! It's all right,
just breathe deep, I've got you.

74
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,320
Captain Jack Harkness.

75
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,720
And who are you? Martha Jones.
Nice to meet you, Martha Jones.

76
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,960
Oh, don't start. I was only saying
hello. I don't mind.

77
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,400
Doctor.

78
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,800
Captain.

79
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,440
Good to see you.

80
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,600
And you. Same as ever. Although...

81
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,120
Have you had work done?

82
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,000
You can talk.

83
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,240
Yes, the face. Regeneration.
How did you know this was me?

84
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,400
The police box kind of gives it
away. I've been following you.

85
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,000
For a long time.

86
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,480
You abandoned me.

87
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,560
Did I? Busy life. Moving on.

88
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,520
I've just got to ask...

89
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,720
The Battle of Canary Wharf.

90
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,600
I saw the list of the dead.

91
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,440
And it said Rose Tyler.

92
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,400
Oh! No! Sorry! She's alive!
You're kidding!

93
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,520
Parallel world! Safe and sound! And Mickey!
And her mother! Oh, yes!

94
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,040
Good old Rose.

95
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,640
So there I was, stranded in the year
200100, ankle deep in Dalek dust,

96
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,160
and he goes off without me,
but I had this.

97
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,360
I used to be a Time Agent, it's
called a Vortex Manipulator,

98
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,480
he's not the only one who can time travel.
Excuse me, that is not time travel.

99
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,720
It's like, I've got a sports
car, you've got a spacehopper.

100
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,880
Oh, boys and their toys.

101
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,960
All right, so I bounced, I thought, 21st
century, best place to find the Doctor.

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,600
Except I got it a little wrong, arrived in
1869, this thing burnt out, so it was
useless.

103
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,960
Told you!

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,760
I lived through the entire 20th
century, waiting for a version
of you that coincided with me.

105
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,680
But that makes you more than 100 years old.
And looking good, don't you think?

106
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,160
So, I went to the Time Rift,
based myself there, cos I knew

107
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,040
you'd come back to refuel, until
finally, I get a signal on this...

108
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,680
detecting you, and here we are!
But how come you left him behind,
Doctor? I was busy!

109
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Is that what happens? D' you just get
bored of us, one day and disappear?

110
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,920
Not if you're blonde.
Oh, what a surprise! You two!

111
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,880
We're at the end of the universe,

112
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,560
right at the edge of knowledge
itself, and you're busy...

113
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,880
blogging!

114
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,160
Come on!

115
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,480
Is that a city?

116
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,680
City, or a hive, or a nest.

117
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,800
Or a conglomeration.

118
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
Like it was grown.

119
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,680
But look, there, that's like...

120
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:39,560
pathways, or roads, there
must've been some sort of life.

121
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Long ago. What killed it?

122
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,120
Time.
just time. Everything's dying now.

123
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,000
All the great
civilisations have gone.

124
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,680
This isn't just night - all the
stars have burnt up and faded away.

125
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,560
Into nothing.

126
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,040
They must have an atmospheric shell.

127
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,840
We should be frozen to death.

128
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,000
Well, Martha and I, maybe.

129
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,280
Not so sure about you, Jack.

130
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,520
But what about the people?

131
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Does no-one survive?

132
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,520
I suppose...

133
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,400
I have to hope,

134
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,960
life will find a way.

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,880
Well, he's not doing too bad.

136
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:36,040
Is it me, or does that look like a
hunt? Come on!

137
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,920
Oh, I've missed this!

138
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,440
SHOUTING AND GROWLING

139
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
I've got you. They're coming.
They're coming.

140
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,360
GROWLING

141
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Jack. Don't you dare.

142
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,480
GUNSHOTS

143
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,240
What the hell are they?
We've got to keep going.

144
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,000
I've got a ship nearby. It's safe,
it's over there... or maybe not

145
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,080
We're close to the Silo! If we get to
the Silo, then we're safe.
Silo? Silo! Silo for me!

146
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,920
It's the Futurekind - they're coming,
let us in! Show me your teeth!

147
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,520
Show me your teeth! Show me your
teeth! Show him your teeth!

148
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,760
Human! Let them in! Let them in!

149
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,720
Close! Close! Close!

150
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,360
RAPID GUNFIRE

151
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,960
Humaaaaans.

152
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,600
Human meat.

153
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,920
Make feast.

154
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,520
Go back to where you came from.
I said, go back! Back!

155
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,320
Don't tell him to put HIS gun
down. He's not my responsibility.
And I am? That makes a change.

156
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
Watching you.

157
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,120
Kind hungry.

158
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,880
Yeah!

159
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,960
Thanks for that.
Right, let's get you inside.

160
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,200
My name is Padra Fet Shafe Cane,
tell me,

161
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,360
just tell me...
Can you take me to Utopia?

162
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,480
Oh, yes, sir. Yes, I can!

163
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,600
Professor, we've got four
new Humans inside, one of them
is calling himself a Doctor.

164
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,480
Of medicine? He says of everything.
What? A scientist!

165
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,680
Oh, my word! Chantho, just...

166
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,840
I don't know. I'm coming!

167
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,560
It's like a box, a big blue box...

168
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,720
I need it back,
it's stuck out there.

169
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,360
You're 561. My family were heading
for the Silo. Did they get here?

170
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,560
My mother is Kistane Shafe Cane,
my brother's name is Beltone.

171
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,120
You can check the paperwork. Creet!
Passenger needs help!
What d' you need?

172
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,840
A blue box, you said?
Big, tall, wooden, says "Police".

173
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,920
We're driving out for the last water
collection, I'll see what I can do.
Thank you!

174
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,480
We could still take a look.
Come on.

175
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,600
Sorry, but... how old are you?

176
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,720
Old enough to work. This way.

177
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,520
Kistane Shafe Cane!

178
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,920
Kistane and Beltone Shafe Cane!

179
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,680
I'm looking for
Kistane and Beltone Shafe Cane!

180
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,600
The Shafe Canes, anyone? Anyone?

181
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,160
Kistane from Red Falls Five?
Kistane and Beltone Shafe Cane.

182
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,920
Anyone know the Shafe Cane family?

183
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,480
Anyone called Shafe Cane?

184
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,600
It's like a refugee camp...

185
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,200
It's stinking.

186
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,920
Sorry. No offence. Not you.

187
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,840
Don't you see, though? The ripe
old smell of humans! You survived!

188
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,440
Oh, you might've spent a million
years evolving into clouds of gas,
and another million as downloads,

189
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,720
but you always revert
to the same basic shape.

190
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,600
Indomitable!

191
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Is there a Kistane Shafe Cane?
That's me.

192
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,720
Mother! Oh, my God! Padra!

193
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,760
It's not all bad news.

194
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,520
Captain Jack Harkness,
and who are you?

195
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,280
Stop it! Give us a hand with this.

196
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,440
It's half-deadlocked.
See if you can overwrite the code.
Let's find out where we are.

197
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,520
I've got you. Thanks.

198
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,520
How did you cope without me?
Now that is what I call a rocket!

199
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,440
They're not refugees,
they're passengers.
He said they were going to Utopia.

200
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,080
The perfect place. Hundred trillion
years and it's the same old dream.
D' you recognise the engines?

201
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,080
Nope, whatever it is,
it's not rocket science.

202
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,560
But it's hot, though. Boiling!

203
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,200
But if the universe is falling
apart, what does Utopia mean?

204
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,400
The Doctor? That's me!

205
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,240
Good! Good good good good good good
good good good good good good!

206
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,560
It's good, apparently.

207
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,400
Chan, welcome, tho.

208
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,120
This is the gravitissimal
accelerator, it's past its best...

209
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,280
Chan, welcome though. And over here
is the Footprint Impeller System.

210
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,400
D' you know anything about end time
gravity mechanics? Who are you?

211
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,080
Chan, Chantho, tho.

212
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,920
But we can't get it to harmonise...

213
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,600
Captain Jack Harkness. Stop it!
Can't I say hello to anyone?

214
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,200
Chan, I do not protest tho.

215
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,800
Maybe later, Blue.

216
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,920
So what have we got here?
And all this feeds into the rocket?

217
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,560
Except without a stable footprint,
we'll never achieve escape velocity.

218
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:35,720
If only we could harmonise the five
impact patterns, and unify them,
well, we might yet make it.

219
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,440
What d' you think, Doctor?

220
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,240
Any ideas? Well.

221
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,280
Um. Basically. Sort of...

222
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,040
Not a clue. Nothing?

223
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,120
I'm not from round these parts.
I've never seen a system like it.
Sorry.

224
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,040
No, no, I'm sorry, it's my fault.

225
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,960
There's been so little help...

226
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,800
Oh, my God.

227
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,200
You've got a hand, a hand in a jar.

228
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,720
A hand, in jar, in your bag.

229
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,200
That's - that's my hand!

230
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,120
I said I had a Doctor-detector!

231
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,040
Is this is a tradition amongst
your people?

232
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,320
What d' you mean, that's your hand?!
You've got both your hands.
I can see them!

233
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,680
I lost my hand Christmas Day
in a swordfight.

234
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,480
What, and you grew another hand?!

235
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,480
Um. Yeah, yeah I did, yeah.

236
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,120
Hello!
Might I ask, what species are you?

237
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,280
Time Lord - last of.

238
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,920
Heard of them?

239
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,480
Legend or anything?

240
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,120
Not even a myth? Blimey, end of
the universe is a bit humbling.

241
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,320
Chan, it is said that I am the
last of my species too, tho.
Sorry, what was your name?

242
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,080
My assistant, and good friend,
Chantho. A survivor of the Malmooth.

243
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,960
This was their planet, Malcassairo,
before we took refuge.

244
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,560
That city outside, that was yours?
Chan, the Conglomeration died... tho.

245
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,320
Conglomeration! That's what I said!
You're supposed to say "Sorry".
Oh, yes.

246
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,440
Sorry. Chan, most grateful, tho.

247
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,880
You grew another hand? Hello again.

248
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,280
It's fine, look, really, it's me.

249
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,640
All this time and you're
still full of surprises.

250
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,440
Chan, you are most unusual, tho.
Well...

251
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,840
So what about those things outside,
the beastie boys?

252
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,800
We call them the Futurekind.

253
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Which is a myth, in itself, but it's
feared they are what we will become,

254
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,800
unless we reach Utopia.
And Utopia is...?

255
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,680
Every human knows of Utopia.

256
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,600
Where have you been? Bit of a hermit.

257
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,480
A hermit with friends?

258
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,080
Hermits United. We meet up, every
ten years, swap stories about caves.

259
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,800
It's good fun for a hermit.

260
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,160
So, um, Utopia?

261
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,800
The call came from across the stars.

262
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,760
Over and over again.

263
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,680
"Come to Utopia".

264
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,560
Originating from that point.

265
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,920
Where is that? Oh, it's far
beyond the Condensate Wilderness.

266
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,160
Out towards the Wildlands and
the Dark Matter Reefs. Calling us in,

267
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,960
the last of the humans,
scattered across the night.

268
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,480
What d' you think is out there?
We can't know.

269
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,960
A colony, a city, some sort of haven?

270
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,240
The Science Foundation
created the Utopia Project,
thousands of years ago.

271
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,560
To preserve mankind,
to find a way of surviving

272
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,840
beyond the collapse of reality
itself, now perhaps they found it.

273
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,040
Perhaps not.

274
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,320
But it's worth a look,
don't you think?

275
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,680
Ohhh yes...

276
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,120
And the signal keeps modulating,
so it's not on automatic.

277
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,400
That's a good sign.
Someone's out there.

278
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,160
And that's, ooh that's

279
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,880
a navigation matrix...

280
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,160
DOCTOR'S VOICE DROWNED OUT BY
LOUD DRUMMING

281
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,080
Professor?

282
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,440
Professor!

283
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,560
Right, that's enough talk.
There's work to do!
Now if you could leave, thank you.

284
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,320
Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine.

285
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,760
And busy!

286
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,400
Except that rocket's
not going to fly, is it?

287
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,000
This footprint mechanism-thing,
it's not working.

288
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,880
We'll find a way!

289
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,320
You're stuck on this planet,

290
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,400
and you haven't told them, have you?

291
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,880
That lot out there,
they still think they're gonna fly.

292
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,680
Well, it's better to let them
live in hope. Quite right too.

293
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,000
And I must say, Professor,

294
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,240
what was it? Yana. Professor Yana,
this new science is well beyond me.

295
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,280
But all the same, a boost reversal
circuit, in any timeframe, must be

296
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,320
a circuit which reverses the
boost, so I wonder what would happen

297
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,720
if I did this...

298
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,200
SIREN WAILS

299
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,400
Chan, it's working, tho.

300
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,520
But! How did you do that?!

301
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Oh, we've been chatting away,
I forgot to tell you. I'm brilliant!

302
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,960
ON TANNOY: 'All passengers, prepare
for boarding. Repeat, all passengers
prepare for immediate boarding.

303
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,080
'Destination Utopia. '

304
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,720
There...

305
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,160
...and there.

306
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:48,800
TANNOY: 'All troops
withdraw to Silo. Repeat,
all troops withdraw to Silo. '

307
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,440
Inside! Everyone, inside.

308
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,560
Come on, move, move, move.

309
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,480
ON TANNOY: 'Air passengers
prepare for immediate boarding.

310
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,920
'Air passengers prepare
for immediate boarding. '

311
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,880
Excuse me.

312
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,680
Hey, what was your name, Creet?

313
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,360
That's right, miss. Who are
you with Creet, you got family?
No, miss, there’s just me.

314
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,000
Good luck. What d' you think it's
gonna be like, in Utopia?

315
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,400
My mum used to say,
the skies are made of diamonds.

316
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,160
Good for her.

317
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,240
Go on, off you go, get your seat!

318
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,880
SHE SNARLS

319
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,720
Is that...? Gluten extract.

320
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,400
It binds the neutralino map together.

321
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,360
But that's food.

322
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,280
You've built this system out of food
and string and staples. Professor
Yana, you're a genius!

323
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,880
Says the man who made it work.

324
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,200
Aah, it's easy,
coming in at the end.

325
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,360
But you're stellar,
this is, this is magnificent!

326
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,480
And I don't often say that, cos...
well, cos of me.

327
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:33,960
But even my title is an affectation.
There hasn't been such a thing as
a university for over 1,000 years.

328
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,360
I've spent my life going from
one refugee ship to another.

329
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,520
If you'd been born in a different
time, you'd be revered. I mean it.

330
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,160
Throughout the galaxies.

331
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,760
Oh, those damn galaxies,
they had to go and collapse!

332
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,720
Some admiration would have been nice.

333
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,280
just a little. just once.
Well, you've got it now.

334
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,920
But that footprint engine-thing...

335
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,760
You can't activate it from on board,
it's got to be done from here.

336
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,280
You're staying behind.

337
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,760
With Chantho.

338
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,480
She won't leave without me.

339
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,960
Simply refuses. You'd give
your life, so they could fly.

340
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,040
Oh, I think I'm a
little too old for Utopia.

341
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,360
Time I had some sleep.

342
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,520
ON TANNOY: 'Professor, tell the
Doctor we've found his blue box. '
Aah.

343
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,480
Doctor...

344
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,960
Professor, it's a wild stab in the
dark, but I might just have found
you a way out!

345
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,760
Extra power.

346
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,200
Little bit of a cheat,
but who's counting?

347
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,560
Jack, you're in charge of
the retro feeds.

348
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,640
Oh, am I glad to see that thing!
Chan, Professor, are you
all right?

349
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,320
Fine, I'm fine,
I'm fine just... get on with it.

350
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,720
Connect those circuits into the
spar, same as the last lot
but quicker. Yes, sir!

351
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,080
You don't have to keep working.
We can handle it. It’s just a
headache, just...

352
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,440
noise, inside my head, Doctor.
Constant noise inside my head.

353
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
What sort of noise?

354
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,480
The sound of drums.

355
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,600
More and more, as though...
it's getting closer.

356
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,680
When did it start?
Oh, I've had it all my life.

357
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,680
Every waking hour!

358
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,000
Still, no rest for the wicked.

359
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,200
So how long have you been with the
Professor? Chan, 17 years, tho.

360
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,120
Blimey. Long time.

361
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,120
Chan, I adore him, tho.

362
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh, right. And he... Chan, I
don't think he even notices, tho.

363
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,720
Tell me about it.

364
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,320
Chan, but I am happy to serve, tho.

365
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,560
D' you have to start
every sentence with "Chan"?

366
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,840
Chan, yes, tho.

367
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,240
And end every sentence with...?
Chan, tho, tho.
What would happen if you didn't?

368
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,560
Chan, that would be rude, tho.

369
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,000
What, like swearing?

370
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,320
Chan, indeed, tho.

371
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,520
Oh, go on. just once.

372
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,280
Chan, I can't, tho. Oh, do it for me.

373
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
No!

374
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,200
Professor!

375
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,440
Systems are down.

376
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,560
Professor, you getting me?

377
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm here - we're ready.

378
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,760
All you need to do is connect
the couplings, then we can launch.

379
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
God save us, this equipment!

380
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,760
Needs rebooting, all the time.

381
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,880
Anything I can do? I've finished
that lot. Yes, if you could.

382
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:44,360
just press the reboot key every time
the picture goes... Certainly!
just don't ask me to do shorthand.

383
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,040
Are you still there?

384
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,600
Present and correct!
Send your man inside.

385
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,360
We'll keep the levels down from here.

386
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,800
He's inside and good luck to him.

387
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,480
Captain, keep the dials below the
red. Where is that room?
It's underneath the rocket.

388
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,080
Fix the couplings, and
the Footprint can work.

389
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,520
But the entire chamber is
flooded with stet radiation.
Stet? Never heard of it.

390
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,880
You wouldn't want to but it's safe
enough. We can hold the radiation
back from here.

391
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,120
ALARM RINGS

392
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,480
It's rising. 0.2, keep it level.
Yes, sir.

393
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,960
SIREN WAILS

394
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,840
We're losing power, tho.

395
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,520
SIREN CONTINUES TO WAIL

396
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,760
Radiation's rising!
We've lost control!
The chamber's going to flood!

397
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,560
Jack! Override the vents!

398
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,640
Get out!

399
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,200
Get out of there! Jake!

400
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,600
Oi, you!

401
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,760
Duck...

402
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,520
We can jump-start the override.

403
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,440
Don't, it's gonna flare!

404
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,360
Jake, get out of there! Get out!

405
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,640
Noooooo!

406
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,080
I've got him.
Don't touch the cables, tho.

407
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,200
I'm so sorry. The chamber's flooded
with radiation, yes?

408
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,240
Without the couplings, the
engines will never start.
It was all for nothing.

409
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,920
Oh, I don't know.

410
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,200
Professor, you've got a room which
no man can enter, without dying.
Is that correct?

411
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,840
Yes. Well...

412
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,800
LOUD GASPING BREATH

413
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,800
I think I've got just the man.

414
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,480
Was someone kissing me?

415
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,920
Lieutenant, get on board the rocket,
you're going to fly.
The chamber's flooded.

416
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,560
We've found a way of tripping the
system. Run!

417
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,040
What are you taking your clothes off
for? I'm going in!

418
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,800
Well, I'd say that stet radiation
doesn't affect clothing, only flesh.
Well, I look good, though!

419
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,080
How long have you known? Ever since
I ran away from you.

420
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,720
Good luck!

421
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,440
We lost picture when
that thing flared up...

422
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,360
Doctor, are you there?
Receiving, yeah. He's inside.

423
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,240
And still alive?
Oh, yes. But he should evaporate.

424
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,200
What sort of a man is he?

425
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,920
I've only just met him. The Doctor
sort of travels through time and
space, and picks people up...

426
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,720
God, I make us
sound like stray dogs.

427
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,200
Maybe we are.

428
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,360
He travels in time?

429
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,960
Don't ask me to explain it.

430
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,960
That's a Tardis, that box thing.

431
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,280
The sports car of time travel,
he says.

432
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,920
When did you realise?

433
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,920
ECHOING VOICE: 'That's a Tardis,
that's a Tardis, that's a Tardis...

434
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,680
When did you realise?
Earth, 1892.

435
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,160
Got in a fight on Ellis Island,
man shot me through the heart
and then I woke up.

436
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,160
Thought it was kind of strange
but then it never stopped.

437
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,120
Fell off a cliff,
trampled by horses, World War One,
World War Two. Poison. Starvation.

438
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,160
A stray javelin. In the end,

439
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,680
I got the message.

440
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,600
I'm the man who can never die.

441
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,360
And all that time, you knew.
That's why I left you behind.

442
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,960
It's not easy, even just... looking
at you, Jack, cos you're wrong.

443
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,480
Thanks. But you are,
I can't help it,

444
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,080
I'm a Time Lord, it's instinct,
it's in my guts.

445
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,960
You're a fixed point in
time and space.

446
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,960
You're a fact.

447
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,760
And that's never meant to happen.

448
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,400
Even the Tardis reacted against
you, tried to shake you off,

449
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,840
flew all the way to the end of the
universe to get rid of you. So what
you're saying is...

450
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,720
you're prejudiced.

451
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,800
I never thought of it like that.
Shame on you. Yeah.

452
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,280
Last thing I remember,
back when I was mortal...

453
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,720
I was facing three Daleks,
death by extermination

454
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,480
and then I came back to life.

455
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,760
What happened?

456
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,160
Rose.

457
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,600
I thought you'd sent her back home.

458
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,480
She came back. Opened the heart of
the Tardis, and absorbed the
Time Vortex itself.

459
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,040
What does that mean, exactly?

460
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,160
No-one's ever meant
to have that power.

461
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,200
If a Time Lord did that,
he'd become a God, a vengeful God.

462
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,600
But she was human.

463
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,600
I bring life.

464
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,800
Everything she did was so human.

465
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,360
She brought you back to life

466
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,760
but she couldn't control it,
she brought you back forever.

467
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,040
That's something, I suppose -

468
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,280
the final act of
the Time War was life.

469
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,440
Do you think she
could change me back?

470
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,200
I took the power out of her.

471
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,680
She's gone, Jack.

472
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,840
She's not just living on a
parallel world, she's trapped there.

473
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,880
The walls have closed. I'm sorry.

474
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,160
Yep. I went back to her estate.

475
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,320
In the nineties,

476
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,800
just once or twice.

477
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,280
Watched her growing up.

478
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
Never said hello,

479
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,040
timelines and all that.

480
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,000
Do you want to die?
Oh, this one's a little stuck.

481
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,480
Jack?

482
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,480
I thought I did.

483
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,000
I dunno...

484
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:08,840
but this lot, you see them out here,
surviving, and that's fantastic.

485
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,680
You might be out there somewhere.
I could go meet myself.

486
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,920
Well, it's the only man
you're ever gonna be happy with.

487
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,880
This new regeneration.

488
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,760
It's kinda cheeky.

489
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,400
VOICE IN HEAD:
'Regeneration, regeneration... '

490
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,960
I never understand half
the things he's saying...

491
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,560
What's wrong? Chan, Professor,
what is it? Time travel.

492
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:42,160
They say there was time
travel back in the old days,

493
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,640
I never believed...

494
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,080
But what would I know?

495
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,560
Stupid old man,

496
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,920
never could keep time.

497
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,200
Always late, always lost.

498
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,560
Even this thing - never worked.

499
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,280
Martha, this watch is me.
I'm gonna become human.

500
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,840
Time and time and time again,
always running out on me...

501
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:17,400
Can I have a look at that?
Oh, it's only an old relic.

502
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,000
Like me.

503
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,120
Where did you get it?

504
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,320
Hmmm?

505
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,440
I was found with it. What d' you mean?
An orphan in the storm.

506
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,000
I was a naked child, found on the
coast of the Silver Devastation.

507
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,760
Abandoned with only this.

508
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,360
Have you ever opened it?
Why would I? It's broken.

509
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,920
How d' you know it's broken
if you've never opened it?

510
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,720
It's stuck, it's old, it's...
not meant to be.

511
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,040
I don't know.

512
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,760
Ah...

513
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,000
Does it matter?

514
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,400
No, it's nothing, it's...

515
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,000
Listen, everything's fine up here,
I'm gonna see if
the Doctor needs me.

516
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,000
Yes! Now get out of there, come on!

517
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:26,320
Lieutenant, everyone on board?
'Ready and waiting. '
Stand by! Two minutes to ignition!

518
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,320
TANNOY: 'Ready to launch.

519
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:35,320
'Outer doors sealed, Countdown
commences, T minus 99, 98... '

520
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,480
The Footprint, it's a gravity pulse,
it stamps down,
the rocket shoots up bit primitive,

521
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,480
it's gonna take the both of us to
keep it stable.

522
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:53,480
Doctor, the Professor's got a
fobwatch, it's the same as yours,
same writing on it, same everything.

523
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,040
Don't be ridiculous. I asked him,
he said he's had it his whole life.

524
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,400
So? He's got the same watch. Yeah,
but it's not a watch... it's this
chameleon thing.

525
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,720
No, no, no... it's this...
it's this thing...

526
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,200
this device that rewrites biology,
changes a Time Lord into a Human.
And it's the same watch!

527
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:14,320
It can't be.
That means he could be a Time Lord!
You might not be the last one!

528
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,120
Jack, keep it level!
But that's brilliant, isn't it?

529
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,360
Yes, it is, course it is!
Depends which one.

530
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,640
Fantastic, yeah... but they died,
the Time Lords,
all of them, they died.

531
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,640
Not if he was human! What did
he say, Martha, what did he say?!

532
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,760
He looked at the watch like
he could hardly see it...

533
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,880
MONTAGE OF VOICES:
'Tardis, the Time Vortex...

534
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,960
'Regeneration. It's the drums,

535
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,120
'the drums, the drums the
never-ending drumbeat,
open me you human fool,

536
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,840
'open the light and
summon me and receive my majesty.

537
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,120
'Destroy him, then you will give your
power to me. '

538
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,400
Chan, Yana, won't you
please take some rest, tho?

539
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,240
ON TANNOY: '13, 12, 11, 10... '

540
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,520
If he escaped the Time War,
then it's a perfect place to hide -
the end of the universe!

541
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,280
And think what the Face of Boe said!
His dying words! He said.

542
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,920
You... are...

543
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,680
not... alone.

544
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,520
Chan, Professor Yana? Tho.

545
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,080
Lieutenant, have you done it?
Did you get velocity?
Have you done it,

546
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,760
Lieutenant, have you done it?

547
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,280
'Affirmative,
we'll see you in Utopia. '

548
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,960
Good luck.

549
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,200
But you've locked them in, tho.
Get it open!

550
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,040
Get it open.

551
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,320
Not to worry, my dear. As one
door closes, another must open.

552
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,480
Chan, you must stop, tho.

553
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,080
Chan, but you've lowered the
defences, the Futurekind
will get in! Tho.

554
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,880
Chan, Professor, I'm so sorry...

555
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,400
...but I must stop you.

556
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,280
You are destroying all our work.

557
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,440
Ohhhhhh,

558
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,080
now I can say I was provoked.

559
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:32,280
SHOUTS AND GROWLING

560
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,520
Did you never think all those
years, standing beside me,
to ask about that watch?

561
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,240
Never?

562
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,520
Did you never once think,
not ever, that you could set me free?

563
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,600
Chan, I'm sorry, tho...
Chan, I'm so sorry.

564
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,680
And you, with your "Chan"
and your "tho", driving me insane...

565
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,040
Chan, Professor, please...
That is not my name.

566
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,920
The Professor was an invention.

567
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,160
So perfect a disguise,
that I forgot who I am.

568
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,640
Chan, then who are you? Tho.

569
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,360
I am the Master.

570
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,360
This way!

571
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,720
Professor! Professor, let me in!

572
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,400
Let me in!

573
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,560
Jack, get the door open NOW!

574
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,320
Professor, professor, where are you?

575
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,720
Professor, professor, are you there,
I need to explain, whatever you do,
don't open that watch.

576
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,720
Utopia.

577
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,200
They're coming!

578
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,840
Open the door!
Open the door, please!

579
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,600
I'm begging you professor,
please listen to me!
just open the door, please!

580
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,560
And locked. Let me in! Let me in!

581
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,360
She's dead... I broke the lock.
Give me a hand.

582
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,080
I'm begging you!
Everything's changed. It's only the
two of us, we're the only ones left.

583
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,120
just let me in!

584
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,560
Killed by an insect.

585
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,280
A girl!

586
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,840
How inappropriate.

587
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:17,120
But still, if the Doctor can be
young and strong...

588
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,280
then so can I.

589
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,760
The Master...

590
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,280
reborn!

591
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:42,040
HE SCREAMS

592
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,480
Doctor, you'd better think of
something!

593
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,480
Ha, ha! Ha, ha!

594
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,320
Oh! Oh!

595
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,120
Now then, Doctor...

596
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,600
ooh, new voice!
IN DIFFERENT PITCHES: Hello! Hello.

597
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,280
Hello.

598
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,600
Anyway! Why don't we stop and have a
nice little chat while I tell you all

599
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,160
my plans and you can work out a
way to stop me, I don't think!

600
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,280
Hold on, I know that voice.

601
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,680
I'm asking you, really properly,
just stop, just think.

602
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,600
Use my name.

603
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,040
Master. I'm sorry.

604
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,520
Tough!

605
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,560
Oh, no you don't!

606
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,360
End of the universe! Have fun!
Bye bye!

607
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,240
Doctor, stop him!

608
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,080
SHOUTS AND SCREAMS
