00:00:00,755 --> 00:00:03,155
<i>Close your eyes
and tell me what you see.</i>

2
00:00:09,904 --> 00:00:11,118
The Library.

3
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,244
<i>Open your eyes again.</i>

4
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,828
<i>Where are you now?</i>

5
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:24,622
My living room, Dr Moon.

6
00:00:25,353 --> 00:00:27,031
<i>When you close your eyes...</i>

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,889
I go to the Library.

8
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:32,505
Go to the Library now.

9
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:36,850
<i>- Are you back there?
- Yes.</i>

10
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:39,015
<i>The same part?</i>

11
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:41,562
<i>No, it's always different.</i>

12
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:43,859
<i>The Library goes on for ever.</i>

13
00:00:45,073 --> 00:00:46,631
<i>How you do move around?</i>

14
00:00:47,888 --> 00:00:49,058
By wishing.

15
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:54,869
- What's wrong?
- Something's here!

16
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,309
Someone's got in!
No-one's supposed to get in!

17
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,671
She's never mentioned anyone.
She's always been alone.

18
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:01,085
<i>Someone's in my library.</i>

19
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:06,254
No! No, please! That's not allowed!

20
00:01:06,354 --> 00:01:07,536
Listen to me.

21
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:10,589
The Library is in your mind.

22
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,269
I know it's in my mind.
But something's got inside!

23
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:26,785
Oh! Hello!

24
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,119
Sorry to burst in on you like this.

25
00:01:29,532 --> 00:01:30,858
OK if we stop here for a bit?

00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:59,269

30
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:14,119
Books! People never
really stop loving books.

31
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:17,584
51st century.

32
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:21,536
By now you've got holovids,
direct to brain downloads, fiction mist,

33
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:25,152
but you need the smell.
The smell of books, Donna. Deep breath.

34
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:30,957
The Library.

35
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:35,017
So big it doesn't need a name.

36
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:36,506
Just a great big "the."

37
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,082
It's like a city.

38
00:02:38,182 --> 00:02:40,442
It's a world. Literally a world.

39
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:42,505
The core of the planet
is the index computer,

40
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:43,902
biggest hard drive ever.

41
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:46,403
And up here,
every book ever written.

42
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:47,785
Whole continents of

43
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:52,271
Jeffrey Archer, Bridget Jones,
Monty Python's Big Red Book.

44
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:54,909
Brand new editions,
specially printed.

45
00:02:57,353 --> 00:02:59,229
<i>We're near the equator, so...</i>

46
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:03,303
this must be Biographies!

47
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:05,282
I love biographies.

48
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:07,482
Yeah, very you.
Always a death at the end.

49
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:10,527
You need a good death.
Without death, there'd only be comedies.

50
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:13,202
Dying gives us size. Oi!

51
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,522
- Spoilers!
- What?

52
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:17,201
These books are from your future.

53
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:19,362
Don't read ahead,
spoil all the surprises.

54
00:03:19,462 --> 00:03:20,469
Like peeking at the end.

55
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,241
Isn't travelling with you
one big spoiler?

56
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:27,630
I try to keep you away
from major plot developments.

57
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:30,915
Which, to be honest,
I seem to be very bad at,

58
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,685
cos... you know what?

59
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:34,742
This is the biggest
library in the universe.

60
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:37,664
So where is everyone?

61
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:43,589
It's silent.

62
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,549
The Library?

63
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,221
The planet.

64
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,069
<i>The whole planet.</i>

65
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:57,591
Maybe it's a Sunday.

66
00:03:57,898 --> 00:03:59,750
No, I never land on Sundays.

67
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,002
Sundays are boring. Well...

68
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:06,557
Maybe everyone's really,
really quiet.

69
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,393
Yeah, maybe.

70
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:11,052
But they'd still show up
on the system.

71
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:14,242
Doctor, why are we here?
Really, why?

72
00:04:14,342 --> 00:04:16,602
Oh, you know, just passing.

73
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:18,482
No, seriously.

74
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:22,014
It was all, "Let's hit the beach,"
then suddenly we're in a library.

75
00:04:22,114 --> 00:04:23,962
- Why?
- Now, that's interesting.

76
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:26,124
- What?
- Scanning for life forms.

77
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,084
<i>If I do a scan looking for
your basic humanoids, you know,</i>

78
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:32,344
<i>your book readers, few limbs and
a face, apart from us, I get nothing.</i>

79
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:34,842
Zippo, nada, see?

80
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:40,035
Nobody home. But if I widen
the parameters to any kind of life...

81
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:46,482
<i>A million million.</i>

82
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:48,142
Gives up after that.

83
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:52,149
A million million.

84
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:54,809
<i>But there's nothing here.</i>

85
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:56,223
<i>There's no-one.</i>

86
00:04:57,687 --> 00:04:59,157
<i>And not a sound.</i>

87
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:03,512
A million million life forms,

88
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,382
and silence in the Library.

89
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,931
But there's no-one here.

90
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:13,642
There's just books.
I mean, it's not the books, is it?

91
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:15,562
I mean, it can't be
the books, can it?

92
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:18,142
I mean, books can't be alive?

93
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,662
<i>Welcome!</i>

94
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:35,349
- That came from in there.
- Yeah!

95
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:53,649
I am Courtesy Node 710/aqua.

96
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:57,474
Please enjoy the Library and
respect the personal access codes

97
00:05:57,574 --> 00:06:02,348
of all your fellow readers
regardless of species or hygiene taboo.

98
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:04,444
That face, it looks real.

99
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:06,132
Yeah, don't worry about it.

100
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:08,749
But a statue with a real face, though!

101
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:12,251
- It's a hologram, isn't it?
- No, but really, it's fine.

102
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:15,942
Additional, There follows a brief
message from the head librarian

103
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,553
for your urgent attention.

104
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:20,068
It has been edited for tone and content

105
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:23,797
by a Felman Lux Automated
Decency Filter.

106
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:25,706
Message follows.

107
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:26,621
"Run.

108
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,229
"For God's sake, run.

109
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:31,138
<i>"Nowhere is safe.</i>

110
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:35,930
"The Library has sealed itself,
we can't... Oh, they're here.

111
00:06:36,682 --> 00:06:40,362
"Arg. Slarg. Snick."
Message ends.

112
00:06:40,843 --> 00:06:45,522
<i>Please switch off your mobile comm
units for the comfort of other readers.</i>

113
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:47,680
So that's why we're here.

114
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,596
Any other messages, same date stamp?

115
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,441
<i>One additional message.</i>

116
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:56,671
This message carries a Felman
Lux coherency warning of...

117
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:59,092
- Yeah, yeah, fine, just play it.
-  5, 0, 11...

123
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:15,749
Donna...

124
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,495
Yeah?

125
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:20,942
Stay out of the shadows.

126
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,514
Why, what's in the shadows?

127
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:43,787
So...

128
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:46,639
We weren't just
in the neighbourhood.

129
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:49,404
Yeah, I kind of, sort of lied a bit.

130
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,069
I got a message
on the psychic paper.

131
00:07:54,445 --> 00:07:56,272
What do you think, cry for help?

132
00:07:57,248 --> 00:08:00,189
Cry for help, with a kiss?

133
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:02,578
Oh, we've all done that.

134
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:05,042
- Who's it from?
- No idea.

135
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:07,493
- So why did we come here, why did you?
- Donna.

136
00:08:11,164 --> 00:08:12,928
- What's happening?
- Run!

137
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:17,902
- What, is it locked?
- Jammed! The wood's warped!

138
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:21,493
Sonic it, use the thingy!

139
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:25,045
- I can't, it's wood!
- What, it doesn't do wood?!

140
00:08:25,145 --> 00:08:27,392
If I can vibrate the molecules,
fry the bindings,

141
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,147
- I can shatterline the interface.
- Oh, get out of the way!

142
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:39,700
Oh! Hello!

143
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:43,440
Sorry to burst in on you like this.
OK if we stop here for a bit?

144
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:47,355
What is it?

145
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,967
Security camera.

146
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,840
Switched itself off.

147
00:08:58,267 --> 00:09:01,396
They were in my library.
How can they be in my library?

148
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,580
Who were they?

149
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,605
What's that? What's that noise?

150
00:09:05,705 --> 00:09:06,650
What noise?

151
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:11,111
Nice door skills, Donna.

152
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:15,134
Well, you know, boyfriends, sometimes
you need the element of surprise.

153
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,598
<i>What was that ?</i>

154
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:18,569
What was after us?

155
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,090
I mean, did we just run away
from a power cut?

156
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:22,251
Possibly.

157
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,192
Are we safe here?

158
00:09:27,507 --> 00:09:29,227
Course we're safe.
There's a little shop.

159
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:36,107
Gotcha!

160
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:39,405
No, stop it!

161
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:42,167
No, no!

162
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,215
Ooh, I'm sorry.

163
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:50,407
I really am, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry. It's alive.

164
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:52,803
You said it was a security camera.

165
00:09:53,598 --> 00:09:54,473
It is.

166
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:56,951
It's an alive one.

167
00:09:57,314 --> 00:09:58,371
Can you hear me?

168
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,727
Are you all right?

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,247
- Others are coming.
- Who's coming?

170
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:07,691
Who are the others?

171
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:09,660
The Library is breached.

172
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,287
- Others are coming.
- What others?

173
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:13,591
<i>Others?</i>

174
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,938
<i>What does it mean, "others"?</i>

175
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:22,020
Excuse me,
what does it mean, "others"?

176
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,340
That's barely more than a speak
your weight machine, it can't help you.

177
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,748
So why's it got a face?

178
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,070
This flesh aspect was donated
by Mark Chambers

179
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,178
on the occasion of his death.

180
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,740
It's a real face?

181
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,396
It has been actualised
individually for you

182
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:41,527
<i>from the many facial aspects
saved to our extensive flesh banks.</i>

183
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:43,847
Please enjoy.

184
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:46,510
It chose me a dead face
it thought I'd like?

185
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:49,081
That statue's got a real
dead person's face on it!

186
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,260
<i>It's the 51st century.</i>

187
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,140
That's basically
like donating a park bench.

188
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:54,857
It's donating a face!

189
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:56,840
No, wait, no!

190
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:59,599
- Oi! Hands!
- The shadow, look.

191
00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:02,564
What about it?

192
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:04,510
Count the shadows.

193
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:09,260
One. There,
I counted it, one shadow.

194
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,167
Yeah...

195
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,560
But what's casting it?

196
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,535
Oh! I'm thick!
Look at me, I'm old and thick!

197
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:28,741
Head's too full of stuff,
I need a bigger head!

198
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:34,940
<i>Power must be going.</i>

199
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,867
This place runs on fission cells.
They'll outburn the sun.

200
00:11:38,524 --> 00:11:41,089
- Then why's it dark?
- It's not dark.

201
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:46,446
That shadow.

202
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,204
It's gone.

203
00:11:49,155 --> 00:11:50,638
We need to get back to the TARDIS.

204
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:51,407
Why?

205
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:54,140
Because that shadow hasn't gone.
It's moved.

206
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:55,830
Reminder,

207
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,380
the Library has been breached,
others are coming.

208
00:11:58,915 --> 00:11:59,484
Reminder,

209
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:02,460
<i>the Library has been breached,
others are coming.</i>

210
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:03,992
<i>Reminder,</i>

211
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:05,483
<i>the Library has been breached...</i>

212
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:28,247
Hello, sweetie.

213
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:30,315
- Get out.
- Doctor?

214
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:33,047
All of you, turn around,
get back in your rocket and fly away.

215
00:12:33,147 --> 00:12:35,112
Tell your grandchildren
you came here and lived,

216
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,295
they won't believe you.

217
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:38,954
Pop your helmets, everyone.
We've got breathers.

218
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,719
How do you know they're not androids?

219
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:43,203
Cos I've dated androids.

220
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:45,462
- They're rubbish.
- Who is this?

221
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:48,500
You said we were the only expedition,
I paid for exclusives.

222
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,866
I lied, I'm always lying.

223
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:51,042
Bound to be others.

224
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,564
Miss Evangelista,
I want to see the contracts.

225
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:56,073
You came through the north door?
Much damage?

226
00:12:56,173 --> 00:12:59,289
Please, just leave. I'm asking you
seriously and properly, just lea...

227
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:00,820
Did you say expedition?

228
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,425
My expedition, I funded it.

229
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:07,100
Oh, you're not, are you?
Tell me you're not archaeologists.

230
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:09,121
Got a problem with archaeologists?

231
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,024
I'm a time traveller.
I point and laugh at archaeologists.

232
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:15,740
Professor River Song, archaeologist.

233
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:16,960
River Song? Lovely name.

234
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,725
As you're leaving, you need
to set up a quarantine beacon.

235
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:20,708
Code-wall the planet,

236
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:24,463
the whole planet. Nobody comes here,
not ever again. No-one living thing.

237
00:13:24,563 --> 00:13:27,298
Not here, not ever. Stop right there!
What's your name?

238
00:13:27,398 --> 00:13:28,060
Anita.

239
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,660
Anita, stay out of the shadows.

240
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,140
Not a foot, not a finger in the shadows
till you're safely back in your ship.

241
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,340
Stay in the light.
Find a nice, bright spot and just stand.

242
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:40,367
If you understand me,
look very, very scared.

243
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:48,367
No, bit more scared than that.

244
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:53,295
OK, do for now.
You, who are you?

245
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:54,440
- Dave.
- OK, Dave...

246
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,625
Oh, well Other Dave,
because that's Proper Dave

247
00:13:57,725 --> 00:14:00,428
the pilot, he was the first Dave,
so when we...

248
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:03,275
Other Dave, the way you came,
does it look the same as before?

249
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,165
Yeah. Oh, it's a bit darker.

250
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:06,091
How much darker?

251
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:09,064
Oh, I could see where we came through
just a moment ago. I can't now.

252
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:10,929
Seal the door. Find another way out.

253
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:14,457
We're not looking for a way out.
Miss Evangelista?

254
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:17,998
I'm Mr Lux's personal... everything.

255
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,988
You need to sign these contracts
agreeing that your experiences

256
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:22,515
inside the Library are...

257
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:25,954
the intellectual property of
the Felman Lux Corporation.

258
00:14:26,054 --> 00:14:28,541
- Right, give it here.
- Yeah, lovely. Thanks.

259
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:34,282
My family built this library.
I have rights.

260
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:37,700
You have a mouth that won't stop.
You think there's danger here?

261
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,276
Something came to this library
and killed everything in it,

262
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:41,780
killed a whole world.

263
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,980
- Danger? Could be.
- That was 100 years ago.

264
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,650
The Library's been silent for 100 years.
Whatever came here is long dead.

265
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:48,920
Bet your life?

266
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:50,967
Always.

267
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:53,516
<i>What do you doing?</i>

268
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:55,793
<i>He said seal the door.</i>

269
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:57,527
Torch! You're taking orders from him?

270
00:14:57,627 --> 00:14:58,786
Spooky, isn't it?

271
00:15:08,011 --> 00:15:09,967
Almost every species in the universe

272
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,460
<i>has an irrational fear of the dark.</i>

273
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,583
<i>But they're wrong.
Cos it's not irrational.</i>

274
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,761
It's Vashta Nerada.

275
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:22,140
<i>What's Vashta Nerada?</i>

276
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,015
It's what's in the dark.

277
00:15:25,398 --> 00:15:27,068
It's what's always in the dark.

278
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,675
- Lights! You got lights?
- What for?

279
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:35,454
Form a circle, safe area,
big as you can, lights pointing out.

280
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:38,157
- Do as he says.
- You're not listening to this man?!

281
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:40,378
Apparently, I am. Unpack the lights.

282
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:43,060
Other Dave, make sure the door's secure,
then help Anita.

283
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,733
Mr Lux, put your helmet
back on, block the visor.

284
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:48,727
Proper Dave, I want you
to access the library database,

285
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:51,365
see what you can find about what
happened a hundred years ago.

286
00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:53,740
Pretty Boy, you're with me.

287
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:55,540
Step into my office.

288
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,716
Professor Song,
why am I the only one wearing my helmet?

289
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:00,693
I don't fancy you.

290
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:03,671
Probably, I can help you.

291
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:06,280
Pretty Boy, with me, I said.

292
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,046
- Oh, I'm Pretty Boy?
- Yes.

293
00:16:12,315 --> 00:16:13,847
Ooh, that came out a bit quick!

294
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:15,412
Pretty?!

295
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:21,221
Don't let your shadows cross!
Seriously. Don't even let them touch.

296
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:24,469
- Any of them could be infected.
- How can a shadow be infected?

297
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:25,958
'Scuse me, can I help?

298
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:28,457
- No, we're fine.
- I could just...

299
00:16:28,557 --> 00:16:29,767
you know, hold things.

300
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,407
No, really, we're OK.

301
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:32,749
éOK.

302
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:40,828
Couldn't she help?

303
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:43,953
Trust me, I just spent 4 days on
a ship with that woman. She's...

304
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:46,872
Couldn't tell the difference between
the escape pod and the bathroom.

305
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,420
<i>We had to go back for her.</i>

306
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:50,196
Twice.

307
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:04,604
- Thanks.
- For what?

308
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:06,293
The usual. For coming when I call.

309
00:17:06,837 --> 00:17:07,945
That was you?

310
00:17:08,113 --> 00:17:10,097
You're doing a good job,
like you don't know me.

311
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,646
I'm assuming there's a reason.

312
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:15,093
- A fairly good one, actually.
- OK, shall we do diaries, then?

313
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:16,632
Where are we this time?

314
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,430
Going by your face,
I'd say it's early days for you, yeah?

315
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,687
So, erm...

316
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:24,593
Crash of the Byzantium...
have we done that yet?

317
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:29,560
Obviously ringing no bells.

318
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:34,465
Right, Picnic at Asgard.

319
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:36,697
Have we done Asgard yet?

320
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:40,620
Obviously not.

321
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,167
Blimey, very early days, then. Hoo!

322
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:46,849
Life with a time traveller
never knew it could be such hard work.

323
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:53,279
Look at you!

324
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,527
- You're young.
- I'm really not, you know.

325
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:00,367
No, but you are.

326
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:02,933
Your eyes.

327
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:06,831
<i>You're younger
than I've ever seen you.</i>

328
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:10,842
You've seen me before, then?

329
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,990
Doctor...

330
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:18,525
Please tell me you know who I am?

331
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,603
Who are you?

332
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:34,265
Sorry, that was me. Trying to get
through into the security protocols,

333
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:35,730
I seem to have set something off.

334
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,207
- What is that, is that an alarm?
- Doctor.

335
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:41,512
- Doctor, that sounds like...
- It is.

336
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:42,813
It's a phone!

337
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:01,396
Dad!

338
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:02,666
<i>In a minute.</i>

339
00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:13,137
I'm trying to call up the data core,
it's not responding. Just that noise.

340
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,571
- But it's a phone!
- Let me try something.

341
00:19:19,988 --> 00:19:22,985
Dad! The phone,
aren't you going to answer it?

342
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:25,331
It's not ringing, sweetie.

343
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:40,866
OK, doesn't like that,
let's try something else.

344
00:19:52,717 --> 00:19:54,127
'OK, here it comes.'

345
00:19:58,048 --> 00:19:58,786
Hello?

346
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:01,668
Hello. Are you in my television?

347
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,322
Well, no, I'm...

348
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:08,544
I'm sort of in space.
I was trying to call up

349
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:11,089
the data core of a triple-grid
security processor.

350
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:13,557
Would you like to speak to my dad?

351
00:20:14,977 --> 00:20:16,773
Your dad or your mum,
that would be lovely.

352
00:20:19,106 --> 00:20:22,047
I know you! You were in my library.

353
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:23,104
YOUR library?

354
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,900
The Library's never been
on the television before.

355
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,333
What have you done?

356
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:32,369
Ah, I... just rerouted the interface...

357
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:36,505
What happened. Who was that?

358
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:50,691
Keep working on those lights,
we need those lights!

359
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,699
You heard him, people,
let there be light.

360
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:12,157
Sorry. Youre not allowed to see
inside the book, its against the rules.

361
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:13,634
What rules?

362
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:15,476
Your rules.

363
00:21:43,814 --> 00:21:44,903
What's that?

364
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,630
- I didn't do that, did you do that?
- Not me.

365
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:54,607
What's CAL?

366
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:15,516
You all right?

367
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:18,168
What's that? What's happening?

368
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:19,407
<i>I don't know.</i>

369
00:22:20,271 --> 00:22:23,993
Oh, thanks for... you know...
offering to help with the lights.

370
00:22:25,282 --> 00:22:26,859
They don't want me.

371
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:29,428
They think I'm stupid cos I'm pretty.

372
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:32,372
Course they don't, nobody thinks that.

373
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:33,801
No, they're right though.

374
00:22:34,026 --> 00:22:35,567
I'm a moron, me.

375
00:22:35,984 --> 00:22:38,074
My dad said I have the IQ of plankton.

376
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:39,508
And I was pleased.

377
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:42,086
See, thats funny.

378
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:46,434
No, I really was pleased.

379
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:50,018
- Is that funny?
- No, no.

380
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:54,887
What's causing that?

381
00:22:55,147 --> 00:22:56,552
Is it the little girl?

382
00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:58,277
<i>But who is the little girl?</i>

383
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,085
What's she got to do with this place?

384
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:08,079
How does the data core work?
What's the principle? What's CAL?

385
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,343
Ask Mr Lux.

386
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:11,457
CAL, what is it?

387
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:15,367
Sorry. You didn't sign your
Personal Experience contracts.

388
00:23:16,486 --> 00:23:19,057
Mr Lux, right now,

389
00:23:19,157 --> 00:23:22,142
you're in more danger than you've
ever been in your whole life.

390
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:23,887
And you're protecting a patent?

391
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:26,673
I'm protecting my family's pride.

392
00:23:26,936 --> 00:23:31,647
Well, funny thing, Mr Lux. I don't
want to see everyone in this room dead

393
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:35,055
because some idiot thinks
his pride is more important.

394
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,237
Then why don't you sign his contract?

395
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:44,717
I didn't either.
I'm getting worse than you.

396
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:48,188
Ok, ok, ok.

397
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:50,547
Let's start at the beginning.
What happened here?

398
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,892
On the actual day, a hundred years ago,
what physically happened?

399
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,451
<i>There was a message
from the library. Just one.</i>

400
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,716
The lights are going out.

401
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,007
Then the computer sealed the planet and
there was nothing for a hundred years.

402
00:24:07,422 --> 00:24:11,847
It's taken 3 generations of my family
to decode the seals and get back in.

403
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:13,132
Excuse me...

404
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:14,489
<i>Not, just now.</i>

405
00:24:16,298 --> 00:24:19,019
There was one other thing
in the last message...

406
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,391
That's confidential.

407
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:21,561
I trust this man.

408
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:23,695
With my life, with everything.

409
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,054
- You've only just met him.
- No, he's only just met me.

410
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:31,776
This might be important actually...

411
00:24:31,982 --> 00:24:33,365
In a moment!

412
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:38,202
This is a data extract
that came with the message.

413
00:24:38,982 --> 00:24:41,966
4022 saved. No survivors.

414
00:24:44,287 --> 00:24:47,033
4022, that's the exact number of people
who were in the Library

415
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:48,654
when the planet was sealed.

416
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:52,681
But how can 4022 people have
been saved if there were no survivors?

417
00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:55,240
That's what were here to find out.

418
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,869
And so far, what we havent
found, are any bodies.

419
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:19,727
Everybody, careful. Stay in the light.

420
00:26:19,827 --> 00:26:21,342
Keep saying. I don't see the point!

421
00:26:21,442 --> 00:26:23,062
- Who screamed?
- Miss Evangelista.

422
00:26:23,162 --> 00:26:24,344
Where is she?

423
00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:28,276
Miss Evangelista,
please state your current...

424
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:35,264
Please state your current...

425
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,834
position.

426
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,660
It's her.

427
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:56,622
It's Miss Evangelista.

428
00:26:56,722 --> 00:26:58,892
<i>We heard her scream a few seconds ago.</i>

429
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,954
What could do that to a
person in a few seconds?

430
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:03,472
- It took less than a few seconds.
- What did?

431
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:04,389
<i>Hello?</i>

432
00:27:04,777 --> 00:27:09,568
Erm, I'm sorry everyone
this isn't going to be pleasant.

433
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:11,943
She's ghosting.

434
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:13,307
She's what?

435
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:16,357
<i>Hello, excuse me?</i>

436
00:27:17,332 --> 00:27:19,810
<i>I'm sorry, hello, excuse me?</i>

437
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,602
That's. That's her.
That's Miss Evangelista!

438
00:27:23,822 --> 00:27:26,642
I don't want to sound horrible,
but couldn't we just. You know?

439
00:27:26,742 --> 00:27:28,942
This is her last moment... no, we cant.

440
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:30,702
A little respect, thank you.

441
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,972
<i>Sorry, where am I? Excuse me?</i>

442
00:27:34,072 --> 00:27:36,072
But that's Miss Evangelista.

443
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:39,367
It's a Data Ghost,
she'll be gone in a moment.

444
00:27:40,562 --> 00:27:43,990
Miss Evangelista,
you're fine, just relax.

445
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,732
We'll be with you presently.

446
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:47,646
What's a Data Ghost?

447
00:27:48,342 --> 00:27:50,149
There's a neural relay
in the communicator.

448
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:51,644
Let's you send thought mails.

449
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:54,197
<i>That's it there, those green lights.</i>

450
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,229
<i>Sometimes it can hold an impression
of a living consciousness</i>

451
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:00,060
<i>for a short time after death.</i>

452
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:02,169
Like an after image.

453
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:05,601
My grandfather lasted a day.

454
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:08,953
Kept talking about his shoelaces.

455
00:28:11,342 --> 00:28:12,575
She's in there!

456
00:28:12,851 --> 00:28:16,140
<i>I can't see, I can't... Where am I?</i>

457
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,374
She's just brain waves now.
The pattern won't hold for long.

458
00:28:21,222 --> 00:28:24,003
She's conscious! She's thinking.

459
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:25,672
<i>I can't see, I can't...</i>

460
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:27,834
<i>I don't know what I'm thinking.</i>

461
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:30,059
She's a footprint on the beach.

462
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:32,011
And the tides coming in.

463
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:33,815
<i>Where is that woman?</i>

464
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:36,330
<i>The nice woman... is she there?</i>

465
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,864
What woman?

466
00:28:40,472 --> 00:28:45,242
She means... I think she means me.

467
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:47,766
<i>Is she there? The nice woman?</i>

468
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,554
Yes, she's here, hang on.

469
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:55,458
Go ahead. She can hear you.

470
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:56,843
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

471
00:28:58,402 --> 00:28:59,183
Help her.

472
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:02,733
- She's dead.
- Yeah. Help her.

473
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:07,200
<i>Hello? Is that the nice woman?</i>

474
00:29:07,742 --> 00:29:11,678
Yeah. Hello.
Yeah, I'm I'm... I'm here.

475
00:29:12,512 --> 00:29:13,446
You OK?

476
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:17,687
<i>What I said before...
about being stupid...</i>

477
00:29:18,318 --> 00:29:20,412
<i>don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

478
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,112
Course I won't.
Course I won't tell them.

479
00:29:23,212 --> 00:29:25,487
<i>Don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

480
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,516
I won't tell them. I said I won't.

481
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:32,181
<i>Don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

482
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:35,415
I'm not going to tell them.

483
00:29:35,515 --> 00:29:36,548
Don't tell the others...

484
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:38,838
She's looping now.
The patterns degrading.

485
00:29:38,938 --> 00:29:42,887
<i>I can't think, I... don't know, I...</i>

486
00:29:44,187 --> 00:29:44,860
<i>I...</i>

487
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:46,474
<i>I...</i>

488
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:48,287
<i>Ice cream.</i>

489
00:29:49,332 --> 00:29:50,307
<i>Ice cream.</i>

490
00:29:51,102 --> 00:29:52,097
<i>Ice cream.</i>

491
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:53,836
<i>Ice cream.</i>

492
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:55,292
<i>Ice cream.</i>

493
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:57,374
- Doe's anybody mind if I.
-  Ice cream.

494
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,201
<i> Ice cream.</i>

495
00:29:59,877 --> 00:30:00,765
<i> Ice cream.</i>

496
00:30:01,697 --> 00:30:02,807
<i> Ice cream.</i>

497
00:30:06,424 --> 00:30:07,162
<i>Was...</i>

498
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,608
<i>That was horrible.</i>

499
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,086
That was the most horrible
thing I've ever seen.

500
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:17,222
No. It's just a freak of technology.

501
00:30:19,222 --> 00:30:23,354
But whatever did this to her,
whatever killed her...

502
00:30:24,162 --> 00:30:25,712
I'd like a word with that.

503
00:30:25,812 --> 00:30:26,971
I'll introduce you.

504
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:39,116
- I'm going to need a packed lunch.
- Hang on.

505
00:30:41,844 --> 00:30:44,240
- What's in that book?
- Spoilers.

506
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:45,694
Who are you?

507
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:49,082
- Professor River Song, University of...
- To me.

508
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:52,795
- Who are you to me?
- Again... spoilers.

509
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:57,043
Chicken, and a bit of salad.
Knock yourself out.

510
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:04,313
Right, you lot.
Let's all meet the Vashta Nerada!

511
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:11,222
Darling, Dr Moon is going now.

512
00:31:11,322 --> 00:31:13,872
But hed like a word with
you alone, is that all right?

513
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,759
- Yes, of course, Dr Moon.
- Thank you.

514
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:21,663
Now,

515
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:23,609
listen.

516
00:31:25,924 --> 00:31:27,088
This is important.

517
00:31:28,045 --> 00:31:32,219
There's the realworld, and
there's the world of nightmares.

518
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:34,142
That's right, Isn't there?
You understand?

519
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:35,867
Yes, I know, Dr Moon.

520
00:31:37,352 --> 00:31:39,567
What I want you to remember is this...

521
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:40,886
<i>and I know its hard.</i>

522
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:47,327
The real world is a lie,
and your nightmares are real.

523
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,482
The Library is real.

524
00:31:49,582 --> 00:31:53,632
There are people trapped in
there, people who need to be saved.

525
00:31:54,715 --> 00:31:56,441
The shadows are moving again.

526
00:31:57,192 --> 00:32:00,127
<i>Those people are depending on you.</i>

527
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:02,367
Only you can save them.

528
00:32:03,682 --> 00:32:04,608
<i>Only you.</i>

529
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:14,887
You travel with him, don't you?

530
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,806
The Doctor, you travel with him.

531
00:32:18,463 --> 00:32:19,401
What of it?

532
00:32:20,077 --> 00:32:21,641
<i>Proper Dave, could you move over a bit?</i>

533
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:22,348
Why?

534
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:24,488
Just over there by the water cooler.
Thanks.

535
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,346
You know him, don't you?

536
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:31,210
Oh, God, do I know that man.

537
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:34,720
<i>We go way back, that man and me.</i>

538
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,000
<i>Just not this far back.</i>

539
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:38,367
<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

540
00:32:39,362 --> 00:32:40,789
He hasn't met me yet.

541
00:32:43,323 --> 00:32:46,545
I sent him a message but
it went wrong, it arrived too early.

542
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:49,849
This is the Doctor in the
days before he knew me.

543
00:32:52,652 --> 00:32:56,452
And he looks at me,
and he looks right through me.

544
00:32:56,552 --> 00:32:58,744
And it shouldn't kill me, but it does.

545
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:02,010
What are you talking about?
Are you just talking rubbish?

546
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,872
Do you know him or don't you?

547
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:07,224
- Donna, quiet, I'm working!
- Sorry!

548
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:10,045
Donna? You're Donna? Donna Noble?

549
00:33:10,145 --> 00:33:12,060
Yeah, why?

550
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:15,467
I do know the Doctor.

551
00:33:16,222 --> 00:33:17,513
But in the future.

552
00:33:18,102 --> 00:33:19,759
His personal future.

553
00:33:20,554 --> 00:33:22,162
So why don't you know me?

554
00:33:22,972 --> 00:33:24,264
Where am I in the future?

555
00:33:26,976 --> 00:33:29,016
<i>OK! We've got a live one.</i>

556
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:34,565
That's not darkness down those
tunnels, this is not a shadow.

557
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,527
It's a swarm.

558
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,742
A man-eating swarm.

559
00:33:42,508 --> 00:33:45,708
The piranhas of the air,
the Vashta Nerada.

560
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:48,824
Literally the shadows
that melt the flesh.

561
00:33:49,493 --> 00:33:52,284
Most planets have them,
but usually in small clusters.

562
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:55,932
I've never seen an infestation
on this scale, or this aggressive.

563
00:33:56,032 --> 00:33:57,917
What d'you mean, most planets?
Not Earth?

564
00:33:58,017 --> 00:34:00,995
Mmmm, Earth, and a billion other worlds.

565
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,166
Where there's meat,
there's Vashta Nerada.

566
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:05,257
<i>You can see them sometimes, if you look.</i>

567
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,602
The dust in sunbeams.

568
00:34:09,335 --> 00:34:11,719
If they were on Earth, we'd know.

569
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:14,117
Nah, normally they live on road kill.

570
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,650
<i>But sometimes people go missing.</i>

571
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,254
Not everyone comes back out of the dark.

572
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:21,662
Every shadow?

573
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:24,706
No. But any shadow.

574
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,483
So what do we do?

575
00:34:26,915 --> 00:34:28,610
Daleks: aim for the eyestalk.

576
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,606
Sontarans: back of the neck.

577
00:34:31,032 --> 00:34:35,882
Vashta Nerada: Run! Just run.

578
00:34:36,052 --> 00:34:37,146
Run where?

579
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:39,842
This is an index point.
There must be an exit teleport.

580
00:34:39,942 --> 00:34:42,202
Don't look at me, I haven't
memorised the schematics!

581
00:34:42,302 --> 00:34:43,233
Doctor,

582
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,965
little shop! They always make you
go through it on the way out

583
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:47,623
so they can sell you stuff.

584
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:51,121
You're right! Brilliant!
That's why I like the little shop!

585
00:34:51,221 --> 00:34:52,059
OK, let's move it.

586
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,082
<i>Actually, Proper Dave, could you
stay where you are for a moment?</i>

587
00:34:55,256 --> 00:34:55,982
Why?

588
00:34:57,684 --> 00:35:00,703
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

589
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,078
But you've got two shadows.

590
00:35:11,647 --> 00:35:16,180
<i>It's how they hunt, they latch on
to a food source and keep it fresh.</i>

591
00:35:18,102 --> 00:35:20,028
- What do I do?
- You stay absolutely still.

592
00:35:20,128 --> 00:35:22,567
Like there's a wasp in the room,
a million wasps.

593
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,608
- We're not leaving you, Dave.
- Of course not.

594
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,666
Where's your helmet?
Don't point, tell me.

595
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:29,040
On the floor, by my bag.

596
00:35:29,547 --> 00:35:31,157
Don't cross his shadow!

597
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:38,536
Thanks.

598
00:35:39,074 --> 00:35:42,912
Now, the rest of you,
helmets back on and sealed up.

599
00:35:43,012 --> 00:35:45,644
- We'll need everything we've got.
- We haven't any helmets.

600
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:48,073
- Yeah, we're safe anyway.
- How are we safe?

601
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,787
That was a clever lie to shut you up.

602
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:51,792
Professor, anything
I can do with the suit?

603
00:35:51,892 --> 00:35:55,487
What good are suits? Miss Evanglista
was wearing one, there was nothing left.

604
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:59,055
We can increase the mesh-density
dial it up 400%. Make it a tougher meal.

605
00:35:59,155 --> 00:35:59,774
<i>OK.</i>

606
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:04,410
- 800%! Pass it on.
- Gotcha!

607
00:36:04,673 --> 00:36:06,606
- What's that?
- It's a screwdriver.

608
00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:10,568
- It's sonic.
- Yeah, I know. Snap!

609
00:36:17,772 --> 00:36:19,050
With me, come on!

610
00:36:23,622 --> 00:36:25,602
Are we shopping?
Is it a good time to shop?

611
00:36:25,702 --> 00:36:28,003
No talking, just moving!
Stand up in the middle!

612
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,598
Its a teleport, stand in the middle.

613
00:36:29,698 --> 00:36:31,388
Can't send the others,
TARDIS won't recognise them.

614
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:33,647
- What you doing?
- You don't have suit, not safe!

615
00:36:33,747 --> 00:36:36,443
You don't have a suit, you're
in just as much danger as I am...

616
00:36:36,543 --> 00:36:38,033
Donna! Let me explain.

617
00:36:38,395 --> 00:36:41,247
- Oh, that's how you do it!
- Doctor!

618
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,274
Where did it go?

619
00:36:55,906 --> 00:36:59,041
It's just gone. I looked round,
one shadow. See.

620
00:36:59,141 --> 00:37:00,932
Does that mean we can leave?

621
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:03,882
I don't know why we're still here.
We can leave him, can't we?

622
00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:06,732
- I mean, no offence.
- Shut up, Mr Lux.

623
00:37:06,832 --> 00:37:09,592
Did you feel anything?
Like an energy transfer?

624
00:37:09,692 --> 00:37:11,996
No, no, but, look, it's gone.

625
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,092
Stop there, stop moving.

626
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,607
They're never just gone.
And they never give up.

627
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:22,046
Well, this ones benign.

628
00:37:22,647 --> 00:37:24,389
<i>Hey, who turned out the lights?</i>

629
00:37:25,002 --> 00:37:25,942
No-one, they're fine.

630
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:27,974
<i>No, seriously, turn them back on!</i>

631
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,556
They are on.

632
00:37:30,392 --> 00:37:31,995
<i>I can't see a ruddy thing.</i>

633
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,435
Dave, turn round.

634
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:36,767
What's going on? Why can't I see?

635
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:39,428
Is the power gone, are we safe here?

636
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:42,092
Dave, I want you to stay still,
absolutely still.

637
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:45,414
Dave, Dave? Dave,
can you hear me, are you all right?

638
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:46,972
Talk to me, Dave.

639
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:51,132
I'm fine, I'm OK, I'm... fine.

640
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,732
I want you to stay still,
absolutely still.

641
00:37:53,832 --> 00:37:56,972
I'm fine, I'm OK, I'm... fine.

642
00:37:58,872 --> 00:38:01,990
I can't. Why can't I? I...

643
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:07,094
I can't. Why can't I? I...

644
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:11,655
I can't. Why can't I?

645
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:13,488
I...

646
00:38:13,762 --> 00:38:15,382
He's gone. He's ghosting.

647
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:17,542
Then why is he still standing?

648
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:20,138
Who turned out the lights?

649
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:23,422
<i>Who turned out the lights?</i>

650
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,649
Doctor, don't!

651
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,382
Dave, can you hear me?

652
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:28,560
Who turned out the lights?

653
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:33,797
<i>Who turned out the lights?</i>

654
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:36,613
- Who turned out the lights?
- Scuse me!

655
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:40,525
Back from it, get back, right back!

656
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:49,282
- Doesn't move very fast does it?
- It's a swarm in a suit.

657
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,769
But it's learning.

658
00:38:56,422 --> 00:38:57,622
What do we do? Where do we go?

659
00:38:57,722 --> 00:38:59,367
See that wall behind you?

660
00:39:00,612 --> 00:39:01,343
DUCK!

661
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:03,940
Squareness gun!

662
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:07,082
Everybody out. Go, go, go!

663
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:08,832
Move it, move, move!

664
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,322
Move it, move, move!

665
00:39:12,473 --> 00:39:14,557
- You said not every shadow.
- But any shadow!

666
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:19,382
Who turned out the lights?

667
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,207
Run!

668
00:39:34,642 --> 00:39:36,208
éSweetie, dinner's ready.

669
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:39,672
Donna Noble has been saved.

670
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:42,612
Sweetie?

671
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,241
<i>Trying to boost the power.</i>

672
00:40:07,512 --> 00:40:09,572
Light doesn't stop them,
but it slows them down.

673
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:13,250
So, what's the plan? Do we have a plan?

674
00:40:14,057 --> 00:40:15,446
Your screwdriver...

675
00:40:18,362 --> 00:40:21,622
- Looks exactly like mine.
- Yeah. You gave it to me.

676
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,651
I don't give my screwdriver to anyone.

677
00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:24,896
I'm not anyone.

678
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:28,268
- Who are you?
- What's the plan?

679
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:31,267
I teleported Donna back to the TARDIS.

680
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,444
If we don't get back in five hours,
emergency program one activates.

681
00:40:34,544 --> 00:40:35,662
Take her home.

682
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,954
- We need to get a shift on.
- She's not there.

683
00:40:38,907 --> 00:40:40,258
I should've received a signal,

684
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:42,507
console signals me if
there's a teleport breach.

685
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,164
Maybe the co-ordinates slipped.
The equipment here's aged.

686
00:40:46,212 --> 00:40:47,247
Donna Noble.

687
00:40:47,347 --> 00:40:51,262
There's a Donna Noble in this library,
do you have the software to locate her?

688
00:40:51,802 --> 00:40:53,955
Donna Noble has left the Library.

689
00:40:54,543 --> 00:40:57,942
- Donna Noble has been saved.
- Donna!

690
00:40:58,798 --> 00:41:00,962
<i>Donna Noble has left the Library.</i>

691
00:41:01,538 --> 00:41:02,971
<i>Donna Noble has been saved.</i>

692
00:41:03,071 --> 00:41:05,917
How can it be Donna?
