00:00:00,338 --> 00:00:02,991
<i>The Library!
So big it doesn't need a name.</i>

2
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:05,380
Someone's got in.
Someone's in my library.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,195
4,022 saved.

4
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:08,415
No survivors.

5
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:11,041
- Others are coming.
- What... others?

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,437
Professor River Song, archaeologist.

7
00:00:19,537 --> 00:00:21,068
You've seen me before, then?

8
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:25,543
The real world is a lie,
and your nightmares are real.

9
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:28,862
- What's CAL?!
- The Library is real.

10
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:33,087
There are people trapped in there,
people who need to be saved.

11
00:00:33,456 --> 00:00:35,427
There's a neural relay
in the communicator.

12
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:37,290
<i>Sometimes it can hold an impression</i>

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,968
<i>of a living consciousness
for a short time after death.</i>

14
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:43,462
The shadows are moving again.
Only you can save them.

15
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:46,120
The piranhas of the air,
the Vashta Nerada.

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,850
Donna Noble has been saved.

17
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:53,231
Donna Noble has been saved.

18
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:56,370
<i>- Who turned out the lights?
- Donna Noble has left the Library.</i>

19
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:59,099
<i>Donna Noble has been saved.
Who turned out the lights?</i>

20
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,050
Donna Noble has left the Library.
Donna Noble has been saved.

00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:50,217
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

28
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:52,945
<i>Hey! Who turned out the lights?</i>

29
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,622
This way, quickly, move!

30
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:59,454
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

31
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,890
Dad, the Library,
it's on television now.

32
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,820
How many times, darling?

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,584
The Library is just
your imagination.

34
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:40,810
Donna?

35
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:55,770
Hello, Donna.

36
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:57,732
Who are you?

37
00:02:57,832 --> 00:02:59,162
I'm Dr Moon.

38
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,503
I've been treating you since
you came here two years ago.

39
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:07,410
Oh, God, Dr Moon, I'm so sorry!

40
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:09,333
What's wrong with me?

41
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:11,291
I didn't know you for a moment.

42
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:15,130
And then you remembered.
Shall we go for a walk?

43
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,891
No more dreams, then?

44
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:21,387
The Doctor and the blue box,
time and space.

45
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,365
How did we get here?

46
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:28,300
We came down the stairs,
out the front door.

47
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:30,873
We passed Mrs Ali on the way out.

48
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:34,758
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

49
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:38,062
- I forgot that.
- And then you remembered.

50
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:42,578
Shall we go down to the river?

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,984
You said "river" and suddenly
we're feeding ducks.

52
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:48,059
Dr Moon!

53
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:50,801
Morning.

54
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:53,955
Donna Noble, Lee McAvoy.

55
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:56,395
Hello, Lee.

56
00:03:56,589 --> 00:03:57,477
Hello...

57
00:03:59,390 --> 00:03:59,792
D...

58
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:03,330
Ooh, you've got bit
of a stammer there... Bless!

59
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:05,161
D... D...

60
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,214
Oh, skip to a vowel, they're easy!

61
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,890
How did we leave it, him and me?

62
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:14,970
I got the impression he was
inviting you fishing tomorrow.

63
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:18,970
So...

64
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:22,130
Fishing!

65
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:26,839
D... D...

66
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:31,081
Gorgeous and can't speak a word.

67
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,066
What am I going to do with you?

68
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,570
Welcome home, M-Mrs McAvoy.

69
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:46,610
Stop it!
Stop it now, we've got a visitor.

70
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,706
You've done so much
in seven years, Donna.

71
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:51,334
Sometimes it feels more like 70.

72
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:54,765
Mind you, sometimes
it feels like no time at all.

73
00:04:57,856 --> 00:05:01,330
Can I just say what a pleasure
it is to see you fully integrated?

74
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:07,607
<i>No, the signal's definitely
coming from the moon.</i>

75
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,965
<i>I'm blocking it,
but it's trying to break through.</i>

76
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:12,562
- Donna!
- Oops, sorry.

77
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,970
Mrs Angelo's rhubarb surprise.

78
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:16,455
Will I never learn?

79
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:19,646
The Doctor!

80
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:22,092
I saw the Doctor!

81
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:26,210
Yes, you did, Donna,
and then... you forgot.

82
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,933
Dr Moon! Oh, hello!

83
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:33,210
Shall I make you a cup of tea?

84
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,403
OK, we've got a clear spot.
In, in, in!

85
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:57,619
Right in the centre,
in the middle of the light, quickly!

86
00:05:57,719 --> 00:05:59,815
Don't let your shadows cross.
Doctor...

87
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:01,191
I'm doing it.

88
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:05,875
There's no lights here.
Sunset's coming, we can't stay long.

89
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,470
Have you found a live one?

90
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,575
Maybe, it's getting harder to tell.
What's wrong with you?

91
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:15,050
We're going to need a chicken leg.
Who's got a chicken leg?

92
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,810
Thanks, Dave.

93
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:24,927
OK... OK, we've got a hot one.
Watch your feet.

94
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:27,148
They won't attack
until there's enough of them,

95
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:29,610
but they've got our scent now,
they're coming.

96
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,811
Who is he?

97
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:36,408
You haven't even told us.
You just expect us to trust him.

98
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:39,860
- He is the Doctor.
- And who is the Doctor?

99
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,986
The only story you'll
ever tell, if you survive him.

100
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:48,448
You say he's your friend,
but he doesn't even know who you are.

101
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:50,344
Listen, all you need to know is this...

102
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,590
I'd trust that man
to the end of the universe,

103
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,117
and actually we've been.

104
00:06:57,964 --> 00:06:59,935
He doesn't act like he trusts you.

105
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:02,175
Yeah, there's a tiny problem.

106
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,183
He hasn't met me yet.

107
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:10,951
What's wrong with it?

108
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:13,815
There's a signal coming from somewhere,
interfering with it.

109
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:16,535
- Use the red settings.
- It doesn't have a red setting.

110
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:19,510
- Well, use the dampers.
- It doesn't have dampers.

111
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:21,180
It will do one day.

112
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:27,376
So, some time in the future,
I just give you my screwdriver.

113
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:29,353
- Yeah.
- And why would I do that?

114
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,535
I didn't pluck it
from your cold dead hands,

115
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:34,373
- if that's what you're worried about.
- I know that because...?

116
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:36,047
Listen to me.

117
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:38,694
You've lost your friend,
you're angry, I understand.

118
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:40,859
But you need to be
less emotional, Doctor.

119
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,589
Less em... I'm not emotional.

120
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:45,880
There are five people in this room
still alive, focus on that.

121
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,221
- Dear God, you're hard work young.
- Young? Who are you?!

122
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:51,762
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Look at the pair of you!

123
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,489
We're all going to die right here,

124
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:56,104
and you're just squabbling
like an old married couple.

125
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:00,960
Doctor...

126
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:05,898
one day I'm going to be someone
that you trust completely,

127
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,013
but I can't wait
for you to find that out.

128
00:08:10,052 --> 00:08:11,898
So I'm going to prove it to you.

129
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:13,725
And I'm sorry.

130
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:18,974
I'm really very sorry.

131
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:32,190
Are we good?

132
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:37,170
Doctor... are we good?

133
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,742
Yeah...

134
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:43,040
Yeah, we're good.

135
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,430
Good.

136
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,819
What's interesting about my screwdriver?

137
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,490
Very hard to interfere with,
nothing's strong enough...

138
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,667
Well, some hairdryers,
but I'm working on that.

139
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:06,031
There is a very strong signal
coming from somewhere,

140
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:08,928
and it wasn't there before,
so what's new, what's changed?

141
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,079
Come on! What's new?

142
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:13,644
- What's different?
- I dunno, nothing.

143
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:15,784
It's getting dark.

144
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,556
It's a screwdriver,
it works in the dark.

145
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:20,795
Moonrise.

146
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,338
Tell me about the moon. What's there?

147
00:09:26,438 --> 00:09:28,578
It's not real,
it was built as part of the Library.

148
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:29,623
Just a doctor moon.

149
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:31,780
- What's a doctor moon?
- A virus checker.

150
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,415
It supports and maintains the main
computer at the core of the planet.

151
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:38,121
Well, it's still active,
it's signalling, look.

152
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,990
Someone somewhere in this Library is
alive and communicating with the moon.

153
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,987
or possibly alive and drying their hair.

154
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:48,981
No, the signal's definitely
coming from the moon.

155
00:09:49,481 --> 00:09:51,240
I'm blocking it,
trying to break through.

156
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,084
Doctor!

157
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:53,512
Donna!

158
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:55,689
That was her, that was your friend.

159
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:57,603
Can you get her back? What was that?

160
00:09:58,035 --> 00:10:01,490
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
I'm trying to find the wavelength.

161
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,417
- I'm being blocked.
- Professor?

162
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:05,690
- Just a moment.
- It's important.

163
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,986
I have two shadows.

164
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,130
OK. Helmets on, everyone.

165
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:14,006
Anita, I'll get yours.

166
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,410
- It didn't do Proper Dave any good.
- Just keep it together, OK?

167
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,493
I'm keeping it together,

168
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:22,514
I'm only crying.

169
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:25,064
I'm about to die,
it's not an overreaction.

170
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:31,530
Hang on.

171
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:36,755
- Oh, God, they've got inside.
- No, no, no, I just tinted her visor.

172
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,790
Maybe they'll think they're already
in there, leave her alone.

173
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,586
You think they can
be fooled like that?

174
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:42,968
Maybe. I don't know.

175
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:45,074
It's a swarm, it's not like we chat.

176
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:47,542
- Can you still see in there?
- Just about.

177
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:49,468
Just... Just stay back.

178
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:51,614
Professor, a quick word, please.

179
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:52,965
- What?
- Down here.

180
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:53,778
What is it?

181
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:56,742
Like you said, there are five people
still alive in this room.

182
00:10:56,842 --> 00:10:57,706
Yeah, so?

183
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:58,458
So...

184
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:01,516
why are there six?

185
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:08,530
- Hey! Who turned out the lights?
- Run!

186
00:11:09,697 --> 00:11:11,292
<i>Hey! Who turned out the lights?</i>

187
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,232
<i>Hey! Who turned out the lights?
Hey! Who turned out the lights?</i>

188
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:21,832
<i>Here we are, Dr Moon.</i>

189
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,084
Mummy, I made you!

190
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:26,287
Ooh, that's nice, Ella.
Where's the face?

191
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:27,682
I don't know.

192
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:31,214
Did you see Dr Moon?
Did he leave?

193
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:32,669
Daddy!

194
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,715
Hello, you two, come here!
Big hugs, big Daddy hugs!

195
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:37,605
Look what I made!

196
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:40,470
- Oh, it's Mummy.
- It hasn't got a face.

197
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:42,069
Did you see Dr Moon?

198
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,672
- No, why, was he here?
- Yeah, just a second ago.

199
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:46,355
You must have passed him.

200
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,084
Are you all right?

201
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:52,817
Yeah.

202
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,223
Yeah, I'm fine, it's just...

203
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:56,674
Just...

204
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,422
Nothing.

205
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:04,945
It's been a long day, that's all.

206
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:07,290
I'm just tired.

207
00:12:10,432 --> 00:12:11,383
Are you OK?

208
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:15,279
I said I was tired and...

209
00:12:16,788 --> 00:12:18,194
..and we put the kids to bed,

210
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:20,407
and we watched television.

211
00:12:23,414 --> 00:12:24,675
Was that a letter?

212
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:27,079
- It's midnight.
- Go and see what it is.

213
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:46,318
- "The world is wrong."
- What?

214
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:48,165
For you. Weird, though.

215
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:51,197
"Dear Donna, the world is wrong.

216
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:54,825
"Meet me at your usual playpark,
two o'clock tomorrow."

217
00:13:06,538 --> 00:13:07,329
Nutter.

218
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:12,945
Don't go. Please don't go.

219
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:23,360
All right, you two,
off you go, no fighting.

220
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,354
I got your note last night.

221
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,035
The world is wrong,
what's that mean?

222
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:51,517
- No, you didn't.
- I'm sorry, what?

223
00:13:51,617 --> 00:13:53,599
You didn't get my note last night.

224
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,496
You got it a few seconds ago.

225
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,936
Having decided to come,
you suddenly found yourself arriving.

226
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:03,930
That is how time progresses here,
in the manner of a dream.

227
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:07,801
You've suspected that before,
haven't you, Donna Noble?

228
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:13,899
- How do you know me?
- We met before, in the Library.

229
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:16,101
<i>You were kind to me.</i>

230
00:14:16,637 --> 00:14:18,870
<i>I hope now to return that kindness.</i>

231
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:22,352
Your voice...

232
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:26,256
- I recognise it.
- Yes, you do.

233
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,282
I am what is left of Miss Evangelista.

234
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,477
Professor, go ahead, find a safe spot.

235
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:46,105
It's a carnivorous swarm in a suit,
you can't reason with it.

236
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:47,091
Five minutes.

237
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:50,579
Other Dave, stay with him, pull him
out when he's too stupid to live.

238
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,302
Two minutes, Doctor.

239
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,355
<i>Hey! Who turned out the lights?</i>

240
00:14:55,455 --> 00:14:57,260
You hear that? Those words?

241
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,827
That is the very last thought
of the man who wore that suit

242
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:02,895
before you climbed inside it
and stripped his flesh.

243
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:04,617
That's a man's soul

244
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:07,525
trapped inside a neural relay,
going round and round forever.

245
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,298
If you don't have the decency
to let him go, how about this?

246
00:15:10,398 --> 00:15:12,392
Use him. Talk to me.

247
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:15,659
It's easy, neural relay.
Just point and think.

248
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,779
- Use him, talk to me.
- Hey! Who turned out the lights?

249
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:23,252
The Vashta Nerada live on all the worlds
in this system, but you hunt in forests.

250
00:15:23,446 --> 00:15:25,693
- What you doing in a library?
- We should go. Doctor!

251
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:26,330
In a minute.

252
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,079
You came to a library to hunt, why?
Just tell me why?

253
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:36,942
We... did not.

254
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:38,982
Oh, hello.

255
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:41,728
We did not.

256
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,662
Take it easy, you'll get the hang of it.
Did not what?

257
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:48,979
We... did not... come... here.

258
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,235
Well, of course you did,
of course you came here.

259
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,725
We come from here.

260
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:55,515
From here?

261
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:57,660
We hatched here.

262
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,158
But you hatch from trees,
from spores in trees.

263
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:04,137
These are our forests.

264
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:06,506
You're nowhere near a forest,
look around you.

265
00:16:06,606 --> 00:16:09,934
These are our forests.

266
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:12,537
You're not in a forest,
you're in a library.

267
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,614
There are no trees in a...

268
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:16,721
library.

269
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:18,386
<i>We should go. Doctor!</i>

270
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:20,094
Books.

271
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,365
You came in the books.

272
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:28,390
Microspores in a million, million books.

273
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,854
<i>We should go. Doctor!</i>

274
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:31,549
Oh, look at that.

275
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:34,383
<i>The forests of the Vashta Nerada,</i>

276
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,330
<i>pulped and printed and bound.</i>

277
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,894
A million, million books,
hatching shadows.

278
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:43,494
<i>We should go. Doctor!</i>

279
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:46,886
Oh...

280
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:50,762
Dave! Oh, Dave, I'm so sorry.

281
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:55,279
- Hey! Who turned out the lights?
- We should go. Doctor!

282
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:58,490
I'm stupid, I talk too much,
this gob doesn't stop for anything.

283
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,743
Want to know the only
reason I'm still alive?

284
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:03,252
Always stay near the door.

285
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,815
<i>I suggested we meet here</i>

286
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:27,588
because a playground
is the easiest place to see it,

287
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:28,883
to see the lie.

288
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:32,255
- What lie?
- The children, look at the children.

289
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:35,266
Why do you wear that veil?

290
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:38,195
If I had a face like yours,
I wouldn't hide it.

291
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:40,119
You remember my face, then?

292
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:47,062
The memories are all still there,
the Library, the Doctor, me.

293
00:17:47,338 --> 00:17:49,483
You've just been
programmed not to look.

294
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,130
Sorry, but... you're dead.

295
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:57,449
In a way, we're all dead here, Donna.

296
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:59,795
We are the dead of the Library.

297
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,260
Well, what about the children?

298
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,050
The children aren't dead.
My children aren't dead.

299
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,170
Your children were never alive.

300
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,752
Don't you say that. Don't you dare
say that about my children!

301
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:12,472
Look at your children.

302
00:18:12,572 --> 00:18:15,650
Look at all of them, really look.
They're not real.

303
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:18,450
<i>Do you see it now?
They're all the same.</i>

304
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:23,655
<i>All the children of this world,
the same boy and the same girl,</i>

305
00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:25,320
<i>over and over again.</i>

306
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:26,427
Stop it.

307
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:30,494
Just stop it! Why are you doing this?
Why are you wearing that veil?

308
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:58,094
You know... it's funny,
I keep wishing the Doctor was here.

309
00:18:58,194 --> 00:19:00,248
<i>The Doctor is here, isn't he?</i>

310
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,644
He's coming back, right?

311
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:08,321
You know when you see a photograph
of someone you know,

312
00:19:08,421 --> 00:19:10,850
but it's from years
before you knew them?

313
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:15,755
It's like they're not quite...
finished, they're not done yet.

314
00:19:16,763 --> 00:19:20,642
Well... yes, the Doctor's here.

315
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,974
He came when I called,
just like he always does.

316
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:28,629
But not MY Doctor.

317
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,640
Now my Doctor...

318
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,599
I've seen whole armies
turn and run away.

319
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:44,523
And he'd just swagger off
back to his TARDIS

320
00:19:45,155 --> 00:19:47,994
and open the doors with
a snap of his fingers.

321
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:53,280
The Doctor... in the TARDIS...

322
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:58,090
- Next stop, everywhere.
- Spoilers!

323
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:03,444
Nobody can open a TARDIS
by snapping their fingers.

324
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:06,729
- It doesn't work like that.
- It does for the Doctor.

325
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:08,718
I am the Doctor.

326
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:10,610
Yeah. Some day.

327
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,576
- How are you doing?
- Where's Other Dave?

328
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:17,253
Not coming, sorry.

329
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:20,700
Well, if they've taken him,

330
00:20:21,063 --> 00:20:23,326
- why haven't they gotten me yet?
- I don't know.

331
00:20:24,377 --> 00:20:26,438
<i>Maybe tinting your
visor's making a difference.</i>

332
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:28,146
<i>It's making a difference all right.</i>

333
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,612
No-one's ever going
to see my face again.

334
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:34,949
- Can I get you anything?
- An old age would be nice.

335
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:37,308
Anything you can do?

336
00:20:37,408 --> 00:20:39,814
- I'm all over it.
- Doctor...

337
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:42,880
When we first met you...

338
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,233
you didn't trust Professor Song.

339
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:50,235
And then she whispered a word
in your ear, and you did.

340
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:52,793
My life so far...

341
00:20:53,782 --> 00:20:55,734
I could do with a word like that.

342
00:20:56,647 --> 00:20:58,199
What did she say?

343
00:21:01,947 --> 00:21:04,857
Give a dead girl a break.
Your secrets are safe with me.

344
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:06,497
Safe.

345
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:07,773
What?

346
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:12,482
Safe. You don't say saved,
nobody says saved,

347
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:14,888
you say safe.
The data fragment! What did it say?

348
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:18,580
- "4,022 people saved. No survivors."
- Doctor?

349
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:23,354
Nobody says saved,
nutters say saved, you say safe.

350
00:21:23,454 --> 00:21:28,570
But you see, it didn't mean safe,
it meant... it literally meant... saved!

351
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,261
What happened to your face?

352
00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:33,931
Transcription errors.

353
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:37,835
It destroyed my face,
did wonders for my intellect.

354
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:39,975
I'm a very poor copy of myself.

355
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:41,703
<i>Where are we?</i>

356
00:21:42,253 --> 00:21:44,174
Why are the children all the same?

357
00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:48,291
The same pattern over and over.
It saves an awful lot of space.

358
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:49,395
Space?

359
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:52,953
Cyberspace.

360
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:55,177
No! Don't tell, you mustn't tell!

361
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:57,503
<i>See, there it is, right there!</i>

362
00:21:57,603 --> 00:21:59,361
A hundred years ago,
massive power surge,

363
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:00,595
all teleports going at once.

364
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,169
Soon as Vashta Nerada hit
their hatching cycle, they attack.

365
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:05,732
Someone hits the alarm,
computer tries to teleport everyone.

366
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:07,702
It tried to teleport 4022 people?

367
00:22:07,802 --> 00:22:09,555
It succeeded, pulled 'em all out, but...

368
00:22:09,655 --> 00:22:11,745
nowhere to send them,
nowhere safe in the Library.

369
00:22:11,845 --> 00:22:13,384
Vashta Nerada growing in every shadow,

370
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:16,350
4022 people, all beamed up
and nowhere to go.

371
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,364
They're stuck in the system,
waiting to be sent, like emails.

372
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:22,508
So what's a computer to do?

373
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,460
What does a computer always do?

374
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,993
It saved them.

375
00:22:29,363 --> 00:22:31,553
The Library, a whole world of books,

376
00:22:31,653 --> 00:22:34,519
and right at the core,
the biggest hard drive in history.

377
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,159
Index to everything ever written,
backup of every single book.

378
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:42,090
The computer saved 4022 people
the only way a computer can.

379
00:22:42,454 --> 00:22:45,130
It saved them to the hard drive.

380
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,130
Your physical self is stored
in the library as an energy signature.

381
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,080
It can be actualised again
whenever you or the Library requires.

382
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,490
The Library?

383
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,703
If my face ends up on
one of those statues...

384
00:22:58,803 --> 00:23:00,411
You remember the statues?

385
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,940
Wait, no, just... hang on. So...

386
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,161
this isn't the real me?

387
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,490
This isn't my real body.

388
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,500
But I've been dieting!

389
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,148
What you see around you,

390
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:19,350
this entire world is nothing
more than virtual reality.

391
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,664
So why do you look like that?

392
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:26,381
I had no choice.

393
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,970
You teleported.
You're a perfect reproduction.

394
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,243
I was just a data ghost caught in
the Wi-Fi and automatically uploaded.

395
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:36,810
And it made you clever?

396
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,849
Were only strings of numbers in here.

397
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,208
I think a decimal point
may have shifted in my IQ.

398
00:23:42,365 --> 00:23:44,692
But my face has been
the bigger advantage.

399
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:48,846
I have the two qualities
you require to see absolute truth.

400
00:23:48,946 --> 00:23:52,130
I am brilliant... and unloved.

401
00:23:55,193 --> 00:23:56,770
If this is all a dream...

402
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:00,310
whose dream is it?

403
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,211
It's hard to see everything in
the data core, even for me, but...

404
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,070
there is a word.

405
00:24:05,964 --> 00:24:06,903
<i>just one word.</i>

406
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,738
CAL.

407
00:24:14,457 --> 00:24:15,915
<i>Mummy! My knee!</i>

408
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:19,125
Oh, look at that knee!

409
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:21,277
Oh, look at that silly old knee!

410
00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:24,298
She's not real. They're fictions.

411
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:28,550
I'm sorry, but now that you understand
that, you won't be able to keep a hold.

412
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,755
They are sustained only by your belief.

413
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:32,580
You don't know, you don't have children.

414
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,053
Neither do you.

415
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,339
Donna, for your own sake, let them go!

416
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,280
Stop it! You'll spoil everything!

417
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,310
I hate you, you're going
to ruin everything! Stop it!

418
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,886
Sweetie, what's wrong?

419
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,530
Shut up!

420
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:52,847
Daddy! No! Daddy!

421
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,794
What is it? What's wrong?

422
00:25:02,388 --> 00:25:06,348
<i>Autodestruct enabled in 20 minutes.</i>

423
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,415
Mummy, what did the lady mean?

424
00:25:10,515 --> 00:25:11,854
<i>Are we not real?</i>

425
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,690
- Where are we going?
- Home!

426
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:17,775
That was quick, wasn't it, Mummy?

427
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,730
Mummy, what's wrong with the sky?

428
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,060
What's maximum erasure?

429
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,140
20 minutes, this planet'll
crack like an egg.

430
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,660
No! No, it's all right,
the Doctor Moon will stop it.

431
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,340
It's programmed to protect CAL.

432
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,170
<i>Now, you really must
stop this, you know.</i>

433
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,616
You've forgotten again it was you who
saved all those people, haven't you?

434
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,180
And then you remembered.

435
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,570
Shut up, Dr Moon!

436
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,151
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

437
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:54,931
<i>All Library systems
are permanently offline,</i>

438
00:25:55,494 --> 00:25:58,090
<i>sorry for any inconvenience. Shortly.</i>

439
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,000
We need to stop this,
we've got to save CAL.

440
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,688
But what is it, what is CAL?

441
00:26:02,276 --> 00:26:05,220
We need to get to the main
computer. I'll show you.

442
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,010
- It's at the core of the planet.
- Well, then...

443
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,986
let's go.

444
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,247
Gravity platform!

445
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,166
- I bet I like you.
- Oh, you do!

446
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:34,780
Mummy, you're hurting my hand.

447
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,317
You just... You just
stay where I can see you.

448
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,421
You don't get out of my sight.

449
00:26:44,315 --> 00:26:45,735
Is it bedtime?

450
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,659
OK.

451
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:01,403
That was lovely, wasn't it?
That was a lovely bedtime.

452
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:03,124
We had warm milk,

453
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:07,466
and we watched cartoons, and then
Mummy read you a lovely bedtime story.

454
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,370
Mummy, Joshua and me,
we're not real, are we?

455
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:14,236
Of course you’re real.

456
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:18,491
You're as real as anything.
Why do you say that?

457
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:23,790
But, Mummy, sometimes, when you're
not here, it's like we're not here.

458
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,610
Even when you close
your eyes. We just stop.

459
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,970
Well, Mummy promises
to never close her eyes again.

460
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,949
No! Please!

461
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:52,180
NO PLEASE! No! No, no!

462
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,768
No, no !

463
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,850
No, no !

464
00:28:01,524 --> 00:28:04,990
<i>Autodestruct in 15 minutes.</i>

465
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:08,900
The Data Core! Over 4000
living minds, trapped inside it.

466
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,099
Yeah, well they won't be living much
longer, we're running out of time.

467
00:28:13,938 --> 00:28:16,750
Help me. Please help me.

468
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,170
Please, please help me!

469
00:28:24,768 --> 00:28:27,039
<i>Help me. Please, help me.</i>

470
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,560
What's that? Was that a child?

471
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,170
Computer's in sleep mode.

472
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:35,039
I can't wake it up. I'm trying.

473
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,970
Doctor, these readings!

474
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:49,370
I know, you'd think it was... dreaming.

475
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,650
It is dreaming... of a normal life,
and a lovely Dad,

476
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,690
and of every book ever written.

477
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:58,140
Computer's don't dream.

478
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,370
<i>Help me. Please help me.</i>

479
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:03,012
No. But little girls do.

480
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:17,050
Please help me. Please help me.

481
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,503
Oh, my God! It's the little girl.

482
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,975
<i>The girl we saw in the computer.</i>

483
00:29:24,688 --> 00:29:26,290
<i>She's not in the computer.</i>

484
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:29,737
<i>In a way, she is the computer.</i>

485
00:29:30,582 --> 00:29:31,859
<i>The main command node.</i>

486
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,890
This is CAL.

487
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:38,240
CAL is a child! A child
hooked up to a mainframe?

488
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,420
Why didn't you tell me
this! I needed to know this!

489
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,337
Because she's family!

490
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,359
CAL...

491
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,719
Charlotte Abigail Lux.

492
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:53,034
My grandfathers youngest daughter.

493
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,725
<i>She was dying,</i>

494
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,890
<i>so he built her a Library,
and put her living mind inside,</i>

495
00:30:01,697 --> 00:30:03,461
with a moon to watch over her,

496
00:30:04,156 --> 00:30:05,920
and all of human history
to pass the time,

497
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,323
<i>any era to live in, any book to read.</i>

498
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,880
<i>She loved books more than anything.</i>

499
00:30:13,475 --> 00:30:15,146
He gave her them all.

500
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,040
He asked only that she be left in peace.

501
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,232
A secret,

502
00:30:21,072 --> 00:30:22,130
not a freak show.

503
00:30:22,736 --> 00:30:26,370
So you weren't protecting a patent,
you were protecting her.

504
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:32,118
This is only half a life, of course.

505
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,260
But it's for ever.

506
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,836
And then the shadows came.

507
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:39,734
<i>Shadows. I have to...</i>

508
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,680
I have to save.

509
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:44,301
Have to save...

510
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:46,241
And she saved them.

511
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:49,930
<i>She saved everyone in the Library,</i>

512
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,797
folded them into her
dreams and kept them safe.

513
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:55,590
<i>Then why didn't she tell us?</i>

514
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,313
<i>Because she's forgotten.</i>

515
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,846
She's got 4000 living minds chatting
away inside her head, it must be like...

516
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,589
being... well, me.

517
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,960
So what do we do?

518
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,069
- Autodestruct in ten minutes.
- Easy!

519
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,110
We beam all people out of data core,
computer'll reset and stop countdown.

520
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,140
Charlotte doesn't have enough
memory space left to make the transfer.

521
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,620
Easy! I'll hook myself to the computer
and she can borrow my memory space!

522
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,080
It'll kill you stone dead.

523
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,010
- Yeah, it's easy to criticise.
- It'll burn out both your hearts.

524
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,290
I'll try my hardest not to die.
It's my main thing.

525
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,161
- Doctor!
- Shut up now!

526
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,869
You and Luxy-boy,
back to the main Library.

527
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:31,905
Prime data cells you can
find for max download,

528
00:31:32,005 --> 00:31:35,343
and before you say anything else,
Professor, can I just mention, shut up!

529
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,220
- I hate you sometimes!
- I know!

530
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,910
Mr Lux, with me! Anita,
if he dies, I'll kill him!

531
00:31:43,174 --> 00:31:44,740
What about the Vashta Nerada?

532
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,070
These are their forests.

533
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,820
I'll seal Charlotte inside her world,
take everybody else away.

534
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,090
The shadows can swarm
to their hearts content.

535
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,048
<i>So you think they're
just gonna let us go?</i>

536
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:55,820
- Best offer they're gonna get.
- You're gonna make em an offer?

537
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,072
They'd better take it,

538
00:31:57,172 --> 00:32:00,730
cos right now, I'm finding it very hard
to make any kind of offer at all.

539
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:03,203
I really liked Anita.

540
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,120
She was brave, even when she was crying,
and she never gave in. And you ate her.

541
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,089
But I'm gonna let that pass.

542
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,572
Just as long as you let them pass.

543
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:16,238
How long have you known?

544
00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:17,815
I counted the shadows.

545
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:21,075
You only have one now.

546
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,043
She's nearly gone. Be kind.

547
00:32:26,218 --> 00:32:29,230
These are our forests. We are not kind.

548
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,474
I'm giving you back your forests,
but you are giving me them.

549
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,030
You are letting them go.

550
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,484
These are our forests.
They are our meat.

551
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:43,936
Don't play games with me.

552
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,960
You just killed someone I like,
that is not a safe place to stand.

553
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,763
I'm the Doctor, and you're in the
biggest Library in the universe.

554
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,261
Look me up.

555
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:10,050
You have one day.

556
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:15,850
Anita!

557
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,727
I'm sorry. She's been dead
a while now. I told you to go.

558
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,890
Lux can manage without me.

559
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,251
But you can't.

560
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:31,810
<i>Autodestruct in two minutes.</i>

561
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:38,700
Oh, no, no, no, no, come on,
what are you doing? That's my job.

562
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,920
Oh, and I'm not allowed to have
a career, I suppose?

563
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,620
Why am I handcuffed?
Why do you even have handcuffs?

564
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,730
Spoilers!

565
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,222
Stop this now, this is gonna kill you!

566
00:33:47,322 --> 00:33:48,698
I'd have a chance, you don't have.

567
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:50,819
You wouldn't have a chance,
and neither do I.

568
00:33:52,355 --> 00:33:54,176
I'm timing it for the end
of the countdown,

569
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:55,761
there'll be a blip in command flow.

570
00:33:55,861 --> 00:33:58,126
It should improve our chances
of a clean download.

571
00:33:58,226 --> 00:33:59,352
River! Please! No!

572
00:33:59,452 --> 00:34:02,962
Funny thing is, this means you've
always known how I was going to die.

573
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:06,459
All the time we've been together,
you knew I was coming here.

574
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,570
The last time I saw you,
the real you, the future you, I mean,

575
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:16,009
you turned up on my doorstep,
with a new haircut and a suit.

576
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:21,009
<i>You took me to Darillium
to see the singing towers.</i>

577
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,008
What a night that was!

578
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,947
The towers sang and you cried.

579
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,540
<i>- Autodestruct in one minute.
- You wouldn't tell me why,</i>

580
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,786
<i>but I suppose you knew
it was time. My time.</i>

581
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:37,130
<i>Time to come to the Library.</i>

582
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,085
You even gave me your screwdriver,
that should've been a clue.

583
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,610
<i>There's nothing you can do.</i>

584
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,420
You can let me do this!

585
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,990
If you die here,
it'll mean I've never met you.

586
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,220
Time can be rewritten.

587
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,570
Not those times.
Not one line! Don't you dare!

588
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,170
It's OK. It's OK, it's not over for you.
You'll see me again.

589
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,707
You've got all of that to come.

590
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,255
You and me, time and space.

591
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,372
You watch us run!

592
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:11,813
River, you know my name!

593
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:13,130
<i>Autodestruct in...</i>

594
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,318
You whispered my name in my ear.

595
00:35:15,418 --> 00:35:18,530
<i>Nine, eight, seven...</i>

596
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,372
There's only one reason I would
ever tell anyone my name.

597
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:23,643
There's only one time I could...

598
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:24,970
Shh, now!

599
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,816
<i>Three.</i>

600
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,011
Spoilers!

601
00:35:28,111 --> 00:35:30,569
<i>Two, one...</i>

602
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,724
Donna? What's happening?

603
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,030
I don't know, but it's not real.
Nothing here's real.

604
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,372
The whole world,
everything, none of it's real.

605
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,143
Am I real?

606
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,016
Course you're real, I know you're real.

607
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,931
Oh, God, oh, God, I hope you're real.

608
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:09,162
I'll find you!
I promise you, I'll find you!

609
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,973
<i>Excuse me.</i>

610
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,018
What happened? How did we get here?

611
00:36:24,363 --> 00:36:25,608
Look at you.

612
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:27,610
You're back.

613
00:36:28,161 --> 00:36:30,683
You're all back. He did it!

614
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,720
You're all back. Look at you!

615
00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:48,319
Look at that!

616
00:36:50,146 --> 00:36:52,079
Look at that. He did it.

617
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,978
<i>4,022 people! Saved!</i>

618
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,030
<i>Please be patient.</i>

619
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,420
<i>Only three can teleport at a time.</i>

620
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,080
<i>Do not state your intended
destination until you arrive in...</i>

621
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,273
Any luck?

622
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,327
There wasn't even anyone called
Lee in the Library that day.

623
00:37:34,497 --> 00:37:37,012
Suppose he could have had
a different name out here, but...

624
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,903
let's be honest,

625
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:41,363
he wasn't real, was he?

626
00:37:42,306 --> 00:37:43,314
Maybe not.

627
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,661
I made up the perfect man.

628
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:51,940
Gorgeous, adores me,
and hardly able to speak a word.

629
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,053
- What does that say about me?
- Everything.

630
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,990
Sorry, did I say everything?
I meant to say nothing.

631
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,015
I was aiming for nothing,
I accidentally said everything.

632
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,855
<i>Stand right in the middle
of the teleport, please...</i>

633
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:05,945
What about you?

634
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:08,416
Are you all right?

635
00:38:08,963 --> 00:38:10,330
I'm always all right.

636
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,695
Is all right special
Time Lord code for...

637
00:38:16,415 --> 00:38:17,890
really not all right at all?

638
00:38:18,554 --> 00:38:19,211
Why?

639
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,315
Cos I'm all right, too.

640
00:38:28,303 --> 00:38:29,029
Come on.

641
00:38:55,218 --> 00:38:56,307
Your friend.

642
00:38:57,283 --> 00:38:58,810
Professor Song...

643
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,614
She knew you in the future,
but she didn't know me.

644
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,991
What happens to me?

645
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:07,457
When she heard my name,
when she looked at me...

646
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:08,370
Donna...

647
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,923
This is her diary.

648
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,085
My future.

649
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,352
I could look you up.

650
00:39:22,492 --> 00:39:23,630
What do you think?

651
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:27,741
Shall we peek at the end?

652
00:39:35,014 --> 00:39:36,810
Spoilers, right?

653
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:39,210
Right.

654
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:56,538
Come on. The next chapter's this way.

655
00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:02,654
<i>When you run with The Doctor,
it feels like it will never end.</i>

656
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:07,181
<i>But however hard you try,
you can't run for ever.</i>

657
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:13,717
<i>Everybody knows that everybody dies,
and nobody knows it like The Doctor.</i>

658
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:20,060
<i>But I do think that all the skies
of all the worlds might just turn dark,</i>

659
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,250
<i>if he ever, for one moment accepts it.</i>

660
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,504
Why? Why would I give
her my screwdriver?

661
00:40:26,604 --> 00:40:27,943
Why would I do that?

662
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:31,660
Thing is, future me had years to think
about it, to think of a way to save her,

663
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,878
and what he did was give her
a screwdriver! Why would I do that?

664
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:42,510
Look at that! I'm very good!

665
00:40:42,755 --> 00:40:44,010
<i>What have you done?</i>

666
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:45,872
Saved her.

667
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,750
Stay with me! You can
do it, stay with me!

668
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,397
Come on, you and me, one last run!

669
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,450
Sorry, River, shortcut!

670
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,295
<i>Platform disabled.</i>

671
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,134
<i>Everybody knows that everybody dies.</i>

672
00:41:22,657 --> 00:41:24,462
<i>But not every day.</i>

673
00:41:27,212 --> 00:41:28,626
<i>Not today.</i>

674
00:41:52,753 --> 00:41:55,019
It's OK. You're safe.

675
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,440
You'll always be safe here.

676
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,480
The Doctor fixed the data core.

677
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,120
This is a good place now.

678
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:04,810
But I was worried you might be lonely.
So I brought you some friends.

679
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,890
Aren't I a clever girl?

680
00:42:07,497 --> 00:42:08,736
Aren't we all?

681
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:14,690
<i>Oh, for heaven's sake!</i>

682
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:16,939
He just can't do it, can he?

683
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,900
That man, that impossible man!

684
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,210
He just can't give in.

685
00:42:42,564 --> 00:42:44,203
<i>Some days are special.</i>

686
00:42:44,948 --> 00:42:47,907
<i>Some days are so, so blessed.</i>

687
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,848
<i>Some days, nobody dies at all.</i>

688
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:20,038
<i>Now and then,</i>

689

<i>every once in a very long while,

<i>sserwhen the wind stands fair,

You be careful.

00:44:16,098 --> 00:44:17,149
<i>Taking a big space truck</i>

695

<i>with bunch of strangers across
diamond planet called Midnight?</i>

696
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:21,042
What could possibly go wrong?

697
00:44:21,142 --> 00:44:22,930
- Enjoy your trip.
- Oh, I can't wait.

698
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,490

If were gonna get out of
this, then you need me!

703

- Two people are dead.
- Don't make it a third!

705
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,870

Get out of there!
