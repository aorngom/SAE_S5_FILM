00:00:00,736 --> 00:00:03,136
<i>Close your eyes
and tell me what you see.</i>

2
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,099
The Library.

3
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:19,225
<i>Open your eyes again.</i>

4
00:00:21,651 --> 00:00:22,809
<i>Where are you now?</i>

5
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,603
My living room, Dr Moon.

6
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:27,012
<i>When you close your eyes...</i>

7
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:28,870
I go to the Library.

8
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:32,486
Go to the Library now.

9
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,831
<i>- Are you back there?
- Yes.</i>

10
00:00:37,882 --> 00:00:38,996
<i>The same part?</i>

11
00:00:39,843 --> 00:00:41,543
<i>No, it's always different.</i>

12
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:43,840
<i>The Library goes on for ever.</i>

13
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:46,612
<i>How you do move around?</i>

14
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:49,039
By wishing.

15
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:54,850
- What's wrong?
- Something's here!

16
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,290
Someone's got in!
No-one's supposed to get in!

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,652
She's never mentioned anyone.
She's always been alone.

18
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:01,066
<i>Someone's in my library.</i>

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,235
No! No, please! That's not allowed!

20
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:07,517
Listen to me.

21
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:10,570
The Library is in your mind.

22
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,250
I know it's in my mind.
But something's got inside!

23
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:26,766
Oh! Hello!

24
00:01:27,436 --> 00:01:29,100
Sorry to burst in on you like this.

25
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:30,839
OK if we stop here for a bit?

00:01:56,162 --> 00:01:59,250

30
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:14,100
Books! People never
really stop loving books.

31
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,565
51st century.

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,517
By now you've got holovids,
direct to brain downloads, fiction mist,

33
00:02:21,617 --> 00:02:25,133
but you need the smell.
The smell of books, Donna. Deep breath.

34
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:30,938
The Library.

35
00:02:33,465 --> 00:02:34,998
So big it doesn't need a name.

36
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:36,487
Just a great big "the."

37
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:38,063
It's like a city.

38
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:40,423
It's a world. Literally a world.

39
00:02:40,523 --> 00:02:42,486
The core of the planet
is the index computer,

40
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:43,883
biggest hard drive ever.

41
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:46,384
And up here,
every book ever written.

42
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:47,766
Whole continents of

43
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:52,252
Jeffrey Archer, Bridget Jones,
Monty Python's Big Red Book.

44
00:02:53,178 --> 00:02:54,890
Brand new editions,
specially printed.

45
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,210
<i>We're near the equator, so...</i>

46
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:03,284
this must be Biographies!

47
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,263
I love biographies.

48
00:03:05,363 --> 00:03:07,463
Yeah, very you.
Always a death at the end.

49
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,508
You need a good death.
Without death, there'd only be comedies.

50
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,183
Dying gives us size. Oi!

51
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,503
- Spoilers!
- What?

52
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:17,182
These books are from your future.

53
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:19,343
Don't read ahead,
spoil all the surprises.

54
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:20,450
Like peeking at the end.

55
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,222
Isn't travelling with you
one big spoiler?

56
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:27,611
I try to keep you away
from major plot developments.

57
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,896
Which, to be honest,
I seem to be very bad at,

58
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:32,666
cos... you know what?

59
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,723
This is the biggest
library in the universe.

60
00:03:36,338 --> 00:03:37,645
So where is everyone?

61
00:03:42,582 --> 00:03:43,570
It's silent.

62
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:45,530
The Library?

63
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:50,202
The planet.

64
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:54,050
<i>The whole planet.</i>

65
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:57,572
Maybe it's a Sunday.

66
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,731
No, I never land on Sundays.

67
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,983
Sundays are boring. Well...

68
00:04:03,153 --> 00:04:06,538
Maybe everyone's really,
really quiet.

69
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:08,374
Yeah, maybe.

70
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:11,033
But they'd still show up
on the system.

71
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:14,223
Doctor, why are we here?
Really, why?

72
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:16,583
Oh, you know, just passing.

73
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:18,463
No, seriously.

74
00:04:18,563 --> 00:04:21,995
It was all, "Let's hit the beach,"
then suddenly we're in a library.

75
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,943
- Why?
- Now, that's interesting.

76
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:26,105
- What?
- Scanning for life forms.

77
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:29,065
<i>If I do a scan looking for
your basic humanoids, you know,</i>

78
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:32,325
<i>your book readers, few limbs and
a face, apart from us, I get nothing.</i>

79
00:04:33,032 --> 00:04:34,823
Zippo, nada, see?

80
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:40,016
Nobody home. But if I widen
the parameters to any kind of life...

81
00:04:44,946 --> 00:04:46,463
<i>A million million.</i>

82
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:48,123
Gives up after that.

83
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:52,130
A million million.

84
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,790
<i>But there's nothing here.</i>

85
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:56,204
<i>There's no-one.</i>

86
00:04:57,668 --> 00:04:59,138
<i>And not a sound.</i>

87
00:05:01,153 --> 00:05:03,493
A million million life forms,

88
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:06,363
and silence in the Library.

89
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:09,912
But there's no-one here.

90
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:13,623
There's just books.
I mean, it's not the books, is it?

91
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,543
I mean, it can't be
the books, can it?

92
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:18,123
I mean, books can't be alive?

93
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:30,643
<i>Welcome!</i>

94
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,330
- That came from in there.
- Yeah!

95
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:53,630
I am Courtesy Node 710/aqua.

96
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:57,455
Please enjoy the Library and
respect the personal access codes

97
00:05:57,555 --> 00:06:02,329
of all your fellow readers
regardless of species or hygiene taboo.

98
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,425
That face, it looks real.

99
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:06,113
Yeah, don't worry about it.

100
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:08,730
But a statue with a real face, though!

101
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:12,232
- It's a hologram, isn't it?
- No, but really, it's fine.

102
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:15,923
Additional, There follows a brief
message from the head librarian

103
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:17,534
for your urgent attention.

104
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:20,049
It has been edited for tone and content

105
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:23,778
by a Felman Lux Automated
Decency Filter.

106
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:25,687
Message follows.

107
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:26,602
"Run.

108
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,210
"For God's sake, run.

109
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:31,119
<i>"Nowhere is safe.</i>

110
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:35,911
"The Library has sealed itself,
we can't... Oh, they're here.

111
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:40,343
"Arg. Slarg. Snick."
Message ends.

112
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:45,503
<i>Please switch off your mobile comm
units for the comfort of other readers.</i>

113
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:47,661
So that's why we're here.

114
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:50,577
Any other messages, same date stamp?

115
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,422
<i>One additional message.</i>

116
00:06:52,883 --> 00:06:56,652
This message carries a Felman
Lux coherency warning of...

117
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:59,073
- Yeah, yeah, fine, just play it.
-  5, 0, 11...

123
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,730
Donna...

124
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:17,476
Yeah?

125
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:20,923
Stay out of the shadows.

126
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,495
Why, what's in the shadows?

127
00:07:43,092 --> 00:07:43,768
So...

128
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:46,620
We weren't just
in the neighbourhood.

129
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:49,385
Yeah, I kind of, sort of lied a bit.

130
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,050
I got a message
on the psychic paper.

131
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:56,253
What do you think, cry for help?

132
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:00,170
Cry for help, with a kiss?

133
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,559
Oh, we've all done that.

134
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,023
- Who's it from?
- No idea.

135
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:07,474
- So why did we come here, why did you?
- Donna.

136
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:12,909
- What's happening?
- Run!

137
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,883
- What, is it locked?
- Jammed! The wood's warped!

138
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,474
Sonic it, use the thingy!

139
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:25,026
- I can't, it's wood!
- What, it doesn't do wood?!

140
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:27,472
If I can vibrate the molecules,
fry the bindings,

141
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:30,300
- I can shatterline the interface.
- Oh, get out of the way!

142
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,583
Oh! Hello!

143
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:45,323
Sorry to burst in on you like this.
OK if we stop here for a bit?

144
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:49,238
What is it?

145
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:52,850
Security camera.

146
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:56,723
Switched itself off.

147
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,279
They were in my library.
How can they be in my library?

148
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:04,463
Who were they?

149
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:07,488
What's that? What's that noise?

150
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,533
What noise?

151
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,994
Nice door skills, Donna.

152
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:17,017
Well, you know, boyfriends, sometimes
you need the element of surprise.

153
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:18,481
<i>What was that ?</i>

154
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:20,452
What was after us?

155
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:22,973
I mean, did we just run away
from a power cut?

156
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,134
Possibly.

157
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:28,075
Are we safe here?

158
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,110
Course we're safe.
There's a little shop.

159
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,990
Gotcha!

160
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:41,288
No, stop it!

161
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,050
No, no!

162
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:48,098
Ooh, I'm sorry.

163
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:52,290
I really am, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry. It's alive.

164
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:54,686
You said it was a security camera.

165
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:56,356
It is.

166
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,834
It's an alive one.

167
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:00,254
Can you hear me?

168
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,610
Are you all right?

169
00:10:05,883 --> 00:10:08,130
- Others are coming.
- Who's coming?

170
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,574
Who are the others?

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,543
The Library is breached.

172
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:14,170
- Others are coming.
- What others?

173
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:15,474
<i>Others?</i>

174
00:10:16,393 --> 00:10:17,821
<i>What does it mean, "others"?</i>

175
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:23,903
Excuse me,
what does it mean, "others"?

176
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:27,223
That's barely more than a speak
your weight machine, it can't help you.

177
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:28,631
So why's it got a face?

178
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,953
This flesh aspect was donated
by Mark Chambers

179
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:34,061
on the occasion of his death.

180
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:36,623
It's a real face?

181
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:39,279
It has been actualised
individually for you

182
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:43,410
<i>from the many facial aspects
saved to our extensive flesh banks.</i>

183
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:45,730
Please enjoy.

184
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:48,393
It chose me a dead face
it thought I'd like?

185
00:10:48,874 --> 00:10:50,964
That statue's got a real
dead person's face on it!

186
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:52,143
<i>It's the 51st century.</i>

187
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:55,023
That's basically
like donating a park bench.

188
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,740
It's donating a face!

189
00:10:57,384 --> 00:10:58,723
No, wait, no!

190
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,482
- Oi! Hands!
- The shadow, look.

191
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:04,447
What about it?

192
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,393
Count the shadows.

193
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:11,143
One. There,
I counted it, one shadow.

194
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:12,050
Yeah...

195
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:15,443
But what's casting it?

196
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,418
Oh! I'm thick!
Look at me, I'm old and thick!

197
00:11:28,518 --> 00:11:30,624
Head's too full of stuff,
I need a bigger head!

198
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:36,823
<i>Power must be going.</i>

199
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:39,750
This place runs on fission cells.
They'll outburn the sun.

200
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,972
- Then why's it dark?
- It's not dark.

201
00:11:47,202 --> 00:11:48,329
That shadow.

202
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:50,087
It's gone.

203
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:52,521
We need to get back to the TARDIS.

204
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:53,290
Why?

205
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,023
Because that shadow hasn't gone.
It's moved.

206
00:11:56,976 --> 00:11:57,713
Reminder,

207
00:11:57,813 --> 00:12:00,263
the Library has been breached,
others are coming.

208
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:01,367
Reminder,

209
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:04,343
<i>the Library has been breached,
others are coming.</i>

210
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:05,875
<i>Reminder,</i>

211
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,366
<i>the Library has been breached...</i>

212
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,130
Hello, sweetie.

213
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,198
- Get out.
- Doctor?

214
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:34,930
All of you, turn around,
get back in your rocket and fly away.

215
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,995
Tell your grandchildren
you came here and lived,

216
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:38,178
they won't believe you.

217
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:40,837
Pop your helmets, everyone.
We've got breathers.

218
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,602
How do you know they're not androids?

219
00:12:43,702 --> 00:12:45,086
Cos I've dated androids.

220
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:47,345
- They're rubbish.
- Who is this?

221
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:50,383
You said we were the only expedition,
I paid for exclusives.

222
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:51,749
I lied, I'm always lying.

223
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:52,925
Bound to be others.

224
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:55,447
Miss Evangelista,
I want to see the contracts.

225
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:57,956
You came through the north door?
Much damage?

226
00:12:58,056 --> 00:13:01,172
Please, just leave. I'm asking you
seriously and properly, just lea...

227
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:02,703
Did you say expedition?

228
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:05,308
My expedition, I funded it.

229
00:13:05,558 --> 00:13:08,983
Oh, you're not, are you?
Tell me you're not archaeologists.

230
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:11,004
Got a problem with archaeologists?

231
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:13,907
I'm a time traveller.
I point and laugh at archaeologists.

232
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:17,623
Professor River Song, archaeologist.

233
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:18,843
River Song? Lovely name.

234
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:21,608
As you're leaving, you need
to set up a quarantine beacon.

235
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,591
Code-wall the planet,

236
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:26,346
the whole planet. Nobody comes here,
not ever again. No-one living thing.

237
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:29,181
Not here, not ever. Stop right there!
What's your name?

238
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:29,943
Anita.

239
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,543
Anita, stay out of the shadows.

240
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:35,023
Not a foot, not a finger in the shadows
till you're safely back in your ship.

241
00:13:35,123 --> 00:13:39,223
Stay in the light.
Find a nice, bright spot and just stand.

242
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:42,250
If you understand me,
look very, very scared.

243
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:50,250
No, bit more scared than that.

244
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:55,178
OK, do for now.
You, who are you?

245
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:56,323
- Dave.
- OK, Dave...

246
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:59,508
Oh, well Other Dave,
because that's Proper Dave

247
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:02,311
the pilot, he was the first Dave,
so when we...

248
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:05,158
Other Dave, the way you came,
does it look the same as before?

249
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:07,048
Yeah. Oh, it's a bit darker.

250
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:07,974
How much darker?

251
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:10,947
Oh, I could see where we came through
just a moment ago. I can't now.

252
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:12,812
Seal the door. Find another way out.

253
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:16,340
We're not looking for a way out.
Miss Evangelista?

254
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,881
I'm Mr Lux's personal... everything.

255
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:22,871
You need to sign these contracts
agreeing that your experiences

256
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:24,398
inside the Library are...

257
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:27,837
the intellectual property of
the Felman Lux Corporation.

258
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:30,424
- Right, give it here.
- Yeah, lovely. Thanks.

259
00:14:33,684 --> 00:14:36,165
My family built this library.
I have rights.

260
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:39,583
You have a mouth that won't stop.
You think there's danger here?

261
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:42,159
Something came to this library
and killed everything in it,

262
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:43,663
killed a whole world.

263
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:45,863
- Danger? Could be.
- That was 100 years ago.

264
00:14:45,963 --> 00:14:49,533
The Library's been silent for 100 years.
Whatever came here is long dead.

265
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,803
Bet your life?

266
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:52,850
Always.

267
00:14:54,132 --> 00:14:55,399
<i>What do you doing?</i>

268
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:57,676
<i>He said seal the door.</i>

269
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:59,410
Torch! You're taking orders from him?

270
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,669
Spooky, isn't it?

271
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:11,850
Almost every species in the universe

272
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:14,343
<i>has an irrational fear of the dark.</i>

273
00:15:14,443 --> 00:15:17,466
<i>But they're wrong.
Cos it's not irrational.</i>

274
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:21,644
It's Vashta Nerada.

275
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:24,023
<i>What's Vashta Nerada?</i>

276
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:25,898
It's what's in the dark.

277
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:28,951
It's what's always in the dark.

278
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:33,558
- Lights! You got lights?
- What for?

279
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:37,337
Form a circle, safe area,
big as you can, lights pointing out.

280
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,040
- Do as he says.
- You're not listening to this man?!

281
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,261
Apparently, I am. Unpack the lights.

282
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:44,943
Other Dave, make sure the door's secure,
then help Anita.

283
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:47,616
Mr Lux, put your helmet
back on, block the visor.

284
00:15:47,936 --> 00:15:50,610
Proper Dave, I want you
to access the library database,

285
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,248
see what you can find about what
happened a hundred years ago.

286
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:55,623
Pretty Boy, you're with me.

287
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:57,423
Step into my office.

288
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,599
Professor Song,
why am I the only one wearing my helmet?

289
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,576
I don't fancy you.

290
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:05,554
Probably, I can help you.

291
00:16:06,286 --> 00:16:08,163
Pretty Boy, with me, I said.

292
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,929
- Oh, I'm Pretty Boy?
- Yes.

293
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:15,730
Ooh, that came out a bit quick!

294
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:17,295
Pretty?!

295
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,104
Don't let your shadows cross!
Seriously. Don't even let them touch.

296
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:26,352
- Any of them could be infected.
- How can a shadow be infected?

297
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:27,841
'Scuse me, can I help?

298
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:30,340
- No, we're fine.
- I could just...

299
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,650
you know, hold things.

300
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,290
No, really, we're OK.

301
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:34,632
éOK.

302
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:42,711
Couldn't she help?

303
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:45,836
Trust me, I just spent 4 days on
a ship with that woman. She's...

304
00:16:45,936 --> 00:16:48,755
Couldn't tell the difference between
the escape pod and the bathroom.

305
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:50,303
<i>We had to go back for her.</i>

306
00:16:51,372 --> 00:16:52,079
Twice.

307
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:06,487
- Thanks.
- For what?

308
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:08,176
The usual. For coming when I call.

309
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,828
That was you?

310
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,980
You're doing a good job,
like you don't know me.

311
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,529
I'm assuming there's a reason.

312
00:17:13,688 --> 00:17:16,976
- A fairly good one, actually.
- OK, shall we do diaries, then?

313
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:18,515
Where are we this time?

314
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,313
Going by your face,
I'd say it's early days for you, yeah?

315
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:23,570
So, erm...

316
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:26,476
Crash of the Byzantium...
have we done that yet?

317
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:31,443
Obviously ringing no bells.

318
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:36,348
Right, Picnic at Asgard.

319
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:38,580
Have we done Asgard yet?

320
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:42,503
Obviously not.

321
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:45,050
Blimey, very early days, then. Hoo!

322
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,732
Life with a time traveller
never knew it could be such hard work.

323
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:55,162
Look at you!

324
00:17:57,802 --> 00:18:00,410
- You're young.
- I'm really not, you know.

325
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:02,250
No, but you are.

326
00:18:03,927 --> 00:18:04,816
Your eyes.

327
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:08,714
<i>You're younger
than I've ever seen you.</i>

328
00:18:10,854 --> 00:18:12,725
You've seen me before, then?

329
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:16,873
Doctor...

330
00:18:18,456 --> 00:18:20,408
Please tell me you know who I am?

331
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:23,486
Who are you?

332
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:36,148
Sorry, that was me. Trying to get
through into the security protocols,

333
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,613
I seem to have set something off.

334
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:41,090
- What is that, is that an alarm?
- Doctor.

335
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:43,395
- Doctor, that sounds like...
- It is.

336
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:44,696
It's a phone!

337
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:03,279
Dad!

338
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:04,549
<i>In a minute.</i>

339
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:15,020
I'm trying to call up the data core,
it's not responding. Just that noise.

340
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,454
- But it's a phone!
- Let me try something.

341
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:24,868
Dad! The phone,
aren't you going to answer it?

342
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:27,214
It's not ringing, sweetie.

343
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:42,749
OK, doesn't like that,
let's try something else.

344
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,010
'OK, here it comes.'

345
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:00,669
Hello?

346
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:03,551
Hello. Are you in my television?

347
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:07,205
Well, no, I'm...

348
00:20:07,862 --> 00:20:10,427
I'm sort of in space.
I was trying to call up

349
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:12,972
the data core of a triple-grid
security processor.

350
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:15,440
Would you like to speak to my dad?

351
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,656
Your dad or your mum,
that would be lovely.

352
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:23,930
I know you! You were in my library.

353
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:24,987
YOUR library?

354
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:27,783
The Library's never been
on the television before.

355
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:29,216
What have you done?

356
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:34,252
Ah, I... just rerouted the interface...

357
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,388
What happened. Who was that?

358
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:52,574
Keep working on those lights,
we need those lights!

359
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:54,582
You heard him, people,
let there be light.

360
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:14,040
Sorry. Youre not allowed to see
inside the book, its against the rules.

361
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:15,517
What rules?

362
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,359
Your rules.

363
00:21:45,697 --> 00:21:46,786
What's that?

364
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:51,513
- I didnt do that, did you do that?
- Not me.

365
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,490
What's CAL?

366
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:17,399
You all right?

367
00:22:17,724 --> 00:22:20,051
What's that? What's happening?

368
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:21,290
<i>I don't know.</i>

369
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:25,876
Oh, thanks for... you know...
offering to help with the lights.

370
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:28,742
They don't want me.

371
00:22:29,136 --> 00:22:31,311
They think I'm stupid cos I'm pretty.

372
00:22:31,411 --> 00:22:34,255
Course they don't, nobody thinks that.

373
00:22:34,355 --> 00:22:35,684
No, they're right though.

374
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:37,450
I'm a moron, me.

375
00:22:37,867 --> 00:22:39,957
My dad said I have the IQ of plankton.

376
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:41,391
And I was pleased.

377
00:22:42,217 --> 00:22:43,969
See, thats funny.

378
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,317
No, I really was pleased.

379
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:51,901
- Is that funny?
- No, no.

380
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:56,770
What's causing that?

381
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,435
Is it the little girl?

382
00:22:58,535 --> 00:23:00,160
<i>But who is the little girl?</i>

383
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,968
What's she got to do with this place?

384
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:09,962
How does the data core work?
What's the principle? What's CAL?

385
00:23:10,062 --> 00:23:11,226
Ask Mr Lux.

386
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:13,340
CAL, what is it?

387
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:17,250
Sorry. You didn't sign your
Personal Experience contracts.

388
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:20,940
Mr Lux, right now,

389
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,025
you're in more danger than you've
ever been in your whole life.

390
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,770
And you're protecting a patent?

391
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,556
I'm protecting my family's pride.

392
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:33,530
Well, funny thing, Mr Lux. I don't
want to see everyone in this room dead

393
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:36,938
because some idiot thinks
his pride is more important.

394
00:23:39,165 --> 00:23:41,120
Then why don't you sign his contract?

395
00:23:44,545 --> 00:23:46,600
I didn't either.
I'm getting worse than you.

396
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:50,071
Ok, ok, ok.

397
00:23:50,171 --> 00:23:52,430
Let's start at the beginning.
What happened here?

398
00:23:52,895 --> 00:23:55,775
On the actual day, a hundred years ago,
what physically happened?

399
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:02,334
<i>There was a message
from the library. Just one.</i>

400
00:24:03,216 --> 00:24:04,599
The lights are going out.

401
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:08,890
Then the computer sealed the planet and
there was nothing for a hundred years.

402
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:13,730
It's taken 3 generations of my family
to decode the seals and get back in.

403
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,015
Excuse me...

404
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:16,372
<i>Not, just now.</i>

405
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:20,902
There was one other thing
in the last message...

406
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,274
That's confidential.

407
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:23,444
I trust this man.

408
00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:25,578
With my life, with everything.

409
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:28,937
- You've only just met him.
- No, he's only just met me.

410
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:33,659
This might be important actually...

411
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:35,248
In a moment!

412
00:24:37,682 --> 00:24:40,085
This is a data extract
that came with the message.

413
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:43,849
4022 saved. No survivors.

414
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,916
4022, that's the exact number of people
who were in the Library

415
00:24:49,016 --> 00:24:50,537
when the planet was sealed.

416
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:54,564
But how can 4022 people have
been saved if there were no survivors?

417
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:57,123
That's what were here to find out.

418
00:24:57,223 --> 00:25:00,752
And so far, what we havent
found, are any bodies.

419
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:21,610
Everybody, careful. Stay in the light.

420
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,225
Keep saying. I don't see the point!

421
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:24,945
- Who screamed?
- Miss Evangelista.

422
00:26:25,045 --> 00:26:26,227
Where is she?

423
00:26:27,697 --> 00:26:30,159
Miss Evangelista,
please state your current...

424
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,147
Please state your current...

425
00:26:39,523 --> 00:26:40,717
position.

426
00:26:51,673 --> 00:26:52,543
It's her.

427
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:58,505
It's Miss Evangelista.

428
00:26:58,605 --> 00:27:00,775
<i>We heard her scream a few seconds ago.</i>

429
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,837
What could do that to a
person in a few seconds?

430
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:05,355
- It took less than a few seconds.
- What did?

431
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:06,272
<i>Hello?</i>

432
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,451
Erm, I'm sorry everyone
this isn't going to be pleasant.

433
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:13,826
She's ghosting.

434
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:15,190
She's what?

435
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:18,240
<i>Hello, excuse me?</i>

436
00:27:19,215 --> 00:27:21,693
<i>I'm sorry, hello, excuse me?</i>

437
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:25,485
That's. That's her.
That's Miss Evangelista!

438
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:28,525
I don't want to sound horrible,
but couldn't we just. You know?

439
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,825
This is her last moment... no, we cant.

440
00:27:30,925 --> 00:27:32,585
A little respect, thank you.

441
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,855
<i>Sorry, where am I? Excuse me?</i>

442
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:37,955
But that's Miss Evangelista.

443
00:27:38,055 --> 00:27:41,250
It's a Data Ghost,
she'll be gone in a moment.

444
00:27:42,445 --> 00:27:45,873
Miss Evangelista,
you're fine, just relax.

445
00:27:46,145 --> 00:27:47,615
We'll be with you presently.

446
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:49,529
What's a Data Ghost?

447
00:27:50,225 --> 00:27:52,032
There's a neural relay
in the communicator.

448
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:53,527
Let's you send thought mails.

449
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:56,080
<i>That's it there, those green lights.</i>

450
00:27:57,243 --> 00:28:00,112
<i>Sometimes it can hold an impression
of a living consciousness</i>

451
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,943
<i>for a short time after death.</i>

452
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:04,052
Like an after image.

453
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,484
My grandfather lasted a day.

454
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:10,836
Kept talking about his shoelaces.

455
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,458
She's in there!

456
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,023
<i>I can't see, I can't... Where am I?</i>

457
00:28:18,123 --> 00:28:21,257
She's just brain waves now.
The pattern won't hold for long.

458
00:28:23,105 --> 00:28:25,886
She's conscious! She's thinking.

459
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:27,555
<i>I can't see, I can't...</i>

460
00:28:28,362 --> 00:28:29,717
<i>I don't know what I'm thinking.</i>

461
00:28:29,817 --> 00:28:31,942
She's a footprint on the beach.

462
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:33,894
And the tides coming in.

463
00:28:34,307 --> 00:28:35,698
<i>Where is that woman?</i>

464
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:38,213
<i>The nice woman... is she there?</i>

465
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:40,747
What woman?

466
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:47,125
She means... I think she means me.

467
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,649
<i>Is she there? The nice woman?</i>

468
00:28:50,883 --> 00:28:53,437
Yes, she's here, hang on.

469
00:28:55,752 --> 00:28:57,341
Go ahead. She can hear you.

470
00:28:57,441 --> 00:28:58,726
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

471
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:01,066
Help her.

472
00:29:02,105 --> 00:29:04,616
- She's dead.
- Yeah. Help her.

473
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:09,083
<i>Hello? Is that the nice woman?</i>

474
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:13,561
Yeah. Hello.
Yeah, I'm I'm... I'm here.

475
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:15,329
You OK?

476
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:19,570
<i>What I said before...
about being stupid...</i>

477
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:22,295
<i>don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

478
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:24,995
Course I won't.
Course I won't tell them.

479
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:27,370
<i>Don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

480
00:29:28,203 --> 00:29:31,399
I won't tell them. I said I won't.

481
00:29:31,785 --> 00:29:34,064
<i>Don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

482
00:29:35,784 --> 00:29:37,298
I'm not going to tell them.

483
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:38,431
Don't tell the others...

484
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:40,721
She's looping now.
The patterns degrading.

485
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:44,770
<i>I can't think, I... don't know, I...</i>

486
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,743
<i>I...</i>

487
00:29:47,684 --> 00:29:48,357
<i>I...</i>

488
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:50,170
<i>Ice cream.</i>

489
00:29:51,215 --> 00:29:52,190
<i>Ice cream.</i>

490
00:29:52,985 --> 00:29:53,980
<i>Ice cream.</i>

491
00:29:54,724 --> 00:29:55,719
<i>Ice cream.</i>

492
00:29:56,376 --> 00:29:57,175
<i>Ice cream.</i>

493
00:29:57,275 --> 00:29:59,257
- Doe's anybody mind if I.
-  Ice cream.

494
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:01,084
<i> Ice cream.</i>

495
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,648
<i> Ice cream.</i>

496
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,690
<i> Ice cream.</i>

497
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,045
<i>Was...</i>

498
00:30:10,315 --> 00:30:11,491
<i>That was horrible.</i>

499
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:13,969
That was the most horrible
thing I've ever seen.

500
00:30:15,452 --> 00:30:19,105
No. It's just a freak of technology.

501
00:30:21,105 --> 00:30:25,237
But whatever did this to her,
whatever killed her...

502
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:27,595
I'd like a word with that.

503
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:28,854
I'll introduce you.

504
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:40,999
- I'm going to need a packed lunch.
- Hang on.

505
00:30:43,727 --> 00:30:46,123
- What's in that book?
- Spoilers.

506
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:47,577
Who are you?

507
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:50,965
- Professor River Song, University of...
- To me.

508
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,678
- Who are you to me?
- Again... spoilers.

509
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:58,926
Chicken, and a bit of salad.
Knock yourself out.

510
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:06,196
Right, you lot.
Let's all meet the Vashta Nerada!

511
00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:13,105
Darling, Dr Moon is going now.

512
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,755
But hed like a word with
you alone, is that all right?

513
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:18,642
- Yes, of course, Dr Moon.
- Thank you.

514
00:31:22,805 --> 00:31:23,546
Now,

515
00:31:24,654 --> 00:31:25,492
listen.

516
00:31:27,807 --> 00:31:28,971
This is important.

517
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:34,102
There's the realworld, and
there's the world of nightmares.

518
00:31:34,202 --> 00:31:36,025
That's right, Isn't there?
You understand?

519
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,750
Yes, I know, Dr Moon.

520
00:31:39,235 --> 00:31:41,450
What I want you to remember is this...

521
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,769
<i>and I know its hard.</i>

522
00:31:43,998 --> 00:31:49,210
The real world is a lie,
and your nightmares are real.

523
00:31:49,873 --> 00:31:51,365
The Library is real.

524
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:55,515
There are people trapped in
there, people who need to be saved.

525
00:31:56,598 --> 00:31:58,324
The shadows are moving again.

526
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:02,010
<i>Those people are depending on you.</i>

527
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:04,250
Only you can save them.

528
00:32:05,565 --> 00:32:06,491
<i>Only you.</i>

529
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,770
You travel with him, don't you?

530
00:32:17,823 --> 00:32:19,689
The Doctor, you travel with him.

531
00:32:20,346 --> 00:32:21,284
What of it?

532
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,524
<i>Proper Dave, could you move over a bit?</i>

533
00:32:23,624 --> 00:32:24,231
Why?

534
00:32:24,331 --> 00:32:26,371
Just over there by the water cooler.
Thanks.

535
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:31,229
You know him, don't you?

536
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:33,093
Oh, God, do I know that man.

537
00:32:34,582 --> 00:32:36,603
<i>We go way back, that man and me.</i>

538
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,883
<i>Just not this far back.</i>

539
00:32:39,096 --> 00:32:40,250
<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

540
00:32:41,245 --> 00:32:42,672
He hasn't met me yet.

541
00:32:45,206 --> 00:32:48,428
I sent him a message but
it went wrong, it arrived too early.

542
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:51,732
This is the Doctor in the
days before he knew me.

543
00:32:54,535 --> 00:32:58,335
And he looks at me,
and he looks right through me.

544
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,627
And it shouldn't kill me, but it does.

545
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:03,893
What are you talking about?
Are you just talking rubbish?

546
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:05,755
Do you know him or don't you?

547
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:09,107
- Donna, quiet, I'm working!
- Sorry!

548
00:33:09,345 --> 00:33:11,928
Donna? You're Donna? Donna Noble?

549
00:33:12,028 --> 00:33:13,943
Yeah, why?

550
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:17,350
I do know the Doctor.

551
00:33:18,105 --> 00:33:19,396
But in the future.

552
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:21,642
His personal future.

553
00:33:22,437 --> 00:33:24,045
So why don't you know me?

554
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:26,147
Where am I in the future?

555
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:30,899
<i>OK! We've got a live one.</i>

556
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:36,448
That's not darkness down those
tunnels, this is not a shadow.

557
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,410
It's a swarm.

558
00:33:39,173 --> 00:33:40,625
A man-eating swarm.

559
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:47,591
The piranhas of the air,
the Vashta Nerada.

560
00:33:48,304 --> 00:33:50,707
Literally the shadows
that melt the flesh.

561
00:33:51,376 --> 00:33:54,167
Most planets have them,
but usually in small clusters.

562
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:57,815
I've never seen an infestation
on this scale, or this aggressive.

563
00:33:57,915 --> 00:33:59,800
What d'you mean, most planets?
Not Earth?

564
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,878
Mmmm, Earth, and a billion other worlds.

565
00:34:03,053 --> 00:34:05,049
Where there's meat,
there's Vashta Nerada.

566
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,140
<i>You can see them sometimes, if you look.</i>

567
00:34:08,003 --> 00:34:09,485
The dust in sunbeams.

568
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:13,602
If they were on Earth, we'd know.

569
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:16,000
Nah, normally they live on road kill.

570
00:34:16,713 --> 00:34:18,533
<i>But sometimes people go missing.</i>

571
00:34:19,855 --> 00:34:22,137
Not everyone comes back out of the dark.

572
00:34:22,488 --> 00:34:23,545
Every shadow?

573
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:26,589
No. But any shadow.

574
00:34:27,102 --> 00:34:28,366
So what do we do?

575
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:30,493
Daleks: aim for the eyestalk.

576
00:34:30,593 --> 00:34:32,489
Sontarans: back of the neck.

577
00:34:32,915 --> 00:34:37,765
Vashta Nerada: Run! Just run.

578
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:39,029
Run where?

579
00:34:39,405 --> 00:34:41,725
This is an index point.
There must be an exit teleport.

580
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:44,085
Don't look at me, I haven't
memorised the schematics!

581
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:45,116
Doctor,

582
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,848
little shop! They always make you
go through it on the way out

583
00:34:47,948 --> 00:34:49,506
so they can sell you stuff.

584
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,004
You're right! Brilliant!
That's why I like the little shop!

585
00:34:53,104 --> 00:34:53,942
OK, let's move it.

586
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:56,965
<i>Actually, Proper Dave, could you
stay where you are for a moment?</i>

587
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:57,865
Why?

588
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:02,586
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

589
00:35:05,401 --> 00:35:06,961
But you've got two shadows.

590
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:18,063
<i>It's how they hunt, they latch on
to a food source and keep it fresh.</i>

591
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,911
- What do I do?
- You stay absolutely still.

592
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:24,450
Like there's a wasp in the room,
a million wasps.

593
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,491
- We're not leaving you, Dave.
- Of course not.

594
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,549
Where's your helmet?
Don't point, tell me.

595
00:35:29,185 --> 00:35:30,923
On the floor, by my bag.

596
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,040
Don't cross his shadow!

597
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,419
Thanks.

598
00:35:40,957 --> 00:35:44,795
Now, the rest of you,
helmets back on and sealed up.

599
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:47,527
- We'll need everything we've got.
- We haven't any helmets.

600
00:35:47,627 --> 00:35:49,956
- Yeah, we're safe anyway.
- How are we safe?

601
00:35:50,162 --> 00:35:51,670
That was a clever lie to shut you up.

602
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,675
Professor, anything
I can do with the suit?

603
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:57,370
What good are suits? Miss Evanglista
was wearing one, there was nothing left.

604
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,938
We can increase the mesh-density
dial it up 400%. Make it a tougher meal.

605
00:36:01,038 --> 00:36:01,657
<i>OK.</i>

606
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,293
- 800%! Pass it on.
- Gotcha!

607
00:36:06,556 --> 00:36:08,489
- What's that?
- It's a screwdriver.

608
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,451
- It's sonic.
- Yeah, I know. Snap!

609
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:20,933
With me, come on!

610
00:36:25,505 --> 00:36:27,485
Are we shopping?
Is it a good time to shop?

611
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,886
No talking, just moving!
Stand up in the middle!

612
00:36:29,986 --> 00:36:31,481
Its a teleport, stand in the middle.

613
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:33,271
Can't send the others,
TARDIS won't recognise them.

614
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:35,530
- What you doing?
- You don't have suit, not safe!

615
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,326
You don't have a suit, you're
in just as much danger as I am...

616
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:39,916
Donna! Let me explain.

617
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:43,130
- Oh, that's how you do it!
- Doctor!

618
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:57,157
Where did it go?

619
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:00,924
It's just gone. I looked round,
one shadow. See.

620
00:37:01,024 --> 00:37:02,815
Does that mean we can leave?

621
00:37:02,915 --> 00:37:05,765
I don't know why we're still here.
We can leave him, can't we?

622
00:37:05,865 --> 00:37:08,615
- I mean, no offence.
- Shut up, Mr Lux.

623
00:37:08,715 --> 00:37:11,475
Did you feel anything?
Like an energy transfer?

624
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:13,879
No, no, but, look, it's gone.

625
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:15,975
Stop there, stop moving.

626
00:37:16,363 --> 00:37:18,490
They're never just gone.
And they never give up.

627
00:37:21,946 --> 00:37:23,929
Well, this ones benign.

628
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,272
<i>Hey, who turned out the lights?</i>

629
00:37:26,885 --> 00:37:27,825
No-one, they're fine.

630
00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:29,857
<i>No, seriously, turn them back on!</i>

631
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:31,439
They are on.

632
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:33,878
<i>I can't see a ruddy thing.</i>

633
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:36,318
Dave, turn round.

634
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:38,650
What's going on? Why can't I see?

635
00:37:39,115 --> 00:37:41,311
Is the power gone, are we safe here?

636
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:43,975
Dave, I want you to stay still,
absolutely still.

637
00:37:44,738 --> 00:37:47,297
Dave, Dave? Dave,
can you hear me, are you all right?

638
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:48,855
Talk to me, Dave.

639
00:37:50,212 --> 00:37:53,015
I'm fine, I'm OK, I'm... fine.

640
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:55,615
I want you to stay still,
absolutely still.

641
00:37:55,715 --> 00:37:58,855
I'm fine, I'm OK, I'm... fine.

642
00:38:00,755 --> 00:38:03,873
I can't. Why can't I? I...

643
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:08,977
I can't. Why can't I? I...

644
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:13,538
I can't. Why can't I?

645
00:38:14,946 --> 00:38:15,371
I...

646
00:38:15,645 --> 00:38:17,265
He's gone. He's ghosting.

647
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:19,425
Then why is he still standing?

648
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,021
Who turned out the lights?

649
00:38:23,704 --> 00:38:25,305
<i>Who turned out the lights?</i>

650
00:38:25,463 --> 00:38:26,532
Doctor, don't!

651
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:28,265
Dave, can you hear me?

652
00:38:28,872 --> 00:38:30,443
Who turned out the lights?

653
00:38:34,172 --> 00:38:35,680
<i>Who turned out the lights?</i>

654
00:38:36,637 --> 00:38:38,496
- Who turned out the lights?
- Scuse me!

655
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:42,408
Back from it, get back, right back!

656
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:51,165
- Doesn't move very fast does it?
- It's a swarm in a suit.

657
00:38:51,323 --> 00:38:52,652
But it's learning.

658
00:38:58,305 --> 00:38:59,505
What do we do? Where do we go?

659
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:01,250
See that wall behind you?

660
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:03,226
DUCK!

661
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,823
Squareness gun!

662
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:08,965
Everybody out. Go, go, go!

663
00:39:09,065 --> 00:39:10,715
Move it, move, move!

664
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:13,205
Move it, move, move!

665
00:39:14,356 --> 00:39:16,440
- You said not every shadow.
- But any shadow!

666
00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:21,265
Who turned out the lights?

667
00:39:21,365 --> 00:39:22,090
Run!

668
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,191
Sweetie, dinner's ready.

669
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:41,655
Donna Noble has been saved.

670
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:44,595
Sweetie?

671
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:09,224
<i>Trying to boost the power.</i>

672
00:40:09,495 --> 00:40:11,555
Light doesn't stop them,
but it slows them down.

673
00:40:11,655 --> 00:40:15,233
So, what's the plan? Do we have a plan?

674
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,429
Your screwdriver...

675
00:40:20,345 --> 00:40:23,605
- Looks exactly like mine.
- Yeah. You gave it to me.

676
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:25,634
I don't give my screwdriver to anyone.

677
00:40:25,734 --> 00:40:26,879
I'm not anyone.

678
00:40:27,704 --> 00:40:30,251
- Who are you?
- What's the plan?

679
00:40:31,627 --> 00:40:33,250
I teleported Donna back to the TARDIS.

680
00:40:33,593 --> 00:40:36,427
If we don't get back in five hours,
emergency program one activates.

681
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:37,645
Take her home.

682
00:40:37,823 --> 00:40:39,937
- We need to get a shift on.
- She's not there.

683
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,241
I should've received a signal,

684
00:40:42,492 --> 00:40:44,490
console signals me if
there's a teleport breach.

685
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,147
Maybe the co-ordinates slipped.
The equipment here's aged.

686
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,230
Donna Noble.

687
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:53,245
There's a Donna Noble in this library,
do you have the software to locate her?

688
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,938
Donna Noble has left the Library.

689
00:40:56,526 --> 00:40:59,925
- Donna Noble has been saved.
- Donna!

690
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:02,945
<i>Donna Noble has left the Library.</i>

691
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:04,954
<i>Donna Noble has been saved.</i>

692
00:41:05,054 --> 00:41:07,900
How can it be Donna?
