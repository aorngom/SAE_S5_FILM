00:00:00,408 --> 00:00:03,061
<i>The Library!
So big it doesn't need a name.</i>

2
00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:05,450
Someone's got in.
Someone's in my library.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,265
4,022 saved.

4
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:08,485
No survivors.

5
00:00:08,585 --> 00:00:11,111
- Others are coming.
- What... others?

6
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:19,507
Professor River Song, archaeologist.

7
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:21,138
You've seen me before, then?

8
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:25,613
The real world is a lie,
and your nightmares are real.

9
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:28,932
- What's CAL?!
- The Library is real.

10
00:00:29,214 --> 00:00:33,157
There are people trapped in there,
people who need to be saved.

11
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:35,497
There's a neural relay
in the communicator.

12
00:00:35,597 --> 00:00:37,360
<i>Sometimes it can hold an impression</i>

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,038
<i>of a living consciousness
for a short time after death.</i>

14
00:00:40,138 --> 00:00:43,532
The shadows are moving again.
Only you can save them.

15
00:00:43,632 --> 00:00:46,190
The piranhas of the air,
the Vashta Nerada.

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,920
Donna Noble has been saved.

17
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,301
Donna Noble has been saved.

18
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:56,440
<i>- Who turned out the lights?
- Donna Noble has left the Library.</i>

19
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:59,169
<i>Donna Noble has been saved.
Who turned out the lights?</i>

20
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:03,120
Donna Noble has left the Library.
Donna Noble has been saved.

00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:50,287
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

28
00:01:51,307 --> 00:01:53,015
<i>Hey! Who turned out the lights?</i>

29
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:56,692
This way, quickly, move!

30
00:01:57,703 --> 00:01:59,524
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

31
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,960
Dad, the Library,
it's on television now.

32
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,890
How many times, darling?

33
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,654
The Library is just
your imagination.

34
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:40,880
Donna?

35
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:55,840
Hello, Donna.

36
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:57,802
Who are you?

37
00:02:57,902 --> 00:02:59,232
I'm Dr Moon.

38
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:02,573
I've been treating you since
you came here two years ago.

39
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:07,480
Oh, God, Dr Moon, I'm so sorry!

40
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:09,403
What's wrong with me?

41
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:11,361
I didn't know you for a moment.

42
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:15,200
And then you remembered.
Shall we go for a walk?

43
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,961
No more dreams, then?

44
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:21,457
The Doctor and the blue box,
time and space.

45
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,435
How did we get here?

46
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:28,370
We came down the stairs,
out the front door.

47
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:30,943
We passed Mrs Ali on the way out.

48
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:34,828
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

49
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:38,132
- I forgot that.
- And then you remembered.

50
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,648
Shall we go down to the river?

51
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,054
You said "river" and suddenly
we're feeding ducks.

52
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:48,129
Dr Moon!

53
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:50,871
Morning.

54
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:54,025
Donna Noble, Lee McAvoy.

55
00:03:55,614 --> 00:03:56,465
Hello, Lee.

56
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,547
Hello...

57
00:03:59,460 --> 00:03:59,862
D...

58
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:03,400
Ooh, you've got bit
of a stammer there... Bless!

59
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:05,231
D... D...

60
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:08,284
Oh, skip to a vowel, they're easy!

61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
How did we leave it, him and me?

62
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:15,040
I got the impression he was
inviting you fishing tomorrow.

63
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:19,040
So...

64
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:22,200
Fishing!

65
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:26,909
D... D...

66
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:31,151
Gorgeous and can't speak a word.

67
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,136
What am I going to do with you?

68
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:38,640
Welcome home, M-Mrs McAvoy.

69
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:46,680
Stop it!
Stop it now, we've got a visitor.

70
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,776
You've done so much
in seven years, Donna.

71
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:51,404
Sometimes it feels more like 70.

72
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:54,835
Mind you, sometimes
it feels like no time at all.

73
00:04:57,926 --> 00:05:01,400
Can I just say what a pleasure
it is to see you fully integrated?

74
00:05:05,243 --> 00:05:07,677
<i>No, the signal's definitely
coming from the moon.</i>

75
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:10,035
<i>I'm blocking it,
but it's trying to break through.</i>

76
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:12,632
- Donna!
- Oops, sorry.

77
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,040
Mrs Angelo's rhubarb surprise.

78
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:16,525
Will I never learn?

79
00:05:18,502 --> 00:05:19,716
The Doctor!

80
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,162
I saw the Doctor!

81
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:26,280
Yes, you did, Donna,
and then... you forgot.

82
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:31,003
Dr Moon! Oh, hello!

83
00:05:31,828 --> 00:05:33,280
Shall I make you a cup of tea?

84
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:54,473
OK, we've got a clear spot.
In, in, in!

85
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:57,689
Right in the centre,
in the middle of the light, quickly!

86
00:05:57,789 --> 00:05:59,885
Don't let your shadows cross.
Doctor...

87
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,261
I'm doing it.

88
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:05,945
There's no lights here.
Sunset's coming, we can't stay long.

89
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,540
Have you found a live one?

90
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,645
Maybe, it's getting harder to tell.
What's wrong with you?

91
00:06:12,183 --> 00:06:15,120
We're going to need a chicken leg.
Who's got a chicken leg?

92
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,880
Thanks, Dave.

93
00:06:21,894 --> 00:06:24,997
OK... OK, we've got a hot one.
Watch your feet.

94
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:27,218
They won't attack
until there's enough of them,

95
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:29,680
but they've got our scent now,
they're coming.

96
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,881
Who is he?

97
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:36,478
You haven't even told us.
You just expect us to trust him.

98
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:39,930
- He is the Doctor.
- And who is the Doctor?

99
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,056
The only story you'll
ever tell, if you survive him.

100
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:48,518
You say he's your friend,
but he doesn't even know who you are.

101
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:50,414
Listen, all you need to know is this...

102
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:52,660
I'd trust that man
to the end of the universe,

103
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,187
and actually we've been.

104
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:00,005
He doesn't act like he trusts you.

105
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:02,245
Yeah, there's a tiny problem.

106
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:04,253
He hasn't met me yet.

107
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:11,021
What's wrong with it?

108
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,885
There's a signal coming from somewhere,
interfering with it.

109
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:16,605
- Use the red settings.
- It doesn't have a red setting.

110
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:19,580
- Well, use the dampers.
- It doesn't have dampers.

111
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:21,250
It will do one day.

112
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:27,446
So, some time in the future,
I just give you my screwdriver.

113
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:29,423
- Yeah.
- And why would I do that?

114
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,605
I didn't pluck it
from your cold dead hands,

115
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:34,443
- if that's what you're worried about.
- I know that because...?

116
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:36,117
Listen to me.

117
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:38,764
You've lost your friend,
you're angry, I understand.

118
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:40,929
But you need to be
less emotional, Doctor.

119
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,659
Less em... I'm not emotional.

120
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,950
There are five people in this room
still alive, focus on that.

121
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:49,291
- Dear God, you're hard work young.
- Young? Who are you?!

122
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:51,832
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Look at the pair of you!

123
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:53,559
We're all going to die right here,

124
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:56,174
and you're just squabbling
like an old married couple.

125
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:01,030
Doctor...

126
00:08:02,308 --> 00:08:05,968
one day I'm going to be someone
that you trust completely,

127
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:09,083
but I can't wait
for you to find that out.

128
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,968
So I'm going to prove it to you.

129
00:08:12,844 --> 00:08:13,795
And I'm sorry.

130
00:08:16,535 --> 00:08:19,044
I'm really very sorry.

131
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:32,260
Are we good?

132
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:37,240
Doctor... are we good?

133
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:40,812
Yeah...

134
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:43,110
Yeah, we're good.

135
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:48,500
Good.

136
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:58,889
What's interesting about my screwdriver?

137
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:01,560
Very hard to interfere with,
nothing's strong enough...

138
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,737
Well, some hairdryers,
but I'm working on that.

139
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:06,101
There is a very strong signal
coming from somewhere,

140
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:08,998
and it wasn't there before,
so what's new, what's changed?

141
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:11,149
Come on! What's new?

142
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:13,714
- What's different?
- I dunno, nothing.

143
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:15,854
It's getting dark.

144
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,626
It's a screwdriver,
it works in the dark.

145
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:20,865
Moonrise.

146
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,408
Tell me about the moon. What's there?

147
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:28,648
It's not real,
it was built as part of the Library.

148
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:29,693
Just a doctor moon.

149
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:31,850
- What's a doctor moon?
- A virus checker.

150
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,485
It supports and maintains the main
computer at the core of the planet.

151
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:38,191
Well, it's still active,
it's signalling, look.

152
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:43,060
Someone somewhere in this Library is
alive and communicating with the moon.

153
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,057
or possibly alive and drying their hair.

154
00:09:46,157 --> 00:09:49,051
No, the signal's definitely
coming from the moon.

155
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:51,310
I'm blocking it,
trying to break through.

156
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,154
Doctor!

157
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:53,582
Donna!

158
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:55,759
That was her, that was your friend.

159
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:57,673
Can you get her back? What was that?

160
00:09:58,105 --> 00:10:01,560
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
I'm trying to find the wavelength.

161
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,487
- I'm being blocked.
- Professor?

162
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:05,760
- Just a moment.
- It's important.

163
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,056
I have two shadows.

164
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:12,200
OK. Helmets on, everyone.

165
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,076
Anita, I'll get yours.

166
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,480
- It didn't do Proper Dave any good.
- Just keep it together, OK?

167
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:20,563
I'm keeping it together,

168
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:22,584
I'm only crying.

169
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,134
I'm about to die,
it's not an overreaction.

170
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:31,600
Hang on.

171
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:36,825
- Oh, God, they've got inside.
- No, no, no, I just tinted her visor.

172
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,860
Maybe they'll think they're already
in there, leave her alone.

173
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,656
You think they can
be fooled like that?

174
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:43,038
Maybe. I don't know.

175
00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:45,144
It's a swarm, it's not like we chat.

176
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,612
- Can you still see in there?
- Just about.

177
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:49,538
Just... Just stay back.

178
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:51,684
Professor, a quick word, please.

179
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,035
- What?
- Down here.

180
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:53,848
What is it?

181
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:56,812
Like you said, there are five people
still alive in this room.

182
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:57,776
Yeah, so?

183
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:58,528
So...

184
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:01,586
why are there six?

185
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:08,600
- Hey! Who turned out the lights?
- Run!

186
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,362
<i>Hey! Who turned out the lights?</i>

187
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:20,302
<i>Hey! Who turned out the lights?
Hey! Who turned out the lights?</i>

188
00:11:20,402 --> 00:11:21,902
<i>Here we are, Dr Moon.</i>

189
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:23,154
Mummy, I made you!

190
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:26,357
Ooh, that's nice, Ella.
Where's the face?

191
00:11:26,457 --> 00:11:27,752
I don't know.

192
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:31,284
Did you see Dr Moon?
Did he leave?

193
00:11:31,644 --> 00:11:32,739
Daddy!

194
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,785
Hello, you two, come here!
Big hugs, big Daddy hugs!

195
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:37,675
Look what I made!

196
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:40,540
- Oh, it's Mummy.
- It hasn't got a face.

197
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,139
Did you see Dr Moon?

198
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:44,742
- No, why, was he here?
- Yeah, just a second ago.

199
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:46,425
You must have passed him.

200
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,154
Are you all right?

201
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:52,887
Yeah.

202
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:55,293
Yeah, I'm fine, it's just...

203
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:56,744
Just...

204
00:11:59,349 --> 00:12:00,492
Nothing.

205
00:12:03,245 --> 00:12:05,015
It's been a long day, that's all.

206
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:07,360
I'm just tired.

207
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:11,453
Are you OK?

208
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:15,349
I said I was tired and...

209
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:18,264
..and we put the kids to bed,

210
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:20,477
and we watched television.

211
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:24,745
Was that a letter?

212
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,149
- It's midnight.
- Go and see what it is.

213
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:46,388
- "The world is wrong."
- What?

214
00:12:46,744 --> 00:12:48,235
For you. Weird, though.

215
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:51,267
"Dear Donna, the world is wrong.

216
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,895
"Meet me at your usual playpark,
two o'clock tomorrow."

217
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:07,399
Nutter.

218
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:13,015
Don't go. Please don't go.

219
00:13:21,197 --> 00:13:23,430
All right, you two,
off you go, no fighting.

220
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:46,424
I got your note last night.

221
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,105
The world is wrong,
what's that mean?

222
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:51,587
- No, you didn't.
- I'm sorry, what?

223
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:53,669
You didn't get my note last night.

224
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,566
You got it a few seconds ago.

225
00:13:56,572 --> 00:14:00,006
Having decided to come,
you suddenly found yourself arriving.

226
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:04,000
That is how time progresses here,
in the manner of a dream.

227
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,871
You've suspected that before,
haven't you, Donna Noble?

228
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,969
- How do you know me?
- We met before, in the Library.

229
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:16,171
<i>You were kind to me.</i>

230
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:18,940
<i>I hope now to return that kindness.</i>

231
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:22,422
Your voice...

232
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:26,326
- I recognise it.
- Yes, you do.

233
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:30,352
I am what is left of Miss Evangelista.

234
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,547
Professor, go ahead, find a safe spot.

235
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:46,175
It's a carnivorous swarm in a suit,
you can't reason with it.

236
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:47,161
Five minutes.

237
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:50,649
Other Dave, stay with him, pull him
out when he's too stupid to live.

238
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:52,372
Two minutes, Doctor.

239
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,425
<i>Hey! Who turned out the lights?</i>

240
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:57,330
You hear that? Those words?

241
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,897
That is the very last thought
of the man who wore that suit

242
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:02,965
before you climbed inside it
and stripped his flesh.

243
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:04,687
That's a man's soul

244
00:15:04,832 --> 00:15:07,595
trapped inside a neural relay,
going round and round forever.

245
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:10,368
If you don't have the decency
to let him go, how about this?

246
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:12,462
Use him. Talk to me.

247
00:15:13,718 --> 00:15:15,729
It's easy, neural relay.
Just point and think.

248
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:18,849
- Use him, talk to me.
- Hey! Who turned out the lights?

249
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:23,322
The Vashta Nerada live on all the worlds
in this system, but you hunt in forests.

250
00:15:23,516 --> 00:15:25,763
- What you doing in a library?
- We should go. Doctor!

251
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:26,400
In a minute.

252
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,149
You came to a library to hunt, why?
Just tell me why?

253
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:37,012
We... did not.

254
00:15:37,556 --> 00:15:39,052
Oh, hello.

255
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:41,798
We did not.

256
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:44,732
Take it easy, you'll get the hang of it.
Did not what?

257
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:49,049
We... did not... come... here.

258
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,305
Well, of course you did,
of course you came here.

259
00:15:51,537 --> 00:15:53,795
We come from here.

260
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:55,585
From here?

261
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:57,730
We hatched here.

262
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,228
But you hatch from trees,
from spores in trees.

263
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:04,207
These are our forests.

264
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:06,576
You're nowhere near a forest,
look around you.

265
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:10,004
These are our forests.

266
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:12,607
You're not in a forest,
you're in a library.

267
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:14,684
There are no trees in a...

268
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:16,791
library.

269
00:16:16,891 --> 00:16:18,456
<i>We should go. Doctor!</i>

270
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:20,164
Books.

271
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:22,435
You came in the books.

272
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:28,460
Microspores in a million, million books.

273
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,924
<i>We should go. Doctor!</i>

274
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:31,619
Oh, look at that.

275
00:16:32,345 --> 00:16:34,453
<i>The forests of the Vashta Nerada,</i>

276
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:37,400
<i>pulped and printed and bound.</i>

277
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:41,964
A million, million books,
hatching shadows.

278
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:43,564
<i>We should go. Doctor!</i>

279
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:46,956
Oh...

280
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:50,832
Dave! Oh, Dave, I'm so sorry.

281
00:16:52,784 --> 00:16:55,349
- Hey! Who turned out the lights?
- We should go. Doctor!

282
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:58,560
I'm stupid, I talk too much,
this gob doesn't stop for anything.

283
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,813
Want to know the only
reason I'm still alive?

284
00:17:01,614 --> 00:17:03,322
Always stay near the door.

285
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,885
<i>I suggested we meet here</i>

286
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:27,658
because a playground
is the easiest place to see it,

287
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:28,953
to see the lie.

288
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:32,325
- What lie?
- The children, look at the children.

289
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,336
Why do you wear that veil?

290
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:38,265
If I had a face like yours,
I wouldn't hide it.

291
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:40,189
You remember my face, then?

292
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:47,132
The memories are all still there,
the Library, the Doctor, me.

293
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:49,553
You've just been
programmed not to look.

294
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:54,200
Sorry, but... you're dead.

295
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:57,519
In a way, we're all dead here, Donna.

296
00:17:57,756 --> 00:17:59,865
We are the dead of the Library.

297
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:02,330
Well, what about the children?

298
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,120
The children aren't dead.
My children aren't dead.

299
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,240
Your children were never alive.

300
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,822
Don't you say that. Don't you dare
say that about my children!

301
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:12,542
Look at your children.

302
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:15,720
Look at all of them, really look.
They're not real.

303
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,520
<i>Do you see it now?
They're all the same.</i>

304
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,725
<i>All the children of this world,
the same boy and the same girl,</i>

305
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:25,390
<i>over and over again.</i>

306
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:26,497
Stop it.

307
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:30,564
Just stop it! Why are you doing this?
Why are you wearing that veil?

308
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:58,164
You know... it's funny,
I keep wishing the Doctor was here.

309
00:18:58,264 --> 00:19:00,318
<i>The Doctor is here, isn't he?</i>

310
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:02,714
He's coming back, right?

311
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:08,391
You know when you see a photograph
of someone you know,

312
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:10,920
but it's from years
before you knew them?

313
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:15,825
It's like they're not quite...
finished, they're not done yet.

314
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,712
Well... yes, the Doctor's here.

315
00:19:21,563 --> 00:19:24,044
He came when I called,
just like he always does.

316
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:28,699
But not MY Doctor.

317
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:33,710
Now my Doctor...

318
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,669
I've seen whole armies
turn and run away.

319
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:44,593
And he'd just swagger off
back to his TARDIS

320
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,064
and open the doors with
a snap of his fingers.

321
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,350
The Doctor... in the TARDIS...

322
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:58,160
- Next stop, everywhere.
- Spoilers!

323
00:20:00,774 --> 00:20:03,514
Nobody can open a TARDIS
by snapping their fingers.

324
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:06,799
- It doesn't work like that.
- It does for the Doctor.

325
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:08,788
I am the Doctor.

326
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:10,680
Yeah. Some day.

327
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:15,646
- How are you doing?
- Where's Other Dave?

328
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:17,323
Not coming, sorry.

329
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:20,770
Well, if they've taken him,

330
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:23,396
- why haven't they gotten me yet?
- I don't know.

331
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,508
<i>Maybe tinting your
visor's making a difference.</i>

332
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,216
<i>It's making a difference all right.</i>

333
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:30,682
No-one's ever going
to see my face again.

334
00:20:31,714 --> 00:20:35,019
- Can I get you anything?
- An old age would be nice.

335
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,378
Anything you can do?

336
00:20:37,478 --> 00:20:39,884
- I'm all over it.
- Doctor...

337
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:42,950
When we first met you...

338
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,303
you didn't trust Professor Song.

339
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,305
And then she whispered a word
in your ear, and you did.

340
00:20:51,512 --> 00:20:52,863
My life so far...

341
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,804
I could do with a word like that.

342
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:58,269
What did she say?

343
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:04,927
Give a dead girl a break.
Your secrets are safe with me.

344
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:06,567
Safe.

345
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:07,843
What?

346
00:21:09,914 --> 00:21:12,552
Safe. You don't say saved,
nobody says saved,

347
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:14,958
you say safe.
The data fragment! What did it say?

348
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:18,650
- "4,022 people saved. No survivors."
- Doctor?

349
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:23,424
Nobody says saved,
nutters say saved, you say safe.

350
00:21:23,524 --> 00:21:28,640
But you see, it didn't mean safe,
it meant... it literally meant... saved!

351
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,331
What happened to your face?

352
00:21:32,431 --> 00:21:34,001
Transcription errors.

353
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:37,905
It destroyed my face,
did wonders for my intellect.

354
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,045
I'm a very poor copy of myself.

355
00:21:40,426 --> 00:21:41,773
<i>Where are we?</i>

356
00:21:42,323 --> 00:21:44,244
Why are the children all the same?

357
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:48,361
The same pattern over and over.
It saves an awful lot of space.

358
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:49,465
Space?

359
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:53,023
Cyberspace.

360
00:21:53,123 --> 00:21:55,247
No! Don't tell, you mustn't tell!

361
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:57,573
<i>See, there it is, right there!</i>

362
00:21:57,673 --> 00:21:59,431
A hundred years ago,
massive power surge,

363
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:00,665
all teleports going at once.

364
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:03,239
Soon as Vashta Nerada hit
their hatching cycle, they attack.

365
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:05,802
Someone hits the alarm,
computer tries to teleport everyone.

366
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:07,772
It tried to teleport 4022 people?

367
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,625
It succeeded, pulled 'em all out, but...

368
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:11,815
nowhere to send them,
nowhere safe in the Library.

369
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,454
Vashta Nerada growing in every shadow,

370
00:22:13,554 --> 00:22:16,420
4022 people, all beamed up
and nowhere to go.

371
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,434
They're stuck in the system,
waiting to be sent, like emails.

372
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:22,578
So what's a computer to do?

373
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:24,530
What does a computer always do?

374
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,063
It saved them.

375
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,623
The Library, a whole world of books,

376
00:22:31,723 --> 00:22:34,589
and right at the core,
the biggest hard drive in history.

377
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:37,229
Index to everything ever written,
backup of every single book.

378
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:42,160
The computer saved 4022 people
the only way a computer can.

379
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:45,200
It saved them to the hard drive.

380
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,200
Your physical self is stored
in the library as an energy signature.

381
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,150
It can be actualised again
whenever you or the Library requires.

382
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,560
The Library?

383
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,773
If my face ends up on
one of those statues...

384
00:22:58,873 --> 00:23:00,481
You remember the statues?

385
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,010
Wait, no, just... hang on. So...

386
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,231
this isn't the real me?

387
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,560
This isn't my real body.

388
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,570
But I've been dieting!

389
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,218
What you see around you,

390
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:19,420
this entire world is nothing
more than virtual reality.

391
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,734
So why do you look like that?

392
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:26,451
I had no choice.

393
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,040
You teleported.
You're a perfect reproduction.

394
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,313
I was just a data ghost caught in
the Wi-Fi and automatically uploaded.

395
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:36,880
And it made you clever?

396
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,919
Were only strings of numbers in here.

397
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,278
I think a decimal point
may have shifted in my IQ.

398
00:23:42,435 --> 00:23:44,762
But my face has been
the bigger advantage.

399
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:48,916
I have the two qualities
you require to see absolute truth.

400
00:23:49,016 --> 00:23:52,200
I am brilliant... and unloved.

401
00:23:55,263 --> 00:23:56,840
If this is all a dream...

402
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:00,380
whose dream is it?

403
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,281
It's hard to see everything in
the data core, even for me, but...

404
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:05,140
there is a word.

405
00:24:06,034 --> 00:24:06,973
<i>just one word.</i>

406
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,808
CAL.

407
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:15,985
<i>Mummy! My knee!</i>

408
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:19,195
Oh, look at that knee!

409
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:21,347
Oh, look at that silly old knee!

410
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:24,368
She's not real. They're fictions.

411
00:24:24,887 --> 00:24:28,620
I'm sorry, but now that you understand
that, you won't be able to keep a hold.

412
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,825
They are sustained only by your belief.

413
00:24:30,925 --> 00:24:32,650
You don't know, you don't have children.

414
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,123
Neither do you.

415
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,409
Donna, for your own sake, let them go!

416
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,350
Stop it! You'll spoil everything!

417
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,380
I hate you, you're going
to ruin everything! Stop it!

418
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,956
Sweetie, what's wrong?

419
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,600
Shut up!

420
00:24:50,886 --> 00:24:52,917
Daddy! No! Daddy!

421
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:01,864
What is it? What's wrong?

422
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:06,418
<i>Autodestruct enabled in 20 minutes.</i>

423
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,485
Mummy, what did the lady mean?

424
00:25:10,585 --> 00:25:11,924
<i>Are we not real?</i>

425
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
- Where are we going?
- Home!

426
00:25:15,855 --> 00:25:17,845
That was quick, wasn't it, Mummy?

427
00:25:18,295 --> 00:25:21,800
Mummy, what's wrong with the sky?

428
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:27,130
What's maximum erasure?

429
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,210
20 minutes, this planet'll
crack like an egg.

430
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,730
No! No, it's all right,
the Doctor Moon will stop it.

431
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,410
It's programmed to protect CAL.

432
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,240
<i>Now, you really must
stop this, you know.</i>

433
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,686
You've forgotten again it was you who
saved all those people, haven't you?

434
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,250
And then you remembered.

435
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,640
Shut up, Dr Moon!

436
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,221
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

437
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:55,001
<i>All Library systems
are permanently offline,</i>

438
00:25:55,564 --> 00:25:58,160
<i>sorry for any inconvenience. Shortly.</i>

439
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,070
We need to stop this,
we've got to save CAL.

440
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,758
But what is it, what is CAL?

441
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:05,290
We need to get to the main
computer. I'll show you.

442
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,080
- It's at the core of the planet.
- Well, then...

443
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,056
let's go.

444
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,317
Gravity platform!

445
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:23,236
- I bet I like you.
- Oh, you do!

446
00:26:32,973 --> 00:26:34,850
Mummy, you're hurting my hand.

447
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,387
You just... You just
stay where I can see you.

448
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:43,491
You don't get out of my sight.

449
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:45,805
Is it bedtime?

450
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:55,729
OK.

451
00:26:57,988 --> 00:27:01,473
That was lovely, wasn't it?
That was a lovely bedtime.

452
00:27:01,742 --> 00:27:03,194
We had warm milk,

453
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:07,536
and we watched cartoons, and then
Mummy read you a lovely bedtime story.

454
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,440
Mummy, Joshua and me,
we're not real, are we?

455
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:14,306
Of course you’re real.

456
00:27:14,813 --> 00:27:18,561
You're as real as anything.
Why do you say that?

457
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:23,860
But, Mummy, sometimes, when you're
not here, it's like we're not here.

458
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,680
Even when you close
your eyes. We just stop.

459
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,040
Well, Mummy promises
to never close her eyes again.

460
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,019
No! Please!

461
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:52,250
NO PLEASE! No! No, no!

462
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,838
No, no !

463
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,920
No, no !

464
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:05,060
<i>Autodestruct in 15 minutes.</i>

465
00:28:05,454 --> 00:28:08,970
The Data Core! Over 4000
living minds, trapped inside it.

466
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,169
Yeah, well they won't be living much
longer, we're running out of time.

467
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:16,820
Help me. Please help me.

468
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,240
Please, please help me!

469
00:28:24,838 --> 00:28:27,109
<i>Help me. Please, help me.</i>

470
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,630
What's that? Was that a child?

471
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,240
Computer's in sleep mode.

472
00:28:33,322 --> 00:28:35,109
I can't wake it up. I'm trying.

473
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:46,040
Doctor, these readings!

474
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,440
I know, you'd think it was... dreaming.

475
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,720
It is dreaming... of a normal life,
and a lovely Dad,

476
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,760
and of every book ever written.

477
00:28:56,688 --> 00:28:58,210
Computer's don't dream.

478
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,440
<i>Help me. Please help me.</i>

479
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,082
No. But little girls do.

480
00:29:14,724 --> 00:29:17,120
Please help me. Please help me.

481
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,573
Oh, my God! It's the little girl.

482
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,045
<i>The girl we saw in the computer.</i>

483
00:29:24,758 --> 00:29:26,360
<i>She's not in the computer.</i>

484
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:29,807
<i>In a way, she is the computer.</i>

485
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:31,929
<i>The main command node.</i>

486
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,960
This is CAL.

487
00:29:35,101 --> 00:29:38,310
CAL is a child! A child
hooked up to a mainframe?

488
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,490
Why didn't you tell me
this! I needed to know this!

489
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,407
Because she's family!

490
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,429
CAL...

491
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,789
Charlotte Abigail Lux.

492
00:29:50,965 --> 00:29:53,104
My grandfathers youngest daughter.

493
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,795
<i>She was dying,</i>

494
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:00,960
<i>so he built her a Library,
and put her living mind inside,</i>

495
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,531
with a moon to watch over her,

496
00:30:04,226 --> 00:30:05,990
and all of human history
to pass the time,

497
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,393
<i>any era to live in, any book to read.</i>

498
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,950
<i>She loved books more than anything.</i>

499
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,216
He gave her them all.

500
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,110
He asked only that she be left in peace.

501
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,302
A secret,

502
00:30:21,142 --> 00:30:22,200
not a freak show.

503
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:26,440
So you weren't protecting a patent,
you were protecting her.

504
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:32,188
This is only half a life, of course.

505
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,330
But it's for ever.

506
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,906
And then the shadows came.

507
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:39,804
<i>Shadows. I have to...</i>

508
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,750
I have to save.

509
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:44,371
Have to save...

510
00:30:45,141 --> 00:30:46,311
And she saved them.

511
00:30:47,587 --> 00:30:50,000
<i>She saved everyone in the Library,</i>

512
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,867
folded them into her
dreams and kept them safe.

513
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:55,660
<i>Then why didn't she tell us?</i>

514
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,383
<i>Because she's forgotten.</i>

515
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,916
She's got 4000 living minds chatting
away inside her head, it must be like...

516
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,659
being... well, me.

517
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,030
So what do we do?

518
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,139
- Autodestruct in ten minutes.
- Easy!

519
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:13,180
We beam all people out of data core,
computer'll reset and stop countdown.

520
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,210
Charlotte doesn't have enough
memory space left to make the transfer.

521
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,690
Easy! I'll hook myself to the computer
and she can borrow my memory space!

522
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,150
It'll kill you stone dead.

523
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,080
- Yeah, it's easy to criticise.
- It'll burn out both your hearts.

524
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,360
I'll try my hardest not to die.
It's my main thing.

525
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,231
- Doctor!
- Shut up now!

526
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:29,939
You and Luxy-boy,
back to the main Library.

527
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,975
Prime data cells you can
find for max download,

528
00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:35,413
and before you say anything else,
Professor, can I just mention, shut up!

529
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,290
- I hate you sometimes!
- I know!

530
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,980
Mr Lux, with me! Anita,
if he dies, I'll kill him!

531
00:31:43,244 --> 00:31:44,810
What about the Vashta Nerada?

532
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,140
These are their forests.

533
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,890
I'll seal Charlotte inside her world,
take everybody else away.

534
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,160
The shadows can swarm
to their hearts content.

535
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,118
<i>So you think they're
just gonna let us go?</i>

536
00:31:53,218 --> 00:31:55,890
- Best offer they're gonna get.
- You're gonna make em an offer?

537
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,142
They'd better take it,

538
00:31:57,242 --> 00:32:00,800
cos right now, I'm finding it very hard
to make any kind of offer at all.

539
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:03,273
I really liked Anita.

540
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,190
She was brave, even when she was crying,
and she never gave in. And you ate her.

541
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,159
But I'm gonna let that pass.

542
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,642
Just as long as you let them pass.

543
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,308
How long have you known?

544
00:32:16,408 --> 00:32:17,885
I counted the shadows.

545
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:21,145
You only have one now.

546
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,113
She's nearly gone. Be kind.

547
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:29,300
These are our forests. We are not kind.

548
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,544
I'm giving you back your forests,
but you are giving me them.

549
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,100
You are letting them go.

550
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,554
These are our forests.
They are our meat.

551
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:44,006
Don't play games with me.

552
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,030
You just killed someone I like,
that is not a safe place to stand.

553
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,833
I'm the Doctor, and you're in the
biggest Library in the universe.

554
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,331
Look me up.

555
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,120
You have one day.

556
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:15,920
Anita!

557
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,797
I'm sorry. She's been dead
a while now. I told you to go.

558
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,960
Lux can manage without me.

559
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,321
But you can't.

560
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:31,880
<i>Autodestruct in two minutes.</i>

561
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:38,770
Oh, no, no, no, no, come on,
what are you doing? That's my job.

562
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,990
Oh, and I'm not allowed to have
a career, I suppose?

563
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,690
Why am I handcuffed?
Why do you even have handcuffs?

564
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,800
Spoilers!

565
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,292
Stop this now, this is gonna kill you!

566
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,768
I'd have a chance, you don't have.

567
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:50,889
You wouldn't have a chance,
and neither do I.

568
00:33:52,425 --> 00:33:54,246
I'm timing it for the end
of the countdown,

569
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:55,831
there'll be a blip in command flow.

570
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:58,196
It should improve our chances
of a clean download.

571
00:33:58,296 --> 00:33:59,422
River! Please! No!

572
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:03,032
Funny thing is, this means you've
always known how I was going to die.

573
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:06,529
All the time we've been together,
you knew I was coming here.

574
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,640
The last time I saw you,
the real you, the future you, I mean,

575
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:16,079
you turned up on my doorstep,
with a new haircut and a suit.

576
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:21,079
<i>You took me to Darillium
to see the singing towers.</i>

577
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,078
What a night that was!

578
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,017
The towers sang and you cried.

579
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,610
<i>- Autodestruct in one minute.
- You wouldn't tell me why,</i>

580
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,856
<i>but I suppose you knew
it was time. My time.</i>

581
00:34:35,144 --> 00:34:37,200
<i>Time to come to the Library.</i>

582
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,155
You even gave me your screwdriver,
that should've been a clue.

583
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,680
<i>There's nothing you can do.</i>

584
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,490
You can let me do this!

585
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,060
If you die here,
it'll mean I've never met you.

586
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,290
Time can be rewritten.

587
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:52,640
Not those times.
Not one line! Don't you dare!

588
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:59,240
It's OK. It's OK, it's not over for you.
You'll see me again.

589
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,777
You've got all of that to come.

590
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:05,325
You and me, time and space.

591
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,442
You watch us run!

592
00:35:10,437 --> 00:35:11,883
River, you know my name!

593
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:13,200
<i>Autodestruct in...</i>

594
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,388
You whispered my name in my ear.

595
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,600
<i>Nine, eight, seven...</i>

596
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,442
There's only one reason I would
ever tell anyone my name.

597
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:23,713
There's only one time I could...

598
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,040
Shh, now!

599
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,886
<i>Three.</i>

600
00:35:26,986 --> 00:35:28,081
Spoilers!

601
00:35:28,181 --> 00:35:30,639
<i>Two, one...</i>

602
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,794
Donna? What's happening?

603
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,100
I don't know, but it's not real.
Nothing here's real.

604
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,442
The whole world,
everything, none of it's real.

605
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,213
Am I real?

606
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,086
Course you're real, I know you're real.

607
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,001
Oh, God, oh, God, I hope you're real.

608
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:09,232
I'll find you!
I promise you, I'll find you!

609
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,043
<i>Excuse me.</i>

610
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,088
What happened? How did we get here?

611
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:25,678
Look at you.

612
00:36:26,673 --> 00:36:27,680
You're back.

613
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:30,753
You're all back. He did it!

614
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,790
You're all back. Look at you!

615
00:36:47,113 --> 00:36:48,389
Look at that!

616
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:52,149
Look at that. He did it.

617
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,048
<i>4,022 people! Saved!</i>

618
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,100
<i>Please be patient.</i>

619
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,490
<i>Only three can teleport at a time.</i>

620
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,150
<i>Do not state your intended
destination until you arrive in...</i>

621
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,343
Any luck?

622
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,397
There wasn't even anyone called
Lee in the Library that day.

623
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:37,082
Suppose he could have had
a different name out here, but...

624
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,973
let's be honest,

625
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:41,433
he wasn't real, was he?

626
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:43,384
Maybe not.

627
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,731
I made up the perfect man.

628
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,010
Gorgeous, adores me,
and hardly able to speak a word.

629
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,123
- What does that say about me?
- Everything.

630
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,060
Sorry, did I say everything?
I meant to say nothing.

631
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,085
I was aiming for nothing,
I accidentally said everything.

632
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,925
<i>Stand right in the middle
of the teleport, please...</i>

633
00:38:04,945 --> 00:38:06,015
What about you?

634
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:08,486
Are you all right?

635
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,400
I'm always all right.

636
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,765
Is all right special
Time Lord code for...

637
00:38:16,485 --> 00:38:17,960
really not all right at all?

638
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,281
Why?

639
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,385
Cos I'm all right, too.

640
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:29,099
Come on.

641
00:38:55,288 --> 00:38:56,377
Your friend.

642
00:38:57,353 --> 00:38:58,880
Professor Song...

643
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,684
She knew you in the future,
but she didn't know me.

644
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,061
What happens to me?

645
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,527
When she heard my name,
when she looked at me...

646
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:08,440
Donna...

647
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,993
This is her diary.

648
00:39:14,091 --> 00:39:15,155
My future.

649
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,422
I could look you up.

650
00:39:22,562 --> 00:39:23,700
What do you think?

651
00:39:26,165 --> 00:39:27,811
Shall we peek at the end?

652
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:36,880
Spoilers, right?

653
00:39:38,363 --> 00:39:39,280
Right.

654
00:39:53,213 --> 00:39:56,608
Come on. The next chapter's this way.

655
00:39:59,202 --> 00:40:02,724
<i>When you run with The Doctor,
it feels like it will never end.</i>

656
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:07,251
<i>But however hard you try,
you can't run for ever.</i>

657
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,787
<i>Everybody knows that everybody dies,
and nobody knows it like The Doctor.</i>

658
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:20,130
<i>But I do think that all the skies
of all the worlds might just turn dark,</i>

659
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:24,320
<i>if he ever, for one moment accepts it.</i>

660
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,574
Why? Why would I give
her my screwdriver?

661
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,013
Why would I do that?

662
00:40:28,401 --> 00:40:31,730
Thing is, future me had years to think
about it, to think of a way to save her,

663
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,948
and what he did was give her
a screwdriver! Why would I do that?

664
00:40:39,415 --> 00:40:42,580
Look at that! I'm very good!

665
00:40:42,825 --> 00:40:44,080
<i>What have you done?</i>

666
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,942
Saved her.

667
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,820
Stay with me! You can
do it, stay with me!

668
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,467
Come on, you and me, one last run!

669
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,520
Sorry, River, shortcut!

670
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,365
<i>Platform disabled.</i>

671
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,204
<i>Everybody knows that everybody dies.</i>

672
00:41:22,727 --> 00:41:24,532
<i>But not every day.</i>

673
00:41:27,282 --> 00:41:28,696
<i>Not today.</i>

674
00:41:52,823 --> 00:41:55,089
It's OK. You're safe.

675
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,510
You'll always be safe here.

676
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,550
The Doctor fixed the data core.

677
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,190
This is a good place now.

678
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,880
But I was worried you might be lonely.
So I brought you some friends.

679
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,960
Aren't I a clever girl?

680
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:08,806
Aren't we all?

681
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:14,760
<i>Oh, for heaven's sake!</i>

682
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,009
He just can't do it, can he?

683
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,970
That man, that impossible man!

684
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,280
He just can't give in.

685
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:44,273
<i>Some days are special.</i>

686
00:42:45,018 --> 00:42:47,977
<i>Some days are so, so blessed.</i>

687
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,918
<i>Some days, nobody dies at all.</i>

688
00:43:19,001 --> 00:43:20,108
<i>Now and then,</i>

689

<i>sserwhen the wind stands fair,

00:44:16,168 --> 00:44:17,219
<i>Taking a big space truck</i>

<i>with bunch of strangers across
diamond planet called Midnight?</i>

696
00:44:19,928 --> 00:44:21,112
What could possibly go wrong?

697
00:44:21,212 --> 00:44:23,000
- Enjoy your trip.
- Oh, I can't wait.

698
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,560

If were gonna get out of
this, then you need me!

703

- Two people are dead.
- Don't make it a third!

705
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,940

Get out of there!
