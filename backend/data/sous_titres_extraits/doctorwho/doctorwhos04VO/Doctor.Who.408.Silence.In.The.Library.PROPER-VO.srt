00:00:00,436 --> 00:00:02,836
<i>Close your eyes
and tell me what you see.</i>

2
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:10,799
The Library.

3
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:18,925
<i>Open your eyes again.</i>

4
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:22,509
<i>Where are you now?</i>

5
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,303
My living room, Dr Moon.

6
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:26,712
<i>When you close your eyes...</i>

7
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:28,570
I go to the Library.

8
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:32,186
Go to the Library now.

9
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,531
<i>- Are you back there?
- Yes.</i>

10
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:38,696
<i>The same part?</i>

11
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:41,243
<i>No, it's always different.</i>

12
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,540
<i>The Library goes on for ever.</i>

13
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:46,312
<i>How you do move around?</i>

14
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:48,739
By wishing.

15
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:54,550
- What's wrong?
- Something's here!

16
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:56,990
Someone's got in!
No-one's supposed to get in!

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,352
She's never mentioned anyone.
She's always been alone.

18
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:00,766
<i>Someone's in my library.</i>

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,935
No! No, please! That's not allowed!

20
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:07,217
Listen to me.

21
00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:10,270
The Library is in your mind.

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,950
I know it's in my mind.
But something's got inside!

23
00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:26,466
Oh! Hello!

24
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:28,800
Sorry to burst in on you like this.

25
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:30,539
OK if we stop here for a bit?

26
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:58,950

30
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:13,800
Books! People never
really stop loving books.

31
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,265
51st century.

32
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,217
By now you've got holovids,
direct to brain downloads, fiction mist,

33
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:24,833
but you need the smell.
The smell of books, Donna. Deep breath.

34
00:02:29,605 --> 00:02:30,638
The Library.

35
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:34,698
So big it doesn't need a name.

36
00:02:34,798 --> 00:02:36,187
Just a great big "the."

37
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:37,763
It's like a city.

38
00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:40,123
It's a world. Literally a world.

39
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:42,186
The core of the planet
is the index computer,

40
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:43,583
biggest hard drive ever.

41
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:46,084
And up here,
every book ever written.

42
00:02:46,184 --> 00:02:47,466
Whole continents of

43
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:51,952
Jeffrey Archer, Bridget Jones,
Monty Python's Big Red Book.

44
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:54,590
Brand new editions,
specially printed.

45
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:58,910
<i>We're near the equator, so...</i>

46
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:02,984
this must be Biographies!

47
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:04,963
I love biographies.

48
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:07,163
Yeah, very you.
Always a death at the end.

49
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:10,208
You need a good death.
Without death, there'd only be comedies.

50
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:12,883
Dying gives us size. Oi!

51
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,203
- Spoilers!
- What?

52
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:16,882
These books are from your future.

53
00:03:16,982 --> 00:03:19,043
Don't read ahead,
spoil all the surprises.

54
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:20,150
Like peeking at the end.

55
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,922
Isn't travelling with you
one big spoiler?

56
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:27,311
I try to keep you away
from major plot developments.

57
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,596
Which, to be honest,
I seem to be very bad at,

58
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:32,366
cos... you know what?

59
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:34,423
This is the biggest
library in the universe.

60
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:37,345
So where is everyone?

61
00:03:42,282 --> 00:03:43,270
It's silent.

62
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:45,230
The Library?

63
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:49,902
The planet.

64
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:53,750
<i>The whole planet.</i>

65
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,272
Maybe it's a Sunday.

66
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,431
No, I never land on Sundays.

67
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,683
Sundays are boring. Well...

68
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:06,238
Maybe everyone's really,
really quiet.

69
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:08,074
Yeah, maybe.

70
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:10,733
But they'd still show up
on the system.

71
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:13,923
Doctor, why are we here?
Really, why?

72
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:16,283
Oh, you know, just passing.

73
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:18,163
No, seriously.

74
00:04:18,263 --> 00:04:21,695
It was all, "Let's hit the beach,"
then suddenly we're in a library.

75
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,643
- Why?
- Now, that's interesting.

76
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:25,805
- What?
- Scanning for life forms.

77
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:28,765
<i>If I do a scan looking for
your basic humanoids, you know,</i>

78
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:32,025
<i>your book readers, few limbs and
a face, apart from us, I get nothing.</i>

79
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:34,523
Zippo, nada, see?

80
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:39,716
Nobody home. But if I widen
the parameters to any kind of life...

81
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:46,163
<i>A million million.</i>

82
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:47,823
Gives up after that.

83
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:51,830
A million million.

84
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,490
<i>But there's nothing here.</i>

85
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:55,904
<i>There's no-one.</i>

86
00:04:57,368 --> 00:04:58,838
<i>And not a sound.</i>

87
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:03,193
A million million life forms,

88
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:06,063
and silence in the Library.

89
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:09,612
But there's no-one here.

90
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:13,323
There's just books.
I mean, it's not the books, is it?

91
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,243
I mean, it can't be
the books, can it?

92
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:17,823
I mean, books can't be alive?

93
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:30,343
<i>Welcome!</i>

94
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,030
- That came from in there.
- Yeah!

95
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,330
I am Courtesy Node 710/aqua.

96
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,155
Please enjoy the Library and
respect the personal access codes

97
00:05:57,255 --> 00:06:02,029
of all your fellow readers
regardless of species or hygiene taboo.

98
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,125
That face, it looks real.

99
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:05,813
Yeah, don't worry about it.

100
00:06:06,445 --> 00:06:08,430
But a statue with a real face, though!

101
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:11,932
- It's a hologram, isn't it?
- No, but really, it's fine.

102
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:15,623
Additional, There follows a brief
message from the head librarian

103
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,234
for your urgent attention.

104
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,749
It has been edited for tone and content

105
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:23,478
by a Felman Lux Automated
Decency Filter.

106
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:25,387
Message follows.

107
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:26,302
"Run.

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,910
"For God's sake, run.

109
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:30,819
<i>"Nowhere is safe.</i>

110
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,611
"The Library has sealed itself,
we can't... Oh, they're here.

111
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:40,043
"Arg. Slarg. Snick."
Message ends.

112
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:45,203
<i>Please switch off your mobile comm
units for the comfort of other readers.</i>

113
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:47,361
So that's why we're here.

114
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:50,277
Any other messages, same date stamp?

115
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,122
<i>One additional message.</i>

116
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:56,352
This message carries a Felman
Lux coherency warning of...

117
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:58,773
- Yeah, yeah, fine, just play it.
-  5, 0, 11...

123
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,430
Donna...

124
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:17,176
Yeah?

125
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:20,623
Stay out of the shadows.

126
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,195
Why, what's in the shadows?

127
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:43,468
So...

128
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:46,320
We weren't just
in the neighbourhood.

129
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:49,085
Yeah, I kind of, sort of lied a bit.

130
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:51,750
I got a message
on the psychic paper.

131
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:55,953
What do you think, cry for help?

132
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:59,870
Cry for help, with a kiss?

133
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,259
Oh, we've all done that.

134
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,723
- Who's it from?
- No idea.

135
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:07,174
- So why did we come here, why did you?
- Donna.

136
00:08:10,845 --> 00:08:12,609
- What's happening?
- Run!

137
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:17,583
- What, is it locked?
- Jammed! The wood's warped!

138
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,174
Sonic it, use the thingy!

139
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:24,726
- I can't, it's wood!
- What, it doesn't do wood?!

140
00:08:24,826 --> 00:08:27,172
If I can vibrate the molecules,
fry the bindings,

141
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:30,000
- I can shatterline the interface.
- Oh, get out of the way!

142
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,283
Oh! Hello!

143
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:45,023
Sorry to burst in on you like this.
OK if we stop here for a bit?

144
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:48,938
What is it?

145
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:52,550
Security camera.

146
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:56,423
Switched itself off.

147
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,979
They were in my library.
How can they be in my library?

148
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:04,163
Who were they?

149
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,188
What's that? What's that noise?

150
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:08,233
What noise?

151
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,694
Nice door skills, Donna.

152
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:16,717
Well, you know, boyfriends, sometimes
you need the element of surprise.

153
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:18,181
<i>What was that ?</i>

154
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:20,152
What was after us?

155
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:22,673
I mean, did we just run away
from a power cut?

156
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,834
Possibly.

157
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:27,775
Are we safe here?

158
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,810
Course we're safe.
There's a little shop.

159
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,690
Gotcha!

160
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:40,988
No, stop it!

161
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,750
No, no!

162
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:47,798
Ooh, I'm sorry.

163
00:09:47,898 --> 00:09:51,990
I really am, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry. It's alive.

164
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:54,386
You said it was a security camera.

165
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:56,056
It is.

166
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,534
It's an alive one.

167
00:09:58,897 --> 00:09:59,954
Can you hear me?

168
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:02,310
Are you all right?

169
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,830
- Others are coming.
- Who's coming?

170
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:09,274
Who are the others?

171
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,243
The Library is breached.

172
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:13,870
- Others are coming.
- What others?

173
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,174
<i>Others?</i>

174
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:17,521
<i>What does it mean, "others"?</i>

175
00:10:21,357 --> 00:10:23,603
Excuse me,
what does it mean, "others"?

176
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:26,923
That's barely more than a speak
your weight machine, it can't help you.

177
00:10:27,023 --> 00:10:28,331
So why's it got a face?

178
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:31,653
This flesh aspect was donated
by Mark Chambers

179
00:10:31,753 --> 00:10:33,761
on the occasion of his death.

180
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:36,323
It's a real face?

181
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:38,979
It has been actualised
individually for you

182
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,110
<i>from the many facial aspects
saved to our extensive flesh banks.</i>

183
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:45,430
Please enjoy.

184
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:48,093
It chose me a dead face
it thought I'd like?

185
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:50,664
That statue's got a real
dead person's face on it!

186
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:51,843
<i>It's the 51st century.</i>

187
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,723
That's basically
like donating a park bench.

188
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:56,440
It's donating a face!

189
00:10:57,084 --> 00:10:58,423
No, wait, no!

190
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:01,182
- Oi! Hands!
- The shadow, look.

191
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:04,147
What about it?

192
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,093
Count the shadows.

193
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:10,843
One. There,
I counted it, one shadow.

194
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:11,750
Yeah...

195
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:15,143
But what's casting it?

196
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:28,118
Oh! I'm thick!
Look at me, I'm old and thick!

197
00:11:28,218 --> 00:11:30,324
Head's too full of stuff,
I need a bigger head!

198
00:11:35,117 --> 00:11:36,523
<i>Power must be going.</i>

199
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:39,450
This place runs on fission cells.
They'll outburn the sun.

200
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:42,672
- Then why's it dark?
- It's not dark.

201
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:48,029
That shadow.

202
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:49,787
It's gone.

203
00:11:50,738 --> 00:11:52,221
We need to get back to the TARDIS.

204
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:52,990
Why?

205
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,723
Because that shadow hasn't gone.
It's moved.

206
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:57,413
Reminder,

207
00:11:57,513 --> 00:11:59,963
the Library has been breached,
others are coming.

208
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:01,067
Reminder,

209
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:04,043
<i>the Library has been breached,
others are coming.</i>

210
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,575
<i>Reminder,</i>

211
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:07,066
<i>the Library has been breached...</i>

212
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:29,830
Hello, sweetie.

213
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,898
- Get out.
- Doctor?

214
00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:34,630
All of you, turn around,
get back in your rocket and fly away.

215
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,695
Tell your grandchildren
you came here and lived,

216
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:37,878
they won't believe you.

217
00:12:37,978 --> 00:12:40,537
Pop your helmets, everyone.
We've got breathers.

218
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:43,302
How do you know they're not androids?

219
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:44,786
Cos I've dated androids.

220
00:12:44,886 --> 00:12:47,045
- They're rubbish.
- Who is this?

221
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:50,083
You said we were the only expedition,
I paid for exclusives.

222
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:51,449
I lied, I'm always lying.

223
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:52,625
Bound to be others.

224
00:12:53,145 --> 00:12:55,147
Miss Evangelista,
I want to see the contracts.

225
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:57,656
You came through the north door?
Much damage?

226
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:00,872
Please, just leave. I'm asking you
seriously and properly, just lea...

227
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:02,403
Did you say expedition?

228
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:05,008
My expedition, I funded it.

229
00:13:05,258 --> 00:13:08,683
Oh, you're not, are you?
Tell me you're not archaeologists.

230
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:10,704
Got a problem with archaeologists?

231
00:13:10,804 --> 00:13:13,607
I'm a time traveller.
I point and laugh at archaeologists.

232
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:17,323
Professor River Song, archaeologist.

233
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:18,543
River Song? Lovely name.

234
00:13:18,643 --> 00:13:21,308
As you're leaving, you need
to set up a quarantine beacon.

235
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:22,291
Code-wall the planet,

236
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:26,046
the whole planet. Nobody comes here,
not ever again. No-one living thing.

237
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:28,881
Not here, not ever. Stop right there!
What's your name?

238
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:29,643
Anita.

239
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,243
Anita, stay out of the shadows.

240
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,723
Not a foot, not a finger in the shadows
till you're safely back in your ship.

241
00:13:34,823 --> 00:13:38,923
Stay in the light.
Find a nice, bright spot and just stand.

242
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,950
If you understand me,
look very, very scared.

243
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,950
No, bit more scared than that.

244
00:13:52,638 --> 00:13:54,878
OK, do for now.
You, who are you?

245
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:56,023
- Dave.
- OK, Dave...

246
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:59,208
Oh, well Other Dave,
because that's Proper Dave

247
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:02,011
the pilot, he was the first Dave,
so when we...

248
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:04,858
Other Dave, the way you came,
does it look the same as before?

249
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,748
Yeah. Oh, it's a bit darker.

250
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:07,674
How much darker?

251
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:10,647
Oh, I could see where we came through
just a moment ago. I can't now.

252
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:12,512
Seal the door. Find another way out.

253
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:16,040
We're not looking for a way out.
Miss Evangelista?

254
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,581
I'm Mr Lux's personal... everything.

255
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,571
You need to sign these contracts
agreeing that your experiences

256
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:24,098
inside the Library are...

257
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,537
the intellectual property of
the Felman Lux Corporation.

258
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:30,124
- Right, give it here.
- Yeah, lovely. Thanks.

259
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:35,865
My family built this library.
I have rights.

260
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:39,283
You have a mouth that won't stop.
You think there's danger here?

261
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:41,859
Something came to this library
and killed everything in it,

262
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,363
killed a whole world.

263
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:45,563
- Danger? Could be.
- That was 100 years ago.

264
00:14:45,663 --> 00:14:49,233
The Library's been silent for 100 years.
Whatever came here is long dead.

265
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,503
Bet your life?

266
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:52,550
Always.

267
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:55,099
<i>What do you doing?</i>

268
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,376
<i>He said seal the door.</i>

269
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:59,110
Torch! You're taking orders from him?

270
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,369
Spooky, isn't it?

271
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:11,550
Almost every species in the universe

272
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:14,043
<i>has an irrational fear of the dark.</i>

273
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:17,166
<i>But they're wrong.
Cos it's not irrational.</i>

274
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:21,344
It's Vashta Nerada.

275
00:15:22,057 --> 00:15:23,723
<i>What's Vashta Nerada?</i>

276
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:25,598
It's what's in the dark.

277
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:28,651
It's what's always in the dark.

278
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,258
- Lights! You got lights?
- What for?

279
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:37,037
Form a circle, safe area,
big as you can, lights pointing out.

280
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,740
- Do as he says.
- You're not listening to this man?!

281
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,961
Apparently, I am. Unpack the lights.

282
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:44,643
Other Dave, make sure the door's secure,
then help Anita.

283
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,316
Mr Lux, put your helmet
back on, block the visor.

284
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:50,310
Proper Dave, I want you
to access the library database,

285
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,948
see what you can find about what
happened a hundred years ago.

286
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:55,323
Pretty Boy, you're with me.

287
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:57,123
Step into my office.

288
00:15:57,223 --> 00:16:00,299
Professor Song,
why am I the only one wearing my helmet?

289
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,276
I don't fancy you.

290
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:05,254
Probably, I can help you.

291
00:16:05,986 --> 00:16:07,863
Pretty Boy, with me, I said.

292
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,629
- Oh, I'm Pretty Boy?
- Yes.

293
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:15,430
Ooh, that came out a bit quick!

294
00:16:15,987 --> 00:16:16,995
Pretty?!

295
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,804
Don't let your shadows cross!
Seriously. Don't even let them touch.

296
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:26,052
- Any of them could be infected.
- How can a shadow be infected?

297
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,541
'Scuse me, can I help?

298
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:30,040
- No, we're fine.
- I could just...

299
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,350
you know, hold things.

300
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,990
No, really, we're OK.

301
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:34,332
éOK.

302
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:42,411
Couldn't she help?

303
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:45,536
Trust me, I just spent 4 days on
a ship with that woman. She's...

304
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:48,455
Couldn't tell the difference between
the escape pod and the bathroom.

305
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:50,003
<i>We had to go back for her.</i>

306
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:51,779
Twice.

307
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:06,187
- Thanks.
- For what?

308
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:07,876
The usual. For coming when I call.

309
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,528
That was you?

310
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,680
You're doing a good job,
like you don't know me.

311
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,229
I'm assuming there's a reason.

312
00:17:13,388 --> 00:17:16,676
- A fairly good one, actually.
- OK, shall we do diaries, then?

313
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:18,215
Where are we this time?

314
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:22,013
Going by your face,
I'd say it's early days for you, yeah?

315
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:23,270
So, erm...

316
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:26,176
Crash of the Byzantium...
have we done that yet?

317
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:31,143
Obviously ringing no bells.

318
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:36,048
Right, Picnic at Asgard.

319
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:38,280
Have we done Asgard yet?

320
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:42,203
Obviously not.

321
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:44,750
Blimey, very early days, then. Hoo!

322
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,432
Life with a time traveller
never knew it could be such hard work.

323
00:17:53,817 --> 00:17:54,862
Look at you!

324
00:17:57,502 --> 00:18:00,110
- You're young.
- I'm really not, you know.

325
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:01,950
No, but you are.

326
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:04,516
Your eyes.

327
00:18:06,381 --> 00:18:08,414
<i>You're younger
than I've ever seen you.</i>

328
00:18:10,554 --> 00:18:12,425
You've seen me before, then?

329
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:16,573
Doctor...

330
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:20,108
Please tell me you know who I am?

331
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:23,186
Who are you?

332
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:35,848
Sorry, that was me. Trying to get
through into the security protocols,

333
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,313
I seem to have set something off.

334
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:40,790
- What is that, is that an alarm?
- Doctor.

335
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:43,095
- Doctor, that sounds like...
- It is.

336
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:44,396
It's a phone!

337
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:02,979
Dad!

338
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,249
<i>In a minute.</i>

339
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:14,720
I'm trying to call up the data core,
it's not responding. Just that noise.

340
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,154
- But it's a phone!
- Let me try something.

341
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:24,568
Dad! The phone,
aren't you going to answer it?

342
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:26,914
It's not ringing, sweetie.

343
00:19:40,022 --> 00:19:42,449
OK, doesn't like that,
let's try something else.

344
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,710
'OK, here it comes.'

345
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,369
Hello?

346
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,251
Hello. Are you in my television?

347
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:06,905
Well, no, I'm...

348
00:20:07,562 --> 00:20:10,127
I'm sort of in space.
I was trying to call up

349
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:12,672
the data core of a triple-grid
security processor.

350
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:15,140
Would you like to speak to my dad?

351
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,356
Your dad or your mum,
that would be lovely.

352
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:23,630
I know you! You were in my library.

353
00:20:23,886 --> 00:20:24,687
YOUR library?

354
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:27,483
The Library's never been
on the television before.

355
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,916
What have you done?

356
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:33,952
Ah, I... just rerouted the interface...

357
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:38,088
What happened. Who was that?

358
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:52,274
Keep working on those lights,
we need those lights!

359
00:20:52,374 --> 00:20:54,282
You heard him, people,
let there be light.

360
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,740
Sorry. Youre not allowed to see
inside the book, its against the rules.

361
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:15,217
What rules?

362
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,059
Your rules.

363
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:46,486
What's that?

364
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,213
- I didnt do that, did you do that?
- Not me.

365
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,190
What's CAL?

366
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:17,099
You all right?

367
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:19,751
What's that? What's happening?

368
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:20,990
<i>I don't know.</i>

369
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:25,576
Oh, thanks for... you know...
offering to help with the lights.

370
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:28,442
They don't want me.

371
00:22:28,836 --> 00:22:31,011
They think I'm stupid cos I'm pretty.

372
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:33,955
Course they don't, nobody thinks that.

373
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:35,384
No, they're right though.

374
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:37,150
I'm a moron, me.

375
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:39,657
My dad said I have the IQ of plankton.

376
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:41,091
And I was pleased.

377
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:43,669
See, thats funny.

378
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,017
No, I really was pleased.

379
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:51,601
- Is that funny?
- No, no.

380
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,470
What's causing that?

381
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,135
Is it the little girl?

382
00:22:58,235 --> 00:22:59,860
<i>But who is the little girl?</i>

383
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,668
What's she got to do with this place?

384
00:23:06,504 --> 00:23:09,662
How does the data core work?
What's the principle? What's CAL?

385
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:10,926
Ask Mr Lux.

386
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:13,040
CAL, what is it?

387
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:16,950
Sorry. You didn't sign your
Personal Experience contracts.

388
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:20,640
Mr Lux, right now,

389
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,725
you're in more danger than you've
ever been in your whole life.

390
00:23:23,894 --> 00:23:25,470
And you're protecting a patent?

391
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,256
I'm protecting my family's pride.

392
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:33,230
Well, funny thing, Mr Lux. I don't
want to see everyone in this room dead

393
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:36,638
because some idiot thinks
his pride is more important.

394
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:40,820
Then why don't you sign his contract?

395
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:46,300
I didn't either.
I'm getting worse than you.

396
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:49,771
Ok, ok, ok.

397
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:52,130
Let's start at the beginning.
What happened here?

398
00:23:52,595 --> 00:23:55,475
On the actual day, a hundred years ago,
what physically happened?

399
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,034
<i>There was a message
from the library. Just one.</i>

400
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,299
The lights are going out.

401
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:08,590
Then the computer sealed the planet and
there was nothing for a hundred years.

402
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:13,430
It's taken 3 generations of my family
to decode the seals and get back in.

403
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,715
Excuse me...

404
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:16,072
<i>Not, just now.</i>

405
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:20,602
There was one other thing
in the last message...

406
00:24:20,702 --> 00:24:21,974
That's confidential.

407
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:23,144
I trust this man.

408
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:25,278
With my life, with everything.

409
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:28,637
- You've only just met him.
- No, he's only just met me.

410
00:24:31,175 --> 00:24:33,359
This might be important actually...

411
00:24:33,565 --> 00:24:34,948
In a moment!

412
00:24:37,382 --> 00:24:39,785
This is a data extract
that came with the message.

413
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:43,549
4022 saved. No survivors.

414
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,616
4022, that's the exact number of people
who were in the Library

415
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:50,237
when the planet was sealed.

416
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:54,264
But how can 4022 people have
been saved if there were no survivors?

417
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:56,823
That's what were here to find out.

418
00:24:56,923 --> 00:25:00,452
And so far, what we havent
found, are any bodies.

419
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:21,310
Everybody, careful. Stay in the light.

420
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,925
Keep saying. I don't see the point!

421
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:24,645
- Who screamed?
- Miss Evangelista.

422
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:25,927
Where is she?

423
00:26:27,397 --> 00:26:29,859
Miss Evangelista,
please state your current...

424
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:36,847
Please state your current...

425
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,417
position.

426
00:26:51,373 --> 00:26:52,243
It's her.

427
00:26:56,704 --> 00:26:58,205
It's Miss Evangelista.

428
00:26:58,305 --> 00:27:00,475
<i>We heard her scream a few seconds ago.</i>

429
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:02,537
What could do that to a
person in a few seconds?

430
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:05,055
- It took less than a few seconds.
- What did?

431
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:05,972
<i>Hello?</i>

432
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,151
Erm, I'm sorry everyone
this isn't going to be pleasant.

433
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:13,526
She's ghosting.

434
00:27:13,835 --> 00:27:14,890
She's what?

435
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,940
<i>Hello, excuse me?</i>

436
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:21,393
<i>I'm sorry, hello, excuse me?</i>

437
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:25,185
That's. That's her.
That's Miss Evangelista!

438
00:27:25,405 --> 00:27:28,225
I don't want to sound horrible,
but couldn't we just. You know?

439
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:30,525
This is her last moment... no, we cant.

440
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:32,285
A little respect, thank you.

441
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:35,555
<i>Sorry, where am I? Excuse me?</i>

442
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,655
But that's Miss Evangelista.

443
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:40,950
It's a Data Ghost,
she'll be gone in a moment.

444
00:27:42,145 --> 00:27:45,573
Miss Evangelista,
you're fine, just relax.

445
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:47,315
We'll be with you presently.

446
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:49,229
What's a Data Ghost?

447
00:27:49,925 --> 00:27:51,732
There's a neural relay
in the communicator.

448
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:53,227
Let's you send thought mails.

449
00:27:53,635 --> 00:27:55,780
<i>That's it there, those green lights.</i>

450
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:59,812
<i>Sometimes it can hold an impression
of a living consciousness</i>

451
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,643
<i>for a short time after death.</i>

452
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:03,752
Like an after image.

453
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,184
My grandfather lasted a day.

454
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:10,536
Kept talking about his shoelaces.

455
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,158
She's in there!

456
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:17,723
<i>I can't see, I can't... Where am I?</i>

457
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:20,957
She's just brain waves now.
The pattern won't hold for long.

458
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:25,586
She's conscious! She's thinking.

459
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:27,255
<i>I can't see, I can't...</i>

460
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:29,417
<i>I don't know what I'm thinking.</i>

461
00:28:29,517 --> 00:28:31,642
She's a footprint on the beach.

462
00:28:32,185 --> 00:28:33,594
And the tides coming in.

463
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:35,398
<i>Where is that woman?</i>

464
00:28:36,145 --> 00:28:37,913
<i>The nice woman... is she there?</i>

465
00:28:39,465 --> 00:28:40,447
What woman?

466
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:46,825
She means... I think she means me.

467
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,349
<i>Is she there? The nice woman?</i>

468
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:53,137
Yes, she's here, hang on.

469
00:28:55,452 --> 00:28:57,041
Go ahead. She can hear you.

470
00:28:57,141 --> 00:28:58,426
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

471
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:00,766
Help her.

472
00:29:01,805 --> 00:29:04,316
- She's dead.
- Yeah. Help her.

473
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:08,783
<i>Hello? Is that the nice woman?</i>

474
00:29:09,325 --> 00:29:13,261
Yeah. Hello.
Yeah, I'm I'm... I'm here.

475
00:29:14,095 --> 00:29:15,029
You OK?

476
00:29:16,152 --> 00:29:19,270
<i>What I said before...
about being stupid...</i>

477
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:21,995
<i>don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

478
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,695
Course I won't.
Course I won't tell them.

479
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:27,070
<i>Don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

480
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:31,099
I won't tell them. I said I won't.

481
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:33,764
<i>Don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

482
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:36,998
I'm not going to tell them.

483
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:38,131
Don't tell the others...

484
00:29:38,231 --> 00:29:40,421
She's looping now.
The patterns degrading.

485
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:44,470
<i>I can't think, I... don't know, I...</i>

486
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,443
<i>I...</i>

487
00:29:47,384 --> 00:29:48,057
<i>I...</i>

488
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:49,870
<i>Ice cream.</i>

489
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:51,890
<i>Ice cream.</i>

490
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:53,680
<i>Ice cream.</i>

491
00:29:54,424 --> 00:29:55,419
<i>Ice cream.</i>

492
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:56,875
<i>Ice cream.</i>

493
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:58,957
- Doe's anybody mind if I.
-  Ice cream.

494
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:00,784
<i> Ice cream.</i>

495
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,348
<i> Ice cream.</i>

496
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,390
<i> Ice cream.</i>

497
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:08,745
<i>Was...</i>

498
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:11,191
<i>That was horrible.</i>

499
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:13,669
That was the most horrible
thing I've ever seen.

500
00:30:15,152 --> 00:30:18,805
No. It's just a freak of technology.

501
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:24,937
But whatever did this to her,
whatever killed her...

502
00:30:25,745 --> 00:30:27,295
I'd like a word with that.

503
00:30:27,395 --> 00:30:28,554
I'll introduce you.

504
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:40,699
- I'm going to need a packed lunch.
- Hang on.

505
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:45,823
- What's in that book?
- Spoilers.

506
00:30:46,424 --> 00:30:47,277
Who are you?

507
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:50,665
- Professor River Song, University of...
- To me.

508
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,378
- Who are you to me?
- Again... spoilers.

509
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:58,626
Chicken, and a bit of salad.
Knock yourself out.

510
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:05,896
Right, you lot.
Let's all meet the Vashta Nerada!

511
00:31:11,189 --> 00:31:12,805
Darling, Dr Moon is going now.

512
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:15,455
But hed like a word with
you alone, is that all right?

513
00:31:15,555 --> 00:31:18,342
- Yes, of course, Dr Moon.
- Thank you.

514
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,246
Now,

515
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:25,192
listen.

516
00:31:27,507 --> 00:31:28,671
This is important.

517
00:31:29,628 --> 00:31:33,802
There's the realworld, and
there's the world of nightmares.

518
00:31:33,902 --> 00:31:35,725
That's right, Isn't there?
You understand?

519
00:31:35,825 --> 00:31:37,450
Yes, I know, Dr Moon.

520
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:41,150
What I want you to remember is this...

521
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,469
<i>and I know its hard.</i>

522
00:31:43,698 --> 00:31:48,910
The real world is a lie,
and your nightmares are real.

523
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:51,065
The Library is real.

524
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:55,215
There are people trapped in
there, people who need to be saved.

525
00:31:56,298 --> 00:31:58,024
The shadows are moving again.

526
00:31:58,775 --> 00:32:01,710
<i>Those people are depending on you.</i>

527
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,950
Only you can save them.

528
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:06,191
<i>Only you.</i>

529
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,470
You travel with him, don't you?

530
00:32:17,523 --> 00:32:19,389
The Doctor, you travel with him.

531
00:32:20,046 --> 00:32:20,984
What of it?

532
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,224
<i>Proper Dave, could you move over a bit?</i>

533
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:23,931
Why?

534
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:26,071
Just over there by the water cooler.
Thanks.

535
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:30,929
You know him, don't you?

536
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:32,793
Oh, God, do I know that man.

537
00:32:34,282 --> 00:32:36,303
<i>We go way back, that man and me.</i>

538
00:32:37,113 --> 00:32:38,583
<i>Just not this far back.</i>

539
00:32:38,796 --> 00:32:39,950
<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

540
00:32:40,945 --> 00:32:42,372
He hasn't met me yet.

541
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:48,128
I sent him a message but
it went wrong, it arrived too early.

542
00:32:49,061 --> 00:32:51,432
This is the Doctor in the
days before he knew me.

543
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:58,035
And he looks at me,
and he looks right through me.

544
00:32:58,135 --> 00:33:00,327
And it shouldn't kill me, but it does.

545
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:03,593
What are you talking about?
Are you just talking rubbish?

546
00:33:03,693 --> 00:33:05,455
Do you know him or don't you?

547
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:08,807
- Donna, quiet, I'm working!
- Sorry!

548
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:11,628
Donna? You're Donna? Donna Noble?

549
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:13,643
Yeah, why?

550
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:17,050
I do know the Doctor.

551
00:33:17,805 --> 00:33:19,096
But in the future.

552
00:33:19,685 --> 00:33:21,342
His personal future.

553
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:23,745
So why don't you know me?

554
00:33:24,555 --> 00:33:25,847
Where am I in the future?

555
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,599
<i>OK! We've got a live one.</i>

556
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:36,148
That's not darkness down those
tunnels, this is not a shadow.

557
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,110
It's a swarm.

558
00:33:38,873 --> 00:33:40,325
A man-eating swarm.

559
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:47,291
The piranhas of the air,
the Vashta Nerada.

560
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:50,407
Literally the shadows
that melt the flesh.

561
00:33:51,076 --> 00:33:53,867
Most planets have them,
but usually in small clusters.

562
00:33:54,254 --> 00:33:57,515
I've never seen an infestation
on this scale, or this aggressive.

563
00:33:57,615 --> 00:33:59,500
What d'you mean, most planets?
Not Earth?

564
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,578
Mmmm, Earth, and a billion other worlds.

565
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:04,749
Where there's meat,
there's Vashta Nerada.

566
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:06,840
<i>You can see them sometimes, if you look.</i>

567
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:09,185
The dust in sunbeams.

568
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,302
If they were on Earth, we'd know.

569
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:15,700
Nah, normally they live on road kill.

570
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:18,233
<i>But sometimes people go missing.</i>

571
00:34:19,555 --> 00:34:21,837
Not everyone comes back out of the dark.

572
00:34:22,188 --> 00:34:23,245
Every shadow?

573
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:26,289
No. But any shadow.

574
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:28,066
So what do we do?

575
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:30,193
Daleks: aim for the eyestalk.

576
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:32,189
Sontarans: back of the neck.

577
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:37,465
Vashta Nerada: Run! Just run.

578
00:34:37,635 --> 00:34:38,729
Run where?

579
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:41,425
This is an index point.
There must be an exit teleport.

580
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:43,785
Don't look at me, I haven't
memorised the schematics!

581
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:44,816
Doctor,

582
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,548
little shop! They always make you
go through it on the way out

583
00:34:47,648 --> 00:34:49,206
so they can sell you stuff.

584
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:52,704
You're right! Brilliant!
That's why I like the little shop!

585
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:53,642
OK, let's move it.

586
00:34:53,742 --> 00:34:56,665
<i>Actually, Proper Dave, could you
stay where you are for a moment?</i>

587
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:57,565
Why?

588
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:02,286
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

589
00:35:05,101 --> 00:35:06,661
But you've got two shadows.

590
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,763
<i>It's how they hunt, they latch on
to a food source and keep it fresh.</i>

591
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:21,611
- What do I do?
- You stay absolutely still.

592
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:24,150
Like there's a wasp in the room,
a million wasps.

593
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,191
- We're not leaving you, Dave.
- Of course not.

594
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,249
Where's your helmet?
Don't point, tell me.

595
00:35:28,885 --> 00:35:30,623
On the floor, by my bag.

596
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,740
Don't cross his shadow!

597
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,119
Thanks.

598
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:44,495
Now, the rest of you,
helmets back on and sealed up.

599
00:35:44,595 --> 00:35:47,227
- We'll need everything we've got.
- We haven't any helmets.

600
00:35:47,327 --> 00:35:49,656
- Yeah, we're safe anyway.
- How are we safe?

601
00:35:49,862 --> 00:35:51,370
That was a clever lie to shut you up.

602
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,375
Professor, anything
I can do with the suit?

603
00:35:53,475 --> 00:35:57,070
What good are suits? Miss Evanglista
was wearing one, there was nothing left.

604
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,638
We can increase the mesh-density
dial it up 400%. Make it a tougher meal.

605
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:01,357
<i>OK.</i>

606
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,993
- 800%! Pass it on.
- Gotcha!

607
00:36:06,256 --> 00:36:08,189
- What's that?
- It's a screwdriver.

608
00:36:09,617 --> 00:36:12,151
- It's sonic.
- Yeah, I know. Snap!

609
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:20,633
With me, come on!

610
00:36:25,205 --> 00:36:27,185
Are we shopping?
Is it a good time to shop?

611
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,586
No talking, just moving!
Stand up in the middle!

612
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:31,181
Its a teleport, stand in the middle.

613
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:32,971
Can't send the others,
TARDIS won't recognise them.

614
00:36:33,071 --> 00:36:35,230
- What you doing?
- You don't have suit, not safe!

615
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:38,026
You don't have a suit, you're
in just as much danger as I am...

616
00:36:38,126 --> 00:36:39,616
Donna! Let me explain.

617
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:42,830
- Oh, that's how you do it!
- Doctor!

618
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:56,857
Where did it go?

619
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:00,624
It's just gone. I looked round,
one shadow. See.

620
00:37:00,724 --> 00:37:02,515
Does that mean we can leave?

621
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:05,465
I don't know why we're still here.
We can leave him, can't we?

622
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:08,315
- I mean, no offence.
- Shut up, Mr Lux.

623
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:11,175
Did you feel anything?
Like an energy transfer?

624
00:37:11,275 --> 00:37:13,579
No, no, but, look, it's gone.

625
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,675
Stop there, stop moving.

626
00:37:16,063 --> 00:37:18,190
They're never just gone.
And they never give up.

627
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:23,629
Well, this ones benign.

628
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,972
<i>Hey, who turned out the lights?</i>

629
00:37:26,585 --> 00:37:27,525
No-one, they're fine.

630
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:29,557
<i>No, seriously, turn them back on!</i>

631
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:31,139
They are on.

632
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:33,578
<i>I can't see a ruddy thing.</i>

633
00:37:33,953 --> 00:37:36,018
Dave, turn round.

634
00:37:36,118 --> 00:37:38,350
What's going on? Why can't I see?

635
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:41,011
Is the power gone, are we safe here?

636
00:37:41,111 --> 00:37:43,675
Dave, I want you to stay still,
absolutely still.

637
00:37:44,438 --> 00:37:46,997
Dave, Dave? Dave,
can you hear me, are you all right?

638
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:48,555
Talk to me, Dave.

639
00:37:49,912 --> 00:37:52,715
I'm fine, I'm OK, I'm... fine.

640
00:37:52,815 --> 00:37:55,315
I want you to stay still,
absolutely still.

641
00:37:55,415 --> 00:37:58,555
I'm fine, I'm OK, I'm... fine.

642
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:03,573
I can't. Why can't I? I...

643
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:08,677
I can't. Why can't I? I...

644
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:13,238
I can't. Why can't I?

645
00:38:14,646 --> 00:38:15,071
I...

646
00:38:15,345 --> 00:38:16,965
He's gone. He's ghosting.

647
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:19,125
Then why is he still standing?

648
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,721
Who turned out the lights?

649
00:38:23,404 --> 00:38:25,005
<i>Who turned out the lights?</i>

650
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:26,232
Doctor, don't!

651
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:27,965
Dave, can you hear me?

652
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,143
Who turned out the lights?

653
00:38:33,872 --> 00:38:35,380
<i>Who turned out the lights?</i>

654
00:38:36,337 --> 00:38:38,196
- Who turned out the lights?
- Scuse me!

655
00:38:40,112 --> 00:38:42,108
Back from it, get back, right back!

656
00:38:47,902 --> 00:38:50,865
- Doesn't move very fast does it?
- It's a swarm in a suit.

657
00:38:51,023 --> 00:38:52,352
But it's learning.

658
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,205
What do we do? Where do we go?

659
00:38:59,305 --> 00:39:00,950
See that wall behind you?

660
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:02,926
DUCK!

661
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,523
Squareness gun!

662
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:08,665
Everybody out. Go, go, go!

663
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,415
Move it, move, move!

664
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:12,905
Move it, move, move!

665
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:16,140
- You said not every shadow.
- But any shadow!

666
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:20,965
Who turned out the lights?

667
00:39:21,065 --> 00:39:21,790
Run!

668
00:39:36,325 --> 00:39:37,891
Sweetie, dinner's ready.

669
00:39:39,524 --> 00:39:41,355
Donna Noble has been saved.

670
00:39:43,444 --> 00:39:44,295
Sweetie?

671
00:40:07,422 --> 00:40:08,924
<i>Trying to boost the power.</i>

672
00:40:09,195 --> 00:40:11,255
Light doesn't stop them,
but it slows them down.

673
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:14,933
So, what's the plan? Do we have a plan?

674
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,129
Your screwdriver...

675
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:23,305
- Looks exactly like mine.
- Yeah. You gave it to me.

676
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:25,334
I don't give my screwdriver to anyone.

677
00:40:25,434 --> 00:40:26,579
I'm not anyone.

678
00:40:27,404 --> 00:40:29,951
- Who are you?
- What's the plan?

679
00:40:31,327 --> 00:40:32,950
I teleported Donna back to the TARDIS.

680
00:40:33,293 --> 00:40:36,127
If we don't get back in five hours,
emergency program one activates.

681
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:37,345
Take her home.

682
00:40:37,523 --> 00:40:39,637
- We need to get a shift on.
- She's not there.

683
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,941
I should've received a signal,

684
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:44,190
console signals me if
there's a teleport breach.

685
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,847
Maybe the co-ordinates slipped.
The equipment here's aged.

686
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:48,930
Donna Noble.

687
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,945
There's a Donna Noble in this library,
do you have the software to locate her?

688
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:55,638
Donna Noble has left the Library.

689
00:40:56,226 --> 00:40:59,625
- Donna Noble has been saved.
- Donna!

690
00:41:00,481 --> 00:41:02,645
<i>Donna Noble has left the Library.</i>

691
00:41:03,221 --> 00:41:04,654
<i>Donna Noble has been saved.</i>

692
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,600
How can it be Donna?
