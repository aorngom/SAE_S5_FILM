1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,270
Deep South

2
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,630
Exciting news! The pet license
I requisitioned for Nibbler is here.

3
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,150
That's sweet.
I didn't know you cared about Nibbler.

4
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,069
Dream on! I want to put him in a sack,
toss the sack in the river...

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,838
...and hurl the river into space.

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,716
But I like filling out requisitions.
And these were some doozies!

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,754
Great Jah's dreadlocks!
There's been a mix-up.

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,509
This isn't the pet license,
it's a fishing license!

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,313
And it's mandatory!

10
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,910
The exact center
of the Atlantic Ocean!

11
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,953
Seems the logical place
for fish to congregate!

12
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,118
- We're in international waters?
- Indeed so.

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,156
Falcon, this is Blue Raven.
The goose has nested.

14
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,630
Guess what you're accessories to?

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,873
The sun, the sea air, good friends.

16
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,311
Leela's right. Fishing blows.
Let's make it interesting.

17
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,873
- Why not?
- Yeah, cool!

18
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,514
Everybody kick in 5 bucks!

19
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,875
- Wasn't that interesting?
- Bender!

20
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,152
This contest is as good as over.
I once caught a fish this big.

21
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,477
Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish
this big.

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,756
You're both out of your league!

23
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,191
Because you're looking at a woman
who owns a harpoon.

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,396
Harpoon my ass!

25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,868
Okay!

26
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,514
Let's see now. Which bait to use?

27
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,035
Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?

28
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,555
Excuse me, if I might be so bold.

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,628
I am willing to offer my services
as a bait critic.

30
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,118
These sardines, for example,
are bland and tasteless.

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,711
And these dry, stringy
night crawlers, though juicy...

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,315
Very, very juicy.

33
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,959
I don't believe this!
It's eating my bait!

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,509
Beat it, you mooching crawdad!

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,197
Hey, Fry.
Check out my laser-guided fishing rod.

36
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,396
<i>Q</i>uiet, you'll scare away the fish.

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,909
Fine. I'll head to the other side.

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,674
Good luck fishing on this side!

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,153
I can hit a fish
between the eyes from 20 yards.

40
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,789
- Yeah? I can hit a shrimp!
- A shrimp?

41
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,076
I find it a bit hard to believe that...

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,198
Gather around, chumps!
I got the winner.

43
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,398
So, this is where you
shop for your boots!

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,719
A couple more of those and you'll have
yourself a fish stick.

45
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,430
A fish this fine belongs
in a fish nugget-style chunklet.

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,911
It's bigger than anything
you've caught.

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,790
My small intestine.

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,593
Bingo!

49
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,832
Whatever it is, it's 20 times
heavier than a boot.

50
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,430
You'll never catch anything with
that primitive technology.

51
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,069
What you need is this fish pheromone.

52
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,909
The most potent aphrodisiac
known to fishkind.

53
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,078
I am so into you!

54
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,036
Oh, my!

55
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,319
Bender, I just caught a fish this big!

56
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,272
<i>Q</i>uit exaggerating!

57
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,478
Screw this!

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,071
If I'm not gonna catch a fish,
I might as well not catch a big fish.

59
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,233
There. Like most problems,
this one can be solved with bending.

60
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,874
Bender, be careful!

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,516
That's the ship's diamond
filament tether. It's unbreakable.

62
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,952
- Then, why do I have to be careful?
- It belonged to my grandmother.

63
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,959
My Manwich!

64
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,189
Wake up! I've got something.
And this time, it's alive!

65
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,035
Dr. Zoidberg, since when
do you even wear boots?

66
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,317
I wasn't wearing it. I was eating it!

67
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,193
Come on, let's go home.

68
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,355
Sunburn! My fabulous body!
It's ruined!

69
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,318
What happened to my parasol?

70
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,875
It wasn't here
when I took your umbrella.

71
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,357
- I put sun block on you.
- It didn't work.

72
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,954
Come on, Bender.
Pull in your line and let's go.

73
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,432
Hey! I'm snagged!

74
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,752
It's not snagged. The mechano-man has
caught something!

75
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,911
Sweet zombie Jesus! It's huge!

76
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,349
It's coming up!

77
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,836
- That's big!
- A colossal mouth bass!

78
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,993
It's diving!

79
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,075
It's pulling us under! Into the ship!

80
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,759
Wait, I'll save us...

81
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,872
...by cutting the unbreakable diamond
filament.

82
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,995
Well, at least I'll die
with my friends. Hello?

83
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,913
My Speedos!

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,797
Depth at 4500 feet!

85
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,189
Forty-eight hundred!

86
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,555
Fifty hundred!

87
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,994
Five thousand feet!

88
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,949
Dear Lord! That's over
150 atmospheres of pressure!

89
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,111
How many atmospheres
can the ship withstand?

90
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,199
It's a spaceship, so I'd say
anywhere between zero and one.

91
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,919
What's that?
Is someone bending girders?

92
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,871
We'll be crushed if we don't equalize.

93
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,115
How do we do that?

94
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,635
That should do it.

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,194
We're gonna die!

96
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,510
Wait! I'll be back in a minute.

97
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,517
- You did it, Fry!
- Did what?

98
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,153
People, it's far, far worse
than we thought.

99
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,193
My fish got away!

100
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,634
Good as new!

101
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,510
Except we're 3 miles down below,
have no food, and the ship won't work.

102
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,191
Tempers are wearing thin. Let's hope
some robot doesn't kill everybody!

103
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,716
Don't panic. There are rules
for situations like this.

104
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,754
The first order of business is lunch.

105
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,714
I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg.
I mean lobster Newburg.

106
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,558
I mean Dr. Zoidberg.

107
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,597
Okay, everyone calm down.

108
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,717
The professor and I
will work on the ship.

109
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,832
Bender, Zoidberg: Since you can
survive under water...

110
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,399
...you'll go out and find food.

111
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,551
I better go too.
They don't know what I like.

112
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,594
No! The pressure will crush you like
a snake under a sugarcane truck!

113
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,909
Not necessarily.

114
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,591
This is a chance for Fry to test
my experimental anti-pressure pill.

115
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,519
I can't swallow that!

116
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,036
Well, then, good news!
It's a suppository.

117
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,838
How are you doing there?

118
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,992
Glad to hear it!

119
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,073
Ah, yeah.

120
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,717
Yum, yum, yum.

121
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,550
Look at me! I'm Dr. Zoidberg,
homeowner!

122
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,516
Careful, Fry. I think that flag
may be poisonous.

123
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,792
Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us
some hearty grub!

124
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,558
The laws of science
be a harsh mistress.

125
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,031
Robot, old buddy,
could you help me move a couch?

126
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,514
Okay. But I'm not
carrying it upstairs.

127
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,833
What is it, Fry?

128
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,435
You want lemonade?
You saw a parade?

129
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,591
Your student loans have been repaid?

130
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,476
Then how about lending your old pal
Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr. Millionaire.

131
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,278
Fry, swallow your food, then talk.

132
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,474
A mermaid!

133
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,877
You think you saw a mermaid?

134
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,640
No, I did see a mermaid.
She was wearing a tube top...

135
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,077
...and she had a scaly tail,
and hair extensions.

136
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,111
- Yeah, right!
- Sure she did!

137
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,437
You are simply hallucinating,
you moron!

138
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,312
What's so far-fetched about mermaids?

139
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,671
There's all sorts of weird
sea creatures here in the future.

140
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,359
Like Dr. Zoidberg!

141
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,275
Fry is suffering from ocean madness.

142
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,631
Every time something good happens
to me, you say it's madness.

143
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,110
Or I'm drunk. Or I ate too much candy.

144
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,118
Well, I saw a real mermaid!

145
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,591
And I wish for once my friends had
the decency to believe me!

146
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,637
Ocean madness.

147
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,678
He may have ocean madness, but that's
no excuse for ocean rudeness.

148
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,558
Ocean madness. Yeah, right!
It's always something, ain't it?

149
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,953
It's her! Bender, wake up!
She's here, wake up!

150
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,790
Oxygen!

151
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,358
Here you go, darling.

152
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,036
Hey! I can breathe and talk,
just like a fish!

153
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,912
You speak fish?

154
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,559
- What?
- I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious.

155
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,593
- Hi, my name is Umbriel.
- I'm Fry.

156
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,957
- So, am I gonna drown?
- Of course not!

157
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,556
Just stay calm and let the gentle
currents relax your every muscle.

158
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,999
Did it just get warmer?

159
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,112
I can't believe you're real.
I like your tail.

160
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,188
You're sweet! I like those wiggly
doodads coming out of your hips.

161
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,113
Thanks. They're called pants.

162
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,913
This here is a volcanic vent.

163
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,789
- The water is over 4000 degrees.
- No kidding.

164
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,311
Did it just get colder?

165
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,350
Tell me more about that bizarre landie
world you come from.

166
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,953
Is there water there too?

167
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,919
Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky.

168
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,231
And sometimes it doesn't.

169
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,119
Mr. Fry, you do go on!

170
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,636
What's best about you is
you find me fascinating.

171
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,718
Even if I'm not claiming to be
a jewel thief or lion-tamer.

172
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,520
Lions? There are sea lions
on the land?

173
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,996
Yep! We call them land sea lions.
I tame them.

174
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,869
I've almost reconfigured
the ship's propulsion system.

175
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,118
We can leave as soon
as the papier-mâché is dry.

176
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,834
- Where's Fry?
- I didn't kill him. You?

177
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,632
No, I've been busy.

178
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,396
He must've gone looking for that
mermaid. Poor demented honky.

179
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,318
It's ocean madness, all right.

180
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,069
Sailors call it aqua dementia.
The deep down crazies.

181
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,714
The wet willies. The screaming moist.

182
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,957
We'll form a search party.
We'll need oxygen.

183
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,918
I got it covered.

184
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,114
In the event of emergency, my ass
can be used as flotation device.

185
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,118
You've all taken your
pressure pills, right?

186
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,431
Yes! Stop asking!

187
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,391
I've got a scent, over here where
the water gets warmer.

188
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,115
This way!

189
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,798
Bend me!

190
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,553
Dude! An ancient sunken city!

191
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,354
Could it possibly be?
Are the old legends true?

192
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,030
It is! It's the fabled lost
city of Atlanta!

193
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,629
Howdy, y'all!

194
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,190
Welcome to Atlanta!
Folks here call me "The Colonel. "

195
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,035
Have some breathers,
courtesy of our chamber of commerce.

196
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,919
This is uncomfortable and humiliating!

197
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,113
Now, if they could put it
in the form of a suppository...

198
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,750
Y'all enjoy your stay!
Tourism's our main source of income.

199
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,590
So see the sights, spend some money!
Please don't leave!

200
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,190
Fry, I knew you were alive!
I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes.

201
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,550
The most amazing thing happened!

202
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,957
It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy
Kreme. Plus there's mermaids.

203
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,750
I'd like you to meet
my daughter, Umbriel.

204
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,030
Umbriel, these are some Yankees.

205
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,797
So Atlanta was an American city
in your time?

206
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,918
I think it was just an airport.
They had a place to buy nuts.

207
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,590
No! Ancient Atlanta was
more than just a Delta hub!

208
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,799
It was a vibrant metropolis.
The equal of Paris or New York.

209
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,956
That's right, honey. Whatever you say.

210
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,077
Loot at these fabulous ruins.

211
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,714
Turner Field...

212
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,632
...the Coca-Cola bottling plant...

213
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,914
...the airport.

214
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,116
How could a city with such a fabulous
airport end up underwater?

215
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,513
That's a story only to be told
in the chamber of commerce video...

216
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,399
...narrated by folk-rock
troubadour Donovan.

217
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,914
<i>Atlanta was a city, landlocked.</i>

218
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,239
<i>Hundreds of miles from the area</i>
<i>we now call the Atlantic Ocean.</i>

219
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,597
<i>Yet so desperate the city's desire</i>
<i>for tourism...</i>

220
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,157
<i>... that they moved offshore,</i>
<i>became an island and bigger Delta hub.</i>

221
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,756
<i>Until the city overdeveloped,</i>
<i>and it started to sink.</i>

222
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,432
<i>Knowing their fate,</i>
<i>the</i> q<i>uality people ran away.</i>

223
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,757
<i>Ted Turner, Hank Aaron,</i>
J<i>eff Foxworthy...</i>

224
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,116
<i>... the guy who invented</i>
<i>Coca-Cola...</i>

225
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,353
<i>... the magician, and the other</i>
<i>so-called gods of our legends.</i>

226
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,431
<i>Though gods they were.</i>

227
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,511
<i>Also</i> J<i>ane Fonda was there.</i>

228
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,116
<i>The others remained behind...</i>

229
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,515
<i>... on their porches with rifles...</i>

230
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,154
<i>... and one day evolve</i>
<i>into mermaids...</i>

231
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,831
<i>... and sing and dance and</i>
<i>ring in the new.</i>

232
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,798
Hail Atlanta!

233
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,919
The magician?

234
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,437
Wouldn't it take millions of years
to evolve into mermaids?

235
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,150
Normally, yes. But the caffeine
really sped things up.

236
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,397
That stuff's wonderful!

237
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,519
When Umbriel brought home this
carpetbagger, I was against it.

238
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,195
But damn if old legs here
ain't grown on me!

239
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,590
Shucks, Colonel!

240
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,192
It's very nice here, but we should go.
I miss me wife and oxygen.

241
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,989
We all miss our loved ones and gases.
Come on, Fry.

242
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,151
Wait, I'm not going with you.

243
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,308
What about us?
What about your life on the surface?

244
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,993
You don't belong here.

245
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,557
She's right. Sure they got the Braves,
but it's a third-rate symphony.

246
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,799
Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac!
Be reasonable!

247
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,315
Do you realize if you
stay at this depth...

248
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,949
...you'll permanently adapt
to the pressure?

249
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,037
Realize it?
I don't even understand it!

250
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,397
You'll never be able to return
to the surface.

251
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,558
I don't care.
I've got everything I want right here.

252
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,795
I'm bored! Let's go!

253
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,511
You know, Fry, I've got a little place
just outside town.

254
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,119
You could visit, maybe?

255
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,388
Sorry, I'm trying to join
the country club.

256
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,392
I'll miss you!

257
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,357
Y'all come back now, you hear?

258
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,477
Let's go, damn it, let's go!

259
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,633
I guess this is goodbye
for me as well.

260
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,399
- Whatever.
- Later!

261
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,829
My home! It burned down!

262
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,439
- How did this happen?
- That's a good question!

263
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,915
So that's where I left my cigar.

264
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,714
That just raises further questions!

265
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,789
These last 24 hours have been
the happiest days of my life.

266
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,517
I want you to make a mer-woman
out of mer-me.

267
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,508
Mercy! I do believe I'm
getting the vapors.

268
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,154
What the hell is that?

269
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,153
I'm a little confused too!

270
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,153
How do I... you know,
with the tail and all?

271
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,033
I'm not your first, am I?

272
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,558
I lay my eggs, then I leave
and you release your fertilizer.

273
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,480
Why couldn't she be
the other kind of mermaid...

274
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,319
...with fish part on top,
and lady part on bottom?

275
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,433
Now who's gonna escort me
to the Debutante Ball?

276
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,831
What about that rich
young dugong from Macon?

277
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,834
The engine modifications are complete.

278
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,354
Prepare for launch.

279
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,837
Wait! Wait for me!
Don't leave me here!

280
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,870
And so, in honor of his
record-breaking catch...

281
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,108
...I'm proud to award Bender
this check for $ 1000!

282
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,433
- It's you!
- Yeah, buddy!

283
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,033
My Manwich!

284
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,795
- Are you all right? What happened?
- What about Umbriel?

285
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,276
Turns out I loved her,
but I wasn't in love with her.

286
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,708
Trouble in bed.

287
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,195
It's great to have you back, buddy!

288
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,914
Wait!
This is no record!

289
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,398
Give me back that check!
I'm giving it to some giant orphans.

290
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,632
Bender, you're hurting me!

291
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,153
Hey, I'm trying to sleep in here!

292
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,719
