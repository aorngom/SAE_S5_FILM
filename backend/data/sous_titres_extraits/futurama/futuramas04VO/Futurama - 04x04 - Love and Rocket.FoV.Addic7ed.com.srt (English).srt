1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Futurama [4x04] - Love And Rocket - CiWaN

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You are one narrow-Minded
spaceship, Planet Express ship!

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Whoa. Why should my tax money
pay for art I find offensive?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Would you censor the Venus De Venus
just because you can see her spewers?

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's filthy! Why not create a
national endowment for strip clubs...

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
While we're at it?
Why not, indeed!

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Bender, ship!

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Stop bickering or I’m gonna come back
there and change your opinions manually!

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Fine! I’ll be in my quarters,
appreciating controversial artworks.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oops. Sorry.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That ship is so white bread.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
People. It's Valentine’s Day next week.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So your beloved company has
gotten you all new uniforms.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Cool!
Clothing. Delicious clothing.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We'll need to look our
best to get the account...

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Of our new potential
customer, Romanticorp.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Romanticorp? Are they a corporation
that makes romantic stuff?

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Very good, Amy.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Everyone suit up. We're off to
the most romantic city on Earth.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Remember, we've got
to show these people...

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We're not bitter husks
of human beings...

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Who long ago abandoned hope of
finding love in this lifetime.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Leela, you'll have to do some acting.
Check.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Welcome. Oh, I’m just so excited.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I’m Sheldon, and this is my
chief financial officer, Gwen.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
For 30 years, we've shared the
adventure of managing Romanticorp.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Not to mention the
adventure of marriage.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, you have got to be kidding.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Ow! I mean, that's so sweet.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I mean, that's sho shweet.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You know, romance is an
important part of our work too.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Right, everyone?
Yeah. Sure.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Do any of you collect Lovey Bears?
I do. Kif's given me dozens.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Is it true what the ad says?

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That you kiss them together out
of blanket cloth and magic buttons?

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No.
It's actually cheaper...

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
To genetically engineer real ones.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
They frolic in the Lovey Forest
until their first birthday.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Then we choose the
cuddly-Uddliest ones...

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And stuff them full of
fire-Retardant love fluff.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So cute!

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Knowing which pickup lines
fizzle and which ones sizzle...

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Keeps us on the cutting edge
of flirtation technology.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is heaven missing an angel?
Because you've got nice cans.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
My two favorite things are
commitment and changing myself.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Does that dummy have a brother?

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And now, friends and lovers,
we come to the heart of our operation.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Pun definitely intended.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Impressive.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
My family has been making
these hearts since the 1900s.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Tastes may have changed,
but our secret recipe sure hasn't.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Letter's like U and R can mean
words like "you" and "are."

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Here, Leela. "U- R- 2 cute."
Perhaps. What's your point?

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I’ve never been able to put
into words how I feel about you.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But somewhere among these trillions of
hearts, those words must already exist.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And I’m gonna find them.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh...

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So do we have the contract?

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
With that big, new
Romanticorp contract...

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I’ve been able to make those
government-Mandated upgrades...

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You've all been suing me about.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Look. You taped up the cracks
in the dark matter reactor.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And you got a cage for the lion.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Who's been messing with the radio?
This isn't alternative rock.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's college rock.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It must have been the new, improved
ship's personality software I installed.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah, it was me. It's a cute song.
Listen, ship!

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No one changes my stations!
I hope you have a good mechanic!

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It even comes with an adjustable voice.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We each get one of the four buttons.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Remember, Bender? That was the deal.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What? Did you just say:

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If you don't like the stations,
play with my buttons...

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Till you find something we both enjoy.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh, gosh. That came out all wrong.
Too late, baby. You said it.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So, what will it be? My place? Or you?

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Before we deliver these hearts...

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I’m gonna find one that
sums up my feelings for you.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
"I love you." Too conventional.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
"You're my man." Oh, so close.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I’m not impressed by a guy's message,
Fry. I’m impressed by the guy. Or not.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What was that?
Maybe we hit a space cow.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Cootchie- Cootchie.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Stop it.
You're mussing up my trajectory.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You know you love it, sugar engine.
No!

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Bender! What's going on in here?

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Planet Express ship! Cover your shame!

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh. It's not what it looks like. Bender
was just helping me zip up my turbine.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Wow, Bender.
Are you and the ship an item?

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I mean, I know you're both items,
but how can you date a ship, anyway?

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It'd be like me dating a really
fat lady and living inside her.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And she'd be all like:

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Fry, in order for me to get
busy at maximum efficiency...

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I need a girl with a big 400-Ton booty.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Bender, dating your coworker and
primary mode of transportation...

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Is immoral, illogical and a violation
of interstellar shipping statute 437- B.

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's what makes it so nasty.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Still, given the chance,
I’d give in to urges far more shocking.

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Well, I’m sick of her.
The ship? But you just started dating.

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
With my mighty robot powers,
I can get sick of things...

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Much quicker than you humans.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Just remember, we all
still have to work together.

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So try and let her down easy.
In due time, Leela.

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But for now, I’ll just resume
dating cheap floozies on the side.

105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You have much to teach us.

106
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Doesn't it bother you a little...

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
To be taking advantage
of your girlfriends trust?

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, wait, you're serious.
Let me laugh even harder.

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What's it like being a lawyer
for the mayor's office...

110
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And also the worlds
strongest millionaire?

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, baby, for starters,
you need to be honest all the time.

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Good evening, Bender.

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And to your lady friends,
may I say, “Bam."

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You know Elzar?

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hm.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Huh?

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Planet Express ship? Is that you?
Oh, hi, Fry.

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Is Bender home?
No. I think he's at his parents.

119
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, I see. He didn't fly there
in another spaceship, did he?

120
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Bender? No. He's an old- Fashioned,
one- Spaceship robot.

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Look, I’ll tell him you stopped by, okay?
Okay.

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, hi, Fry. Is he home now?

123
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Of all the zoos we've been to
today, I like this one the best.

124
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Bender, which is your
favorite nocturnal rat?

125
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
They're all pretty unimpressive.
Oh, honey, look! The tapirs!

126
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It says here the babies lose their
pajama-Like coat after their first year.

127
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Isn’t that interesting, honey?
Yep. Mind- Numbingly interesting. Whoa.

128
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Bender! Are you looking at other women?

129
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No, baby, never!

130
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Bender! Don't lie!

131
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I saw you at Elzar's with
those two ladies of the evening!

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Explain that!
Okay. I like a challenge.

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No. No. I got it.

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I’m going to be completely honest
with you, Planet Express ship.

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Those women you saw me
with were my accountants.

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Your accountants?

137
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I would dearly love to believe
that were true. So I do.

138
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Phew.

139
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I’m gonna go home and
get dinner started.

140
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Who were you talking to?
No one, baby.

141
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender.
I love you--

142
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Planet Express ship, is something wrong?

143
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh, It's Bender.
He's acting so strange lately.

144
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Do you think he's gonna
ask me to marry him?

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Uh, no.

146
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Somebody knows something
she's not telling.

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Look. I’m not saying
Bender's not great...

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But have you ever considered that
maybe he's, you know, not that great?

149
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You're just jealous.

150
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
No one loves you, because
you're tiny and made of meat.

151
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Could you maybe pay a little
more attention to these asteroids?

152
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Sorry, Capt. Leela.

153
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I guess I’m just having
one of those manic Mondays.

154
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This is ancient Earth's
most foolish program.

155
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Why does Ross, the largest friend,
not simply eat the other five?

156
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps.

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Exalted leaders, the Earth
messengers have arrived...

158
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Bearing a peace offering from
their weak and fearful government.

159
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh, very well. This is a
Joey-Heavy episode anyway.

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I am Lrrr, of the
planet Omicron Persei 8.

161
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
"Esteemed potentates
of Omicron Persei 8.

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Please accept these 20 billion candy
hearts as proof that Earth loves you...

163
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
This much."

164
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Ugh!

165
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
These candies are chalky and unpleasant!

166
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And what is this emotion
you humans call "wuv"?

167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Surely it says "love."
No."Wuv," with an Earth W!

168
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Behold!

169
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This concept of "wuv"
confuses and infuriates us!

170
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Incoming torpedoes.
Shields at maximum yarnell.

171
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Steady, Planet Express ship.

172
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Focus on diverting all
power to the scram jets.

173
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Look, Planet Express ship,
this might not be the best time...

174
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But, well, I really
like you and whatever...

175
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But I think we should just be friends.

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No!

177
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So we're cool?

178
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, it was a spectacular battle.

179
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But there doesn't seem to
be any permanent damage.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No damage? What about my feelings?

181
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Aw. Calm down. I’m sure Bender is
taking this just as hard as you are.

182
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Bender is great...
Oh, Bender is great...

183
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You coulïve picked a better
time to dump the ship.

184
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The moment seemed right.

185
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Call me old- Fashioned, but I like a dump
to be as memorable as it is devastating.

186
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I know. I know. Look, ship.

187
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If I learned one thing from my breakup
with Shawn that was totally mutual...

188
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's that happiness can
only come from within you.

189
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But Bender is within me!

190
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
There must be some way
to make him love me again.

191
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Trust me. You can't change men...

192
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Any more than you can change
the laws of time and space.

193
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That is so true.

194
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I may not be able to change
the laws of time and space

195
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But I know something that can.

196
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Sweetie? You see that giant
quasar we're heading into?

197
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You might want to scooch
a few parsecs to the left.

198
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I’m afraid I can't do that, Leela.

199
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What's happening? Space cow?

200
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The ship's just taking the
breakup a little hard. She's nuts!

201
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
In a few moments,
the power of 10 billion black holes...

202
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Will smooch Bender and me together...

203
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Into a beautiful eternal
quantum singularity.

204
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You don't need to kill us,
Planet Express ship.

205
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Because I love you! Yeah, baby!

206
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Feel like doing stuff for you and stuff.

207
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hm. I don't believe you.

208
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
If you really wanted to be with me...

209
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You'd merge your programming with mine.

210
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.
My friends who've done that...

211
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Say that afterwards, all the passion
went out of their relationship.

212
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't know if you
want my opinion-- Leela.

213
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Bender and I really need to be alone,
so I’m turning off the oxygen.

214
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Look, missy.
If you don't turn around now...

215
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I’m gonna have to shut down your brain!

216
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela.

217
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That barely hurt Leela at all.
Maybe not.

218
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But what if the artificial
gravity were to malfunction?

219
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Float for your lives!

220
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is the one place she can't hear us.
Just pretend to shower.

221
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Same as every day. Got it.
Now here's the plan.

222
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh, if only I could read lips.

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Comprende, Bender?
You'll have to distract her.

224
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Merge your programming with
hers while I shut down her brain.

225
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's too risky.
I’m a very meek individual.

226
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
If her personality engulfs mine,
the Bender you know and worship...

227
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Could disappear forever.

228
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I’m willing to take that risk.

229
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Hey, pookums.
Contrary to what I was saying earlier...

230
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Melding minds with you
would be extremely bearable.

231
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You really mean it?

232
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Uh, yes.

233
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Huh? Hey?

234
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Tubes?
You're older than you said you were!

235
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Come closer, Bender.
Let's become one.

236
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I prefer two. That way we can
still be a horse for Halloween.

237
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Okay, Bender has her distracted.
Now I can shut down her brain...

238
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
By deactivating the
carbonated logic matrix.

239
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh. I can't concentrate with
this obnoxious candy in my face.

240
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I’m on it. Maybe I’ll find those
magic words while I’m at it.

241
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Fat chance.
Yeah, I know.

242
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh. How about this one?
Give it up, Fry!

243
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I’ve got to pop these
tops in a precise order.

244
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Halfway there. The ship should be
getting a bit less rational now.

245
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Me want engulf Bender!
No! I didn't do it!

246
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Only a few more.

247
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Hey, I won free admission to Six Flags!

248
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Just one more reason
we must survive this.

249
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Leela?
Fry, I’ll read your candy later.

250
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
When we're not dead!

251
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What was that?
Oh, nothing.

252
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We're gonna love being
each other, you sexy ion.

253
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Last one.

254
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It worked! Gravity normal. Air returning.
Terror replaced by cautious optimism.

255
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We did it, Fry! Fry?

256
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You gave me your oxygen? Oh, no!

257
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Breathe, Fry! Breathe!

258
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh...

259
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
"You leave me breathless"?

260
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Happy Valentine’s Day, Fry.
Happy Valentine’s Day.

261
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Bender, are you okay?

262
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What crazy thing am I gonna date next?

263
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It sounds like you were able to keep
your consciousness separate from hers.

264
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Of course. Bender is a lone wolf.
A solitary eagle.

265
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
A cuddly baby tapir.

266
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And that's why I love him.

267
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I guess we'd better clean
up these millions of hearts.

268
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
No. I’ve got a lazier idea.

269
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
As the candy hearts poured
into the fiery quasar...

270
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
A wondrous thing happened, why not?

271
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
They vaporized into a
mystical love radiation...

272
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That spread across the universe,
destroying many, many planets...

273
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Including two gangster
planets and a cowboy world.

274
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But one Planet was exactly the right
distance to see the romantic rays...

275
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But not be destroyed by them. Earth.

276
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So all over the world,
couples stood together in joy.

277
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And me, zoidberg.

278
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
No one could have been happier,
unless it would have also been Valentine’s Day.

279
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What? It was? Hooray!
