0:0:18,328 --> 0:0:19,265
<i>And now...</i>

4
0:0:19,390 --> 0:0:22,134
The transcredible exploits
of Zapp Brannigan

5
0:0:22,259 --> 0:0:24,817
<i>brought to you
by Bartley's Rocket Wax.</i>

6
0:0:24,942 --> 0:0:27,151
I wax my rocket every day.

7
0:0:32,867 --> 0:0:34,909
No one can save you now, Leela.

8
0:0:35,633 --> 0:0:37,78
What about Zapp Brannigan?

9
0:0:37,287 --> 0:0:40,436
Well, obviously, Zapp Brannigan
could save you, but...

10
0:0:42,0 --> 0:0:44,960
So, Emperor Chopchop,
once again, we meet at last.

11
0:0:45,222 --> 0:0:47,972
Drop that space gun
or I'll shoot... like so.

12
0:0:52,336 --> 0:0:54,336
Tie me back up and ravish me.

13
0:0:54,521 --> 0:0:56,571
I'd like to, Leela, so I will.

14
0:1:4,67 --> 0:1:6,928
Shake it, baby.
Shake it like...

15
0:1:7,53 --> 0:1:8,818
I surrender
and volunteer for treason.

16
0:1:9,27 --> 0:1:11,195
Emergency summons
from the president, Captain.

17
0:1:11,555 --> 0:1:12,492
Oh, it's you.

18
0:1:12,823 --> 0:1:15,739
Just let me freshen up.
Computer, captain's musk.

19
0:1:34,644 --> 0:1:36,544
The long, dramatic corridor.

20
0:1:37,202 --> 0:1:38,806
That's never a good sign.

21
0:1:40,961 --> 0:1:42,381
<i>Glove recognized.</i>

22
0:1:42,506 --> 0:1:44,256
<i>Proceed, Mrs. Eisenhower.</i>

23
0:1:46,523 --> 0:1:48,315
Mr. President.
What the hell?

24
0:1:48,525 --> 0:1:49,984
At ease, Brannigan.

25
0:1:51,695 --> 0:1:54,529
What you're about to see
is highly classified.

26
0:1:54,861 --> 0:1:56,863
Reptilicus, hit the thingy.

27
0:1:59,369 --> 0:2:1,36
At oh-zero-hundred hours,

28
0:2:1,246 --> 0:2:4,665
Planet X-3 was attacked
by a mysterious Death-Sphere.

29
0:2:5,33 --> 0:2:6,833
Magnify that Death-Sphere.

30
0:2:9,274 --> 0:2:12,423
- Why is it still blurry?
- That's all the resolution we have.

31
0:2:12,770 --> 0:2:15,16
Making it bigger
doesn't make it clearer.

32
0:2:15,141 --> 0:2:16,917
It does on <i>CSI: Miami</i>.

33
0:2:18,31 --> 0:2:20,757
They fought back
with advanced military hardware,

34
0:2:20,882 --> 0:2:23,632
but it was like shooting
BBs at Bebe Rebozo.

35
0:2:25,188 --> 0:2:27,354
That poor, brave hardware.

36
0:2:27,707 --> 0:2:30,775
The Sphere then fired
some kind of hellish blackout ray.

37
0:2:30,943 --> 0:2:34,654
Erased that planet
like 18 minutes of incriminating tape.

38
0:2:38,426 --> 0:2:40,874
I just wish I understood why.

39
0:2:41,467 --> 0:2:42,620
Why I should care.

40
0:2:42,829 --> 0:2:45,498
Because the Death-Sphere
is now on course for Earth.

41
0:2:49,503 --> 0:2:52,46
My God, we're defenseless,
like fish in a barrel.

42
0:2:52,255 --> 0:2:54,882
- Options?
- My instinct is to hide in this barrel

43
0:2:55,140 --> 0:2:56,550
like the wily fish.

44
0:2:57,264 --> 0:2:59,15
Then we're down to our last hope:

45
0:2:59,140 --> 0:3:2,418
a radical new weapon
built by a visionary scientist

46
0:3:2,543 --> 0:3:4,767
I once dismissed as crazy.

47
0:3:7,887 --> 0:3:11,23
Let's see how crazy I am now, Nixon.

48
0:3:11,358 --> 0:3:13,547
The correct answer is "very."

49
0:3:13,672 --> 0:3:14,819
All right, Professor,

50
0:3:15,28 --> 0:3:16,320
sock it to me.

51
0:3:16,544 --> 0:3:18,292
Top secret news, everyone.

52
0:3:18,417 --> 0:3:21,199
I've developed a tiny,
one-man stealth fighter

53
0:3:21,324 --> 0:3:23,327
that's virtually undetectable.

54
0:3:23,766 --> 0:3:24,829
How undetectable?

55
0:3:25,38 --> 0:3:26,288
It's in front of you.

56
0:3:26,498 --> 0:3:27,552
I find that...

57
0:3:28,190 --> 0:3:29,240
to believe.

58
0:3:32,893 --> 0:3:36,632
But how exactly is this Happy Meal toy
going to destroy a giant Death-Sphere?

59
0:3:36,842 --> 0:3:37,892
From within.

60
0:3:38,17 --> 0:3:40,692
This ship should be able
to sneak, undetected,

61
0:3:40,817 --> 0:3:43,97
through the Sphere's
one vulnerable opening.

62
0:3:43,306 --> 0:3:44,640
What vulnerable opening?

63
0:3:44,850 --> 0:3:47,476
All Death-Spheres
have one vulnerable opening.

64
0:3:47,686 --> 0:3:50,268
Well, sure, but who's brave
enough to fly into something

65
0:3:50,393 --> 0:3:52,356
we all keep calling a Death-Sphere?

66
0:3:52,566 --> 0:3:54,316
- I say Brannigan.
- I say no.

67
0:3:54,526 --> 0:3:56,376
- I say me.
- I say Leela.

68
0:3:56,695 --> 0:3:58,696
- I say yes.
- I say no.

69
0:3:58,905 --> 0:3:59,989
I say Leela, too.

70
0:4:0,198 --> 0:4:1,323
I say yes again.

71
0:4:1,533 --> 0:4:2,992
I say I shall join her.

72
0:4:3,201 --> 0:4:6,176
But it's only a one-man craft.
I say.

73
0:4:6,486 --> 0:4:9,31
There'll only be one man... me.

74
0:4:9,271 --> 0:4:11,81
How would you feel if I rode rear

75
0:4:11,206 --> 0:4:13,2
as your personal tail gunner?

76
0:4:13,516 --> 0:4:14,503
Creeped out.

77
0:4:14,713 --> 0:4:15,838
Then it's decided.

78
0:4:22,220 --> 0:4:23,804
I have to sit in your lap?

79
0:4:24,14 --> 0:4:26,398
It'll help us achieve
maximum thrust.

80
0:4:28,491 --> 0:4:30,450
I made you some trail mix
for the flight.

81
0:4:30,575 --> 0:4:32,859
Also, this picture, to remember me.

82
0:4:32,984 --> 0:4:34,189
You hold onto it.

83
0:4:35,359 --> 0:4:36,643
I'll be back soon.

84
0:4:39,571 --> 0:4:41,485
Activating stealth shielding.

85
0:4:45,772 --> 0:4:47,912
- Liftoff!
- I'll roger that.

86
0:4:52,702 --> 0:4:55,887
Does anybody else feel aroused
and jealous and worried?

87
0:4:56,12 --> 0:4:59,943
I haven't felt much of anything
since my guinea pig died.

88
0:5:9,518 --> 0:5:12,786
Death-Sphere in range.
Engaging holographic targeting.

89
0:5:14,542 --> 0:5:15,856
Activating the Force.

90
0:5:17,329 --> 0:5:19,109
<i>Feel the entrance, Leela.</i>

91
0:5:19,606 --> 0:5:23,577
Destination on your left
in 0.3 miles.

92
0:5:28,895 --> 0:5:31,914
Zapp to Leela.
Look at all that surveillance equipment.

93
0:5:32,229 --> 0:5:33,387
We better whisper.

94
0:5:33,512 --> 0:5:35,512
Switching to pillow talk mode.

95
0:5:36,252 --> 0:5:38,587
Look! What are those huge letters?

96
0:5:39,504 --> 0:5:41,465
V- GINY?

97
0:5:42,27 --> 0:5:43,175
Doesn't ring a bell.

98
0:5:45,554 --> 0:5:48,193
I don't like
the looks of this V-GINY.

99
0:5:48,536 --> 0:5:50,474
Does anyone recognize
those call letters?

100
0:5:51,614 --> 0:5:52,483
Nope.

101
0:5:52,608 --> 0:5:54,228
It's not in the Janeway's Guide.

102
0:5:54,437 --> 0:5:56,912
Deciphering that I.D. code
is critical.

103
0:5:57,37 --> 0:5:59,587
I'll be
in the Chamber of Understanding.

104
0:6:8,269 --> 0:6:11,78
This is it... the moment
we should have trained for.

105
0:6:26,739 --> 0:6:27,928
Holy cr...

106
0:6:30,172 --> 0:6:32,266
Incoming yucky.
Firing pocket-rocket!

107
0:6:37,564 --> 0:6:39,356
Don't panic, Leela.
Go, go.

108
0:6:46,698 --> 0:6:48,574
I hope this is the control stick.

109
0:6:55,153 --> 0:6:57,916
Captain's log. We've lost control.
Addendum...

110
0:7:1,984 --> 0:7:3,478
<i>And now back to...</i>

111
0:7:3,603 --> 0:7:6,633
The transcredible exploits
of Zapp Brannigan

112
0:7:6,977 --> 0:7:9,595
Chapter Two: "The Heat Thickens".

113
0:7:11,345 --> 0:7:12,373
Leela, wake up.

114
0:7:12,498 --> 0:7:14,589
I can't face
this mysterious planet alone

115
0:7:14,714 --> 0:7:16,351
without you or someone like you.

116
0:7:19,629 --> 0:7:20,829
Zapp, wake up.

117
0:7:23,335 --> 0:7:26,153
- Where are we?
- We crashed on an uncharted planet.

118
0:7:26,321 --> 0:7:28,864
When I woke up,
I was pinned under this tree.

119
0:7:28,989 --> 0:7:29,990
Help me!

120
0:7:30,158 --> 0:7:32,377
If anyone can move it, I can.

121
0:7:35,157 --> 0:7:36,997
No one can move it.
Are you hurt?

122
0:7:37,165 --> 0:7:39,556
No, but I'm so thirsty.

123
0:7:39,810 --> 0:7:42,169
This space suit is making me
sweat like a sow.

124
0:7:42,337 --> 0:7:44,345
Me, too.
We'd better strip them off

125
0:7:44,470 --> 0:7:46,692
and continue surving au naturel.

126
0:7:48,99 --> 0:7:49,549
I suppose so.

127
0:7:53,141 --> 0:7:56,850
Here, we can cover ourselves
with these sticky, sap-covered leaves.

128
0:7:57,6 --> 0:7:59,61
I'll try to avert my eyes
from your nudery.

129
0:7:59,403 --> 0:8:0,403
You will?

130
0:8:0,961 --> 0:8:3,315
What's the point?
You'll have to look sooner or later.

131
0:8:3,634 --> 0:8:6,235
Well, I promise
not to abuse the privilege.

132
0:8:6,444 --> 0:8:9,404
For now I'd better scout around
for food and water and help.

133
0:8:9,572 --> 0:8:12,309
What a thoughtful
and considerate thing to say.

134
0:8:12,434 --> 0:8:13,659
What's wrong with you?

135
0:8:13,827 --> 0:8:15,194
I'm not quite sure.

136
0:8:15,373 --> 0:8:18,592
Perhaps it's the fresh air
or a severe head injury.

137
0:8:18,737 --> 0:8:20,287
In any case, I'm off.

138
0:8:21,392 --> 0:8:23,995
If you see any steaks,
that'd be good!

139
0:8:26,537 --> 0:8:27,909
Why isn't Leela back yet?

140
0:8:28,34 --> 0:8:30,156
- Do you think she's okay?
- How should I know?

141
0:8:30,281 --> 0:8:32,339
And how come you never ask
if I'm okay?

142
0:8:32,464 --> 0:8:34,12
I'm feeling a little neglected here.

143
0:8:35,702 --> 0:8:37,474
- Are you okay, Bender?
- Shut up.

144
0:8:37,642 --> 0:8:39,86
What difference does it make?

145
0:8:39,211 --> 0:8:42,573
When that Death- Sphere gets here,
we'll all be blown to Manwich meat.

146
0:8:42,698 --> 0:8:46,650
Well, I guess it's time to indulge
in some end-of-the-world debauchery.

147
0:8:46,818 --> 0:8:48,285
Who's up for an orgy?

148
0:8:52,324 --> 0:8:54,493
Maybe a Parcheesi tournament.

149
0:8:54,618 --> 0:8:56,718
Belay that Parcheesi tournament.

150
0:8:56,864 --> 0:8:59,172
I've identified the Death-Sphere.

151
0:8:59,297 --> 0:9:2,249
We may yet have
a faint hope of survival.

152
0:9:2,479 --> 0:9:5,127
Still, a Parcheesi tournament.

153
0:9:6,36 --> 0:9:9,47
This is a top secret
military satellite

154
0:9:9,215 --> 0:9:12,50
launched by the air force in 1998.

155
0:9:12,878 --> 0:9:15,958
And this is a top
secret FCC satellite

156
0:9:16,83 --> 0:9:17,598
launched that same year

157
0:9:17,766 --> 0:9:20,225
to censor indecent TV programs.

158
0:9:20,393 --> 0:9:22,477
Like <i>The Pimpsons</i> and <i>Ass-o-rama</i>?

159
0:9:22,645 --> 0:9:23,571
Precisely.

160
0:9:23,696 --> 0:9:26,691
However, the satellites collided
shortly after launch

161
0:9:26,816 --> 0:9:28,734
and were never heard from again.

162
0:9:28,902 --> 0:9:30,152
I found the board!

163
0:9:30,320 --> 0:9:32,182
Now I've simulated that collision

164
0:9:32,307 --> 0:9:33,906
using Shrapnel-vision.

165
0:9:41,664 --> 0:9:43,477
Granted, all that makes
perfect sense.

166
0:9:43,602 --> 0:9:45,876
But why is this Death-Sphere
destroying planets?

167
0:9:46,44 --> 0:9:48,86
That makes the most sense of all.

168
0:9:48,254 --> 0:9:50,839
Look at the planets
it's destroyed so far.

169
0:9:51,152 --> 0:9:54,22
First came X-3
the nude beach planet,

170
0:9:55,236 --> 0:9:56,678
then Poopiter,

171
0:9:57,391 --> 0:10:0,200
and finally that world
that can't be mentioned

172
0:10:0,325 --> 0:10:1,516
in polite company.

173
0:10:1,684 --> 0:10:2,880
You mean...

174
0:10:3,750 --> 0:10:5,20
How dare you.

175
0:10:5,582 --> 0:10:9,517
So the Death-Sphere
is "censoring" indecent planets?

176
0:10:9,818 --> 0:10:11,459
Indeed, and we're next,

177
0:10:11,584 --> 0:10:14,178
if we can't keep it
in our collective pants.

178
0:10:14,303 --> 0:10:17,110
Our sole hope
is to persuade the people of Earth

179
0:10:17,235 --> 0:10:19,660
to abandon their smutty ways.

180
0:10:20,917 --> 0:10:22,499
So the orgy's off?

181
0:10:24,493 --> 0:10:25,776
So thirsty.

182
0:10:26,158 --> 0:10:28,874
Why couldn't a water fountain
have fallen on me?

183
0:10:29,462 --> 0:10:32,620
I couldn't find any water, but
the moisture in these fruit-nut-berries

184
0:10:32,745 --> 0:10:33,840
should sustain you.

185
0:10:36,261 --> 0:10:39,172
I climbed perilously high
into the trees to pick them,

186
0:10:39,297 --> 0:10:41,838
yet I saw no sign
of intelligent life.

187
0:10:42,383 --> 0:10:43,100
Bummer.

188
0:10:43,268 --> 0:10:46,353
Moreover, the crash
totally destroyed our ship.

189
0:10:46,521 --> 0:10:48,730
So we're stuck here
until someone finds us?

190
0:10:48,898 --> 0:10:50,798
Alas, that may never happen.

191
0:10:50,923 --> 0:10:53,727
Stealth technology
makes the ship impossible to locate,

192
0:10:53,852 --> 0:10:55,737
yet easy to stub your crotch on.

193
0:10:55,905 --> 0:10:58,636
Well, there's worse places
to be marooned.

194
0:10:58,856 --> 0:11:0,784
Plenty of food, mild climate.

195
0:11:0,978 --> 0:11:3,78
It's a veritable Garden of Eden.

196
0:11:3,599 --> 0:11:4,599
It is?

197
0:11:12,46 --> 0:11:13,422
Did that snake say hello?

198
0:11:13,590 --> 0:11:16,91
No. We're both delirious
from dehydration.

199
0:11:16,495 --> 0:11:18,278
Just like Adam and Eve.

200
0:11:23,600 --> 0:11:25,267
We can still save Earth.

201
0:11:25,438 --> 0:11:27,561
People are sure
to clean up their act

202
0:11:27,686 --> 0:11:29,870
when presented with cold, hard facts

203
0:11:29,995 --> 0:11:31,606
by rational folks like us.

204
0:11:33,99 --> 0:11:35,974
<i>The end is near!
Repent thy sins!</i>

205
0:11:36,696 --> 0:11:37,982
I'll thinks it overs

206
0:11:38,107 --> 0:11:40,449
while I engages
this five-dollar hooker.

207
0:11:40,976 --> 0:11:42,617
Don't do it!
It's not worth it!

208
0:11:42,785 --> 0:11:44,453
Okay, make it three dollars.

209
0:11:45,470 --> 0:11:47,779
I don't wants
no three-dollar hooker.

210
0:11:47,904 --> 0:11:50,454
I'm going backs
to the adults bookstore.

211
0:11:50,752 --> 0:11:53,628
Adult bookstore?
I thought this was the public library.

212
0:11:54,512 --> 0:11:56,465
Pubic library.

213
0:11:58,51 --> 0:11:59,512
Where are you?

214
0:11:59,697 --> 0:12:2,197
God, I'm actually
starting to miss him.

215
0:12:2,416 --> 0:12:4,503
Maybe you two belong together.

216
0:12:4,628 --> 0:12:6,892
We do not.
And you can't talk.

217
0:12:7,185 --> 0:12:8,60
Come on.

218
0:12:8,246 --> 0:12:10,346
It must be an awful temptation.

219
0:12:10,934 --> 0:12:14,83
Guess who just killed a
woodchuck with his bare feet?

220
0:12:15,531 --> 0:12:17,652
I thought I'd whip
us up some shelter.

221
0:12:17,820 --> 0:12:19,363
Make this a little more like home.

222
0:12:19,675 --> 0:12:21,605
I do miss the Earth terribly.

223
0:12:21,730 --> 0:12:23,700
I wonder if it's even still there?

224
0:12:23,868 --> 0:12:25,780
Let's find out together.
I'll brave

225
0:12:25,954 --> 0:12:28,805
the ship's wreckage to
fetch you the telescope.

226
0:12:29,389 --> 0:12:30,689
That's so sweet.

227
0:12:30,998 --> 0:12:32,698
I'm just sayin', is all.

228
0:12:45,330 --> 0:12:47,594
I know my new plan is a long shot,

229
0:12:47,719 --> 0:12:49,758
but it's the only hope left.

230
0:12:49,991 --> 0:12:51,937
Well, now I've heard everything.

231
0:12:52,284 --> 0:12:53,152
On my iPod.

232
0:12:53,277 --> 0:12:56,566
So, do you have a new plan, Professor?
And is there any hope left?

233
0:12:56,734 --> 0:13:0,445
Indeed. We're here on
Earth's last unspoiled acre

234
0:13:0,613 --> 0:13:2,35
to show the Death-Sphere

235
0:13:2,160 --> 0:13:4,199
there's still purity in the world.

236
0:13:4,521 --> 0:13:5,951
Begin transmitting.

237
0:13:7,983 --> 0:13:9,750
Commence purity chant.

238
0:13:16,699 --> 0:13:20,522
I'm proud of you, Bender...
avoiding sin for almost a full minute.

239
0:13:22,242 --> 0:13:24,469
Yeah, baby, you're quite a dish.

240
0:13:34,483 --> 0:13:35,730
Quiet your riot.

241
0:13:35,855 --> 0:13:38,155
What's the worst that could happen?

242
0:13:52,967 --> 0:13:54,40
Earth is gone!

243
0:13:54,465 --> 0:13:57,413
We're the only two humans
left in the universe!

244
0:13:58,881 --> 0:14:1,98
Oh, God, I'm sorry, Leela.

245
0:14:3,307 --> 0:14:5,121
Maybe this was meant to be.

246
0:14:5,558 --> 0:14:8,513
Maybe you and I were meant
to build a new world here.

247
0:14:8,741 --> 0:14:10,599
We can avoid humanity's mistakes.

248
0:14:10,767 --> 0:14:11,725
Like the tuba.

249
0:14:12,859 --> 0:14:14,545
We'll be like Adam and Eve.

250
0:14:14,670 --> 0:14:15,979
Only without the tuba.

251
0:14:16,104 --> 0:14:17,975
And we'll beget little Zapp Junior.

252
0:14:18,100 --> 0:14:20,722
And Leela Junior.
And they'll have kids of their own.

253
0:14:20,847 --> 0:14:23,862
Yuck! Is that really
what happened in the Bible?

254
0:14:24,30 --> 0:14:26,656
It's a sick and twisted book
of holiness, all right.

255
0:14:26,824 --> 0:14:28,335
Then we'll write our own bible.

256
0:14:28,460 --> 0:14:31,210
With less Sodom and more Gomorrah.

257
0:14:31,496 --> 0:14:32,420
Let's do it.

258
0:14:32,545 --> 0:14:35,73
I shall become
the mother of a new world,

259
0:14:35,198 --> 0:14:37,248
trapped here, under this tree.

260
0:14:37,585 --> 0:14:40,834
The Tree of Knowledge.
Look, it even has apples!

261
0:14:45,310 --> 0:14:46,670
Come here, Adam.

262
0:14:46,970 --> 0:14:48,970
Partake of my forbidden fruit.

263
0:14:49,95 --> 0:14:51,216
Thee will be done.

264
0:14:59,161 --> 0:15:2,192
Wait. One more bite
before we begin the begetting.

265
0:15:4,787 --> 0:15:5,650
Juicy.

266
0:15:5,775 --> 0:15:8,21
Those nut-berries
you found were so salty,

267
0:15:8,146 --> 0:15:9,866
I couldn't think straight.

268
0:15:12,297 --> 0:15:15,9
I mean, not to belabor it,
but they were as salty

269
0:15:15,134 --> 0:15:17,415
as that bag of trail mix
Fry gave me.

270
0:15:18,77 --> 0:15:19,480
Exactly as salty.

271
0:15:20,938 --> 0:15:22,138
Wait a second!

272
0:15:28,463 --> 0:15:31,185
I have a terrible
confession to make.

273
0:15:31,734 --> 0:15:34,84
You see, when I first went foraging,

274
0:15:34,600 --> 0:15:38,61
what I actually found was the smoldering
wreckage of the ship.

275
0:15:38,229 --> 0:15:40,105
Ignoring all danger, I charged

276
0:15:40,344 --> 0:15:42,594
inside to liberate our provisions.

277
0:15:43,234 --> 0:15:45,569
So thisisthe trail mix Fry gave me!

278
0:15:47,164 --> 0:15:50,296
I exaggerated when I said
I picked it from the treetops.

279
0:15:50,579 --> 0:15:52,529
I just wanted you to think...

280
0:15:52,654 --> 0:15:54,286
a little better of me.

281
0:15:55,606 --> 0:15:57,192
Your motives were good.

282
0:15:57,317 --> 0:15:59,993
And we were both loopy
from dehydration.

283
0:16:0,195 --> 0:16:1,123
Wait.

284
0:16:1,248 --> 0:16:3,628
You've been doing
an awful lot of urinating.

285
0:16:6,375 --> 0:16:8,75
There's plenty of water.

286
0:16:8,200 --> 0:16:11,318
You see, after I selflessly
rescued the trail mix,

287
0:16:11,443 --> 0:16:14,598
I braved the flames once more,
in search of fluids.

288
0:16:21,272 --> 0:16:22,606
Why didn't you give me any?

289
0:16:23,483 --> 0:16:24,958
I thought it might help you forget

290
0:16:25,83 --> 0:16:28,945
your intense hatred for me if
you were a teensy bit delirious.

291
0:16:29,113 --> 0:16:31,13
So you let me dehydrate

292
0:16:31,138 --> 0:16:34,598
while you washed down the trail mix
with imported mineral water?

293
0:16:36,538 --> 0:16:37,787
Not exactly.

294
0:16:38,386 --> 0:16:39,999
You see, besides the trail mix,

295
0:16:40,124 --> 0:16:42,557
the minibar also contained
Doritos, beef jerky,

296
0:16:42,682 --> 0:16:44,502
and an assortment
of fine chocolates.

297
0:16:47,187 --> 0:16:48,798
I wanted to offer you
the chocolates.

298
0:16:48,966 --> 0:16:52,177
I truly did... but I was
concerned about your waistline.

299
0:16:52,534 --> 0:16:53,720
Very concerned.

300
0:16:53,914 --> 0:16:56,160
It's because
I haven't been exercising.

301
0:16:56,285 --> 0:16:59,100
If only this tree
hadn't fallen on me by chance.

302
0:17:0,29 --> 0:17:1,179
Oh, dear God!

303
0:17:5,405 --> 0:17:7,355
It was just after we crashed.

304
0:17:7,510 --> 0:17:9,760
I awoke first, to find you trapped.

305
0:17:12,260 --> 0:17:13,260
Wake up.

306
0:17:26,176 --> 0:17:28,448
You could've moved
this grub-infested log

307
0:17:28,573 --> 0:17:29,798
any time you wanted?

308
0:17:29,966 --> 0:17:31,292
Well, sure...

309
0:17:31,417 --> 0:17:33,850
but then I wouldn't have been able
to provide the loving care

310
0:17:33,975 --> 0:17:35,725
you wouldn't have needed.

311
0:17:38,407 --> 0:17:40,528
I'd leave you to rot
in this paradise,

312
0:17:40,653 --> 0:17:42,811
if only the ship weren't destroyed.

313
0:17:43,523 --> 0:17:45,973
The ship's fully functional,
isn't it?

314
0:17:48,743 --> 0:17:50,698
You see, after re-trapping you

315
0:17:50,823 --> 0:17:52,508
and before feigning unconsciousness,

316
0:17:52,633 --> 0:17:54,433
I paused to enjoy a cigar.

317
0:17:54,682 --> 0:17:57,570
Though mellow and satisfying,
it did parch me a bit,

318
0:17:57,695 --> 0:17:59,494
so I went in search of brandy.

319
0:17:59,685 --> 0:18:3,432
That's when my keen senses
detected the still-invisible ship.

320
0:18:6,711 --> 0:18:8,339
So we can go back to Earth?

321
0:18:8,795 --> 0:18:10,845
But there is no Earth anymore!

322
0:18:11,198 --> 0:18:13,104
Everyone I know is dead!

323
0:18:15,660 --> 0:18:17,721
This seems like a good place
to take a dump.

324
0:18:19,722 --> 0:18:20,724
You're alive!

325
0:18:22,836 --> 0:18:25,194
But how did you find this planet?

326
0:18:26,267 --> 0:18:27,267
Well?

327
0:18:29,637 --> 0:18:31,134
We're actually on Earth.

328
0:18:31,259 --> 0:18:33,319
The ship's homing device
brought us back.

329
0:18:33,487 --> 0:18:35,321
But I saw Earth explode.

330
0:18:36,42 --> 0:18:38,310
I'm actually
kind of proud of this one.

331
0:18:38,435 --> 0:18:39,647
You see, what you saw

332
0:18:40,74 --> 0:18:42,179
was merely a simulation I rigged up,

333
0:18:42,304 --> 0:18:45,111
using the ship's holographic
targeting projector.

334
0:18:45,236 --> 0:18:48,186
The alleged "telescope"
was a toilet paper tube.

335
0:18:48,753 --> 0:18:50,743
You said there wasn't
any toilet paper!

336
0:18:50,868 --> 0:18:53,256
And that humanity was annihilated!

337
0:18:53,424 --> 0:18:54,784
My motives were pure.

338
0:18:54,909 --> 0:18:57,152
I just wanted to you to think
we had to save humanity

339
0:18:57,277 --> 0:18:58,970
so you'd be willing to have sex.

340
0:18:59,138 --> 0:19:0,764
Please say you believe me.

341
0:19:0,932 --> 0:19:2,684
Yes, I believe you.

342
0:19:7,871 --> 0:19:10,821
There must be something
to steal on this island.

343
0:19:10,946 --> 0:19:12,66
It's Leela.

344
0:19:13,945 --> 0:19:15,625
Let's go home, everybody.

345
0:19:15,750 --> 0:19:17,447
At least the world wasn't destroyed.

346
0:19:19,557 --> 0:19:20,325
Yet.

347
0:19:24,362 --> 0:19:25,663
<i>People of Earth!</i>

348
0:19:25,831 --> 0:19:29,167
<i>Hear the righteous word
of the mighty V-GINY!</i>

349
0:19:29,335 --> 0:19:30,794
The mighty V-GINY!

350
0:19:31,975 --> 0:19:33,285
<i>Seeing you frolic</i>

351
0:19:33,410 --> 0:19:35,33
<i>in this unspoiled garden</i>

352
0:19:35,158 --> 0:19:38,259
<i>gives hope that this world
may yet be redeemed.</i>

353
0:19:38,427 --> 0:19:41,179
Huzzah!
The purity chant worked!

354
0:19:42,688 --> 0:19:45,142
<i>Unacceptable wardrobe malfunction!</i>

355
0:19:45,267 --> 0:19:47,417
<i>I was referring to Adam and Eve!</i>

356
0:19:47,700 --> 0:19:49,350
We're not Adam and Eve.

357
0:19:49,509 --> 0:19:50,980
You see, due to a series of...

358
0:19:51,148 --> 0:19:52,774
<i>Consummate your union,</i>

359
0:19:52,942 --> 0:19:54,702
<i>or I shall destroy Earth.</i>

360
0:19:58,460 --> 0:19:59,807
If it's to save Earth...

361
0:19:59,932 --> 0:20:1,825
I guess I could take one
for the team.

362
0:20:2,286 --> 0:20:3,636
What? Right now?!

363
0:20:3,960 --> 0:20:5,886
But I need a romance first.

364
0:20:6,11 --> 0:20:8,164
Maybe a vanilla candle or something?

365
0:20:8,332 --> 0:20:9,999
<i>Commence intercourse!</i>

366
0:20:11,117 --> 0:20:14,95
Those giant guns
are making me feel sort of inadequate.

367
0:20:14,220 --> 0:20:16,298
- I'm not sure if I can...
- Move it.

368
0:20:16,423 --> 0:20:18,161
I gotta get home and do laundry.

369
0:20:22,221 --> 0:20:24,681
For God's sake, censor it!
Censor it!

370
0:20:24,890 --> 0:20:26,740
<i>Approved for all audiences!</i>

371
0:20:35,249 --> 0:20:37,728
<i>And now, the spicy finale of...</i>

372
0:20:38,88 --> 0:20:41,118
The transcredible exploits
of Zapp Brannigan

373
0:20:41,738 --> 0:20:44,388
That was a close call,
but we saved Earth.

374
0:20:44,577 --> 0:20:47,579
Was it as good for you
as it was for the human race?

375
0:20:49,414 --> 0:20:52,333
Let's save another planet right now!
