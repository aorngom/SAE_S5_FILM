1
00:00:00,081 --> 00:00:02,640
That girl's looking at you.
Maybe she's looking at me.

2
00:00:03,146 --> 00:00:04,960
She's not looking at you, JJ.

3
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:08,880
JJ gets locked on.
You have to look after him.

4
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:11,960
- Cook's his friend.
- I think Cook's your friend, isn't he?

5
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:15,378
We're friends because you don't
surf and turf my men. You said that.

6
00:00:15,498 --> 00:00:17,320
He's not yours.
He'll never belong to anyone.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,489
- Shut up.
- He's not the one you want.

8
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:22,775
When I'm with you,
I feel like I'm a better person

9
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:24,080
and I feel happier...

10
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:26,920
- less alone.
- Careful what you wish for, Pandora.

11
00:00:27,196 --> 00:00:28,196
Why?

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,496
What's wrong?

13
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:32,679
Why don't you want
to be friends with us?

14
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,726
- Cook hasn't got any friends.
- Don't say that!

Acknowledged.

19
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:36,240
Messerschmitt ME-262E...

20
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:40,404
A Curtis P40 Kittyhawk...

21
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:44,199
- A Hawker Typhoon...
- Night Fighter or Ground Attack?

22
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,528
Ground Attack.

23
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,124
A Focke Wulf 190...

24
00:02:48,748 --> 00:02:50,006
Gloster Meteor...

25
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:52,269
Boulton Paul Defiant...

26
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,112
and...

27
00:02:54,232 --> 00:02:57,000
Mitsubishi Zero.
I want that in Kamikaze spec.

28
00:02:57,705 --> 00:03:00,120
What's happened, JJ? I sold you
that one three weeks back.

29
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:02,278
Collateral damage,

30
00:03:02,654 --> 00:03:04,480
quite a lot of it.
Rage incident, you know.

31
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:05,957
Another one?

32
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:07,157
'Fraid so.

33
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:09,671
You taking those pills
they give you?

34
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,920
- Of course. I'm the pill king.
- Maybe they stopped working, yeah?

35
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,460
Impossible.

36
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:16,677
Olanzipine, Risperidone
and Dextroamphetamine

37
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,428
have unrivalled efficacy rates.

38
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:20,412
Well, something's up, ain't it?

39
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:22,701
I mean, deliberately destroying

40
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:24,920
a Kamikaze spec Zero...

41
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,376
That's gotta tell you something.

42
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:32,709
Here, this'll cheer you up.

43
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,240
I got cruise missiles
on special offer.

44
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:38,782
- Intercontinental?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:41,120
R62 Matador...

46
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,722
the real deal.

47
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,633
Nobody fucks ya
with one of these babies!

48
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:56,560
Dear.

49
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,112
- Can you remember where I live?
- Course I can.

50
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:03,001
Terry died and you live
with the other ladies now.

51
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:04,697
Oh, bugger!

52
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:21,366
I don't want to.

53
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:24,869
I'm telling you,
I don't like it. I can't come here!

54
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:27,319
Don't be a silly bear.
It'll be fine.

55
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,076
- Really?
- Really.

56
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,152
I'll come and check on you later on.
Don't panic, yeah?

57
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:49,849
Next.

58
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:55,876
Eleven stone three.

59
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:00,720
Metric, if you wouldn't mind, JJ.

60
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,445
71.7 kilos.

61
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:04,640
Good, good.

62
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:09,204
- Why do you always weigh me?
- We weigh everyone.

63
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:10,925
Yes, but why?

64
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,720
You don't have to worry about that.

65
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:16,182
Well, I do.

66
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,123
You know what we say about worrying.

67
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:21,077
Just don't.

68
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,755
That's right, just don't.

69
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:27,155
Take a seat, lad.

70
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,144
So, how have we been?

71
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:33,585
It's complicated.

72
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:34,955
Yes, of course.

73
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:38,480
Got any new tricks for me?

74
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,693
- I'm not doing magic any more.
- Really?

75
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:45,959
- Have you been taking your pills?
- Yes. That's the thing,

76
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:48,640
nobody likes magic,
or there isn't a point,

77
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,072
or maybe they just
don't like me enough.

78
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:52,368
- Who?
- My friends.

79
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:54,959
- Your friends don't like you?
- I'm pretty sure of it.

80
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:56,528
And why is that?

81
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:00,160
Because if they liked me,
maybe they'd listen to me occasionally

82
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,452
instead of fighting all the time
and hating each other.

83
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:06,116
- I'm sure they don't hate you.
- I didn't say they hated me.

84
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:09,960
- They hate each other.
- Well, there you go.

85
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:15,358
I've been getting locked on,

86
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:18,880
- breaking stuff, getting into rages.
- Don't do that.

87
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:20,091
Right.

88
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:24,353
I'll give you some new little pills.

89
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:28,035
We can't get enough of them!
Take them at breakfast and supper, OK?

90
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,336
Instead of what?

91
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:32,243
No, as well as, JJ. As well as.

92
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:35,960
Sitro Teasic Ulvaceous Neoprenes.

93
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,224
Amusing, isn't it?

94
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:41,038
Pretty effective blighters,
sort everything out.

95
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:46,186
I think...

96
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:50,199
I think I want to be...
normal, you know?

97
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,478
Yes, so take those twice a day.

98
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:54,359
No, I... That's not it.

99
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:58,057
Freddie smashed Cook
and Cook stole his girl,

100
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:00,291
and they're my best friends.

101
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:02,892
- They don't sound like friends.
- No, you don't...

102
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,606
They're my friends and they hate
each other because of Effy,

103
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:09,921
and... But we love each other,
or at least...

104
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,819
- You love a girl, that's normal.
- That's not it.

105
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,400
I do love her, but...

106
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,127
But that's not it.

107
00:07:23,164 --> 00:07:25,040
- I'm feeling angry!
- You're worrying.

108
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:26,880
Yes! I'm worrying and...

109
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:30,520
- I'm worrying, and...
- So just don't do that, OK?

110
00:08:15,304 --> 00:08:16,604
What a surprise.

111
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,400
Emily, what are you...?

112
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:27,579
We don't say.

113
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:28,689
It's OK.

114
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,764
Yes. It's all right.
It's just I don't expect...

115
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,009
I don't usually see people
I know in here.

116
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:35,959
Why not?

117
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:38,320
Because normal people
don't come here.

118
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Right.

119
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:44,634
I've been having
a bit of counselling.

120
00:08:44,953 --> 00:08:45,953
Nice.

121
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:50,317
I asked them to help me to be a bit
more honest with people, you know?

122
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:52,400
Anyway, they just gave me these.

123
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:56,275
Snap.

124
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:00,206
Must be good if they can help you
calm down and be more honest.

125
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:04,400
It wasn't really
what I was hoping for.

126
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:06,960
Do you need calming down?

127
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,149
Believe me, I totally do.

128
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:11,725
I'm getting overstimulated
just talking to you now.

129
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:14,320
I mean, you're exciting me.
Wait! That's not...

130
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:17,800
- Bugger! Shitification!
- It's all right, JJ.

131
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:21,797
It's hard telling people
things about yourself, isn't it?

132
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,040
But I'm gonna try.

133
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,763
It's no big deal.

134
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,400
- Probably couldn't care less.
- About what?

135
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,322
I want to have sex with girls.

136
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,798
- Right.
- Yeah. I like girls.

137
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,267
I like sex with girls.

138
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:46,960
I like their rosy lips,
their hard nipples, bums, soft thighs.

139
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,028
I like tits and fanny, you know?

140
00:09:49,638 --> 00:09:52,320
There, I've said it and now...

141
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:56,555
Fucking hell.

142
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:05,360
Priazapan, Moraglutomol,

143
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:08,280
Triculine, Rizzalin...

144
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:10,199
The veritable Stun, as of today.

145
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,837
That is a lot of drugs.

146
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:14,750
Dietary supplements...
Ah, here's my vitamin C.

147
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:18,119
I do about twenty of these a day,
cos they're nice and fizzy.

148
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,629
Go on. Try one.

149
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,174
You're supposed to dissolve them,
but they've got a better kick this way.

150
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:27,560
Go on. Go!

151
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,150
All right.

152
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,997
I don't think you want to do that!

153
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:48,297
Holy shit!

154
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,522
I think you've got
your hand on my tit.

155
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:10,693
I know. I mean... Shit, sorry.

156
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,459
I've had a lovely time.

157
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:20,245
I've screwed this all up, haven't I?

158
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,250
Truth is...

159
00:11:25,974 --> 00:11:27,280
you're nice, JJ.

160
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:28,824
I'm unusual.

161
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:32,633
That's just code for "not normal".

162
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:37,960
I'd give anything
to be normal for a whole day.

163
00:11:42,164 --> 00:11:44,393
If you were normal,
what would you do?

164
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,231
I'd lose my virginity first,
several times.

165
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:51,359
Then have a Choccy Nut milk shake
without going into shock.

166
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,718
Then I'd tell Freddie and Cook to
stop fighting over Effy

167
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,799
before they hate each other for ever,
and not make me take sides.

168
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,158
And they'd listen to me for once
and not fucking ruffle my hair!

169
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:02,999
And then I'd tell Effy I loved her
and lose my virginity a few more times.

170
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,550
You love Effy?

171
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:07,040
Did I say that out loud?

172
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:08,546
'Fraid so.

173
00:12:10,171 --> 00:12:11,171
Retard!

174
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,261
I'm a retard!
Nut job! Bat case!

175
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:18,125
Spaso! Mong! Autistic
fucking fruitcake mental basket!

176
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:20,773
- You're getting locked on!
- Shitty Looney Tune. One Flew Over...

177
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:22,240
The Fucking Cuckoo's Nest!

178
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:23,640
Look at these!

179
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:32,560
That worked.

180
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:39,283
Last guy to see my tits
wasn't quite as impressed.

181
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:43,591
I suppose I should be leaving.

182
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,531
You know, J,

183
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:49,064
all those things you want,

184
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,143
you don't ask for them.

185
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,840
Why don't you just ask?

186
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:01,502
Can I see your breasts again?

187
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:05,870
Let's start
with the easy stuff, yeah?

188
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:12,200
- So where do we start?
- We?

189
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:21,029
- I'm going to be normal.
- Right.

190
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,286
- Normal, normal.
- Ring the bell, JJ.

191
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:29,945
- What are you gonna say?
- {\I'm }Gonna ask him to make up with Cook.

192
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:32,757
Gonna ask him to forget Effy,
because she's not good for us.

193
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:34,791
Gonna ask him to
stop ruffling my hair.

194
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:39,680
- Don't let anything stop you.
- Right.

195
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,686
- Tell her.
- Karen, if you don't mind,

196
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:50,848
- would you please not ruffle...
- Hang on.

197
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:52,880
What are you doing here?

198
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:55,040
Do I know you?

199
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,240
Fucking hell!

200
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:06,880
I want to see Freddie
and I want to see him now.

201
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:12,268
It's OK, Karen.
I know which bedroom it is.

202
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:14,508
Yeah, but this is going to be good.

203
00:14:16,902 --> 00:14:17,840
It's uncanny.

204
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,460
What...?

205
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:23,005
He's definitely in there.

206
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:29,083
I'm just a bit busy
at the minute, J. Sorry.

207
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,959
We'll do this another time, then.

208
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,640
For Pete's sake.
Get out of the way!

209
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,456
Now,

210
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:53,204
does everybody know each other?

211
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:55,151
That's great. Brilliant, Karen.

212
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:57,240
For Christ's sake,
what are you doing?

213
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,519
I'm doing the Great fucking
Northern Run, what does it look like?

214
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,560
Guys, could we please just...?

215
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,480
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm sorry.

216
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:08,302
Maybe my postal application
hasn't reached you yet.

217
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,629
Now, do you mind? We're sort
of in the middle of something.

218
00:15:13,094 --> 00:15:15,200
That's not right.
You want Eff and she's not...

219
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,344
It's a free country, JJ.
Maybe my weirdo sister's up for it.

220
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,040
That's ridiculous, Emily's gay.
I wanted to talk to you.

221
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:24,473
- We can do this another time and...
- Quality!

222
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:28,520
That's not true.

223
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
Is it Ems?

224
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:35,120
Because you promised me
that wasn't true.

225
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:44,970
Shed.

226
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,040
So what did you want to tell me, J?

227
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,558
- Has she gone yet?
- None of your business!

228
00:16:10,915 --> 00:16:12,554
Right arse you made of it.

229
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
I want...

230
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,290
- I want things to change.
- Things have changed.

231
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,999
They change all the time.

232
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:26,735
Doesn't it matter what I think?

233
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:29,815
Because I think it should
matter more, you know.

234
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:32,985
So?

235
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,320
We're supposed to be friends.

236
00:16:39,657 --> 00:16:41,360
- For ever.
- I can't do it, J.

237
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,479
Just because of a girl.
You don't even want Effy.

238
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:45,599
Don't tell me what I want!

239
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:47,461
Then tell me what to do.

240
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,746
You've gotta choose, mate.

241
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:53,067
Either me or Cook.

242
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:55,507
And what about me?

243
00:16:55,987 --> 00:16:57,187
Don't I count?

244
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:03,480
- I'm not the one who's telling fibs.
- Let it alone, J.

245
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,675
I'm...

246
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:08,011
the normal one.

247
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:28,998
Mum...

248
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,189
- <i>Gay J, man. Where you been?</i>
- Doing stuff.

249
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:07,780
<i>Been days, J-Lo. What's going on?</i>

250
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:10,296
Like I said. Stuff and...

251
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:12,747
- stuff.
- <i>Well...</i>

252
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:15,356
<i>You did that nutty professor
thing today, yeah?</i>

253
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,421
My assessment. You remembered?

254
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:20,643
<i>JJ, am I your bestest or what?</i>

255
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:23,564
<i>Anyway, you're coming to Thomas's
shindig tonight at the Roxie?</i>

256
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:26,779
<i>Non-negotiable. He's putting
a band on an' all, it'll be sweet as!</i>

257
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:30,106
- Can I ask you something?
- <i>Ask me later J-Lo.</i>

258
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:32,695
<i>I got business to attend to.
Keep taking them mad pills,</i>

259
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:34,178
<i>and I'll see you later.</i>

260
00:19:36,034 --> 00:19:37,631
<i>I love that barmy fucker.</i>

261
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:40,567
<i>"Everyone's gotta have a mate
who's a twat</i>

262
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:43,010
<i>and who's not gonna try
and finger your pussy candy.</i>

263
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,430
<i>Like you, babes.</i>

264
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,106
<i>You getting it?</i>

265
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:50,157
<i>You there?</i>

266
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:52,379
<i>How about here?</i>

267
00:19:52,877 --> 00:19:54,470
<i>Like that. Grab my balls...</i>

268
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,520
<i>Just fucking like that.</i>

269
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:01,668
Guys...

270
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,360
I'm not gay. I'm not anything, OK?

271
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,779
Fuck off!

272
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,836
How come he gets a lolly?

273
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:31,870
- Yeah, that's gay.
- Totally gay!

274
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,560
He's so gay. That's...

275
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,200
Anyone home?

276
00:22:01,502 --> 00:22:02,880
What the fuck!

277
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,100
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry.

278
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,459
- I'm sorry!
- Give me my T-shirt,

279
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:09,960
fucking hopeless perv.

280
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,401
I'm sorry. The door was open.

281
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,960
- I got worried.
- About what?

282
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,640
I dunno. I thought you might have...
I dunno, OK?

283
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,473
I was pissed at the two of you.

284
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:24,674
Two of who?

285
00:22:26,015 --> 00:22:28,732
I heard what you were saying.
I want you to stop doing that.

286
00:22:28,852 --> 00:22:30,720
- What the fuck?
- You and Cook.

287
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,495
I haven't seen him for days.

288
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:34,880
Don't dis me while you're having
sexual intercourse,

289
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,056
because you might think
it's funny but I...

290
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:38,080
Sorry?

291
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,640
Are you going to give me some fucked up
hint what you're talking about?

292
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:54,400
I usually drink mango juice
when I get over stressed.

293
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,001
So?

294
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:28,972
I think it must be these new pills
they've given me.

295
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:32,560
Vivid dreams. It's a side effect.

296
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:34,920
Cool. Let's do a couple now.

297
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,552
Get off our faces.

298
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,140
It does other stuff, too.

299
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,260
Like?

300
00:23:40,774 --> 00:23:43,320
Calms you...
makes you tell the truth, allegedly.

301
00:23:44,211 --> 00:23:45,723
What's wrong with that?

302
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:47,734
Dunno...

303
00:23:48,158 --> 00:23:48,963
dunno.

304
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:52,362
Come on, JJ. Don't be pathetic.

305
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:54,480
It's easy.
Just tell me something true.

306
00:23:57,172 --> 00:23:58,110
Tell me.

307
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,160
- Tell me now!
- I love you.

308
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,261
Everybody loves me.

309
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:11,368
That's a relief.

310
00:24:11,488 --> 00:24:14,520
With the possible exception
of darling Ma and Da.

311
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,699
They don't love me so good.

312
00:24:17,063 --> 00:24:18,175
Why's that?

313
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:21,880
Cos I won't let them fuck up
their lives in peace.

314
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:24,948
So I'm being a total bitch
to both of them.

315
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,821
What did they...

316
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:30,400
She fucked his boss and he behaved
like a complete dildo as usual.

317
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,600
Sounds bad.

318
00:24:34,687 --> 00:24:36,086
It's well bad, JJ.

319
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:38,327
I'm officially off the rails.

320
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,680
You should try it.

321
00:24:41,233 --> 00:24:44,535
I can't go off the rails.
My Mum... she needs me to be OK.

322
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:45,955
I have to be OK.

323
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:49,060
Is that why you take all the pills?

324
00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:51,680
Pretty much.

325
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:58,707
Please leave them alone, Effy.

326
00:25:00,485 --> 00:25:01,285
Who?

327
00:25:03,174 --> 00:25:04,863
I don't mean to be rude but

328
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:07,120
Cook, Freddie and me,

329
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,831
they're the only friends
I've ever had and...

330
00:25:11,195 --> 00:25:14,840
you've basically ruined everything
and I'd like you to stop now.

331
00:25:27,302 --> 00:25:28,855
I can't do that, J.

332
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:31,582
Why not?

333
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,739
- Thanks for loving me.
- No problem.

334
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:43,535
I'd like to be your friend.

335
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:48,384
Nice, babes.

336
00:26:49,478 --> 00:26:50,280
Nice.

337
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:52,988
Cookie, stop it.
I gotta go...

338
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,480
- I'm going.
- I'm coming and coming!

339
00:27:12,974 --> 00:27:15,383
Mac J, the Lord High Chieftain of J.

340
00:27:20,498 --> 00:27:22,298
Winding up for a big one tonight?

341
00:27:22,418 --> 00:27:23,976
Dunno, Cook.
I don't know.

342
00:27:24,096 --> 00:27:25,282
Course you are.

343
00:27:25,402 --> 00:27:26,941
Me and you, J, tonight,

344
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:29,760
we're setting course
for the heart of the fucking sun.

345
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,057
You just arrived?

346
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,507
Did you...

347
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:38,240
- you see anyone on the way out?
- I just arrived.

348
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:39,866
Cool.

349
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,858
You missed my tip top, rumpy pumpy,

350
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:46,120
bangs like a rabbit, secret lover.

351
00:27:47,035 --> 00:27:48,002
Really?

352
00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:50,960
Don't you want to know who she is?

353
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,560
Who is it?

354
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:57,019
I'm not telling you, man.
Even the Cookie monster knows

355
00:27:57,139 --> 00:27:58,586
when it's time for schtum,

356
00:27:58,706 --> 00:28:01,643
Otherwise the shit's gonna
dismantle the fan.

357
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:05,148
But she can't fucking help herself{\though, man},
I'm telling you.

358
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:06,389
If it's wrong,

359
00:28:06,796 --> 00:28:08,362
why are you doing it?

360
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:11,680
Because it's life, J. You gotta
get in there and never fucking stop.

361
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,440
Shit's waiting to be done.

362
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:16,083
If you're not gonna do it
you're a pathetic pussy fart.

363
00:28:16,203 --> 00:28:17,800
What would be so bad about stopping?

364
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:23,493
- What about other people?
- Fuck other people, J.

365
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:25,357
Fuck 'em!
Let's blow.

366
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,692
The thing is...

367
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:30,421
you didn't answer my question.

368
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,289
What would happen if you stopped?

369
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,160
Look at me.

370
00:28:40,058 --> 00:28:41,240
What else have I got?

371
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,112
Please make up with Freddie.

372
00:28:44,232 --> 00:28:46,880
- It doesn't work. It just...
- Freddie can fuck himself.

373
00:28:47,216 --> 00:28:48,589
He was asking for it, yeah?

374
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:50,709
- What was he asking for?
- He's pissed

375
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,345
- cos I've got something he wants.
- You don't care, leave her alone.

376
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,885
- {\It's not like }You're going out with her or anything.
- She likes it mindless.

377
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:57,305
So do I. Sorted.

378
00:28:58,094 --> 00:29:01,600
Now, are you coming or do I have to keep
look out myself when I'm buying gear?

379
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:04,359
Just care. OK?

380
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,268
- About what?
- About me!

381
00:29:07,388 --> 00:29:08,823
About me, you twat!

382
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,848
You're all fucking twats!

383
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,389
Here...

384
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,474
Here...

385
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:31,400
I pissing love you, J.

386
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:35,811
Nothing's gonna change that, man.

387
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:41,720
You're my very own little fruit bat.

388
00:29:42,654 --> 00:29:43,804
Fuck Freddie.

389
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:46,000
It's just me and you now.

390
00:29:47,048 --> 00:29:48,165
Feel the love.

391
00:29:50,781 --> 00:29:52,041
You feeling it?

392
00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:55,340
Right.

393
00:29:55,724 --> 00:29:57,024
Now, let's walk.

394
00:29:57,841 --> 00:29:59,375
I want to get mentalled.

395
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:01,747
We've got
pharmaceuticals to purchase.

396
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:06,520
Eight for one fucking pill?
I'll pay you £8 for three!

397
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,716
I don't give a shit.
It's £8 a pill.

398
00:30:10,836 --> 00:30:13,641
What pills are they
you charge me £8 for?

399
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,944
If you don't want the pills,
then don't come to me...

400
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,760
It's not about the fucking money...

401
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,131
It's £8 for maybe three or four...

402
00:30:25,251 --> 00:30:27,393
You don't want the pills,
you can fuck off!

403
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:35,059
Police... stop! You're under arrest!

404
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:40,395
Come back!

405
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:07,069
Shit, I thought
it was getting dodgy down there.

406
00:31:07,189 --> 00:31:08,640
But you still went?

407
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:10,840
I needed to get stuff.

408
00:31:13,346 --> 00:31:15,794
No fucking gear in this town. Shit.

409
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:18,045
Manage without?

410
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,885
That'll be no kind
of night out now, will it, J?

411
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:25,160
- I need to get something.
- I can do without.

412
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:28,470
- I don't need spliff or pills...
- All right. All right!

413
00:31:30,573 --> 00:31:33,072
And by the way,
that's so fucking not true.

414
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:36,250
I don't drink, I don't do weed,

415
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,954
- I don't do class A...
- You're pilled up every day.

416
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:41,760
Nothing fancy about you,
so don't fucking come it.

417
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:45,247
All right.

418
00:31:46,547 --> 00:31:48,874
- You can have some of mine.
- Mad pills?

419
00:31:50,313 --> 00:31:51,560
You wanna get mad, right?

420
00:31:54,032 --> 00:31:55,147
Stun?

421
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,478
- What do they do?
- A lot.

422
00:32:00,598 --> 00:32:02,366
You need to take two or three.

423
00:32:02,486 --> 00:32:03,485
Go on then.

424
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:06,976
I've already taken mine.

425
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:09,799
There you go.

426
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:12,591
Or possibly you're pussy.

427
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,331
Pussy.

428
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,431
Let the party commence.

429
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:39,581
D'you mind?

430
00:32:40,932 --> 00:32:42,259
Stupid bitch!

431
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,960
You OK?

432
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:49,814
No Cook?

433
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:52,920
- Why would there be a Cook?
- You're seeing him, aren't you?

434
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:56,160
I'm fucking him occasionally.
I'm not seeing him.

435
00:32:57,221 --> 00:32:58,360
There's a distinction?

436
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:03,793
No Emily?

437
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,120
Truth.

438
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:10,018
That obvious?

439
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:12,720
Don't have to be a genius
to work it out.

440
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,840
- So?
- So I'm straight.

441
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:16,936
Sure?

442
00:33:21,486 --> 00:33:22,568
If I said no,

443
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,384
- would I regret it?
- Probably. But not because of me.

444
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:33,458
We're objects of lust.

445
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,877
- Making you feel good?
- Not really.

446
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:38,463
I suggest we go in here

447
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,680
and get so monumentally fucked up,

448
00:33:40,923 --> 00:33:42,523
we forget all about...

449
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,360
My god. That's fucked up.

450
00:33:54,813 --> 00:33:56,239
- You love him?
- No

451
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,200
You love The Lips.

452
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,360
Oh, my god. Go on, lie to me.

453
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:03,479
I want to see this.

454
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,840
Here, come!

455
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:08,510
You don't pay. Friends don't pay!

456
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:13,520
Isn't this great?
I've sold a load of tickets.

457
00:34:15,462 --> 00:34:16,559
Here, come! Come!

458
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:21,362
Welcome, welcome <i>mes amis</i>!
Club Thomas is pleased to receive you!

459
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:22,482
All right?

460
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:27,407
Aren't you gonna be
bitchy to me, Katie?

461
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:29,351
Yeah, sure.

462
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:31,680
Give me time.

463
00:34:35,229 --> 00:34:36,280
Listen, everyone,

464
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,718
everything is great,
totally super great.

465
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:39,800
More friends!

466
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,036
Wait until you see this place.
You will not believe it.

467
00:34:46,027 --> 00:34:47,720
And the band are formidable!

468
00:34:48,102 --> 00:34:51,119
Everyone is together, Panda is coming,
and Emily's already here.

469
00:34:52,753 --> 00:34:53,580
Where?

470
00:36:03,071 --> 00:36:04,076
Fuck you.

471
00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:06,489
You fuck off!

472
00:36:21,553 --> 00:36:23,239
What the fuck's he on?

473
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,990
How many, JJ?

474
00:36:34,379 --> 00:36:35,408
How many?

475
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:37,554
Four... Then another two.

476
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:40,760
- You twat! What does this stuff do?
- Calms you down...

477
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:41,921
and stuff.

478
00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:43,679
Right. You see that?

479
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:50,520
You stupid fucking idiot!

480
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,475
- And what the fuck were you doing?
- I'm sorry...

481
00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:32,120
I'm sorry.
He pissed me off.

482
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,986
How?

483
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:35,649
It doesn't matter.
Just say he's gonna be all right.

484
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:39,552
He's gonna be all right. He's always
fucking all right, aren't you, Cook?

485
00:37:40,077 --> 00:37:41,400
- Aren't you?
- Don't.

486
00:37:51,953 --> 00:37:53,203
Top pills, man.

487
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,400
I knew you'd come for me,

488
00:38:00,884 --> 00:38:02,131
Three Musketeers.

489
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,421
Fuck off, Cook.

490
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:06,280
Freddie, she loves you, you know.

491
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:12,621
What?

492
00:38:13,114 --> 00:38:14,314
She loves you.

493
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:17,369
But she can't stand it.
Can't stand the love,

494
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:19,590
- so she fucks me instead.
- What's he saying?

495
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:22,240
What?

496
00:38:22,688 --> 00:38:23,688
Shit.

497
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,329
I think you're gonna get the truth.

498
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:29,516
- Cook?
- I'm pissed off, yeah?

499
00:38:30,861 --> 00:38:33,959
She's taking the piss
and it's hurting me.

500
00:38:34,434 --> 00:38:36,298
Cos Cook needs the love too.

501
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:40,520
- Cookie's got nothing.
- Everything all right, guys?

502
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,880
Cookie's always got nothing.

503
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,937
That's why I do her pal.

504
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,380
That's why I pop Panda.

505
00:38:52,224 --> 00:38:53,474
Panda's popped.

506
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:56,879
It's always the same great tits Panda,
great tits Effy.

507
00:38:57,414 --> 00:38:59,641
That's all I get cos I'm shit.

508
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:03,710
I'm pure shit.

509
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:12,779
Back off.

510
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:19,320
- He does not deserve friends!
- Yeah.

511
00:39:21,557 --> 00:39:22,657
He's a cunt.

512
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:28,961
Move! Move!

513
00:39:38,695 --> 00:39:40,602
You've had a busy day,
haven't you, J?

514
00:39:40,722 --> 00:39:41,722
I'm sorry.

515
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:43,719
I got locked on.

516
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:46,640
You all pissed me off.

517
00:39:49,808 --> 00:39:51,960
Does this mean
I can't come to the shed anymore?

518
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:58,699
Course not,
you can still come to the shed.

519
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:04,339
Just give me some space, OK?

520
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:06,520
I need time to think.

521
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:10,000
What's going on? Someone said he...

522
00:40:17,592 --> 00:40:18,960
It's yours, I think.

523
00:40:53,728 --> 00:40:55,031
How are you doing?

524
00:40:57,799 --> 00:40:58,799
Here.

525
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:04,665
There you go.

526
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:14,026
According to the diagnosis,
I'm liable to social dysfunction.

527
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:16,626
They shouldn't let me out really.

528
00:41:17,217 --> 00:41:18,451
It's OK, JJ.

529
00:41:19,297 --> 00:41:20,733
You did me a favour.

530
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:22,095
I did?

531
00:41:24,268 --> 00:41:25,559
Katie loves me.

532
00:41:25,937 --> 00:41:27,237
I know she does.

533
00:41:28,217 --> 00:41:29,280
Yes, definitely.

534
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,080
Did you do it?

535
00:41:36,697 --> 00:41:38,184
Did you ask for stuff?

536
00:41:41,188 --> 00:41:42,794
I did a fair bit of...

537
00:41:42,914 --> 00:41:43,914
asking.

538
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:46,039
And how did it go?

539
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,945
I'd say bad on the face of it.

540
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:51,968
But in another sense,

541
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:54,440
you might say it's too early to say.

542
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:58,421
Too early to say.

543
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:05,945
I don't want to go home tonight.

544
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:08,720
- Katie's too...
- Locked on.

545
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:12,127
She's locked on.

546
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,483
I don't want to go home.

547
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:17,320
I can't.

548
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,496
Right.

549
00:42:22,889 --> 00:42:24,172
So let's think.

550
00:43:08,771 --> 00:43:11,760
Please tell me somebody
makes you wear those pyjamas.

551
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:14,120
I just like them.

552
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,193
They're 100% Egyptian cotton,

553
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,112
which is good cos rayon derivatives

554
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:20,312
and other man-made fibres
can interfere with...

555
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:23,200
If we're going to be my friends,
you can't wear teddy bears any more.

556
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:24,885
Get them off.

557
00:43:25,484 --> 00:43:26,778
Right. You got it.

558
00:43:27,348 --> 00:43:28,398
No teddies.

559
00:43:29,002 --> 00:43:32,081
I've got some others
with World War One Fighter planes on.

560
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:42,067
I'm asking for something, JJ.

561
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:46,571
Yup and I'm saying yes.

562
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:49,108
But possibly a phased approach
might be more...

563
00:43:50,157 --> 00:43:51,357
Take them off.

564
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:53,265
Don't be silly.

565
00:43:53,385 --> 00:43:55,741
Take them off now, JJ,
and get in here.

566
00:44:06,374 --> 00:44:09,152
This is a once only charity event,
you understand.

567
00:44:09,874 --> 00:44:11,659
Got you. Because you're gay.

568
00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:14,298
I'm gay.

569
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:22,904
Get on with it.

570
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:40,795
In you pop.

571
00:44:47,189 --> 00:44:48,727
I'm lots of things, JJ,

572
00:44:49,124 --> 00:44:50,602
and I really like you.

573
00:44:51,143 --> 00:44:53,105
So this is between friends, yeah?

574
00:44:55,773 --> 00:44:57,073
Between friends.

575
00:45:02,053 --> 00:45:03,626
And I can be quite cute.

576
00:45:04,677 --> 00:45:05,677
You can.

577
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,372
Mum, this is Emily.

578
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,746
A friend of mine.

579
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,892
Would you like some tea?

580
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,320
Yeah, please. Thanks.

581
00:46:09,807 --> 00:46:11,465
So how was it last night?

582
00:47:26,824 --> 00:47:28,120
Beware the moon.
