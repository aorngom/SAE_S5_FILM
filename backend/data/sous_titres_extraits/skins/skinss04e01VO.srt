1
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:03,990
You've been aware of drug
dealers working your premises?

2
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:08,302
Because a responsible, conscientious
club owner like you would be aware.

3
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:09,513
Right, Alan?

4
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,508
Yes, of course.

5
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:17,219
How old was that last girl
we talked to would you say?

6
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,972
Fifteen, no older then sixteen.

7
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:27,665
We just got this new bouncer.

8
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:29,965
He's a bit of an idiot.

9
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:31,759
The girl's charming, you know...

10
00:04:34,255 --> 00:04:35,953
Did they charm you, too?

11
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:36,905
No.

12
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:39,484
Tonight, your night?

13
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:43,295
- Yes, I wanna tonight DJ.
- That's right.

14
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:45,901
You run it for Alan.

15
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:49,027
You're his boy.

16
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:57,475
Right, I want copies of your
licence, financial records

17
00:04:57,476 --> 00:04:59,628
purchase orders, guest lists, the lot.

18
00:05:00,326 --> 00:05:01,460
By tomorrow.

19
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,535
The club was over
capacity by 200 tonight.

20
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,199
Are you listening?

21
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:27,439
We let everybody in, underaged
people, they were all underage.

22
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:29,546
Yes, so?

23
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:31,465
And do you know drug dealers working

24
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:33,889
- we see them on that...
- I don't know that!

25
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:37,288
And neither do you, okay?

26
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:45,881
So shut the fuck up, Thomas.

27
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:48,293
Yeah?

28
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:54,318
- Bonus.
- What's for?

29
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,986
For shutting the fuck up.

30
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,439
And if you do slip up,

31
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:06,178
someone will come, Thomas,

32
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:09,485
and snap your fucking spine.

33
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:39,650
Come on.

34
00:07:18,378 --> 00:07:20,802
Thomas, where have you been?

35
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:22,812
Merde.

36
00:07:28,437 --> 00:07:29,874
Mom.

37
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,335
- God what's...
- Daniel is ill again.

38
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:34,443
Who is that with you?

39
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,075
Hello Kasoke.

40
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:40,575
You know my rules.

41
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:42,536
It was too late to get home.

42
00:07:42,537 --> 00:07:46,228
We're not gonna, you know, do anything.

43
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,695
Like what?

44
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:50,193
You know, having sex.

45
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,873
But we not gonna have
sex, we wouldn't do that.

46
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,085
No?

47
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:55,364
Yeah, I mean...

48
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,737
We have done stuff, possibly I'm not...

49
00:07:59,738 --> 00:08:01,906
Lows, probably you could say lows.

50
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:03,362
Okay maybe you should stop talking now.

51
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:07,480
Yeah just, "the whole truth, nothing
but the truth, so help me God", mh, no.

52
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:08,528
Bloody hell.

53
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:13,377
Someone tell me please, where
to find a virgin in this country.

54
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:20,120
Well, difficult.

55
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:36,983
Hold him up.

56
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:43,338
It's okay, Dan-Man. Thomas is here.

57
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:52,282
What were you doing that was more
important than your family this evening?

58
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:55,913
Speak to me boy.

59
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:59,263
Mom, a girl died tonight.

60
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:02,534
That's my club-nights.

61
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,933
I think she was on drugs, or any...

62
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:09,101
Now she's dead.

63
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:23,087
What's that?

64
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:24,500
Money.

65
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:26,267
We don't want it.

66
00:09:26,268 --> 00:09:29,147
- We do, we need it for...
- We don't want it!

67
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:31,425
Why do you bring
trouble to the door?

68
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:32,729
We have enough here.

69
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:45,845
Now go and do, what you're meant to do.

70
00:09:49,606 --> 00:09:51,702
I put Daniel to bed.

71
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,781
We were waiting for you.

72
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,559
Who are you?

73
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:20,345
Daniel wanted to story
about, I didn't mind...

74
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:22,977
I don't think you're selfish.

75
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,797
But I don't think you're tickly

76
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:30,703
Get off.

77
00:10:33,611 --> 00:10:35,562
Mom says, we've got to pray.

78
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,846
Please...

79
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:45,949
Kneeling.

80
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,127
Dear God in the sky, help
us to care for each-other,

81
00:10:57,128 --> 00:11:00,538
let the sun shine, send
us songs and keep us safe.

82
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,739
And don't kill Daniel.

83
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:09,009
- Right, don't do that.
- Amen.

84
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:12,622
- Sleep now, okay?
- Okay.

85
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:16,033
Night, Daniel.

86
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:19,224
Night.

87
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,513
Panda...

88
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,079
Panda, we can't, my mom will hear.

89
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,528
I don't care.

90
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:47,657
My blood feels frozen.

91
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:50,224
I keep seeing her face.

92
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:00,461
I need you.

93
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,371
Come on, Thomas, dance.

94
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:01,200
Friends, friends, please.

95
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:04,116
Remember the power of God.

96
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:10,691
Thomas, it's a long time
since we've seen you.

97
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:12,543
Yes, sorry.

98
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:15,826
He's fooling father,
fooling and fornicating.

99
00:14:15,827 --> 00:14:19,274
His friends, his girlfriend.
They are bad for him.

100
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,245
- You don't know my friends.
- I know enough.

101
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:24,986
- That girl, she is a who...
- Kasoki, please.

102
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:27,095
We do not fight here.

103
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:34,064
Thomas, I expect you to say
that your friends are not so bad.

104
00:14:34,445 --> 00:14:38,645
They love you and they are there for
you in times of need, no matter what.

105
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:40,130
- Yes?
- Yes.

106
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:44,385
Are you sure about that?

107
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:47,686
Thomas...

108
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:50,477
We are your people.

109
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:54,291
And we will never ever let you down.

110
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:56,877
But we are waiting for
you to take the first step.

111
00:14:56,878 --> 00:15:00,417
That first step into a wider world.

112
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:02,908
- That's Star Wars.
- Excuse me?

113
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:06,044
Obi-Wan Kenobi says that after
Luke gets shot by the floaty-thing.

114
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:06,979
Obi-Wan?

115
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,151
"Well done Luke, you have taken
your first step into a wider world."

116
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:16,864
- That's good.
- Yes,

117
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:20,596
because Obi-Wan Kenobi is like
God, but with better weapons.

118
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:27,327
Obi-Wan Kenobi rules.

119
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,791
Ok, everybody. Watch the card.

120
00:16:11,982 --> 00:16:13,577
See?

121
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,575
Thommo, how the fuck have
you did a-little, man?

122
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:20,493
- What do you want?
- Oh, all right...

123
00:16:20,494 --> 00:16:22,565
I just thought you might
wanna friend today, that's all.

124
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:25,261
Give me that shit with that girl.

125
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:27,204
She was fucked up beyond.

126
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:31,110
***

127
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:33,728
- You're not my friend.
- Okay, I'm just saying...

128
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,821
How do you know she was fucked up?

129
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,717
I don't. I mean you just...

130
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:46,205
Assume, don't you?

131
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:47,731
Yeah?

132
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:04,061
Excuse me.

133
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:09,672
You!

134
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:11,750
Yes?

135
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,837
Would you mind awfully not smoking?

136
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:17,384
Thank you.

137
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:21,036
Just thought that I pop down and say:

138
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:25,473
Hi I'm David Blood, your
new college director.

139
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:28,302
And. I'm saying "Hi".

140
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,592
What happened to Harriet?

141
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:33,210
Harriet has moved on.

142
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:36,038
- Why?
- Because, because, because...

143
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:38,939
Let me see, how can I put this?

144
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:43,692
Because this place is rubbish.

145
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:46,451
And so are you.

146
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:49,297
So now...

147
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,510
We're all about change.

148
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,075
Everything's going to change.

149
00:17:57,073 --> 00:17:58,760
We'll all do it together yes?

150
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,749
We can, change...

151
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:04,874
And if any of you find that difficult,

152
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:07,647
I want you to know that

153
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:09,584
I will find you,

154
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,074
I will interrogate you

155
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:14,920
I will expel you,

156
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:19,239
I will expunge you.

157
00:18:24,374 --> 00:18:25,621
Great.

158
00:18:26,003 --> 00:18:30,140
Doug has an announcement,
it's very important.

159
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:33,030
So I know we will all listen carefully.

160
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:35,524
Otherwise it's rude.

161
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:36,757
Isn't it, Doug?

162
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:40,807
Yes of course it is, David.

163
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:42,289
Professor Blood.

164
00:18:43,243 --> 00:18:44,959
Professor, yes.

165
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:49,748
So, welcome back everyone.

166
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:51,978
Oggy, oggy, oggy!

167
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,534
Great, lovely.

168
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:04,043
And I'm afraid the police
would like to interview you all.

169
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:09,615
Katie Fitch.

170
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:26,927
This is fucked up, I didn't even know the
girl. Why are they treating us like criminals?

171
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:28,130
Because she's dead.

172
00:19:28,746 --> 00:19:30,522
- And we were there.
- So?

173
00:19:30,523 --> 00:19:33,878
That doesn't make us responsible,
if some kid decides to off herself.

174
00:19:34,112 --> 00:19:36,093
Right Naomes? Naomes?

175
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:39,658
Yeah, it's fucked up.

176
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:50,434
Cook, we've gotta wait here.

177
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:52,047
I've gotta slash, don't I?

178
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,660
- Hey, Freds.
- Yeah?

179
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:03,902
Have you heard from her?

180
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:07,796
Who?

181
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,921
The Empress Cleopatra, who do you think?

182
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:13,503
Na.

183
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:18,379
Thought she might
just show up, you know?

184
00:20:19,347 --> 00:20:20,756
- First day back...
- Yeah.

185
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:23,177
Well, she didn't.

186
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:28,053
I touched a nerve.

187
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:30,650
Guys, you've got to not talk about Effy.

188
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:31,673
Why?

189
00:20:31,878 --> 00:20:33,331
She really fucked Freddy over.

190
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,869
No, we're just not going there.

191
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,522
I mean, me Cook and Freds,
we're getting through it.

192
00:20:40,314 --> 00:20:41,738
She dumped you all?

193
00:20:42,012 --> 00:20:42,746
Kind of.

194
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:46,194
Effy's gone and we're happy.

195
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:49,715
The status of the tribe is
protected. We're happy, right?

196
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:01,258
Good.

197
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,691
As long as we're all happy.

198
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:46,992
What are you doing, Cook?

199
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:49,882
What is this?

200
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:53,858
The dump police?

201
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:58,641
I'm thinking somebody
gave that girl drugs.

202
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,138
Yep. So?

203
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:04,506
It was you. I'll tell them.

204
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:06,956
Yeah? Fuck you, Thomas.

205
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:09,015
Tell them what you want, mate.

206
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:11,348
Never met the girl.

207
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:17,319
How's your girlfriend, Cook?

208
00:22:19,853 --> 00:22:21,995
I don't have a girlfriend, Thomas.

209
00:22:23,154 --> 00:22:24,402
How's yours?

210
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:26,857
Still got that dirty
little walt on her ass?

211
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:29,337
Come on then Thomas, come on at me.

212
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,459
Fucking never finished have we?

213
00:22:35,132 --> 00:22:36,423
Cook.

214
00:22:38,668 --> 00:22:40,913
Cops called your name, mate.

215
00:22:57,522 --> 00:22:58,916
Thomas?

216
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:01,762
What you doing?

217
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:04,594
Working. Just work.

218
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:08,247
Panda needs a hug.

219
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:11,984
Thommo?

220
00:23:18,553 --> 00:23:19,800
Come on.

221
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,265
Everybody's skipping next
period and going to White Hart.

222
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:23,923
We all need a drink, get some shots...

223
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:26,740
That's your answer to everything,
just go and get pissed?

224
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,951
No. Häagen-Dazs is the
answer to everything right?

225
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:40,606
Come on.

226
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:43,217
It's all just fucked up.

227
00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:48,446
I don't know anymore. Just don't know.

228
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,837
I know.

229
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,648
What you doing?

230
00:24:03,147 --> 00:24:05,568
Making us feel better, come on stupid.

231
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:14,627
No. I don't want to.

232
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,855
I'm sorry, I just,

233
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:26,467
I have to do this work, okay?

234
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,929
I have to get it done.

235
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,578
Fine.

236
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:05,839
Hello.

237
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,656
Hello.

238
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:13,043
Come up, I'm bursting.

239
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:15,616
I hate prayer group.

240
00:26:16,672 --> 00:26:18,770
Just wait, you have
to be good here, okay?

241
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:20,375
I gotta go, I'm telling you.

242
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:22,561
She always needs to go. Girls.

243
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:24,351
Yes. Why can't you at the right time?

244
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:28,840
This is the right time
moron, I gotta w-e-e.

245
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:32,713
Thomas, welcome.

246
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:39,370
Oh, you came. Cool.
This is Thomas, dad.

247
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:43,610
Oh yes. I know who he is.

248
00:26:47,176 --> 00:26:49,421
It's coming out.

249
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:53,631
Quiet! Everybody, quiet!

250
00:26:55,608 --> 00:26:57,339
Everybody.

251
00:26:57,838 --> 00:27:00,831
Everybody, Jesus. Get shut up!

252
00:27:01,873 --> 00:27:05,306
Now we were just about to sing a song,
weren't we? So what should we sing?

253
00:27:05,307 --> 00:27:06,989
- Rihanna!
- Lady Gaga!

254
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,236
Beyoncé!

255
00:27:08,237 --> 00:27:10,710
Those are all people,
who can't really sing,

256
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:13,762
don't wear very many clothes
and get married far too young.

257
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:15,627
What do we call that sorts of people?

258
00:27:15,628 --> 00:27:20,101
- Americans!
- That's right, Americans.

259
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:21,657
Now listen.

260
00:27:41,406 --> 00:27:42,976
What?

261
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:45,558
- Come on, sing.
- Sing, sucker!

262
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,065
Enjoying yourself?

263
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:51,692
Yes, it's fun.

264
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,658
I'm wondering...

265
00:28:54,245 --> 00:28:58,295
How is it you spend over a year
at the same college as my daughter,

266
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:00,044
and only just met?

267
00:29:01,385 --> 00:29:03,439
- I don't know.
- I do, Thomas.

268
00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:08,392
After I spoke to you, you started
noticing things, didn't you?

269
00:29:08,932 --> 00:29:11,925
Things that have always been
there, but you have never seen.

270
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,485
I suppose. She's beautiful.

271
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:21,509
- She is a beautiful singer.
- She is. She serves the Lord.

272
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:26,124
If you put your trust in
him and obey his rules,

273
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:30,443
you see the world in a
new way, it's wonderful.

274
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:32,616
Just...

275
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:38,000
Open up your heart, Thomas
and give me your soul.

276
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:41,565
Give it to me.

277
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:49,677
Thomas, Daniel's sick. Thomas!

278
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:51,995
Oh, my God.

279
00:29:52,377 --> 00:29:54,372
Daniel, sit up.

280
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,041
It's okay.

281
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,978
It's okay, Daniel. I got you.

282
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:05,626
Lung infection. It's okay,
we'll clear it up.

283
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,615
Is he okay?

284
00:30:09,037 --> 00:30:10,743
- Daniel.
- He's fine,

285
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:13,182
Mrs. Tomoni. We're on top of it.
They brought him straight here.

286
00:30:13,183 --> 00:30:16,615
I told you to look after them,
what did you do to my baby,

287
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:18,265
Mum, I brought him to
Pastor Babajide's house.

288
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:21,034
It concerns me that this is
the third incident in six weeks

289
00:30:21,035 --> 00:30:22,355
So?

290
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:24,661
Now I'm just saying, if there
is an environmental factor,

291
00:30:24,662 --> 00:30:27,045
if your house is damp or dusty...

292
00:30:27,046 --> 00:30:28,916
- My house is clean.
- Yes, right,

293
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:30,876
but he shouldn't be here this often.

294
00:30:30,877 --> 00:30:34,177
I look after my children, you
can mind your own business.

295
00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:37,616
Mum, the house is dump.
There's mold and the walls are wet.

296
00:30:39,427 --> 00:30:41,720
- We can't get rid of it.
- Right.

297
00:30:41,721 --> 00:30:45,067
Well, then that would...
perhaps social services.

298
00:30:45,456 --> 00:30:48,872
Who are you? You don't know me.

299
00:30:51,411 --> 00:30:53,818
What do you know about
bringing children up?

300
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:57,647
I've given everything
to you, all my life.

301
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,618
And now you want to tell me what to do?

302
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:01,957
You have no respect.

303
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:05,079
If your father was here,
he would beat you.

304
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,876
My father is dead and
he is no use to us!

305
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:16,151
- Is he all right?
- No he's not, nothing's all right.

306
00:31:16,152 --> 00:31:18,121
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

307
00:31:27,374 --> 00:31:30,354
Thomas, hang on please.

308
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,971
- What's the matter?
- I can't stand this place.

309
00:31:35,972 --> 00:31:37,736
- This country, no one understands.
- It's all right.

310
00:31:37,737 --> 00:31:39,433
No, nothing makes sense. I can't...

311
00:31:39,434 --> 00:31:40,785
I just can't...

312
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,919
I can't do it. I can't.

313
00:33:10,811 --> 00:33:12,255
It's all right.

314
00:33:13,081 --> 00:33:14,983
It's all right, Thomas.

315
00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:18,170
It's all right.

316
00:33:44,242 --> 00:33:49,079
Something said to me, we need to cheer
up, what we need is a Reese-a-thon.

317
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,684
Oh, and I brought JJ.

318
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,130
What I like about Reese is,
she is a virgin you can believe in.

319
00:34:00,953 --> 00:34:03,543
- What's this one called again?
- Red neck bride.

320
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:05,736
I feel that was "The Last One".

321
00:34:05,737 --> 00:34:07,439
No, that was "That Damn Man".

322
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,278
Got it, she is ****

323
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:12,006
No, that's "Kentucky Bride Hitchin'".

324
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:21,721
Go on, get one. Go on.

325
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:23,683
I'm all right.

326
00:34:24,254 --> 00:34:26,029
- I got your favorites.
- I'm not hungry.

327
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:28,545
What's wrong? Don't you like the film?

328
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,015
It doesn't make sense.

329
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:32,508
What do you mean?

330
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:36,567
Now you don't understand, why Reese
goes back to Matthew McConaughey

331
00:34:36,568 --> 00:34:38,105
after he slept with Rachel McAdams.

332
00:34:38,762 --> 00:34:40,429
No, I gotta say, you make a fair point.

333
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,499
No, I don't mean that.

334
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,846
Yes, but Reese forgave
him, he made a mistake.

335
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:45,760
That's what I love about her,
when you make a mistake...

336
00:34:45,761 --> 00:34:46,828
I slept with someone.

337
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:50,724
Go on, she hid the ring
in her bra, you tit!

338
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:52,828
You gonna use the metal detector again.

339
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:55,410
Idiot.

340
00:34:55,865 --> 00:34:56,789
What?

341
00:34:57,684 --> 00:34:59,753
I slept with someone, it wasn't you.

342
00:34:59,754 --> 00:35:01,572
Na, na, na, that's not it.

343
00:35:01,573 --> 00:35:03,861
She is going make him think,
she put the horse down...

344
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:06,810
and then she's gonna sleep with him,
'cause she thinks they're still married.

345
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:11,431
You did it first.

346
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,764
- You did what?
- I did it!

347
00:35:17,765 --> 00:35:20,449
I did it, okay? I wanted to.

348
00:35:23,442 --> 00:35:25,379
You fucked it, Thommo.

349
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:50,294
Ah, Thomas, would you
mind coming with me?

350
00:36:53,771 --> 00:36:56,926
Involvement in the girl's death,

351
00:36:56,927 --> 00:36:59,346
brings your college into disrepute,

352
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:04,193
and for that reason I am
going to expel you.

353
00:37:06,117 --> 00:37:07,601
Vodka.

354
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:37,384
Another.

355
00:37:57,452 --> 00:37:59,194
Hey, it's Thommo.

356
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:02,991
How the fuck are you still deadly
married, jamming cheating todger?

357
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:04,916
What did you say?

358
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:07,715
- Everyone knows, mate.
- Your such a tit, Thomas.

359
00:38:07,716 --> 00:38:09,748
- She loved you.
- Yup.

360
00:38:09,749 --> 00:38:11,479
Pissed on our Panda Pop, didn't you?

361
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:15,077
Who's the lucky lady
anyway, to got Congo-cocked?

362
00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:19,757
This is for selling drugs
in my club, you bastard.

363
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:21,988
- Now the girl is dead.
- Thomas.

364
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:24,731
She is dead you cunt.
You fucking killed her.

365
00:38:25,793 --> 00:38:28,654
Break it up, you should stop it.

366
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:30,370
- Stop.
- Stop.

367
00:38:30,371 --> 00:38:32,014
Dead, dead girl.

368
00:38:32,615 --> 00:38:34,479
Thomas stop.

369
00:38:34,948 --> 00:38:36,621
Come on, then you fucking...

370
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:41,066
Thomas, Thomas. It was
me, I gave it to her.

371
00:38:41,844 --> 00:38:44,191
What? You what?

372
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:49,514
Cook, Cook dealt me
the powder, that was it.

373
00:38:50,365 --> 00:38:54,576
I needed the money, and I
just sold it to some random.

374
00:38:55,412 --> 00:38:57,290
She died. She is dead!

375
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:58,625
I didn't mean that.

376
00:38:59,945 --> 00:39:01,853
Please don't tell anyone.

377
00:39:02,528 --> 00:39:04,230
Do not tell Emily.

378
00:39:05,418 --> 00:39:07,003
She would...

379
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,081
Thomas.

380
00:39:48,961 --> 00:39:52,057
Good evening Papa Babaj... Babaj ...

381
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:52,864
You're drunk.

382
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:54,214
No, no...

383
00:39:54,844 --> 00:40:00,097
I was wondering, if maybe
I could possibly see Andrea.

384
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:04,822
I feel sorry for you, Thomas.

385
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,574
No, no. I need to talk to...

386
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:15,286
Andrea!

387
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,992
I need to talk to you.

388
00:40:24,346 --> 00:40:27,445
Thomas!

389
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,961
I need to speak to someone.

390
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,858
So tell me what you
did that's so terrible.

391
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:47,627
I betrayed someone, I love.

392
00:40:48,498 --> 00:40:50,057
With you.

393
00:40:57,324 --> 00:40:58,745
I see.

394
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:05,271
You feel so right.

395
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:10,452
Everything about you ... is like home.

396
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:14,303
- But...
- It doesn't work like that.

397
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:18,980
You love her.

398
00:41:30,594 --> 00:41:33,047
Good bye, Thomas.

399
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:55,623
I don't know, why we came here.

400
00:41:57,296 --> 00:41:59,497
For a better life.

401
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,151
I can change things.

402
00:42:40,313 --> 00:42:42,949
You will love this place.

403
00:42:48,978 --> 00:42:52,234
Make your deposit now
and it'll be yours today.

404
00:43:12,946 --> 00:43:14,047
Can I come in?

405
00:43:14,048 --> 00:43:16,247
No, you fucker.

406
00:43:18,104 --> 00:43:22,758
Pandora, we started again
before, can we do it now.

407
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,847
I don't think so.

408
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,634
But I love you Panda.

409
00:43:39,427 --> 00:43:41,246
I know you do, Thomas.

410
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,841
I told him no like you said.

411
00:44:15,956 --> 00:44:17,086
Good.

412
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:20,319
Eat up.

413
00:44:23,444 --> 00:44:27,240
Well done, he needs to
think about what he did.

414
00:44:30,287 --> 00:44:32,854
I'm glad you're back, Eff.
