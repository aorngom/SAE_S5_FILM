1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,068
This is our place and if
you're not going to shag us then...

2
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:07,040
get to fuck.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000
- She didn't kiss me, OK?
- {\Yes, she did, }She practically jumped on you.

4
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:12,098
- I kissed her.
- So, can I just say again?

5
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:15,000
Me, not muff muncher.
Me, cock cruncher.

6
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,543
- Do you want me to show you?
- What do I want? Surfing and turfing.

7
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:20,600
When do I want it? Now.

8
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:25,022
- Effy, I've come to tell you...
- Freddie.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Now you know.

10
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:29,879
<i>Me, you and JJ.</i>

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,835
<i>Best mates for life.</i>

00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,120
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck?

16
00:01:32,284 --> 00:01:34,644
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm a friend of your Mum's...

17
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:36,955
I had nowhere to kip.
Sweetheart, isn't she?

18
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:39,065
Even if she doesn't believe
I'm the actual messiah.

19
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:41,000
Mum...! Mum!

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,310
Who the hell does she think she is?
This is bloody ridiculous,

21
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,309
does nobody understand privacy?

22
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:51,139
I'm naked.

23
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:53,313
I sleep naked.

24
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:56,077
Nothing I haven't seen before.
You look like your mum, actually.

25
00:01:56,197 --> 00:01:58,400
You've even got
the same haircut she has.

26
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:03,514
Mum!

27
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:07,400
- I can see why you find it offensive...
- It's not just the shape,

28
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:09,800
- it's the skin...
- It's a very aggressive texture.

29
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:11,599
Positively patriarchal.

30
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,360
Definitely patriarchal.

31
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:20,696
Mum.

32
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:25,080
Has anyone ever told you
what a complete fucking cow you are?

33
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,471
Plenty of people.
Look at this would you, love?

34
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:29,726
We're thinking of banning it
in the group shopping list.

35
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:32,640
There's a man.
In my room. In my bed!

36
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,040
He had nowhere else to go.
It's called communal living, sweetie...

37
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:38,760
God! You're so... irritating!

38
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:48,444
Kids...

39
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:50,055
Immature...

40
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:39,800
- I'm late. Am I late?
- Course not...

41
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,183
Besides, this is hardly
an appointment is it?

42
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:44,247
Kept behind by Cruella De Ville.

43
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:47,386
And what did
the college director want?

44
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:51,080
To send me on a motivation course...
The Feeling, Healing Teaching Programme.

45
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:52,508
Fuck's sake!

46
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:55,228
And guess what?
I fucking hate teaching!

47
00:03:58,443 --> 00:03:59,570
So, how's your Mum?

48
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,024
Still saving the world
one lentil at a time?

49
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:05,120
Well, you know... Sometimes she's up.
Sometimes she's down.

50
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:08,760
Sometimes she's only half-way up,
which is neither up nor down.

51
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,252
And the Mother Nature thing
is getting tired.

52
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:15,680
I've got 15 people living in
my house, and none are paying rent!

53
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:19,452
Still, can't be all bad.

54
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,044
Made you, didn't she?

55
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,318
Though apparently
Fred West's daughter's a charm.

56
00:04:25,438 --> 00:04:26,912
Hope for us all.

57
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,720
Right so, that's me.
See you in assembly...

58
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,720
Our glorious leader
has summoned us all.

59
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:35,280
- You're gonna like this...
- Like what?

60
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:38,640
You'll find out...
Just be there, missy.

61
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,560
- What's going on there?
- Nothing.

62
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:12,459
Shut up!

63
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,545
Then you've got
the shaft of your penis...

64
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:44,377
In ancient times before the now.

65
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,637
There was an almighty blazing row.

66
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:51,246
Between two kingdoms tall and proud.

67
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,557
How to decide this without blood?

68
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:58,799
Right, settle down everyone...

69
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:00,801
Thank you, Doug,

70
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,705
fascinating introduction.

71
00:06:02,825 --> 00:06:04,484
- But I'm not finished!
- Yes, you are!

72
00:06:04,604 --> 00:06:06,800
Let's put it to a vote!

73
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:10,199
Bit of theatre, you know... Impact.

74
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:11,925
OK, it's simple.

75
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:13,945
We want a Student President.

76
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:16,640
This will be a...

77
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:19,513
democratically empowered position,

78
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:21,174
for a talented individual,

79
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:23,222
to proactively seek excellence

80
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,120
in matters
of student representation.

81
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:30,437
And you,
my little education consumers,

82
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,237
will choose this president by vote.

83
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:36,125
The election is next week
so if you wish to stand,

84
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:38,000
please see Doug after assembly.

85
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:40,147
Can I just...

86
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,374
I've got a whole rhyme
worked out for that bit...

87
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:44,036
No. Please. No.

88
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,364
I just thought you'd like it,
it's a clever pun on Doug,

89
00:06:48,484 --> 00:06:51,783
digging, and I'm awfully nasty
about the Welsh...

90
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:55,326
- You've got to be joking.
- I'm not gonna help run this place.

91
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:57,137
I don't get it, why not?

92
00:06:57,507 --> 00:07:00,187
- You really care about this stuff.
- What stuff?

93
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:03,280
Equality, environmentalism,
feminism,

94
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:06,390
I don't ever want
to shut my mouth-ism...

95
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,591
Great. You're making me sound great.

96
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,196
Come on.

97
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:13,120
Come on, you know about politics,
you're always talking about it.

98
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:18,009
We've had about three conversations
our entire lives.

99
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:22,129
So the idea that you know I'm always
talking about anything is ridiculous.

100
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:26,206
Morning ladies.

101
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:27,954
Love is all around.

102
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:30,792
- Piss off.
- Naomikins, I've been thinking.

103
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,400
You should see more cock.

104
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:36,080
Pardon?

105
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,120
Me and you. We should go to it.
Know what I'm saying?

106
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:40,508
Excuse me?

107
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:41,882
Go to it?

108
00:07:42,937 --> 00:07:43,920
Definitely.

109
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,987
You've got about as much chance
of fucking me

110
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:48,879
as becoming the democratic elected
Student President of this dump.

111
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,920
I enjoy a challenge.

112
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:54,400
Babe... You have got a deal.

113
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,030
What?

114
00:07:56,829 --> 00:07:58,879
I didn't mean it like that.
I'm not going to...

115
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,822
- Guaranteed a shag.
- What?

116
00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:12,256
- Name?
- Crispin.

117
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:14,089
Second name?

118
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,223
That's it, sir. Just Crispin.

119
00:08:16,343 --> 00:08:19,370
Like Prince, Madonna, Cher,
Lemar... Only Crispin.

120
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,681
And what are your policies, Crispin?

121
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,889
A tightening of college
selection procedure.

122
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,680
They let some awful shit
in this place.

123
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:29,534
Like him, for instance.

124
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,000
All right, Doug? Is this where
you register to be president, yeah?

125
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,520
You? President?

126
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:36,338
Yeah, man. Problem?

127
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:42,680
Fantastic, a two-horse race!

128
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:45,520
Let the best man win.

129
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,832
So, just fill the form in.

130
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:16,640
Girls. Stupid.

131
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:18,911
You're all so stupid.

132
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:28,686
I can see your knickers.

133
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:33,573
- You? President?
- Why do people keep saying that?

134
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,617
Me, president. You, my slave.

135
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,585
Why you fighting it, Naomi?

136
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,400
You want it. I want it.
Let's get together and feel all right.

137
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:48,488
You couldn't make me feel all right
if you stapled your tongue to my clit

138
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:50,508
and stood on a cement mixer.

139
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:57,189
Too pussy to take a chance,
little girl.

140
00:09:58,146 --> 00:10:00,959
- See you next time.
- Yeah, you love me.

141
00:10:06,156 --> 00:10:08,113
I was going to ask you
if you wanted a lift.

142
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,144
- What?
- You know, save your legs.

143
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:11,800
Your wheels. Only if you...

144
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:16,652
- You can give me a lift.
- Great.

145
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,375
Hang on.

146
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,443
- Mind the spring.
- Where?

147
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:49,450
This is some automobile
you've got here.

148
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:52,754
Would you believe
it only cost me £2.50?

149
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,421
And three tokens from
the top of Weetabix packets.

150
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,322
Yeah, I really would believe that.

151
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,215
Come on, come on...

152
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:07,430
Can you give me a lift on your bike?

153
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:12,972
It's all part
of her grand love note to Ofsted.

154
00:11:13,092 --> 00:11:14,985
It looks good to have
a student president.

155
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:16,670
Will that person have power?

156
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,222
Will they bollocks.

157
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:21,080
I ran for office once...

158
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,047
Oh, yes. You're looking
at the Workers Unite candidate,

159
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,840
Bristol City Council,
Redland Ward, 1998.

160
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:28,703
I bet that went well for you.

161
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:31,479
I got six votes,
and I knew three of them personally.

162
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:34,182
But then, buoyed up by my success,

163
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:37,920
I decided to dedicate my life
to shaping the young minds of tomorrow.

164
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:40,128
Only to discover
they don't have minds,

165
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:42,607
only mild jangling things
between their ears.

166
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:46,152
Mild jangly things that are colour-
co-ordinated to go with their shoes!

167
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:51,292
I think you should stand.

168
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:52,841
What? Why?

169
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:55,419
Come on. You're the best,
we both know it.

170
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:59,200
Is that a compliment?
Are you complimenting me?

171
00:11:59,537 --> 00:12:01,644
I've got a few compliments in me.

172
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:06,320
Listen, is it my drug problem,
or is someone waving at that window?

173
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,105
God, it's my mum. Don't look.

174
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:12,166
Shit. She's so embarrassing!

175
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:14,497
I want to meet
this mythical creature.

176
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:19,469
Right.

177
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
Thanks.

178
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:34,602
You wanna do something about this girl.
There is fungal matter in the oven!

179
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:36,282
You are fungal matter!

180
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:38,280
It says on the rota
it's your job to clean it.

181
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:40,979
How many feminists does it take
to change a light bulb?

182
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:44,542
One. Me. Because I'm oppressed.
You're oppressing me.

183
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:47,477
The Messiah does not oppress,
OK? He enlightens.

184
00:12:47,597 --> 00:12:50,102
I'll fucking enlighten you,
you patriarchal prick!

185
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:51,782
Jesus does not do fungus.

186
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:54,199
Really, does he not do fungus?

187
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:58,833
I was waving! You were with a man!

188
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:03,114
- What is this? Surveillance culture?
- I was just saying. He looked nice.

189
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:06,100
He's my politics teacher, all right?

190
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,865
Okay, just saying.

191
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,926
Nice to see you with a guy.
Makes a change.

192
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:14,346
Anyway, do you wanna come
and help me feed...?

193
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,226
You don't even know who you're feeding?
This is our house, Mum!

194
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:19,400
Of course it is.

195
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:22,676
I think someone stole
the telly from your room.

196
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
Who are you? Who is this?

197
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,666
Jesus, is there never any peace?!

198
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:34,360
- How did you get in here?
- This weird guy let me in.

199
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:36,681
Looks a bit like Jesus?

200
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:41,482
It's like a game of Christ-themed
Guess Who in this house.

201
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:44,582
- What do you want?
- Wanted to give you this.

202
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:47,040
You're very annoying.

203
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:48,880
You seem to inspire it in me.

204
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:51,654
Jinx.

205
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,538
You're gonna run? Great.

206
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,759
- I'll help with the form.
- No, Emily, I don't need any help.

207
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,066
Right. OK. Well, see you.

208
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:15,052
Just so you know,

209
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:17,960
my first thought when I see you
is not, "I want to fuck that girl."

210
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,365
We've kissed. Twice. It was nice.

211
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,988
But it's also nice
just being with you,

212
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:26,230
when you're not being a prick,
that is.

213
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:28,482
Thanks.

214
00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:32,174
You should run for President
because I think you'd be good at it.

215
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:33,867
It's that simple, okay?

216
00:14:37,705 --> 00:14:39,290
Then you should... stay.

217
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,014
Thanks. I will.

218
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,920
<i>I can just see it now... in lights.</i>

219
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:54,566
"Naomi - Get to know me!"

220
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:57,736
I thought it was quite catchy.

221
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,798
Yeah, well, so's AIDS.

222
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:07,505
- Do you think I can do it?
- I think you can do anything.

223
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:09,029
Really?

224
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:16,529
I've been wondering...

225
00:15:23,717 --> 00:15:25,680
What do lesbians... do?

226
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:30,482
I mean, in bed.

227
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:32,498
I know what you mean!

228
00:15:32,854 --> 00:15:34,680
- But why would I know?
- You've never...?

229
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:36,523
No, I've never!

230
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:40,254
I mean...

231
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:43,823
Is it all brogues
and strap-ons, or...?

232
00:15:46,287 --> 00:15:48,099
I don't know. They just...

233
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:51,320
do what we do to ourselves.
Only to each other.

234
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:53,703
Probably slightly more aggressively.

235
00:15:53,823 --> 00:15:55,432
And with, you know,

236
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:57,826
oils and stuff.

237
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:09,619
Oils?

238
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:12,367
And stuff.

239
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:27,560
Oilssss.

240
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:31,379
Lots of it.

241
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:32,714
Oils.

242
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,900
Where do you put it? Oils?

243
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:39,360
On salad.

244
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:14,826
Fuck's sake.

245
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:26,213
What are you doing?

246
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:48,710
<i>I am Cook! Vote for me!</i>

247
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,760
- <i>Vote for non-stop partying!</i>
- Oh, God.

248
00:17:55,638 --> 00:17:58,040
- Who's up there with him?
- JJ.

249
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,640
- Think I lost him.
- What, JJ?

250
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,531
Yeah, him too.

251
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:15,623
Is this about Effy?

252
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:18,535
That obvious, is it?

253
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,562
- So tell her.
- I did.

254
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:27,461
It should make a difference when
someone loves you. Shouldn't it?

255
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:28,835
<i>We love to party!</i>

256
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,839
<i>We love to party!</i>

257
00:18:54,491 --> 00:18:56,091
You left pretty early.

258
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:58,400
I had things to do, you know?

259
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:01,959
I met your mum.

260
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,121
Did you?

261
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,674
- She's nice.
- She's a cliche.

262
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:08,765
- She's a nice cliche.
- Is she?

263
00:19:12,174 --> 00:19:13,274
Emily, look.

264
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,240
I forgot to tell you.
I made these in anticipation.

265
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:18,081
Cool, huh?

266
00:19:19,864 --> 00:19:21,400
I got the message, Naomi.

267
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:23,192
I'll manage.

268
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:26,049
But there is one thing, though.

269
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,320
You can't let him win, now, can you?

270
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,000
<i>Cook before education!</i>

271
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:38,240
<i>Sex before exams!</i>

272
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:45,860
<i>I'm asking for one-to-one tuition
to achieve your goals,</i>

273
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,200
<i>work experience and...</i>

274
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,172
My name is Crispin, that's my name

275
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:56,079
I don't like chavs, that's my game

276
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:57,545
If you vote for me

277
00:19:57,665 --> 00:20:00,824
Like a princess and a pea
I'll free you from their menace.

278
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,560
A wigada-wigada-whack
West Morningside!

279
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,600
Next up, Naomi.

280
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,760
What this college needs is
somebody who'll understand...

281
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,480
- Council has to mean something...
- Give a look to the man Cook!

282
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,527
Excuse me. Everyone.

283
00:20:53,803 --> 00:20:55,960
Can I just...?
Can you listen, please?

284
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:02,519
If you vote for me, I'll make sure each
and every one of your voices is heard.

285
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,751
I'll make it my business to get
to know each...

286
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:05,871
Apples!

287
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:11,181
Apples and pears. Get your apples.
Apples and pears.

288
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:14,477
- Apples and pears. Apples!
- {\See, }This is what you've got to decide.

289
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,960
- Do you want a comedy president...?
- Banana!

290
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,730
You're such a fucking joke!

291
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,907
I'm a joke?
You're fucking hilarious!

292
00:21:25,027 --> 00:21:26,880
At least I care about something.

293
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,400
- There are issues.
- What's{\ so} good about caring? No-one here{\*cares}.

294
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:31,193
We just wanna party!

295
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,954
Any chance you could be
a cunt over there, d'you think?

296
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:44,912
That's nice.

297
00:21:45,626 --> 00:21:48,000
Getting your girlfriend
to hold your hand.

298
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,400
Bit of moral support, yeah?
Sweet, innit?

299
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Sweet.

300
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,560
If I'm a joke, at least
people can have a laugh...

301
00:21:57,971 --> 00:22:00,226
Caring's over-rated.
Do you want to know my slogan?

302
00:22:00,346 --> 00:22:02,040
I'm Cook. Vote for me.

303
00:22:02,383 --> 00:22:03,957
I don't give a fuck either.

304
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,000
- Wait, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- Just leave me alone!

305
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:30,920
I hate him!

306
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,570
He's a ball bag, right?

307
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:38,307
I was such a dick.

308
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,910
- Such a dick.
- What's a bit of public humiliation?

309
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,867
I'm a teacher, I'm used to it.

310
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,661
People fuck you up every day.

311
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:50,087
Yep. Every day.

312
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,292
After a while
you get to kind of like it.

313
00:22:53,469 --> 00:22:54,769
No, I'm serious.

314
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
There.

315
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:04,953
You look so much prettier
when you smile.

316
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:09,413
I don't get it.

317
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,137
Why are you so nice
and all other men are such wankers?

318
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:15,959
Now you've got me.

319
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:27,282
- What?
- What?

320
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,400
But you're...

321
00:23:28,731 --> 00:23:30,541
You're old enough to be my dad!

322
00:23:31,513 --> 00:23:33,783
Maths was never
my strong suit, but I think,

323
00:23:33,903 --> 00:23:35,181
you know, not quite!

324
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:40,321
- I thought you liked me!
- I do. And I do.

325
00:23:40,592 --> 00:23:43,254
- What did you just do?
- You wanted me to kiss you.

326
00:23:43,374 --> 00:23:44,374
But I just...

327
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:46,760
I wanted to trust you.

328
00:23:47,402 --> 00:23:48,889
No, you can...

329
00:23:51,277 --> 00:23:52,277
trust me.

330
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:22,124
Fuck off!

331
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:48,478
Can we go somewhere?

332
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:51,080
Anywhere.

333
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:50,489
It's lovely.

334
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:52,316
It's a lovely place.

335
00:26:53,187 --> 00:26:54,844
It's one of my favourites.

336
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,769
I didn't bring a swimming costume.

337
00:27:06,701 --> 00:27:07,901
Neither did I.

338
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,960
- The sun won't shine forever.
- Someone might be looking.

339
00:27:15,743 --> 00:27:17,882
Honey, your body ain't that special.

340
00:27:20,351 --> 00:27:21,602
Don't look, OK?

341
00:27:21,782 --> 00:27:22,582
Fine.

342
00:27:43,648 --> 00:27:44,749
I said don't look!

343
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:48,276
- I wasn't looking, you just...
- You were looking. You were perving.

344
00:27:52,628 --> 00:27:53,400
Come on.

345
00:27:54,243 --> 00:27:55,080
Get in!

346
00:27:59,682 --> 00:28:01,596
- Oh, Jesus!
- It's freezing!

347
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,578
You all right, Em?

348
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,560
Hello?

349
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:22,877
Hello?

350
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,639
You deaf or what?

351
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,463
{\You know, }That's the first time
you've asked me something.

352
00:28:27,588 --> 00:28:29,132
- What, today?
- Ever.

353
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,391
Well, answer it then.
You all right?

354
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:37,446
I'm having
the worst time of my life.

355
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:40,072
The weather's shit.
The company's even worse.

356
00:28:40,197 --> 00:28:40,997
Amen.

357
00:28:48,543 --> 00:28:49,679
It's peaceful.

358
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,208
Do you wanna do blowbacks?

359
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:15,435
I never got blowbacks.

360
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,880
Why can't people just smoke
the damn things straight?

361
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,159
It's fun.
Have you even tried it?

362
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:25,058
But being all seeing,
I already know it's shit.

363
00:29:28,277 --> 00:29:29,996
Come on. Everything once.

364
00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:33,756
Oh, fuck it.
Go ahead and disappoint me.

365
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:34,870
Say something.

366
00:30:36,512 --> 00:30:38,377
I'm all about experiments, me.

367
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:01,880
Twice!

368
00:32:02,305 --> 00:32:04,754
You're gonna do this to me, twice!

369
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:10,076
- You fucking stop right now!
- What?

370
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,970
Don't you dare leave me
in your bed again.

371
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:14,560
I've got to go.

372
00:32:16,422 --> 00:32:18,996
I know you, Naomi.
I know you're lonely.

373
00:32:19,478 --> 00:32:21,703
I think you need
someone to want you.

374
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:24,902
I do want you.

375
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:27,394
So be brave.

376
00:32:28,537 --> 00:32:29,810
And want me back!

377
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:29,605
Mum.

378
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:35,513
I know it's early but...

379
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:42,556
This is my fucking house!

380
00:33:44,644 --> 00:33:46,658
Naomi! For the love of God!

381
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:47,896
Stop will you!

382
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:50,421
I came looking for you,
to apologise.

383
00:33:51,182 --> 00:33:53,977
She was here. We got talking.
She's a nice...

384
00:33:54,308 --> 00:33:56,676
Naomi, please.
I'm a fucking disaster, OK?

385
00:33:57,407 --> 00:33:58,320
I just...

386
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:00,364
I'm lonely.

387
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:01,941
Fuck off!

388
00:34:28,508 --> 00:34:31,655
Right. Well, these aren't going
to count themselves.

389
00:34:33,225 --> 00:34:35,291
There's one thing
I want to make clear to you.

390
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:38,317
- That boy will not win.
- Cook? He might win.

391
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,427
He seems very popular.

392
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:43,171
He will not win.

393
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:48,352
I mean...

394
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,118
That goes against...

395
00:34:50,975 --> 00:34:53,066
I'm totally against that. Totally...

396
00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:56,644
Don't you have a career review
assessment with me next week?

397
00:34:57,352 --> 00:34:59,996
Totally agree. He will not win.

398
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,164
Right.

399
00:35:01,604 --> 00:35:05,051
This is how it will work.
Vote for Naomi, this pile.

400
00:35:05,502 --> 00:35:08,105
Vote for Crispin, this pile.

401
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:09,956
Someone voted for Crispin?

402
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,567
Vote for Cook, this pile.

403
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:15,244
Right.

404
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:17,444
Right.

405
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:23,064
- I think we're gonna need a bigger bra.
- Shut up and get on with it.

406
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:24,588
Drum roll, please.

407
00:35:38,897 --> 00:35:39,897
Thank you.

408
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:41,283
And...

409
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:42,895
the winner...

410
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:44,097
is...

411
00:35:50,454 --> 00:35:53,165
Naomi, do you have a few words?

412
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:07,836
- You should have more confidence.
- What?

413
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:10,156
I mean, your tits are fine.

414
00:36:10,575 --> 00:36:11,575
What?

415
00:36:20,364 --> 00:36:23,095
Now, I'm not sure,
but were these votes counted?

416
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:28,701
Stop the silliness.
Celebrate. You've won.

417
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:30,738
Cook won.

418
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:32,996
He's our President.

419
00:36:45,682 --> 00:36:49,052
And my first act
as President of this school,

420
00:36:49,963 --> 00:36:52,693
is to declare this riot open!

421
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,940
So...

422
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:42,985
Where does this go next?

423
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,761
Burning all the gym equipment or
shitting in the College Director's desk?

424
00:37:46,886 --> 00:37:48,440
I tell you, I'd be up for either.

425
00:37:52,656 --> 00:37:53,560
I'm sorry.

426
00:37:56,449 --> 00:37:59,178
You're supposed
to be flattered by my intention.

427
00:37:59,303 --> 00:38:01,516
But ultimately,
honourably, unobtainable.

428
00:38:03,797 --> 00:38:05,481
A bit too flattered maybe.

429
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
A bit too

430
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:08,760
obtainable.

431
00:38:09,384 --> 00:38:11,432
- A bit of a twat.
- Yeah, maybe.

432
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,080
Do you like her?

433
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:17,875
She's...

434
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,000
She's right.

435
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:25,436
So go tell her, will you?

436
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:28,579
Sure.

437
00:38:31,154 --> 00:38:32,154
Thanks!

438
00:38:49,518 --> 00:38:51,344
I'm looking for three pornos,

439
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,814
two ninja stars and a butt plug
that Kieran fucker confiscated.

440
00:38:55,528 --> 00:38:57,160
Think you'll be expelled for this?

441
00:38:57,853 --> 00:39:00,351
They'll have to explain why,
wouldn't they?

442
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:02,251
I reckon, when this is over,

443
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:04,853
they'll try and pretend
it never happened.

444
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:08,129
- You're probably right.
- I entered to piss you off, obviously.

445
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:09,254
Obviously.

446
00:39:13,864 --> 00:39:16,140
You ever wish
things were just simple?

447
00:39:16,764 --> 00:39:18,513
Things are simple. I won.

448
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:21,568
Now we get to willy waggle, yeah?

449
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:24,383
- I never said...
- Are you sure?

450
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:27,185
- Are you sure you never said cos...
- Hang on.

451
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,718
I think we should willy waggle.

452
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:41,280
They all come to the
Cookie Monster in the end.

453
00:40:04,633 --> 00:40:05,904
This isn't right.

454
00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:07,106
What?

455
00:40:09,504 --> 00:40:11,506
Sorry. It's just isn't a goer.

456
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:13,967
Fair enough.

457
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:16,600
Is that's it? You're not even
gonna try and convince me?

458
00:40:17,227 --> 00:40:19,366
- Most guys would.
- Most guys aren't me, babe.

459
00:40:19,491 --> 00:40:21,540
You fancy me, I'm cool with it.

460
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:26,236
So there's another reason why you won't
fuck me. It's probably a good one cos

461
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:27,204
you're,

462
00:40:27,598 --> 00:40:28,598
you know,

463
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:30,261
clever.

464
00:40:35,825 --> 00:40:38,196
You're a lot nicer
than most people think.

465
00:40:38,494 --> 00:40:39,494
Fuck you.

466
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,479
Fuck you right back.

467
00:42:01,964 --> 00:42:03,737
You noticed how quiet it is?

468
00:42:05,825 --> 00:42:07,084
You kicked them out?

469
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:09,360
Probably take a few days
to clean the place, right?

470
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,964
What did you want to talk
to me about this morning?

471
00:42:16,525 --> 00:42:17,480
Is anyone here?

472
00:42:17,914 --> 00:42:21,247
Just some man who seemed to think
you wanted him back in my bed.

473
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,694
He's very entertaining
for an Irishman.

474
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:29,301
It is peaceful.

475
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,320
Did I ever tell you how angry I was when
I found out I was pregnant with you?

476
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:38,884
Is this going to cheer me up?

477
00:42:39,138 --> 00:42:42,219
- Because I need cheering up. OK?
- I'm getting there.

478
00:42:43,723 --> 00:42:45,539
I'd met the man of my dreams.

479
00:42:45,848 --> 00:42:49,076
I wanted to travel the world,
fuck on every beach in India,

480
00:42:49,281 --> 00:42:52,009
be in love, and then
I found out I was pregnant.

481
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:54,925
I can only apologise.

482
00:42:57,536 --> 00:43:00,804
And, you know, your dad turned out
to be a shitty little prick,

483
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:02,996
and it was all a little bit rubbish.

484
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:06,416
Until you made my life complete.

485
00:43:08,848 --> 00:43:11,164
And actually,
rather fucking wonderful.

486
00:43:14,486 --> 00:43:15,486
I did that?

487
00:43:16,911 --> 00:43:18,413
I wasn't expecting it.

488
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:22,406
People who make us happy are
never the people you expect.

489
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:27,915
So, when you find someone.

490
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,756
You've got to cherish it.

491
00:43:45,284 --> 00:43:46,284
Right then.

492
00:43:46,712 --> 00:43:49,602
I've got an Irishman waiting for me,
who says all he needs for happiness

493
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,973
is regular sex and potatoes.

494
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:34,573
I'm not gonna open the door.

495
00:44:35,113 --> 00:44:36,664
My face is all puffy.

496
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,791
I've been...

497
00:44:39,414 --> 00:44:41,516
- crying a bit.
- I don't care.

498
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:04,520
I do want someone.

499
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:08,076
Need someone. You're right.

500
00:45:11,323 --> 00:45:12,123
And?

501
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,920
And...

502
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:18,814
when I'm with you,
I feel like I'm a better person.

503
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,463
I feel happier. Less...

504
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:25,083
alone.

505
00:45:25,717 --> 00:45:26,817
Less lonely.

506
00:45:39,774 --> 00:45:41,729
But it's not
as simple as that, is it?

507
00:45:42,176 --> 00:45:43,527
Being with someone.

508
00:45:45,044 --> 00:45:46,044
Isn't it?

509
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:51,045
I mean,

510
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:53,233
I don't know.

511
00:45:54,486 --> 00:45:55,760
I mean, I don't think so.

512
00:45:59,608 --> 00:46:00,608
I mean...

513
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,894
Can't we just sit like this...

514
00:46:12,715 --> 00:46:13,715
for a bit?

515
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:32,126
We can.

516
00:46:34,467 --> 00:46:35,467
For a bit.

517
00:46:51,883 --> 00:46:53,316
I've been getting locked on.

518
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,280
Breaking stuff.

519
00:46:57,004 --> 00:46:58,276
Getting into rages.

520
00:47:00,548 --> 00:47:01,915
- Don't do that.
- Right.

521
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,516
You gotta choose, mate.
Either me or Cook.

522
00:47:04,684 --> 00:47:07,369
- Please make up with Freddie, Cook.
- He can fuck himself.

523
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:09,464
- All those things you want.
- I love you.

524
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:12,156
You don't ask for them.
Why don't you just ask?
