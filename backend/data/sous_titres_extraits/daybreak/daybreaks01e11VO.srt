00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:13,439
<i>My name is Detective Brett Hopper.</i>

3
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:16,095
<i>And this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

4
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:20,291
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,828
<i>I will be framed for murder.</i>

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,580
Who the hell are you people?

7
00:00:24,962 --> 00:00:26,684
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

8
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:30,013
<i>I know all this
because I'm living the same day...</i>

9
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:32,596
<i>... over and over again.</i>

10
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:35,802
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

11
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:37,503
<i>Someone went a long way to set me up.</i>

12
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:38,999
Konrad Deitweiler,

13
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:40,687
Tobias Booth...

14
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:43,150
<i>But I finally discovered
who really killed Garza.</i>

15
00:00:43,356 --> 00:00:44,663
Miguel Dominguez...

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,932
<i>A gang member
who's supposed to be in prison.</i>

17
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:49,047
<i>My informant, Damien,
helped me track him down.</i>

18
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,568
You gotta tell me about Dominguez!

19
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,442
Whose address is this?

20
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:55,464
<i>And I caught the killer.</i>

21
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:57,665
<i>- I cleared my name...</i>
- You're a free man!

22
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,951
<i>I thought this was over.
I thought I'd escaped the day...</i>

23
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:01,584
You wanna watch the sun rise with me?

24
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:04,251
<i>...but I didn't.</i>

25
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,311
<i>So now, I'm wondering what comes next...</i>

26
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,786
<i>and if anything I do even matters.</i>

27
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:13,056
Day Break 1x11
What if he walks away?

28
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,229
Hey, Andrea. What's up? Rehab? Waow...

29
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:32,074
Yeah, I know.
And he's really lucky to have you.

30
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:33,258
Hey, Damien. It's me.

31
00:01:33,446 --> 00:01:35,664
I know. I know about the safehouse.

32
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,447
I have a lead on some people
who I think did this.

33
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:40,364
And I won't be able to make
the 9 o'clock,

34
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:42,107
but tell your niece
I said happy birthday.

35
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:44,792
My name is Brett Hopper.
You sent me a package, you're in danger.

36
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:46,941
Stay away from Baxter,
skip the morning swim

37
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:48,075
and get out of town, Eva.

38
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,468
Then, it's gonna be okay.

39
00:01:49,502 --> 00:01:51,325
Yes, I know about the briefcase.

40
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:54,171
No, listen.
Don't even stop for coffee, Margo.

41
00:01:54,287 --> 00:01:57,106
Why? Because if you don't,
you're gonna get hit by a bus!

42
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:02,922
Who are you talking to?

43
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:05,252
Nobody.

44
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:06,799
Just people.

45
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,464
What is it?

46
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,480
Never does it get sick of it?

47
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:14,733
Sick of what?

48
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,458
I don't know. Just...
talk to the same people,

49
00:02:19,043 --> 00:02:20,487
doing the same things...

50
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,584
Doing to the same places...

51
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,974
Sure I do.

52
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:27,561
Not everybody I work with
is a ray of sunshine.

53
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:30,432
That's the job.

54
00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:32,401
People count on us.

55
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:35,423
What's the quote ?

56
00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:37,392
85% of life is just showing off?

57
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:44,927
I don't know. Some days...

58
00:02:45,186 --> 00:02:47,002
Some days, I really hate this job.

59
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,156
Man up, Preisser, nobody likes a whiner.

60
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:51,705
Did you hear how that cop
talked to me back there?

61
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,403
He was totally disrespectful.

62
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:56,331
If you joined the IA to make friends,
you're a bonehead with the enemy.

63
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:58,155
Cops are gonna take shots at us.

64
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:00,149
If you ground it up now,

65
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:01,989
that guy's still gonna be running

66
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:03,980
parking tickets
when you make lieutenant.

67
00:03:06,017 --> 00:03:07,160
Hey, Hippo!

68
00:03:07,161 --> 00:03:08,391
Take that last nutty bar.

69
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:09,791
I won't sue you.

70
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,884
Hey fellas, question:

71
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:36,869
when did you stopped caring?

72
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:39,203
Excuse me?

73
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:42,193
No, for real, you used to be cops,
you used to stand for something.

74
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:43,246
Used to help people.

75
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:44,695
What happened?

76
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:46,704
You.

77
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:49,011
Why did you just give up?

78
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:51,638
We're tourists.

79
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:54,059
It's a serious question.

80
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:56,260
How does it feel

81
00:03:56,724 --> 00:03:57,778
to be dead inside?

82
00:03:58,254 --> 00:03:59,731
Do yourself a favor, alright?

83
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,672
Walk away.

84
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:04,587
Right now, just walk away.

85
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:15,747
Yeah.

86
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:18,250
That's sound a better idea.

87
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:20,134
Thanks guys.

88
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:26,029
Hey, baby.

89
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:28,551
I thought you left.

90
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:30,982
Let's blow off the work for a day.

91
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:32,280
- What?
- Yeah.

92
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:33,797
Call in, take a vacation day.

93
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:35,656
Oh, we shouldn't.

94
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:37,098
Come on.

95
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:39,312
- Should we?
- Just one single day.

96
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:41,430
We could be here tomorrow.

97
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:42,691
Look, in ten years...

98
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:44,109
what'll you remember?

99
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:46,386
A day doing the same old thing?

100
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,133
Or a day getting crazy with me.

101
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,291
How crazy?

102
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:56,006
You like?

103
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:57,414
Yeah, I like!

104
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:00,664
Maybe...

105
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:02,885
Maybe we should stay
somewhere less expensive.

106
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,509
My friend knows
this nice motel off the street.

107
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,513
Baby, if we're gonna do this,
we gotta do it right.

108
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:10,679
What is gotten into you today?

109
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:12,900
Just felt it was time for a break.

110
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,702
You know what I love about Vegas?

111
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:17,253
Free drinks and hot chicks?

112
00:05:17,254 --> 00:05:18,345
It's unpredictable...

113
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,875
You gotta deal the cards, roll the dice.

114
00:05:20,923 --> 00:05:22,125
Anything can happen.

115
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:24,655
- Come on.
- You got a history, here, 

116
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:27,200
you don't want me to listen.
It's not that unpredictable.

117
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:29,369
Pretty much everyone leaves
the standard loser.

118
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:30,845
Not us, baby.

119
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:32,102
Not today.

120
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:33,947
Five hundred dollar?

121
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:35,505
And that's for a regular suite?

122
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:37,610
Last minute avaibility is limited.

123
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,098
How much for your best suite?

124
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,132
The presidential suite starts
at five thousand dollars a night.

125
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:45,005
We don't have that kind of money.

126
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:50,694
We're gonna be right back, Amy.

127
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,012
I thought at the bank you said

128
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:56,265
you're only seeking out
a few hundred for this trip.

129
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:58,712
- How much is that?
- Just got to make one bet. That's it.

130
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:01,320
Since when did you become
the big gambler?

131
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:05,065
I want you to get us some drinks,
and I'll meet you at the bar.

132
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:07,298
OK, but don't go crazy,
that's all the cash we have.

133
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:08,309
I got you.

134
00:06:08,596 --> 00:06:09,594
Alright.

135
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:13,544
OK, can I make a bet on the Dodger game?

136
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:14,891
Sir, this is Las Vegas.

137
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:18,185
What kind of odds can you get me
on a bet that's like, let's say...

138
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:20,768
Dodge over the Giants, 11-10.

139
00:06:20,823 --> 00:06:24,171
Seven run, Dodger rally
about the bottom of the... 9th.

140
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,376
I take it you like long shots.

141
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,255
How much did you put down?

142
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,609
- All of it.
- What?

143
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:36,225
You gambled 6 runs
in the bottom of the 9th.

144
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,361
It's OK.

145
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:38,613
They'll come back.

146
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,572
<i>Oh, it looks like he got it!</i>

147
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:42,666
What did happen?

148
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:45,345
Pretty one homerun to left
after a naughty fast ball.

149
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:46,821
Keep watching, it's good.

150
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:57,782
Oh my god, you win !

151
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,412
Look at this place!

152
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:10,496
Look at the view!

153
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:18,043
So this is how the other 1% lives.

154
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:22,649
- You hungry?
- No...

155
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,437
You spoiled me enough.

156
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:29,054
It's been the most amazing day.

157
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,793
I still don't know how you did it.

158
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:35,465
I don't know. I guess...

159
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:38,352
luck finally came my way.

160
00:07:42,553 --> 00:07:43,749
Look...

161
00:07:44,143 --> 00:07:45,326
fake New York...

162
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:47,551
Fake Italy...

163
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,158
Do you think next time
when we come here

164
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,723
we can stay at fake Paris?

165
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:54,417
Why do we gotta setup for fake anything?

166
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:03,160
If you could go anywhere...

167
00:08:05,057 --> 00:08:06,334
in the all world.

168
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,793
Where would it be? New York...

169
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:11,849
- Paris...
- Mexico.

170
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,136
I used to go down there
when I was a kid.

171
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:19,212
Those <i>pelicanos...</i>

172
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:22,057
it was magical.

173
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:27,915
DAY 2(del vo)

174
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:29,069
- No way!
- What?

175
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:32,365
Of all the places in Mexico,
I used to come here when I as a kid.

176
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:34,205
For real?

177
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:37,591
Right before my parents split,
we used to come down every spring,

178
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:40,186
me and my brother used to swim
and play here all week.

179
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,078
What are the chances of that happening?

180
00:08:50,585 --> 00:08:51,914
What's up hot mama?

181
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,510
We should, like, just move here.

182
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,968
It sounds good to me.

183
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:58,710
I think you're kidding, city boy.

184
00:08:59,592 --> 00:09:02,592
You can never leave LA.
You'd miss all the excitement of home.

185
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:14,378
Actually I could get used to this.

186
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:17,761
As long as you're with me.

187
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:44,398
<i>- Buenos dias, señor, señorita.</i>
- Hey, what's happening?

188
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:46,901
- What's this thing called again?
- <i>Abahablast.</i>

189
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:48,356
What's in it?

190
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:51,182
Well, a concoction of rhum,
tequila, brandy,

191
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:53,736
triple-sec, orange, and pineapple,

192
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,145
cranberry and a special
secret ingredient.

193
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,149
You want some?

194
00:09:57,213 --> 00:10:00,222
No, thanks.
I like my liquor like I like my pizza.

195
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:02,259
Less than three ingredients.

196
00:10:02,974 --> 00:10:05,507
- You've got some, and leave a little.
- Yeah.

197
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,290
This is amazing.

198
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,293
I could do this every day.

199
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:14,974
Maybe we should...

200
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:17,013
DAY 3 (del vo)

201
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,821
<i>Buenos dias señor, señorita.</i>

202
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:27,250
Thank you!

203
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,849
- What is thing called again?
- <i>Abahablast.</i>

204
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,262
What's in it?

205
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:36,718
Well, a concoction of rhum,
tequila, brandy, triple-sec, and...

206
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,989
What's the secret ingredient?

207
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,257
It wouldn't be a secret if I told you.

208
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:47,224
This is so amazing.

209
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:49,241
I could do this every day.

210
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,731
DAY 4 (del vo)

211
00:10:57,683 --> 00:10:59,144
What is this thing called again?

212
00:10:59,145 --> 00:11:00,552
<i>Abahablast.<i/>

213
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:02,822
It's got rhum, tequila, brandy,

214
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,554
Triple-sec, orange, cranberry,
pineapple,

215
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,481
and the secret ingredient is
pomegranate juice.

216
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:14,142
How could you possibly know all that?

217
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:15,851
I don't know.
I just knew it.

218
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:21,251
This is amazing.

219
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,843
I could do this every day.

220
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:28,849
<i>Buenos dias señor, señorita.</i>

221
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,878
<i>Buenos dias señor...</i>

222
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:33,536
This is amazing.

223
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:35,225
I could do this everyday.

224
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:36,569
... do this everyday.

225
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,607
... everyday.

226
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:41,458
This is amazing.
I could do this every day.

227
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:50,077
You know, for someone
who suggested this trip,

228
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:52,320
you don't seem very happy to be here.

229
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:54,140
I am.
It's great.

230
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,164
- I love it here.
- No, you don't.

231
00:11:57,495 --> 00:11:58,533
I can tell.

232
00:11:58,929 --> 00:11:59,933
What's going on Brett?

233
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,576
I don't know,
I'm just not feeling this place anymore.

234
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,487
We just got here this morning.

235
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:14,976
What if I told you that...

236
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:18,676
A surfer dude is gonna eat sand
in about like 5 seconds.

237
00:12:19,576 --> 00:12:21,797
- How could you even...
- Just watch.

238
00:12:22,321 --> 00:12:23,448
Look.

239
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:32,405
Yeah. His name is Spence, he works
for an overnight shipping company.

240
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:35,731
He got caught smoking weed on the job,
so they fired him yesterday.

241
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:36,900
Are you making this up?

242
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:40,187
The waitress, that's about
to bring us here Abahablast.

243
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:44,365
Ask her... if she left her curling
iron on this morning.

244
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:47,154
<i>Buenos dias señor, señorita.</i>

245
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:48,498
Ask her.

246
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:51,735
You left your curling iron on
this morning.

247
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:53,435
Oh, my God!

248
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,440
Don't worry,
her house isn't gonna burn down,

249
00:12:57,441 --> 00:12:59,212
she just left a mark on the sink.

250
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,998
How could you even know that?

251
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:03,780
This one, I have been working
on with practises.

252
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:08,905
"Sorry, that one sank like a dive-bomber
at operation metal horn."

253
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:12,320
Sorry, that one sank like a dive-bomber
at operation metal horn.

254
00:13:12,664 --> 00:13:14,994
- Thank guys.
- All right, take care, man.

255
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:17,461
- You're scaring me.
- That's ok.

256
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:21,441
I'm just living the same day
over and over and over again.

257
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:24,509
- What?
- Come get a drink with me at the bar.

258
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:26,579
There're some things I need to tell you.

259
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:28,958
I mean, at first, I thought that I...

260
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,500
There was something wrong with me.

261
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:34,898
I got an MRI, I spoke with a doctor.

262
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,158
He didn't find anything.

263
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:40,290
You're saying that we've
done this 12 times.

264
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:42,239
Same beach, same hotel.

265
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,759
A place you came, as a kid.

266
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,476
But here's the thing: I know how happy
this place makes you.

267
00:13:49,423 --> 00:13:50,448
But I just...

268
00:13:51,992 --> 00:13:54,083
I just... I can't take it anymore.

269
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,485
So you pick up another spot,
and we go there tomorrow.

270
00:13:58,622 --> 00:13:59,920
Anywhere. No problem.

271
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:04,842
So while we're living large in Mexico,
you're accused of murder in L.A.

272
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:07,360
- Yeah.
- And you know who's framing you.

273
00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:11,700
And these people back home,
they're getting hurt, every day.

274
00:14:12,963 --> 00:14:14,359
Yeah, but like I said,

275
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:15,944
the day...

276
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:18,214
It resets itself every day.

277
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:23,476
Look. I used to think
that if kept doing these things,

278
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:26,534
if I could solve the case,

279
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:28,419
if I could find the real killer,

280
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,812
if I could keep
everybody from getting hurt.

281
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:33,842
I used to think
that I could fix the day.

282
00:14:34,518 --> 00:14:35,557
But I...

283
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:38,525
I did all that stuff.
Over and over again. And  I...

284
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:46,121
The day kept repeating,
so it doesn't matter.

285
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:47,282
I decided,

286
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:49,756
if I can't do anything to change it...

287
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:51,427
that I'm just gonna...

288
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:55,922
I'm just gonna take care of <i>you</i>.
I'm just gonna make <i>you</i> happy.

289
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,945
You...
But you lied to me.

290
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:03,582
This trip, this day.
It's just been a... one big lie.

291
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,809
- Wait, it's not "one big lie".
- What did you expect would happen

292
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,353
when you told me this?
Why are you telling me this now?

293
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:12,919
Because I'm tired of pretending
I'm having fun.

294
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,084
Just pretending.

295
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:19,699
Fine.

296
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:20,902
That's not what I meant.

297
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:23,880
I've known it for a while.
I just don't have the word.

298
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:25,832
What did you say?

299
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,799
Everything about this is wrong!

300
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:30,428
What about those people
in LA who need you?

301
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,412
They...

302
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:35,327
It doesn't matter.
They don't matter, it keeps...

303
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:36,611
It matters to me!

304
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:39,917
Well, it's not gonna matter
tomorrow morning.

305
00:15:40,777 --> 00:15:44,445
Because, you're gonna...
forget we even had this conversation.

306
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:49,611
You wanna bet?

307
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,946
Hey baby, I got an idea!

308
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,835
Why don't we...

309
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:54,874
take the day off?

310
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,743
You're suprised? Sounds like stuff
I wouldn't normally do.

311
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:02,764
Why don't we...

312
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,610
go to the desert,
over...

313
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,866
San Francisco?

314
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,807
What you think?

315
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,880
Same floor, let's go!

316
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,150
Go!

317
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,630
Move, move.

318
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,500
Sir, if you're here,
please identify yourself.

319
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,150
Move, move!

320
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,030
Clear!

321
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:05,700
Clear after search, detective.

322
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:08,807
Guess at least you're free to check
the rest of the building, doesn't it?

323
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:22,307
You know what I think?

324
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:24,424
Police must come out here all the time.

325
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:26,072
Nobody comes out of
the houses to watch.

326
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:29,310
Cops is second nature in our days.
Too much reality on TV.

327
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,020
Go. Drive.

328
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:34,750
Wow, partner.

329
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:36,318
I think you jumped into the wrong car.

330
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:39,169
Shut up, I know who you both are.
Fencik, Buchalter.

331
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:41,800
You've been following me for weeks,
videotaping.

332
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:43,647
I wish I knew what you're talking about.

333
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:46,480
Look, we could drive or we could all go
talk to the cops, right now.

334
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:48,606
- Maybe that's a good idea.
- We can both tell 'em

335
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:49,877
you're ex-sheriff deputies.

336
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:52,500
That you two are involved
in the Garza murder.

337
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,295
They'd love to
find out who killed the guy

338
00:18:54,312 --> 00:18:55,756
in the tub above my appartment.

339
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,199
Do yourself a favor: get out of the car,

340
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,562
- and walk away.
- Or we can call Detweiler.

341
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:01,672
Or maybe Booth?

342
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,862
Tell 'em what a big mess you've
been making of this whole thing.

343
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:06,557
What do you say?

344
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:07,956
How about you?

345
00:19:08,854 --> 00:19:10,349
- Let's go.
- Attaboy!

346
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:22,919
I said put Shelten on the line.

347
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,260
He's not here right now.

348
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:27,699
And when he's done torturing some
beat cop, have him give me a call.

349
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:29,961
Well, perhaps it'd be best
if you left a message.

350
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:31,800
Tell him thanks for nothing.

351
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:33,665
sending us on a wild goose chase.

352
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,264
Alright, now you're gonna tell me...

353
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:38,465
You're gonna tell me where Rita is.

354
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:40,066
- Who?
- My girlfriend Rita,

355
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:41,603
the girl you've been following.

356
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:42,890
Videotaping.

357
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,910
Her!

358
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,619
You got a good taste.

359
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,445
A girl nice to wake up next to.

360
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,870
Shut up!

361
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:53,884
It's gonna be OK.
We get down on the station,

362
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:56,938
all this guy is gonna do is asking
a couple of questions about Hopper.

363
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,930
Billy, calm down. What's wrong?

364
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:07,070
Look, I can't, not today.

365
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:08,385
- Who is it?
- It's Billy.

366
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:10,236
What kind of trouble is he in now?

367
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:13,304
Billy, just slow down,
you're not making any sense.

368
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:15,615
What?

369
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,487
What happened?

370
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,273
Someone found the body.

371
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:24,157
It must be tough keeping tabs
on a girl like that.

372
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:26,132
Don't open your mouth again.

373
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,674
- I'm just saying...
- What are you just saying?

374
00:20:30,118 --> 00:20:32,216
Your girlfriend has a secret,
that's all.

375
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:34,457
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

376
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,604
Like you said, we've been following her.

377
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:37,724
Taping her.

378
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:42,153
Maybe we know things that you don't.

379
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:46,561
Give me that video camera.

380
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,240
Give me the bag too.

381
00:20:54,014 --> 00:20:55,450
Don't try to think cute.

382
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:12,650
Damn!
How long have you been following me?

383
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:22,027
Wait!

384
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:23,639
What are you doing?

385
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:27,179
Stop the car!

386
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:28,314
Stop!

387
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:40,014
You should've walked
when you had the chance.

388
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,266
Maybe we should call this in.

389
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,180
I'm making an executive decision.

390
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:57,643
Why did you get in the car?

391
00:21:58,231 --> 00:21:59,243
Idiot.

392
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:29,778
How are you feeling, kid?

393
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:34,329
What did you dragged my father into?

394
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,532
Your dad and I...

395
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:38,324
... were told to make the case go away.

396
00:22:40,387 --> 00:22:41,399
Uncle Nick?

397
00:22:46,187 --> 00:22:48,073
What the hell are you doing here?

398
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,950
I've still got eyes and ears
at the station.

399
00:22:51,531 --> 00:22:53,486
I know all about your little situation.

400
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:56,821
Who's this shooter?

401
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:59,139
He's not a shooter, he's a friend.

402
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:03,705
I can count the number of guys
on the force I trust on one hand.

403
00:23:04,627 --> 00:23:05,844
Hippo's three of 'em.

404
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:09,576
He heard they were setting you up
on this Garza thing so...

405
00:23:09,715 --> 00:23:11,225
I told him to stay close.

406
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:16,664
Your old man was on the right track
with the girl.

407
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,090
He's with you.

408
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,680
You're not just keeping an eye on me.

409
00:23:21,824 --> 00:23:24,010
You want me
to look in the Contreras murder.

410
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:25,807
The Jane Doe from 15 years ago.

411
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:27,741
- Where did you hear about th...
- I know...

412
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:28,906
already, Nick.

413
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:33,013
I know that Booth made the call
to kill Isabella Contreras.

414
00:23:33,157 --> 00:23:37,400
I know Dominguez pulled the trigger
and I know that you and my father...

415
00:23:38,232 --> 00:23:41,833
I know that you and my father
took money to make this case go away.

416
00:23:41,983 --> 00:23:43,610
When did you find all this out?

417
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:46,200
Today.

418
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:50,245
Don't judge him, Brett.

419
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:53,782
Everything your old man did was
to protect you,

420
00:23:54,055 --> 00:23:55,340
your mum, your sister.

421
00:23:55,464 --> 00:23:56,790
It was never about the money.

422
00:23:56,888 --> 00:23:58,589
Well, then what was it about?

423
00:23:59,457 --> 00:24:01,131
What your stake in all this?

424
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:05,432
We might wanna sit down.

425
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:06,812
I don't want to sit down.

426
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:10,270
I want to get this interview over.
Where the hell is Chad?

427
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,795
- I don't know, he's not here.
- So, where is he?

428
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,128
None of your business.

429
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:18,155
I'll be conducting the interview.

430
00:24:18,435 --> 00:24:19,638
Consider me Shelten.

431
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:20,910
Now for the day.

432
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:23,984
Not till you gain a hundred pounds
and grow a pair.

433
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,990
I know about Danny Yan.

434
00:24:29,474 --> 00:24:31,470
Strip club. Bank withdrawals.

435
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:34,613
Call me when Shelten's back.

436
00:24:44,814 --> 00:24:46,836
I will be out the rest of the day.

437
00:24:56,085 --> 00:24:57,917
For the night or by the hour?

438
00:24:58,735 --> 00:25:00,396
- Excuse me?
- We're looking for a guy.

439
00:25:00,426 --> 00:25:01,711
Name of Billie Foster.

440
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:03,447
Sorry, can't help ya.

441
00:25:05,476 --> 00:25:06,515
What room?

442
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:11,236
The only way I've managed to stay alive
in this thing is to stay out of it.

443
00:25:11,237 --> 00:25:13,587
But you didn't stay out of it,
you saved my ass today.

444
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:16,212
I helped you out
because I owed your old man.

445
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:19,426
There's more to it than that.

446
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:21,708
What's your bee with Tobias Booth?

447
00:25:21,804 --> 00:25:22,843
Me and him...

448
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:25,002
We don't exactly see eye to eye.

449
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:26,410
You wanna take him down.

450
00:25:26,506 --> 00:25:28,419
You really think
I'd do some that stupid?

451
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,016
No, that's just my job, isn't it, Nick?

452
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,400
Right?
You want me to get to Booth?

453
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:35,218
I didn't pick you, son.

454
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,653
- They did.
- Why?

455
00:25:37,184 --> 00:25:38,524
Booth's vindictive.

456
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:39,849
Paranoid.

457
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:42,979
If he set you up for this,
he thinks you can bring him down.

458
00:25:43,148 --> 00:25:44,405
So the question is :

459
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:46,319
What can you prove?

460
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,613
I can prove that Dominguez
isn't in prison,

461
00:25:49,763 --> 00:25:51,485
that he hit Garza last night.

462
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:53,071
What do you got?

463
00:25:53,248 --> 00:25:55,490
Dominguez's print on the gun
that killed Garza.

464
00:25:55,613 --> 00:25:57,294
They tried to plant it in my place

465
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,973
but there's evidence of a stakeout
in the apartment above mine.

466
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:01,653
Holes drilled in the floor.

467
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:03,048
Surveillance wires.

468
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,002
A dead body in the tub.

469
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:06,924
Can you tie any of it back to Booth?

470
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:09,449
There were chain of corruption
that would make your head spin.

471
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,587
Crooked cops, federal prosecutors,
prison officials.

472
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:16,346
I've waited in 15 years
for this to blow up in Booth's face.

473
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:18,977
Well, you should've come clean
a long time ago.

474
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:20,417
None of this would be happening.

475
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:21,948
I took the money, Brett.

476
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,105
This son of a bitch had me.

477
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,549
And I wasn't going
to piss away my life the way...

478
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:30,176
What? Say it!

479
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:32,082
Like my father?

480
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:37,057
Listen.

481
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:39,927
Here's what we do.

482
00:26:41,021 --> 00:26:42,237
We get on my boat,

483
00:26:43,488 --> 00:26:45,982
go fishing in Baha
for a couple of months.

484
00:26:45,983 --> 00:26:49,084
- While the heat died down.
- Can't do it, I can't leave, not today.

485
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,435
I gotta find my girl before they do.

486
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:52,665
This girlfriend.

487
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:54,496
You trust her?

488
00:26:54,497 --> 00:26:55,535
Rita? Yeah!

489
00:26:55,863 --> 00:26:56,875
Of course.

490
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,444
You watch yourself, Brett.

491
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:11,830
I had Hippo get your truck for you.

492
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:31,506
Any word?

493
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:35,962
I checked the station. Put a bulletin
on her place like you asked.

494
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:38,757
The lady at the hospital said
Rita took a vacation day.

495
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,001
Vacation day?

496
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:42,460
What d'you mean she's not here?
She started at 8.

497
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:44,346
She called in,
said she was taking a day off.

498
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,451
Anything can happen to anyone.

499
00:27:47,025 --> 00:27:48,999
- Is it possible?
- No, something's wrong.

500
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,667
What about Chad, did you speak to him?

501
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:53,127
That's the funny thing,
he's MIA since this morning.

502
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:55,098
Hasn't checked in
with his minions all day.

503
00:27:55,672 --> 00:27:57,722
This is odd jumble, something's...

504
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,158
- Something's different here.
- What do you mean?

505
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,465
That's enough... Did you...

506
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:11,033
- Did you sell me out?
- Put your hands where we can see 'em!

507
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:12,195
Did you sell me out?

508
00:28:15,716 --> 00:28:17,124
- Backward !
- OK, OK!

509
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,472
- Turn around, turn around!
- By the right.

510
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:22,960
Did you follow me here?

511
00:28:26,477 --> 00:28:29,162
Brett Hopper, you're under arrest
for the murder of Alberto Garza.

512
00:28:29,163 --> 00:28:31,267
I didn't do it, and I can prove it.

513
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:34,554
You're also under arrest
for the murder of Chad and Rita Shelten.

514
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:36,481
What?

515
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:37,520
What did you say?

516
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:38,968
Come on, you heard me.

517
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:52,988
Sit down.

518
00:28:54,895 --> 00:28:56,385
Sit down or I'm gonna sit you down.

519
00:28:56,522 --> 00:28:57,520
Try.

520
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,105
Try and sit me down!

521
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,909
Come on, look.

522
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,399
We're all cops here.

523
00:29:02,595 --> 00:29:04,244
Now we wanna hear
your side of the story.

524
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:06,184
There is no story,
because I didn't do anything.

525
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:08,334
I'm sure you've got an alibi
to back that up, right?

526
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,384
Yeah, he's halfway to Baha, by now.

527
00:29:10,385 --> 00:29:11,423
How convenient.

528
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:14,868
Wanna know what I think happened?

529
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:16,180
Thrill me.

530
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:18,350
I think you killed Garza
then you ran home

531
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,194
to your girlfriend
for a little wine down

532
00:29:20,288 --> 00:29:21,674
when she booted your ass out.

533
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:25,200
And she called her old boy toy Shelten,

534
00:29:25,282 --> 00:29:27,141
so you followed her to the motel.

535
00:29:28,152 --> 00:29:29,191
Motel?

536
00:29:29,628 --> 00:29:30,831
What's the name of the motel?

537
00:29:30,832 --> 00:29:32,771
You busted in
on your gal pal and Shelten

538
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,821
just as they were playing
seven minutes in heaven.

539
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:36,351
Coming off the rage with Garza,

540
00:29:36,614 --> 00:29:39,553
- You gave 'em both what they deserved.
- What was the name of the motel?

541
00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:40,769
You should know it.

542
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,407
You left you .9mm at the crime scene.

543
00:29:43,557 --> 00:29:44,596
I told you.

544
00:29:44,637 --> 00:29:46,086
I didn't execute anybody.

545
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:49,174
That's probably
a guy named Miguel Dominguez.

546
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:54,360
You know Dominguez?

547
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:57,176
No, but it's funny
you should say "execute".

548
00:29:58,085 --> 00:30:00,046
OK, Garza, you did him cold.

549
00:30:00,518 --> 00:30:01,529
But these two?

550
00:30:02,485 --> 00:30:03,496
Not so neat.

551
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,693
You shot Shelten, five times.

552
00:30:07,504 --> 00:30:09,250
You shot your girldfriend another three.

553
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:13,739
I don't want to see that.

554
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,164
That's what I call a crime with passion.

555
00:30:16,295 --> 00:30:17,402
I don't want to see those.

556
00:30:17,403 --> 00:30:18,777
- Real shame.
- Stop it.

557
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:21,614
She's quite a looker.

558
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,331
I need backup!

559
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,816
Attacking an RHD detective.

560
00:30:41,236 --> 00:30:43,832
Not exactly the best way
to prove your innocence.

561
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:45,848
I already proved 'em my innocence.

562
00:30:45,937 --> 00:30:47,167
When did you do that?

563
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:49,244
It doesn't matter.

564
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:51,363
None of it matters.

565
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:52,811
How can you say that?

566
00:30:53,426 --> 00:30:56,009
I didn't think this day
could get any worse.

567
00:30:57,682 --> 00:30:58,694
But it did.

568
00:30:59,987 --> 00:31:01,682
And I tried to changed it...

569
00:31:03,684 --> 00:31:05,516
but Rita still died.

570
00:31:07,423 --> 00:31:09,200
And now I'm scared...

571
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,303
... that tomorrow is gonna come.

572
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:17,330
And she still gonna be dead.

573
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:24,685
You cannot do that.

574
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:28,711
Nobody can.

575
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:34,049
See, you just have to do what's right.

576
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,090
Punish the people who did this.

577
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:40,746
You don't understand.

578
00:31:42,219 --> 00:31:43,798
I understand just fine.

579
00:31:44,263 --> 00:31:45,288
You're giving up.

580
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:47,557
Stop saying that.

581
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,630
I am trapped...

582
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:52,530
in...

583
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:54,881
... this thing.

584
00:31:55,004 --> 00:31:57,238
Hopper, what the hell happened to you?

585
00:31:58,161 --> 00:31:59,569
You have no idea.

586
00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:01,250
Then give me an idea!

587
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:04,046
You don't have all the answers!

588
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,238
Or you wouldn't be there,

589
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:07,183
- feeling sorry for yourself!
- Andrea, please.

590
00:32:07,184 --> 00:32:09,302
So pull yourself together
and give me something.

591
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,491
OK? Anything.

592
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:16,182
Look at me.

593
00:32:21,936 --> 00:32:23,220
You're not alone here.

594
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:28,603
But I need you to help me.

595
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:34,070
If you think of anything
that can get you out of here.

596
00:32:38,238 --> 00:32:40,629
I know where there
is an other dead body.

597
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:45,036
In a bathtub.

598
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,310
Let me see what I can do.

599
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:00,044
It's right in here.

600
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:14,513
But you said there was a body here.

601
00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:15,611
It was.

602
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:18,329
There was.

603
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:21,732
Choi.

604
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:27,664
All right, come in, come on.
Come, hurry.

605
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:39,340
What's going on, Hop'?

606
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,527
They cleaned it all up.

607
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:43,700
Cleaned what up?

608
00:33:46,515 --> 00:33:47,882
It was Pelican Bay.

609
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:50,582
It seems Miguel Dominguez
is resting comfortably

610
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,041
in his cell where he's been
for the last 15 years.

611
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:54,025
Let me speek to him.

612
00:33:54,026 --> 00:33:56,433
The man who knew the warden.
A guy named Mangle.

613
00:33:57,475 --> 00:33:58,852
Detweiler did not send you.

614
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:00,644
I spent 12 years under that man
since the...

615
00:34:00,645 --> 00:34:02,531
You can't speak to him, he's in on it.

616
00:34:02,532 --> 00:34:04,844
So now, the warden's part
of the conspiracy too?

617
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:26,825
Uncle Nick?

618
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:33,293
You did this!

619
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:35,567
You told them
everything I had on Dominguez.

620
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,846
You cleaned up that mess!

621
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:38,847
I didn't clean up anybody's mess!

622
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:40,531
Now calm down and hear me out.

623
00:34:40,532 --> 00:34:41,537
They killed Rita!

624
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,190
I didn't have anything to do with that.

625
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:45,675
Do you forget who saved your ass today?

626
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:46,985
Hey, what's going on in there?

627
00:34:46,986 --> 00:34:47,991
It's OK.

628
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:49,551
We're all right in here.

629
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,117
So what is this uncle Nick?

630
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:58,522
You're here to save me or sell me out?

631
00:34:59,786 --> 00:35:01,341
You don't understand, kid.

632
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:03,048
I don't call the shots.

633
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,769
I'm just middle management.

634
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:06,473
A conduit for information.

635
00:35:06,511 --> 00:35:08,135
Yeah, you mean you're Booth's bitch.

636
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,939
Booth is a monster and if I could,

637
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:12,351
- I'd put a bullet in his head.
- Don't give me that.

638
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,188
Every single thing I told you
about Dominguez

639
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:16,022
you ran and told Booth, didn't you?

640
00:35:16,137 --> 00:35:17,175
Didn't you?

641
00:35:21,275 --> 00:35:22,300
I'm sorry.

642
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:25,050
I...

643
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:28,525
When he-- I didn't have the choice.

644
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:31,887
When it came down to you or them,

645
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:34,631
well, I picked me.

646
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:37,822
See, Booth may have his grand agenda

647
00:35:37,823 --> 00:35:39,485
but I got one on my own too.

648
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:42,197
- Survival.
- You were my father's partner.

649
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:44,940
Spent Chritmas with us.

650
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:48,086
Bought Jen her first bike.

651
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:50,058
You sat at our table.

652
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:51,927
How could you do this?

653
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:55,731
Do you have any idea
how powerful these people are?

654
00:35:56,407 --> 00:35:57,573
If they wanted to,

655
00:35:57,733 --> 00:35:59,624
they could drag you
right out of this cell

656
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,149
- and make you disappear.
- But they won't.

657
00:36:02,658 --> 00:36:03,874
They need a fall guy.

658
00:36:04,735 --> 00:36:05,926
That's why I'm here.

659
00:36:07,646 --> 00:36:08,915
To make you an offer.

660
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:14,183
You do your time,

661
00:36:14,324 --> 00:36:16,437
peacefully, mouth shut.

662
00:36:17,582 --> 00:36:19,770
And I can garantee your safety.

663
00:36:20,476 --> 00:36:22,329
Nobody in here would touch you.

664
00:36:22,795 --> 00:36:24,439
You'd be out in seven years.

665
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:27,208
I'm begging you, kid.

666
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:31,313
- Give it up.
- I gave up already.

667
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:36,737
But the day just got worse.

668
00:36:37,784 --> 00:36:39,081
And I'm paying for it.

669
00:36:39,794 --> 00:36:41,108
You think this is bad?

670
00:36:41,615 --> 00:36:43,071
Think of the alternative,

671
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,601
the people you love.

672
00:36:45,174 --> 00:36:46,517
Booth can get to them.

673
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,155
Look at you.

674
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,666
Coming up in here like you're family,
like you care,

675
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:55,171
You're no better than Detweiler
or Booth.

676
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:00,149
So take your little offer
and shove it up your ass.

677
00:37:02,747 --> 00:37:04,334
It's easy to say now.

678
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:10,501
But eventually,

679
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:12,182
they'll own you.

680
00:37:13,074 --> 00:37:14,360
Just like they do me.

681
00:37:15,507 --> 00:37:16,536
And your dad.

682
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:18,940
Your girlfriend.

683
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:23,030
What did you say?

684
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:26,395
What are you talking about?

685
00:37:26,563 --> 00:37:28,319
Everybody's got secrets, kid.

686
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:31,943
My assets,

687
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:33,915
Kinda irrelevant now, isn't it?

688
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:41,628
What are you talking about?

689
00:37:42,854 --> 00:37:44,515
What do you know about Rita?

690
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:29,894
Some days, I really hate my job.

691
00:38:30,035 --> 00:38:32,191
Man up, Preisser,
nobody likes a whiner.

692
00:38:32,236 --> 00:38:34,174
Did you hear how the cop
talk to me back there?

693
00:38:34,175 --> 00:38:35,842
It was totally disrespectful.

694
00:38:37,586 --> 00:38:38,722
Chad, it's me.

695
00:38:38,905 --> 00:38:40,201
Rita, everything OK?

696
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:41,440
<i>Yeah.</i>

697
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:43,968
No, no, it's not.

698
00:38:44,316 --> 00:38:45,361
<i>What's wrong?</i>

699
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:48,240
- Talk to me.
- It's Brett.

700
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:51,975
- This morning he...
- Did he do something to you?

701
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:54,054
<i>No, no, it's nothing like that.</i>

702
00:38:55,003 --> 00:38:56,544
I wish I knew how to explain it...

703
00:38:56,645 --> 00:38:58,040
Don't forget Hopper's a cop.

704
00:38:58,154 --> 00:39:00,116
He may be expecting us,
don't take any chances.

705
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,183
Did you say Hopper?

706
00:39:01,224 --> 00:39:03,384
We're going to his appartment,
I just got the warrant.

707
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,265
- For what?
- Murder of a D.A, Alberto Garza.

708
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:09,150
Hold on a second.
Rita, is Hopper there? Is he with you?

709
00:39:09,328 --> 00:39:10,426
Yeah, he's in the shower.

710
00:39:10,436 --> 00:39:12,882
Listen to me, I want you
to get out of there, right now.

711
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,805
- What's going on?
- He's wanted for the murder

712
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,901
of a guy named Alberto Garza,
get out of there.

713
00:39:19,682 --> 00:39:20,658
Change your plans.

714
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:22,227
Hopper's not at his place.

715
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:29,309
You called Chad?

716
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,519
Does he know I'm here?

717
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:37,330
He must have called SWAT.

718
00:39:37,432 --> 00:39:38,441
Why him?

719
00:39:39,592 --> 00:39:40,909
Why did you call Chad?

720
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:44,207
- I don't know.
- Think, there must be some reason.

721
00:39:44,411 --> 00:39:45,429
I don't...

722
00:39:46,063 --> 00:39:47,416
I woke up this morning.

723
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,482
- I just had this feeling.
- What kind of a feeling?

724
00:39:51,595 --> 00:39:52,854
Something different.

725
00:39:53,384 --> 00:39:54,592
Like something was wrong.

726
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:56,619
You're keeping something from me?

727
00:39:57,905 --> 00:39:58,910
A secret?

728
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,243
A secret?

729
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,815
Like the one you're keeping from me,
Brett?

730
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,934
Chad said you're accused of murder.

731
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,450
That all thing is a set-up.

732
00:40:08,515 --> 00:40:11,726
You have to believe me when
I say I did not kill Garza.

733
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,545
How did you know it was Garza?

734
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,969
- You were here with me all last night,
you know I couldn't have done this.

735
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:25,292
Everything about this is... wrong.

736
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,309
And maybe I've known for a while,

737
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,400
and I just... didn't have the word.

738
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,780
No, I wanna protect you,
I wanna keep you safe!

739
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:33,528
I don't feel safe, right now.

740
00:40:33,824 --> 00:40:34,917
Rita, please.

741
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,404
I'm not the one
that's different this morning.

742
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,614
It's you.

743
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,154
You're not the same guy
I went to sleep with last night.

744
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,623
You should go.

745
00:40:52,836 --> 00:40:54,020
No, I'm not leaving.

746
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,693
Then you can explain everything
to the cops when they get here.

747
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,369
Glad you could make it.

748
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,580
You and me both.

749
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:30,692
Those skinheads were to smoke my ass
back at the safehouse.

750
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,599
Thanks for the heads up.

751
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,053
Least I can do.

752
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:40,420
I still can't believe Hopper
and Baxter set me up.

753
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,209
They gonna answer for that.

754
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,781
We got bigger problems.

755
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,253
Garza got wacked last night.

756
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,053
So, what does that mean?

757
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,394
They're making their move.

758
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,540
And neither one of us is
gonna like where that's going.

759
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,730
This whole town's going up in flames.

760
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,723
So, I say we take 'em out now.

761
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,670
Torrez, Booth,
all the lot of them.

762
00:42:00,892 --> 00:42:01,944
First, we talk.

763
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,645
We gotta be smart.

764
00:42:03,906 --> 00:42:05,832
So what, you gonna have
a sit-down with Booth ?

765
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:06,858
Not with Booth.

766
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,759
I'm going above him.

767
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,471
Straight to the man at the top.
