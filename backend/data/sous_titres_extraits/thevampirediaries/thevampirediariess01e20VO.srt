No. Don't take her!

11
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,564
You'll be killed along with them.

12

for vampires, now, could I?

00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,260
Cars, computers, match.com.

365
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:49,830
There's so much to learn.
He helped me get this place.

366
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:52,700
So, do you live here alone,

367
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:55,069
or is there someone else here?

368
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:58,639
That's my friend's very...
Passive-aggressive way of asking,

369
00:19:58,707 --> 00:20:01,375
uh, do you know a woman named Isobel?

370
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:04,278
Uh, no. No, I don't know an Isobel.

371
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:07,281
I know John. He's my only real friend.

372
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:10,184
He really showed me the
ropes... how to use a microwave,

373
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,686
separate my whites.

374
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,054
What else do you do for him?

375
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:15,389
I help keep an eye on things...
You know, with the others.

376
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:17,525
The others? From the tomb.

377
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,393
They're still pissed at
the founding families.

378
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:20,962
For trying to burn them alive.

379
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:23,798
I'm cool, but those tomb
boys, they want revenge.

380
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,366
What does John want with them?

381
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,401
He's just keeping an
eye on them, you know?

382
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:29,036
Trying to make sure
they stay out of trouble.

383
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,472
Well, that's John. Heh.
He's such a do-gooder.

384
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,407
[Cell phone rings]

385
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:36,310
Heh. That's John now. [ring]

386
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:38,679
Oh. Hey, let me talk to him. [ring]

387
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,815
All right. Yeah.

388
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,852
[Ring]

389
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,555
[Ring] Are you gonna answer that?

390
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,891
Am I gonna... answer that? [ring]

391
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:55,830
What's going on? [ring]

392
00:20:57,065 --> 00:20:58,766
[Growling]

393
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:00,301
Uhh! Uhh!

394
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:01,669
Aah!

395
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:10,644
[Panting] "Let's not
not kill anyone tonight."

396
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:13,314
Your words. Just pointing that out.

397
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:14,982
[Music playing]

398
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,951
My apologies.

399
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:18,953
No apologies necessary.

400
00:21:19,021 --> 00:21:22,390
So, tell me, Mr. Gilbert, why
should I let you have the device?

401
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:25,092
Because I can help you.
I'm connected around here.

402
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,195
The town council's eating out of
my land. They do whatever I say.

403
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:30,264
And I know that you just
want to live your life.

404
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,500
Complete with a white picket
fence, and I can help you do that.

405
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:35,136
But the device doesn't work.
Why would you even want it?

406
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:37,938
It's a family heirloom.
Call me sentimental.

407
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,408
Johnathan was ahead of his time.

408
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:42,877
I read his journals.
They're very extensive.

409
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:44,545
He actually wrote about you.

410
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:46,947
You were his one regret.

411
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,985
He loved you, and he hated
himself for what he did to you.

412
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:53,721
- You're lying. 
- No.

413
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:57,525
On his last days, he
wrote how sorry he was.

414
00:21:59,061 --> 00:22:01,328
You were the only woman he ever loved.

415
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:07,735
[Chuckling]

416
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:09,437
Good God.

417
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:13,541
You vampires... you're so emotional.

418
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,576
Johnathan Gilbert hated you.

419
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:19,780
His only regret was that he didn't
drive a stake through your heart himself.

420
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,453
I gave it to Damon. What?

421
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,321
I gave your device to Damon.

422
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,156
Why don't you ask him for it yourself?

423
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:32,593
I'm sure he'd be delighted to give
it to you. And then, Mr. Gilbert,

424
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:34,895
may you rot in hell.

425
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,901
Talk to me, Stefan.

426
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:42,470
Why are you doing this?

427
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:46,073
I'm making the decision I
should have made years ago.

428
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:48,275
What are you talking about?

429
00:22:50,145 --> 00:22:52,813
You have to feed in order
to complete the transition.

430
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:55,516
I know that.

431
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:59,053
It was a choice I shouldn't have made.

432
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:10,564
Dear God.

433
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:13,067
Even in our death, you only feel shame?

434
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:15,436
You're one of them now. No.

435
00:23:15,504 --> 00:23:17,571
Father, I came to say good-bye.

436
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:19,640
I watched you die.

437
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,976
You were there when we were shot?

438
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:23,978
I pulled the trigger myself.

439
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:26,347
You killed your own sons?

440
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:29,250
You were both dead to me the
moment you sided with the vampires.

441
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:32,253
I only thank God that your mother isn't
alive to see the disgrace you've become.

442
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,522
I haven't turned yet. I don't want to.

443
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:36,457
I'm going to let myself
die, father. Please.

444
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:38,092
Yes, you are.

445
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:41,762
[Gasps]

446
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:45,533
Uhh!

447
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,835
[Groaning] Father, I didn't mean to.

448
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:50,804
Get away from me. No,
let me help you. Please.

449
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:52,907
[Grunting]

450
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:15,529
Ohh.

451
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:26,407
Ohh.

452
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:28,676
[Grunting]

453
00:24:28,743 --> 00:24:31,178
Uhh. Uhh!

454
00:24:31,246 --> 00:24:33,814
Oh, God. What's happening to me?

455
00:24:38,863 --> 00:24:40,931
How can you even look at me right now?

456
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:44,368
You need to be able talk
about these things, Stefan.

457
00:24:44,436 --> 00:24:47,304
I need to hear them.

458
00:24:47,372 --> 00:24:49,573
Come upstairs.

459
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:50,974
We can talk about it more,

460
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:53,544
and we'll keep talking
as long as you need.

461
00:24:55,513 --> 00:24:57,848
You're so sure I'm ready.

462
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:07,491
And when you feel the same way...

463
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,793
I'll be upstairs.

464
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:24,775
Find anything yet?

465
00:25:24,843 --> 00:25:26,777
No, I looked everywhere. The place is...

466
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:28,846
The place is clean. Well, I found this.

467
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:30,748
Behind the blood in the fridge.

468
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:35,586
Oh, man, this was a real dead-end.

469
00:25:35,653 --> 00:25:37,521
I wouldn't beat myself up over it, man.

470
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:40,190
What did you think you
were gonna find, huh?

471
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:43,494
Isobel with a cigar and slippers?

472
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:46,363
[Chuckling]

473
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:49,133
Oh, man. I... [sighs]

474
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,237
I gotta stop this. I can't...
I can't keep searching for her.

475
00:25:53,304 --> 00:25:55,439
Really? After only 2 years?

476
00:25:55,507 --> 00:25:57,975
That's actually...

477
00:25:58,042 --> 00:26:00,010
Moderately healthy. [chuckles]

478
00:26:00,078 --> 00:26:02,713
What are you going on? 146?

479
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:05,616
Well, I figure the 200 mark is
probably a good stopping point.

480
00:26:05,683 --> 00:26:08,185
[Chuckles]

481
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:10,053
Ahh.

482
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:12,022
I mean, no answer is enough.

483
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,891
I keep thinking I wanna kn why,

484
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,626
when, you know, the precise moment.

485
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:19,229
When my wife decided life
with me wasn't enough.

486
00:26:20,632 --> 00:26:23,233
She charmed me, your wife Isobel.

487
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:25,202
She talked a good game, man.

488
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,071
She was smart. She had
this excitement in her eyes.

489
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:30,440
I probably should have known there
was something different about her,

490
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:32,176
some tie to Katherine.

491
00:26:32,277 --> 00:26:34,144
There had to be some
reason I didn't kill her.

492
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:36,180
That's enough, Damon. I
don't wanna hear anymore.

493
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:38,882
I just don't want to
waste any more of my life.

494
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,618
Searching for answers
that I really don't want.

495
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:47,224
I'm through with Isobel. I...

496
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:50,360
I'm done with all of this.

497
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:53,063
Yeah.

498
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,876
Hey.

499
00:27:05,944 --> 00:27:07,644
What's the matter?

500
00:27:07,712 --> 00:27:09,813
I need you to pack your
things. We're leaving.

501
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:11,682
What? No.

502
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:14,251
I was wrong to think that
we could make a home here.

503
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,286
It's time for us to move on.

504
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:18,822
But I don't want to
move on. I want to stay.

505
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,357
We can't stay.

506
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:23,093
There's too many people
here who know the truth...

507
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,528
Too much history.

508
00:27:24,596 --> 00:27:26,496
So, what, you're just gonna give up,

509
00:27:26,564 --> 00:27:28,332
pack us up, and move us out?

510
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,467
It's not safe here. You know that.

511
00:27:30,535 --> 00:27:32,502
Please.

512
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,771
This is about Jeremy.

513
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,340
No. It's about me.

514
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:39,843
Finally getting to
build a life for myself.

515
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:41,378
Please, mama.

516
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:45,515
You gave me my life back. I am
just trying to protect yours.

517
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:49,620
I can't force you.

518
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:52,155
It's your decision.

519
00:27:56,361 --> 00:27:58,228
[Footsteps]

520
00:27:58,296 --> 00:28:01,231
Ugh. God. You're still here?

521
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:04,034
Were you expecting anything else? No.

522
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:05,903
Ahh.

523
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,472
So, how was the "errand"?

524
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,007
Futile.

525
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:12,009
Although, I think I
witnessed the teacher having.

526
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:13,844
An existential crisis.

527
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:15,112
Has Stefan eaten yet?

528
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,813
I thought you didn't care.

529
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:19,316
Chalk it up to morbid curiosity.

530
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:22,319
I think he's getting there.

531
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:24,888
But he's got a lot of guilt
that he has to deal with.

532
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:28,091
And it doesn't help that
you've spent the last 145 years.

533
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,994
Punishing him for
Katherine getting caught.

534
00:28:31,062 --> 00:28:32,462
This is my fault now?

535
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,364
No, it's no one's fault, Damon.

536
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,067
I'm just... saying you're
not exactly innocent.

537
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:40,871
You've made it your life's
mission to make him miserable.

538
00:28:43,841 --> 00:28:45,309
Let me ask you a question.

539
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:47,010
In all this important soul-searching.

540
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:48,979
And cleansing of the
demons of Stefan's past,

541
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:51,248
did you ever manage to
get e rest of the story?

542
00:28:51,316 --> 00:28:53,450
He said there was more.

543
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:56,019
Yeah. That's an understatement.

544
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:57,487
Damon...

545
00:28:57,555 --> 00:28:59,656
Damon.

546
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:01,692
Tell me.

547
00:29:11,636 --> 00:29:14,871
What are you doing? Who is that?

548
00:29:14,939 --> 00:29:16,873
I brought her for you.

549
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:20,644
She's a gift. Have a seat, please.

550
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:25,983
What have you done, Stefan?

551
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,452
Damon, I've been to see father.

552
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,886
He came at me.

553
00:29:29,954 --> 00:29:34,291
I didn't know my own strength.
There was blood everywhere.

554
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,227
He was dying, and the
blood was too strong.

555
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:40,097
I needed it. I had to have it.

556
00:29:40,164 --> 00:29:42,766
You fed. Yes. And it's incredible.

557
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:46,870
My body is exploding
with power, Damon. No.

558
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:49,172
I can hear things from far away.

559
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,776
I can see through the darkness.
I can move, like it's magic.

560
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:55,679
And the guilt, the pain...
Damon, I can turn it off.

561
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:57,347
Like a switch.

562
00:29:57,415 --> 00:30:00,484
Katherine was right. It's a whole
another world out there, Damon.

563
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,086
Katherine is dead, Stefan.

564
00:30:03,154 --> 00:30:05,589
There's no world without her. No.

565
00:30:05,656 --> 00:30:07,324
You can turn that off, too.

566
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:09,393
You don't have to feel that pain anymore.

567
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,794
I don't want it.

568
00:30:10,862 --> 00:30:12,929
You're weak. You'll be dead soon.

569
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:14,831
You need this.

570
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:16,933
No. [grunting] You'll die.

571
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:19,569
No. I can't.

572
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:21,605
Please.

573
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:34,851
I won't let you die.

574
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:36,253
No. I can't.

575
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,854
Don't fight it.

576
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:41,324
We can do this... together.

577
00:31:06,684 --> 00:31:08,985
[Panting]

578
00:31:15,293 --> 00:31:18,462
From the moment Stefan had
his first taste of human blood,

579
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:20,363
he was a different person.

580
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:22,299
I suppose I should thank him.

581
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:24,868
It's been a hell of a ride. Heh.

582
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:28,071
Oh, my God. He said he wanted to die.

583
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:30,974
That's why he wot feed.
Now I understand why, but...

584
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:32,476
His choice.

585
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:35,946
If he's stupid enough
to make it, so be it.

586
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:40,050
Don't do that. Ok? Don't
pretend like you don't care.

587
00:31:42,153 --> 00:31:44,121
Where are you going?

588
00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:08,086
[Music playing]

589
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,159
Hey.

590
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:17,762
It's getting impossible
to sneak up on you.

591
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,664
Nice try, though.

592
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:22,233
Sorry I woke you.

593
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:24,202
That's OK.

594
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:27,038
You only woke me halfway.

595
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:33,511
So, listen. I...

596
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,913
That feels good.

597
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,767
[Whispering] Good-bye.

598
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:58,002
[Music playing]

599
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:20,358
How do you feel?

600
00:33:20,426 --> 00:33:22,360
[Exhales] You were right.

601
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:24,595
It is a whole new world.

602
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:26,931
We can explore it together.

603
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:33,371
You got what you wanted...
You and me for all eternity.

604
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:36,774
But here it is, brother.

605
00:33:36,842 --> 00:33:39,844
I will make it an eternity.

606
00:33:39,912 --> 00:33:42,647
Of misery for you.

607
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:45,183
Damon!

608
00:33:56,695 --> 00:33:59,097
You've transitioned.

609
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:02,800
You'd have rather found me dead?

610
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:06,137
Katherine saved my life once. I owed her.

611
00:34:06,205 --> 00:34:08,973
That doesn't mean I'd
wish her curse on anyone.

612
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:12,276
It feels more like a gift.

613
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:15,713
That will change. Why is that?

614
00:34:20,085 --> 00:34:22,019
Because even in death,

615
00:34:22,087 --> 00:34:24,388
your heart is pure, Stefan.

616
00:34:24,456 --> 00:34:27,291
I sense that about you.

617
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:31,996
That will be your curse.

618
00:34:33,432 --> 00:34:34,999
Emily, wait.

619
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,743
Stefan.

620
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:53,217
Damon told me the rest of the story.

621
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:56,220
I thought I might find you here.

622
00:34:56,288 --> 00:34:58,556
I should have died that night,

623
00:34:58,624 --> 00:35:02,560
just like I had chosen.

624
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:05,163
I should have let Damon die, too.

625
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,999
But you didn't. And if you die now,

626
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,968
it's not gonna change what happened.

627
00:35:11,036 --> 00:35:15,406
Every single person that's been hurt...

628
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:19,277
Every single life that's
been lost, it's because of me.

629
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:27,018
The night that my parents died...

630
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:31,222
I blew off family night so that
I could go off to some party.

631
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,826
I ended up getting stranded,
and they had to come pick me up.

632
00:35:34,893 --> 00:35:38,362
That's why we ended up in
the car at Wickery bridge.

633
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,132
And that's why they died.

634
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,469
Our actions are what set things in motion.

635
00:35:45,537 --> 00:35:48,506
But we have to live with that.

636
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:54,645
I made a choice, Elena.

637
00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:57,849
And because of that choice,
a lot of people were hurt.

638
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:59,684
You also made a choice to stop,

639
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:01,752
to reject the person
that the blood made you.

640
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,421
You made a choice to be good, Stefan. No.

641
00:36:03,488 --> 00:36:05,556
Please don't do that. That's the person.

642
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:07,792
Who jumped in the water
to save the family.

643
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,794
Whose car had driven
off the bridge. Please.

644
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:11,996
Don't make this all OK. That's the person.

645
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:14,799
Who saved my life. You
don't understand, Elena.

646
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:17,201
Then tell me. It hurts me.

647
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:20,104
It hurts me, knowing what
I've done, and that pain...

648
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:22,273
That pain is with me all the time.

649
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:25,209
And every day, I think that if I just...

650
00:36:25,277 --> 00:36:28,012
If just give myself over to the blood,

651
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,781
I can make that pain stop.

652
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:33,985
It would be that easy, and
every day, I fight that.

653
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:37,355
And I am so terrified that one day,

654
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:40,124
I'm not gonna want to
fight that anymore, Elena.

655
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,629
And the next time I hurt somebody...

656
00:36:44,696 --> 00:36:46,797
It could be you.

657
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:48,666
There will be no next time.

658
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:50,668
You don't know that.

659
00:36:50,736 --> 00:36:53,070
Maybe I don't.

660
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:55,840
But what I do know.

661
00:36:55,908 --> 00:36:58,175
Is that you can take this,

662
00:36:58,243 --> 00:37:01,078
throw it in the quarry,
and let the sun rise.

663
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:04,215
Or you could take this ring and put it on.

664
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:06,784
And keep fighting.

665
00:37:19,398 --> 00:37:22,033
It's your choice.

666
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,778
Elena.

667
00:38:08,824 --> 00:38:11,159
Thank you, Harper. You're welcome

668
00:38:11,227 --> 00:38:12,961
Annabelle should be back in a minute.

669
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:15,797
You know, you don't have to come
with us if you don't want to.

670
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:17,665
This was never my home, miss pearl.

671
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:19,634
I was just a soldier who was left to die.

672
00:38:19,702 --> 00:38:22,137
You saved me. I'm coming with you.

673
00:38:22,204 --> 00:38:24,439
Let me help you with these.

674
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,480
[Whoosh]

675
00:38:43,392 --> 00:38:45,560
[Clattering]

676
00:38:53,335 --> 00:38:55,770
- I'll be upstairs, OK?
- Ok.

677
00:38:56,872 --> 00:38:59,340
Good night, Damon.

678
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:07,982
Thank you. No, Stefan, thank you.

679
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,618
You're back on Bambi blood, and
I'm the big badass brother again.

680
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:12,620
All is right in the world.

681
00:39:12,688 --> 00:39:14,122
I mean it.

682
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,824
Thank you.

683
00:39:15,891 --> 00:39:18,626
For... helping her take care of me.

684
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:21,696
You brood too much. Everything
on this planet is not your fault.

685
00:39:21,764 --> 00:39:23,631
My actions, what I do,
it's not your fault.

686
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:25,433
I own them. They belong to me.

687
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:27,669
You are not allowed to feel my guilt.

688
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:30,939
Do you feel guilt?

689
00:39:31,006 --> 00:39:32,874
If I wanted to,

690
00:39:32,942 --> 00:39:34,876
it's there.

691
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:48,623
Emily waited till after I turned
to tell me she'd been successful.

692
00:39:48,691 --> 00:39:50,558
In protecting Katherine with her spell.

693
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:52,827
She didn't want me to know about the tomb.

694
00:39:52,895 --> 00:39:55,096
She thought it would impact my decision.

695
00:39:55,164 --> 00:39:57,499
She didn't want either one of us to turn.

696
00:39:57,566 --> 00:40:00,201
She said it was a curse. Witches...

697
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:02,637
Judgy little things.

698
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:04,205
Why didn't you tell me?

699
00:40:04,273 --> 00:40:06,141
'Cause I didn't want you to know.

700
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:08,243
'Cause I hated you, and I still do.

701
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:11,212
I know.

702
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,848
But not because you forced me to turn.

703
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:16,317
Then why?

704
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,057
Because she turned you.

705
00:40:24,393 --> 00:40:27,862
It was just supposed to be me, Stefan...

706
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,564
Just me.

707
00:40:34,803 --> 00:40:37,038
[Door closes] I'm back.

708
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:41,509
[Gasps] Oh!

709
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:43,478

Uhh!

00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:51,653
[Sobbing] Please don't leave me again.

713
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,822
No. Please wake up. You have to wake up.

714
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,893
[Sobbing] No.

00:41:07,536 --> 00:41:10,405
Sheriff Forbes, John Gilbert.

716
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:12,407
