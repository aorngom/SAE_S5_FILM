1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:01,501
Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,982
For over a century,
I have lived in secret

3
00:00:03,894 --> 00:00:05,779
Until now. I know the risk.

4
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:07,146
But I have to know her.

5
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:08,781
There's a tomb
underneath the church.

6
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:11,317
A spell sealed Katherine in
that tomb, protecting her.

7
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:12,418
I'm gonna bring her back.

8
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,487
She's not there!

9
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:16,188
You saved everyone in the church?

10
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:18,557
We've taken up residence in a
farmhouse just outside of town.

11
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:20,626
All 25 vampires? Some.

12
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:24,063
I hate this house. I didn't
stay locked up for 145 years

13
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,131
To end up locked up here.

14
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:26,666
Aah!

15
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:27,800
Ugh!

16
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:28,768
So, where's Bethanne?

17
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,169
She won't be coming back.

18
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,804
My wife Isobel spent her life

19
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:34,040
Researching paranormal
activity in this area.

20
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,908
What have you done to my wife?
I turned her.

21
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,344
Maybe there is such
a thing as vampires.

22
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:40,179
They're just different from the
way we always thought they were.

23
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,380
Aah!

24
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:42,748
You got a problem with blood, Anna?

25
00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:44,050
Ahh!

26
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:45,351
I knew this girl Vicki.

27
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:47,386
She was attacked by an animal,
a bite to the neck.

28
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:48,487
And then I saw your face.

29
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:50,356
Why would you confront me about it?

30
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:51,624
Because maybe it's
true about Vicki.

31
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,793
And also because I
want you to turn me.

32
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:34,233
I love storms.

33
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:36,268
Is that a vampire thing?

34
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:38,437
'cause I read vampires
don't like running water.

35
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:39,839
It's only Dracula.

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,608
Yeah. He was a complete wuss.

37
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,710
Never showered. Very smelly.

38
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:46,112
Seriously?

39
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:49,448
First rule about vampires--

40
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:51,817
Don't believe anything you read.

41
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:54,620
You gotta tell me more.
I gotta know.

42
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:57,223
No, you don't.

43
00:01:57,224 --> 00:01:58,657
'cause you're not gonna be one.

44
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:00,025
Come on, you can't
keep saying "No" To me.

45
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:01,727
Look, I'm not gonna turn someone

46
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:04,930
Who learned everything he knows
about vampires from netflix.

47
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:06,932
That's not true, and you know it.

48
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:11,103
Why do you even want this?

49
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:12,838
Give me one good reason.

50
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:15,007
'cause I...

51
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:21,113
Hmm. Let me know when you
can finish that sentence.

52
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:27,186
Hey, you're still up.

53
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:28,521
Hey, what's up?

54
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:30,389
Looks like the there's
a big storm rolling in.

55
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,858
Can you help make sure all
the windows are closed?

56
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:34,794
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

57
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:49,074
We're running low on blood.

58
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:52,111
You might wanna send Anna to
the hospital for some more.

59
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:54,146
I'll send her out
for some tomorrow.

60
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:55,848
Maybe I could go with her.

61
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,115
If the storm keeps it dark enough,

62
00:02:57,115 --> 00:03:00,467
I might be able to go out
during the day, no sun and all.

63
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:01,554
I'm afraid not.

64
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:04,356
Not after your stunt at the
Salvatore house tonight.

65
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:05,891
He and his brother deserved it.

66
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:07,293
And where did that get you?

67
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:09,061
Your girlfriend Bethanne is dead.

68
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:11,564
And you have no one
to blame but yourself.

69
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,533
We cannot live our
lives about revenge.

70
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:17,536
We have to have better
control of our emotions.

71
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:19,605
I understand, miss Pearl.

72
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:22,374
I just wish I knew
what you were up to.

73
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,115
I'm going to make an exploratory
visit into town tomorrow

74
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:33,719
To assess who's under the influence
of vervain and who isn't.

75
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,889
Anna tells me that the
players haven't changed much.

76
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,791
It's still the Lockwoods,
the Forbes, the Fells--

77
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,426
We should kill every
last one of them.

78
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:43,562
We are smarter than that,
Frederick.

79
00:03:43,563 --> 00:03:46,232
These people are not our enemies.

80
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,068
We don't hold grudges
and resentments.

81
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,036
We'll get our town back.

82
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:54,573
We just have to have patience.

83
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:07,653
You heard her.

84
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:10,155
No revenge.

85
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:11,257
Patience.

86
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:13,959
Self-control.

87
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:20,766
She seems to have it all
figured out, doesn't she?

88
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:34,480
I say we go to Pearl's,
bust down the door,

89
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,482
And annihilate the idiot
that attacked us last night.

90
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:37,365
Yeah. And then what?

91
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:39,351
We turn to the rest of
that house of vampires

92
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:40,886
And say, "Oops. Sorry?"

93
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:42,354
I can't believe you
made a deal with her.

94
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:45,858
It was more like a helpful
exchange of information.

95
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:49,328
And it's not like a choice
 She's...

96
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,663
Scary.

97
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:53,666
Besides, she's gonna help
me get Katherine back.

98
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,134
Of course she is.

99
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,535
Damon gets what he wants, as usual.

100
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:58,170
No matter who he
hurts in the process.

101
00:04:58,171 --> 00:05:00,072
You don't have to
be snarky about it.

102
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:02,041
I woke up this morning

103
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,677
To learn that all the vampires
have been released from the tomb.

104
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:06,178
I've earned snarky.

105
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:08,647
How long are you going to blame me

106
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:10,983
For turning your birth
mother into a vampire?

107
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:12,551
I'm not blaming you, Damon.

108
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:14,820
I've accepted the fact that
you're a self-serving psychopath

109
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:16,121
With no redeeming qualities.

110
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:17,690
Ouch.

111
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:19,325
This isn't being very productive.

112
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:22,027
We're gonna figure out a way to deal
with Pearl and the vampires. Yeah?

113
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:24,129
Hmm.

114
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:29,535
I'm sorry. He just
makes me so cranky.

115
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,170
I know. He makes everybody cranky.

116
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:32,671
So, what are we going to do?

117
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:35,641
Damon and I are gonna handle
everything, I promise.

118
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:36,942
Well, what about me?

119
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,243
I can't just sit
here and do nothing.

120
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:39,678
That's exactly what
you're gonna do,

121
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,146
Because that's what
going to keep you safe.

122
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:43,882
Which means nothing if
you're not safe, too.

123
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:45,250
What do you mean?
I'm perfectly safe.

124
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:48,620
I have Damon, the self-serving
psychopath on my side.

125
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:51,023
Well, that's comforting.

126
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,398
Ok. We have some time.

127
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,899
I'm not meeting my mom until later.

128
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,935
Wait. Does your mom
know you're a...

129
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:04,436
The fact that you would
even think it's possible

130
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:06,405
To keep something like that a
secret from your own family

131
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:08,440
Is just further proof
that you're not ready.

132
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:10,476
"Not ready" Is a step up from "No."

133
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:12,678
And a million steps
down from "Maybe."

134
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:17,082
I like your bracelet.

135
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,018
Thanks. My sister got it for me.

136
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,420
Can I see it?

137
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:22,454
Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:06:26,393 --> 00:06:29,495
Your sister doesn't know you're
hanging out with me, does she?

139
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:32,031
No. No. But I don't see
why it would be a problem.

140
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:33,899
It's not like she
knows what you are.

141
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,769
I'd rather keep it
our little secret.

142
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:42,608
You know, why don't you...
why don't you keep this?

143
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:45,611
Why would you give this to me?

144
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:50,149
Because. You like it.
And I like you.

145
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,985
You only like me because
of what you want from me.

146
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:55,721
No. I...I like you.

147
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:03,195
Um...

148
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:05,431
You know, you should wear it.

149
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:07,666
It looks better on you anyway.

150
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:12,771
I yelled at my mom last night.

151
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:16,375
You know, I feel like the
parent and the screwed-up kid.

152
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:17,843
Maybe she needed to hear it.

153
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:19,845
Yeah, but just... I worry
that if I push too hard,

154
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:21,447
Then she will take off again.

155
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:23,015
'cause that's her M.O.

156
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:26,785
Just like Vicki, who I haven't
heard from since she left.

157
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:28,454
Well, you can't control
your mom, Matt,

158
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,689
Any more than you can
control your sister.

159
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,492
I wish that she would just
try a little. You know?

160
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:35,928
If she would just try to try,
that'd be ok.

161
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:37,663
Maybe she'll surprise you.

162
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:40,199
People have a tendency to do that.

163
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:46,472
I should go before the roads
get even worse from the storm.

164
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:49,141
Yeah. Are you sure you
should be driving right now?

165
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:52,945
I have to. It's my dad's
boyfriend's daughter's birthday.

166
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:56,014
We have a non-traditional
traditional ritual.

167
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:59,284
Well, buckle up. Don't speed.

168
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:00,986
Stay off your cell phone.

169
00:08:00,987 --> 00:08:02,654
And call me when you get there.

170
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:05,324
Got it. Anything else?

171
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:06,492
Yes.

172
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,030
Bye.

173
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,365
Bye.

174
00:08:19,772 --> 00:08:21,240
Hunting party?

175
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,242
That guy did a number on me
last night when he stabbed me.

176
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:24,710
I gotta get my strength back up.

177
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:26,712
I've got 2 liters of
soccer mom in the fridge.

178
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:28,881
No?

179
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:32,184
We'll talk when I get back?

180
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:34,820
All right. Give my
regards to the squirrels.

181
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:54,006
Aah!

182
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,126
You're ignoring me

183
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:15,989
The 6 missed calls? Sorry.
My phone is dead.

184
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,365
Is Stefan here? No.

185
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:19,432
Why?

186
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,295
Something wrong?

187
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:21,900
He went out to the woods
and didn't come back.

188
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,965
I can't get him on his phone.

189
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:26,072
I figured he was here with you.

190
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:28,541
It's going straight to voicemail.

191
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:29,948
Where could he be?

192
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:33,246
You're not going to
like what I'm thinking.

193
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,976
Pearl! Open this door.

194
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,712
I swear to God I'll bust
through and rip your head off.

195
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,214
Pearl's not home.

196
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,852
Hmm. Beautiful weather.

197
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,388
Not a ray of sun in the sky.

198
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,856
Where's my brother?

199
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:53,659
Billy.

200
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,700
You're dead. Whoa. I'm sorry.

201
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,836
You haven't been invited in.

202
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,204
Miss Gibbons?

203
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,106
Yes, Frederick honey?

204
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,475
Never let this bad man in.

205
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,077
I'll never let him in.

206
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,414
Ugh!

207
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,349
145 years left starving in a tomb,

208
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,253
Thanks to Katherine's infatuation
with you and your brother.

209
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,988
First few weeks,

210
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,458
Every single nerve in your
body screams with fire.

211
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,028
The kind of pain that
can drive a person mad.

212
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,863
Well...

213
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,365
I thought your brother might've
wanted to get a taste of that

214
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,768
Before I killed him. Billy.

215
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,703
Uhh!

216
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,539
Aah!

217
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,541
You have a nice day.

218
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,154
What happened? Where is he?

219
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,422
They have him. I can't get in.

220
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:57,756
Why not?

221
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,191
Because the woman
that owns the house

222
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,693
Is compelled to not let me in.

223
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,461
I can get in.

224
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,629
You're not going in there.

225
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,863
I'm going! You're not going there.

226
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,167
Why are they doing this?
What do they want with him?

227
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,836
Revenge. They want revenge.

228
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,705
We gotta do something.

229
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,139
I know.

230
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,607
We can't let them hurt him.
We gotta get him out of there.

231
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,143
I know. Elena, I know.

232
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,279
But I don't know
how to get him out.

233
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,967
Vervain on the ropes.

234
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,705
Aah! Unh!

235
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,006
That's gotta sting.

236
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,577
Speaking of...

237
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,818
Aah!

238
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,687
This isn't right!

239
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:07,426
He killed Bethanne.

240
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,394
One of us, Harper.

241
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,370
And don't you think for a second

242
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:14,333
he wouldn't kill you
if he had the chance.

243
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,869
Pearl says we're not
here for revenge, right?

244
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,139
I say that's exactly
what we're here for.

245
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,611
Starting with this.

246
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,980
Aah! Aah!

247
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,150
And then his brother.

248
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,418
And anyone else that
gets in our way.

249
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,720
This isn't right!

250
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,455
You're gonna want to let go of me!

251
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,357
Miss Pearl will be home soon.

252
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,727
Miss Pearl is no longer in charge.

253
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:45,297
Tie him up! And then stake him down.

254
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,678
Well, don't you look... alive?

255
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,213
You can't hurt me.

256
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,048
Oh, I can hurt you, all right.

257
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,019
Mr. Saltzman.

258
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,356
We need your help.

259
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,025
Stefan's in the house.

260
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,360
Damon's a vampire.
He can't get in. We need you.

261
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,728
I would go, but--

262
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,131
Your life is valuable.

263
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,432
Yours, on the other hand...

264
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,568
Stefan told me about your ring.

265
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,602
What about it?

266
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,636
Let me recap...

267
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,371
You tried to kill me.
I defended myself.

268
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,673
You died.

269
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:28,841
Then according to my brother,

270
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,576
Your ring brought you back to life.

271
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,744
Am I leaving anything out?

272
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,247
Yeah. The part where I
try and kill you again.

273
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,915
Only this time, I don't miss.

274
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,317
Mr. Saltzman. Please.

275
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,518
It's Stefan.

276
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,256
I'm sorry, Elena.
But it's not my problem.

277
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,390
That's a shame.

278
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,558
Because the woman in
charge of the crowd

279
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,960
Can help you find your wife.

280
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,997
You're lying. Am I?

281
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,932
Why don't you ask her yourself?

282
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,301
Coward.

283
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,603
Come on, Elena.

284
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,443
All right! Wait.

285
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:08,865
I'll go.

286
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,184
So, I have an answer.

287
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,352
To what?

288
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,519
Why you should turn me.

289
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,288
We're back to that?

290
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:20,959
Look, I wake up every day,
and I feel ok,

291
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,761
But there's something missing.

292
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,197
Like a--like a hole.

293
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,000
Some people, they fit...
in life, or whatever.

294
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,768
I... I don't.

295
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,038
So, you want a pity-turn?

296
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,806
I don't think so.

297
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:39,611
You should turn me because
I don't have anything else.

298
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,717
Do you even know why
we turn other people?

299
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,788
It's not to give someone a one-way
ticket out of loner-hood. Ok?

300
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,724
One--we need someone
to do our dirty work.

301
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,493
Two, revenge.

302
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,729
Three, boredom... but, you know,
that never turns out well.

303
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,266
And then you know there's the obvious one.

304
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,371
You love someone so much
that you would do anything

305
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,840
To spend all of eternity with them.

306
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:16,782
Ahem. I'm sorry, but you don't
fit any of those categories yet.

307
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,155
So, yeah. Just make sure
your thesis is clear,

308
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,090
And she'll love it.

309
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,792
See you later.

310
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,099
Mom, hey. Did you get everything?

311
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,468
Yeah, the blood-bank was understaffed
because of the rain.

312
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,936
I was in and out.

313
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,604
Who's that you were talking to?

314
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,440
A friend from the library.

315
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,674
Let's get home.

316
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:47,079
Hey, you're not going
out in that, are ya?

317
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,881
The roads are dangerous.
Route 5 is completely flooded.

318
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,750
We'll make do.

319
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,585
Mayor Lockwood,
we have your table ready.

320
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,020
Great.

321
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,588
Mayor... Lockwood, is it?

322
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,793
I suppose it is
treacherous outside.

323
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,562
My name is Pearl.

324
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:04,863
Hi.

325
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,865
This is my daughter Anna.

326
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,567
We've just recently moved to town.

327
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:12,104
Welcome. Richard Lockwood.
This is my son Tyler.

328
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,939
Please--please, join us.

329
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,009
It would be a pleasure.

330
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,114
Be more creepy, dad.

331
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,082
Not like your son is
standing right here.

332
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,985
Grow up. Elections are coming.

333
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,655
She's a constituent.
And a rich one, from the looks of it.

334
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,425
You can tell all that
by looking at her ass?

335
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,894
Awesome. I'm gonna
go shoot some pool.

336
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,768
Teacher by day,
vampire hunter by night.

337
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,971
I've you to thank for that.
What are these?

338
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,507
Those are tranquilizer
darts filled with vervain.

339
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,142
Just get me in.
I'll get Stefan out.

340
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:53,478
That's your plan? You're just
gonna take them all on yourself?

341
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,648
Well, I'll be a little
stealthier than that, hopefully.

342
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,083
Whoa. What are you doing?

343
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,284
I'm going with you guys.

344
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,520
No. No. No. No. No way.

345
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,422
You need me. I'll get in.

346
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,290
You could distract them,
and then I'll get Stefan out.

347
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,792
You'll get yourself killed.
You're not going in there.

348
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,060
I'm going.

349
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,762
So, when you get me in,
get out as quickly as you can.

350
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,631
I know how to sneak around
where they can't hear me.

351
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,333
You'll basically
just be in the way.

352
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,669
Damon, now is not the time
to be the lone ranger.

353
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,838
Fine. Elena, you can
drive the getaway car.

354
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,540
You're not going in the house.

355
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,077
You can't stop me. It's Stefan
we're talking about here.

356
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,378
You don't understand.

357
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,780
Oh, I understand. I understand.

358
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,382
He's the reason you live.

359
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,852
His love lifts you up where
you belong. I get it.

360
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,821
Can you just not joke
around for 2 seconds?

361
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,622
I can't protect you, Elena.

362
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,691
I don't know how many
vampires there are in there.

363
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:42,561
That's how long it takes you
to get your head ripped off.

364
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,030
I have to be able to
get in and get out.

365
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,998
I can't be distracted
with your safety.

366
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:51,436
Or this will end up a bloodbath
that none of us walk away from...

367
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,371
Including Stefan.

368
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,076
I know.

369
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,645
I get it.

370
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,647
I understand.

371
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,152
If we're gonna go, let's go.

372
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:18,355
Where are you?
I can barely hear you.

373
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,492
Storm washed out Route 5.

374
00:18:21,654 --> 00:18:25,087
Now I'm detoured on some
random backwoods path to hell.

375
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:26,587
Well, you shouldn't be
talking while you're driving.

376
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:28,199
I know, right?

377
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:30,748
I need one of those
bluetooth thingies.

378
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:32,272
Look, you're breaking up.

379
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:35,043
Just turn around and go
back the same way you came.

380
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:37,112
And watch the road. Ok?

381
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:37,592
Ok.

382
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,286
God.

383
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:54,025
Ohh.

384
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:02,769
Ohh. Seriously.

385
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:15,368
Oh, good, someone's home.

386
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:17,327
Uh, could I use your phone?

387
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:20,255
My--my car broke down a
few miles up the road.

388
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:21,763
This was the first house I saw.

389
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:23,419
Well, lucky you.

390
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:25,168
Yeah. Lucky me.

391
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:27,429
It's no trouble, is it?

392
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,417
Not the slightest.

393
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,522
Great. Whew.

394
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:33,711
Hey, man, I really appreciate it.

395
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:35,160
It's rough out there.

396
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:38,143
Billy, show our visitor where
the phone is in the kitchen.

397
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,875
And get me something to drink.

398
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:41,882
Yeah. Sure thing.

399
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:50,581
Hey, miss Gibbons,
this guy wants to use your phone.

400
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,874
Oh, sure, honey. It's right there.

401
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:56,243
Thanks.

402
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:02,831
Aah!

403
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:06,608
What's happening?

404
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:08,238
I'm really sorry.
But you're gonna need to invite

405
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:09,377
A friend of mine inside.

406
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:12,488
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's not allowed in the house.

407
00:20:12,488 --> 00:20:14,019
I know that. But you
gotta make an exception.

408
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,105
Get her out of the house. Now!

409
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:17,272
Miss Gibbons, tell me the truth.

410
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:18,904
Are you married? 
No.

411
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:21,550
Parents, children, anyone else
who lives on this property?

412
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:22,757
No. It's just me.

413
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:23,601
Good.

414
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:28,069
You were supposed to compel her.

415
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:29,617
It doesn't work that way...
She is human.

416
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:31,433
And I'm not! So, I don't care.

417
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:34,434
Now, get out of here.
And get rid of the body!

418
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,938
I'm in the process of
obtaining some property.

419
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:08,227
I understand that your

420
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:10,154
family is the largest
property owner in town.

421
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:12,212
Well, yes we are.

422
00:21:12,212 --> 00:21:14,602
Dating all the way back to
the town's original charter.

423
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:18,739
Your family came into a lot
of new property in 1864.

424
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:20,270
You know your history.

425
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,782
It's a passion of mine.

426
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:26,219
Guy's not even subtle about it.

427
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:27,361
Who is that?

428
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:29,470
It's not my mother.

429
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:10,362
I'm sorry, Mayor.

430
00:22:11,224 --> 00:22:12,320
Do you know that boy over there?

431
00:22:13,357 --> 00:22:14,580
Yeah it's Jeremy Gilbert.

432
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:18,053
You don't say.

433
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:25,808
Billy, what's the holdup?!

434
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:39,879
Aah!

435
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:52,911
Damn it, Elena!

436
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:08,176
Billy, Jacob, get back in here!

437
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,660
Are you insane?

438
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:51,139
Aah!

439
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:09,590
Aah!

440
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,053
Jeremy Gilbert?

441
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,385
Is that what you've been up to?

442
00:25:26,795 --> 00:25:28,628
He's my friend.
What's the big deal?

443
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:30,888
His family is the reason

444
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:32,792
I was stuck in a tomb
for over a century.

445
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,766
That doesn't mean he'll
make the same choices.

446
00:25:35,597 --> 00:25:37,288
I want you to stop seeing him.

447
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,957
I've been on my own for
a long time, mother.

448
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:40,994
I can make my own decisions.

449
00:25:40,994 --> 00:25:43,234
Then stop acting like a child!

450
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:45,152
As soon as Jeremy finds out

451
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:47,253
what you really are,
he will turn on...

452
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:48,410
He already knows.

453
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:50,456
What did you just say?

454
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:52,071
Jeremy knows.

455
00:25:52,336 --> 00:25:54,668
He likes it. And he likes me.

456
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:17,340
Uhh.

457
00:26:20,165 --> 00:26:21,170
Thank you.

458
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:23,639
For trying to help me.

459
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:26,621
They just needed somebody to blame.

460
00:26:27,873 --> 00:26:29,374
Someone to punish.

461
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:33,037
Elena...

462
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:35,498
You shouldn't be here...

463
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:37,292
She was supposed
to stay in the car.

464
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:40,807
Unh! No. No. No. Not him.

465
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:43,300
Whatever. Let's get you down.

466
00:26:43,857 --> 00:26:45,911
There's vervain on the ropes.

467
00:26:46,056 --> 00:26:47,729
Elena, pull that.

468
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:51,944
Unh!

469
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,032
All right, let's go. Clothes on.

470
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,868
Wait. What? Guys, come on.

471
00:26:55,868 --> 00:26:57,143
We have to get out of here.

472
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:01,106
Uhh! Come on, we gotta go.

473
00:27:01,216 --> 00:27:01,684
The other one.

474
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:03,917
Uhh!

475
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:09,185
Can you get him in the car?

476
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:11,233
Yeah. 
All right, go.

477
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:11,980
What about you?

478
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:13,954
You rescue, I'll distract. Go.

479
00:27:19,644 --> 00:27:20,444
Turn that down.

480
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:29,655
It's too quiet.

481
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:36,521
Spread out. Now.

482
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:42,210
You two, back of the house. Go.

483
00:27:42,985 --> 00:27:45,132
Check out both rooms. Cellar, now.

484
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:54,284
Uhh. Can you make it?

485
00:27:56,652 --> 00:27:57,846
Uhh! Unh.

486
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:03,096
Ohh. You ok?

487
00:28:03,593 --> 00:28:04,505
Yeah.

488
00:28:05,064 --> 00:28:06,885
Come on, we gotta
keep going. Come on.

489
00:28:07,156 --> 00:28:07,945
Ugh.

490
00:28:12,784 --> 00:28:17,004
Aah! Ugh!

491
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:19,440
Aah! Aah!

492
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,377
I'm going after Frederick!

493
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,391
Come on, it's right over here.

494
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,385
Stefan...

495
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,469
Aah!

496
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,637
Ugh!

497
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:31,745
Uhh...

498
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:39,859
This is for Bethanne.

499
00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:43,424
Aah!

500
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:45,447
And this is for the tomb.

501
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:46,334
No!!!

502
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,429
Ugh! Unh!

503
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:55,052
Stefan...

504
00:29:57,238 --> 00:29:58,806
Unh.

505
00:29:58,807 --> 00:29:59,840
Uhh.

506
00:30:00,723 --> 00:30:01,861
Stefan...

507
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,155
Stefan...

508
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:07,637
No, Stefan.

509
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,466
Stefan, Stefan.

510
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:12,000
Stefan! Stefan!

511
00:30:40,996 --> 00:30:41,798
Frederick is gone.

512
00:30:42,985 --> 00:30:44,234
Let's get out of here.

513
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:45,252
I'm gonna kill him.

514
00:30:56,234 --> 00:30:58,436
How many of those vervain
darts you have left?

515
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,570
One.

516
00:31:01,817 --> 00:31:03,186
Not gonna be enough.

517
00:31:06,346 --> 00:31:07,551
Hey, mom.

518
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:10,690
What's going on?

519
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:13,262
What's it look like?

520
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:16,540
Honestly, I wouldn't know.
I've never seen it before.

521
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,460
Well, sit down.
You might wanna order pizza.

522
00:31:19,441 --> 00:31:20,353
I'm out of practice.

523
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:23,365
Mmm. Mystery casserole. Yum.

524
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:25,511
Yeah. Some people aren't
meant for the kitchen.

525
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:31,071
What?

526
00:31:31,071 --> 00:31:33,119
Uh, I know it's been rough.

527
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:37,150
But I'm gonna try.
I mean, really try this time.

528
00:31:37,382 --> 00:31:39,097
You just have to bear with me, ok?

529
00:31:39,906 --> 00:31:40,753
Ok.

530
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:44,450
Ok. Good.

531
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:46,276
You know I got it.

532
00:31:46,366 --> 00:31:47,566
That bad, huh?

533
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,907
What happened to you?

534
00:31:56,435 --> 00:31:57,366
Hey, Matt.

535
00:31:57,697 --> 00:31:58,930
Hey.

536
00:32:00,931 --> 00:32:01,862
What's going on?

537
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,221
Is your mom home?

538
00:32:05,984 --> 00:32:07,070
Alright, give me 10 minutes.

539
00:32:07,234 --> 00:32:08,809
And keep it out of the
news till I get there.

540
00:32:09,204 --> 00:32:10,335
Grab your stuff. We gotta go.

541
00:32:10,953 --> 00:32:12,340
Kinda got half a burger left.

542
00:32:12,757 --> 00:32:13,765
They found Vicki Donovan.

543
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:17,040
Are you serious? Where was she?

544
00:32:17,751 --> 00:32:19,476
Storm unearthed the
grave off county road.

545
00:32:19,453 --> 00:32:21,180
They just brought her
body down to the morgue.

546
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,342
Wait. She's dead?

547
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,919
Come on, we gotta go.

548
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:35,761
Stefan, please.

549
00:32:36,912 --> 00:32:38,374
Stefan!

550
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,072
Oh, Stefan, please get up.
Get up, Stefan.

551
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:48,753
Stefan.

552
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,066
Here.

553
00:32:58,666 --> 00:32:59,798
Elena, please run.

554
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:01,402
No. Please.

555
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:03,190
Stefan. My wrist.

556
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:06,264
Here. Take my wrist.
You need more blood.

557
00:33:06,596 --> 00:33:08,601
Go, Elena. Run. Run...

558
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:09,385
No.

559
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:13,009
I trust you.

560
00:33:42,402 --> 00:33:45,246
So, what you said to get me
to do this, about my wife.

561
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:47,210
It was a lie, wasn't it?

562
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:47,653
Yep.

563
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:49,879
Stop.

564
00:33:50,838 --> 00:33:52,929
What's going on here?

565
00:34:05,303 --> 00:34:06,558
What did you do?

566
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:07,539
Me?

567
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:10,285
Your merry little band of vampires

568
00:34:10,285 --> 00:34:12,367
Spent the day torturing my brother.

569
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:17,652
Trust me. The parties responsible
for this will be dealt with.

570
00:34:17,652 --> 00:34:20,398
Our little arrangement doesn't work 
unless you learn to control them

571
00:34:20,088 --> 00:34:21,575
This wasn't supposed to happen.

572
00:34:21,575 --> 00:34:22,484
Well, it did.

573
00:34:23,464 --> 00:34:24,744
If I had a good side...

574
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:26,476
Not a way to get on it.

575
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:53,835
Argh!

576
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:55,103
Ahh!

577
00:34:56,672 --> 00:34:57,939
Aah!

578
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:01,343
Aah!

579
00:35:01,646 --> 00:35:02,334
Stefan!

580
00:35:06,382 --> 00:35:08,183
Argh!

581
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,119
How are you doing?

582
00:35:53,502 --> 00:35:54,736
I'm ok.

583
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,548
The wounds have mostly healed.

584
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,280
Good.

585
00:36:02,587 --> 00:36:03,925
Elena...

586
00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:05,080
Yeah?

587
00:36:05,576 --> 00:36:07,393
What you did today,

588
00:36:08,307 --> 00:36:09,529
Coming to help me...

589
00:36:11,976 --> 00:36:13,686
You could have been killed.

590
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:15,231
I know.

591
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,741
And what I did, I'm sorry that...

592
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:25,174
I'm sorry that you had to see it.

593
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:27,909
I've just never--

594
00:36:29,669 --> 00:36:30,989
You were like this other person.

595
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:35,628
And it's my fault. I made you--

596
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,032
What, no. no. no.

597
00:36:37,032 --> 00:36:39,471
You didn't make me do anything.
You were saving my life.

598
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:43,745
And I was saving yours.

599
00:36:50,995 --> 00:36:52,866
Everything's gonna be ok.

600
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:06,863
Hey, Jer...

601
00:37:09,218 --> 00:37:11,253
What--what's going on?

602
00:37:13,673 --> 00:37:14,835
Oh, no.

603
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,873
I made you some coffee.

604
00:37:50,974 --> 00:37:51,828
Thanks.

605
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:54,128
Are you...

606
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:56,750
Is there anything I can do?

607
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,028
I just, uh...

608
00:38:08,276 --> 00:38:10,201
I need to be alone right now.

609
00:38:30,704 --> 00:38:31,596
Matt...

610
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:51,700
That was fun.

611
00:38:52,986 --> 00:38:56,234
Oh, don't look at me like that.

612
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:57,650
I know you hate me.

613
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:01,933
Guess what? Everyone hates me.

614
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:05,856
But you can't deny it.

615
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:09,112
We were bad-ass.

616
00:39:16,777 --> 00:39:17,583
Uhh.

617
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:24,792
Happens.

618
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,097
Jer--

619
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,211
Are you ok?

620
00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:37,513
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

621
00:40:12,408 --> 00:40:13,706
What are you doing?

622
00:40:19,096 --> 00:40:22,473
My...my friend Vicki...

623
00:40:23,398 --> 00:40:24,638
She's...

624
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,989
She's dead.

625
00:40:29,037 --> 00:40:29,906
Vicki?

626
00:40:31,237 --> 00:40:32,270
The one you thought was a...

627
00:40:32,361 --> 00:40:33,523
Yep.

628
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:38,012
Turns out she's
been dead all along.

629
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:42,780
She's the reason
you wanted to turn.

630
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,189
You wanted to be with her.

631
00:40:55,929 --> 00:40:57,520
Look, I'm sorry.
