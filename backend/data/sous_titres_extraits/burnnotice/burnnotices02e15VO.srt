1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,583
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:03,770
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:06,880
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:09,468
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing.</i>

5
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,885
<i>No cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,340
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,423 --> 00:00:15,973
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:18,934
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,313
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:25,274
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:28,152
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI.</i>

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,529
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,948
- <i>Family, too...</i>
- Hey, is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,159
- <i>If you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:37,703
<i>Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,</i>

16
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:41,241
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:44,955
Let me tell you a story.

18
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:48,572
It starts with me nearly getting
blown up. You remember that, right?

19
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:50,841
Well, the way the door was rigged,

20
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,135
I realized the bomber
had to leave from the balcony.

21
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,930
Sure enough, the security camera
down the block caught him on tape.

22
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:57,431
Hold that!

23
00:00:57,985 --> 00:00:59,785
He was a hard man to find.

24
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,438
But eventually we connected.

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,100
Turns out he was a hired gun.

26
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,822
Good guy, really, gave me a lead
on the offshore bank that paid him.

27
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,247
I tried to follow the money,
but that turned out to be a dead end.

28
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:20,496
Whoever tired to kill me, he's paranoid,
careful, and he knows I'm close.

29
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,165
That is quite a mouthful, Michael.

30
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,683
- Thank you, Carla.
- You know, I'd love to believe you.

31
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:29,501
I'd also love to know why somebody
who's normally so careful

32
00:01:29,584 --> 00:01:33,734
to keep his mouth shut has suddenly
blossomed into such a storyteller.

33
00:01:34,035 --> 00:01:36,011
You blaming me for playing this
close to the vest?

34
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,723
It was a leak in your organization
that nearly got me killed.

35
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,349
I need you to back off.

36
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,185
I can't draw him out
with the suits-and-sunglasses crowd

37
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:44,768
following me around.

38
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:55,156
You can have more leash
if your story checks out,

39
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:59,324
- but if you hold back on me, Michael...
- You'll go after my family, kill me?

40
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:02,995
Talking with you
is always such a pleasure.

41
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:05,055
You have a nice day, Carla.

42
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:09,920
You didn't tell her it was Victor.
The man has tried to kill you twice,

43
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,792
- and you're protecting him.
- He's the one enemy I know Carla has.

44
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:16,051
I'd like to at least talk to him
before I turn him in.

45
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:19,400
You think he'll stop trying
to kill you long enough for you

46
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:21,348
to grab lunch and have a chat?

47
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:23,715
Everybody loves a free lunch.

48
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:35,662
Can you show this around
in areas Victor might be laying low?

49
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:37,862
Cash motels, campsites?

50
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:41,862
Okay, I'll tell people he's wanted
in connection with a dog-fighting ring.

51
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:43,095
They'll call.

52
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,342
Hi, mom.

53
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:47,875
Don't "Hi, mom" me.

54
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:50,379
You drag me out of my house
at a moment's notice,

55
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,005
and you can't even bother
to pick me up yourself?

56
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,673
You had to send Sam?

57
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:56,256
- No offense.
- None taken.

58
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:59,172
I'm just trying to lock things down
as fast as I can.

59
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:02,223
- It's a little dangerous right now.
- How dangerous, Michael?

60
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:04,235
Just a bad guy in town.

61
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,962
But you don't have to evacuate.
You just have to...

62
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:08,292
Stay here with me.

63
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,375
With you?

64
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,125
Here?

65
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:12,905
In this dump?

66
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:14,777
What?

67
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:17,196
Sam, you forget to lock
the front gate?

68
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:18,425
No.

69
00:03:33,154 --> 00:03:33,921
Sam.

70
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:35,215
Yeah, Mike?

71
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:36,924
He was talking to me.

72
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:39,635
Who are you?

73
00:03:40,615 --> 00:03:41,765
I'm Samantha.

74
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:44,598
Michael and I used to be engaged.

75
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,239

Another Sam.

83
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:19,550
This is gonna be confusing, huh?

84
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,011
Have you ever been
secretly engaged to my son?

85
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,137
No.

86
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,222
Then I think we'll be able
to tell you apart.

87
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:26,562
Fair enough.

88
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:27,766
I can't believe it.

89
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:29,595
No, I can believe it.

90
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:31,645
It's just like Michael.

91
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,917
Look, ladies, don't be
too hard on Mike.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm sure there's a very good reason
why he never mentioned her before.

93
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:41,572
I mean, you know, these things
just happen sometimes.

94
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:47,005
Anybody else need a drink?
No? Okay.

95
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:51,592
Michael, is everything...

96
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:54,793
Sorry, it's just not the best time
to be popping in out of the blue.

97
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,661
Why are you so paranoid?

98
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,132
- Thought you were out of the spy game.
- Yeah, that's the problem.

99
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:11,560
How did you find me?

100
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:13,962
- Your mom's in the book.
- I'm not.

101
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:16,745
She had your address
in her kitchen drawer.

102
00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:18,155
Sorry. I just...

103
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:19,818
needed to find you.

104
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:25,032
I didn't think you'd ever want
to see me again.

105
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,765
I didn't have a choice.

106
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:30,545
I'm in a lot of trouble, Michael.
I could use all the help that I can get.

107
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,822
His name is Tyler Brennen,
a black-market trader.

108
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:36,752
Used to work
in military intelligence.

109
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,754
That's him right there
on the balcony.

110
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:45,005
Evil son of a bitch.

111
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,959
About a month ago,
he came to me with a job offer.

112
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:52,352
- What line of work are you in, Sam?
- Acquisitions.

113
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,839
No need to be coy, dear.

114
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:55,604
If you're a thief,
say you're a thief.

115
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,062
You're among friends.

116
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:59,402
Brennen wanted me
to rob AFC industries.

117
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,912
It's a defense contractor
here in Miami.

118
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,052
The prize was a state-of-the-art
guidance chip,

119
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:06,722
- something to do with UAV spy drones.
- UAV drones?

120
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:09,292
- Tell me you passed on the job.
- Well, I tried to.

121
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,419
Okay, Mike, I'm sorry, but I can't help
steal military technology.

122
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:15,624
- I shouldn't even be hearing about it.
- I don't need help stealing it.

123
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:19,652
Come on!

124
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:21,673
I thought this was
a "get to know the ex" lunch.

125
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,717
Now it's a "19 government agencies
are chasing me" lunch?

126
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:26,051
I got away clean.

127
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:28,102
But when they realize it's missing,

128
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:30,019
they're gonna know it was me.

129
00:06:30,102 --> 00:06:30,802
How?

130
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:32,683
I had to get a job there
to get access.

131
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:34,837
My key-card activity
will give me away.

132
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,202
I'm new,

133
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:38,740
I went in at night, and if you check
my history, you'll see that...

134
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:39,927
Sam, why would you...

135
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,942
I didn't have time to do it
any other way.

136
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:43,861
Brennen kidnapped my son.

137
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,404
This is the ransom.

138
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,822
You have a son?

139
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:49,199
Charlie's 9.

140
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:55,998
When did you...

141
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,255
Is he...?

142
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:00,525
No.

143
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:06,015
No, he's not.
But he needs you.

144
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,855
When I think about
what might happen to him, I...

145
00:07:11,575 --> 00:07:14,122
- What do you want us to do?
- The trade's tomorrow.

146
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:17,478
I don't want to give this to Brennen,
but I need my boy back.

147
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:20,314
Please.

148
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:29,725
<i>The site of a deal can tell you a lot
about who you're doing business with.</i>

149
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:32,305
<i>If it's private, they value control.</i>

150
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,385
<i>If it's public, they want
to get in and out anonymously.</i>

151
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:40,660
<i>If they've somehow found
a site that gives them both,</i>

152
00:07:42,256 --> 00:07:45,552
<i>you're dealing with somebody
who really knows what he's doing.</i>

153
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:48,632
- We're all clear for now.
- Place is a nightmare, Mike.

154
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:50,675
I mean, you got tons
of foot traffic outside here.

155
00:07:50,758 --> 00:07:53,212
We got so many approaches,
we'll never see him coming.

156
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:56,452
If we can't jump him on his way in,
we're gonna let her make the trade.

157
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:57,732
Are you crazy?

158
00:07:57,815 --> 00:08:00,002
Putting military hardware
into this guy's hands?

159
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:02,648
Do you see another way?
There's a kid involved.

160
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,342
Nobody wants him to get hurt.

161
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:07,072
I'm just saying, we got to get that chip
back in the right hands and soon.

162
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:09,321
Otherwise, they're never gonna stop
looking for Samantha.

163
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,182
Sam, you go with Samantha,
oversee the hand-off.

164
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:15,160
Brennen won't expect you, but he won't
blow the deal over a little backup.

165
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,162
Fi, you set up
with a view of the meeting.

166
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:19,373
When you see that Charlie's safe,
give me the signal.

167
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,991
I'll take Brennen down
on his way out.

168
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:26,025
- I know I owe you some answers.
- You don't owe me anything.

169
00:08:27,645 --> 00:08:29,795
I knew Samantha before I met you.

170
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:32,495
We were in St. Petersburg in '97.

171
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:35,995
She was helping me on a job,
and things moved quickly.

172
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:40,282
Then I realized we didn't have
what we needed to make it last.

173
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:41,915
What was that? Trust?

174
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:44,243
Let's not do this now.
We have a job to do.

175
00:08:44,326 --> 00:08:47,135
I've always wanted to tell you.
I was just waiting for the right time.

176
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:49,752
Well, it wasn't the right time
when we met,

177
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:51,861
it wasn't the right time
when we started dating,

178
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:53,943
and it wasn't the right time
when I moved to Miami.

179
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:58,026
No, it was the right time to tell me
when she showed up on your front step.

180
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:01,645
That about right?

181
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:13,455
So, four iced teas?

182
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,782
I'm not that late.

183
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:17,097
You're hiding out.
Is Madeline still pissed?

184
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,822
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Okay, all right.

185
00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:21,902
Look, Mike, I know you've been
a little wound up,

186
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:24,190
so I brought a little present,
something to cheer you up.

187
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:27,024
Oh, no, no, no. This is way too good.
I'm gonna do a show-and-tell.

188
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:30,194
Buddy of mine did
some research on Victor.

189
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:31,778
Victor Stecker-Epps.

190
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,692
I mean, he's got a last name like
a female middle-distance runner,

191
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,725
but this is a bad man, Mike.
Black-ops hard-ass.

192
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,777
You're not the first guy
he tried to kill.

193
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,767
Just the first one he missed.
It's a great read.

194
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,016
If Carla's people burned him,
it's all fiction.

195
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:46,282
- How did he get burned?
- Good question.

196
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:49,865
July '03. Things get a little bloody
down Mexico way.

197
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:51,992
Victor denied the hits,

198
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,218
but a guy named Philip Cowan
burns him anyway.

199
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:56,651
Five years working for Carla alone.

200
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:58,506
I have a hunch
he's ready to make a friend.

201
00:09:58,589 --> 00:09:59,961
Mike, I don't know.

202
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:02,621
This one, you should be careful.
I mean, if half this crap is true,

203
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:05,687
Victor's a lot like you,
only with, you know, rabies.

204
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:22,035
Mom, I didn't think
you'd still be up.

205
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:25,225
Obviously.

206
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:30,625
Mom, what can I say?
I'm sorry you have to stay here.

207
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,625
Jesus, Michael.

208
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:35,795
That's not what
you should be sorry for.

209
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:37,755
Samantha.

210
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:40,585
I was getting to that.

211
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:42,465
Mom, I'm sorry.

212
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:45,018
It just never came up.
It was a long time ago.

213
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:48,272
You know, so was World War II,
but they still talk about it.

214
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:53,986
I want to know about the woman
who almost married my son.

215
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:58,647
She is a pisces,

216
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,580
she does "security",

217
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:03,829
and she hasn't been in my life
in a decade.

218
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,998
And she has a son
who's been kidnapped.

219
00:11:07,395 --> 00:11:08,495
Sam told me.

220
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:12,379
Is he yours, Michael?

221
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:13,835
I don't know.

222
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:16,383
But I'm gonna get him back.

223
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:22,705
- Hello?
- Michael?

224
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:27,227
You're gonna have to speak up,
I can barely hear you!

225
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:30,856
Victor, sounds like
you're enjoying Miami.

226
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,766
Nothing like a near-death experience
to get the juices flowing.

227
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:35,649
Am I right, or am I right?

228
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:37,572
I'm trying to cut back, myself.

229
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,706
Is that why you didn't shoot at me
the other night?

230
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:42,039
Or were you trying to make friends?

231
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:45,345
What's going on
in that pretty head of yours?

232
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:48,160
Vic, we have so much in common,
so much to talk about.

233
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:51,143
- Let's get together.
- I love it. Let's do it.

234
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:53,395
When and where? I'll be there.

235
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:56,423
Yes, you will be, but let's make that
a surprise, all right?

236
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,651
- Victor...
- I'll see you soon, sport. I promise.

237
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:09,353
- <i>Tell me what you see, Fiona.</i>
- Old Sam looks sweaty.

238
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,564
Just trying to cut
the tension, Michael.

239
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:16,026
Wait. There's Brennen.
He used a southwest approach.

240
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,820
Well, I'm in position.
If he doesn't leave this way...

241
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:21,335
He'll have to get past me.

242
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,275
"Come alone"...

243
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:25,848
I guess that was
too hard to understand.

244
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,095
Who's your friend, Sam?

245
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:29,998
Call me Chuck.
It'll be less confusing.

246
00:12:30,895 --> 00:12:33,152
I'm just here to make sure
everything goes smoothly.

247
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:37,839
Well, Chuck, number one, RSVP next time,
and number two, shut up.

248
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:40,926
I was talking to her.
The chip... Let's see it.

249
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,345
Where's my son?
Where's Charlie?

250
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:47,002
Trust me. I'm not looking to adopt.
I'm looking to retire.

251
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:49,518
But you don't see him
until I see the chip.

252
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:53,945
<i>Most black-market transactions
tend to go the same way.</i>

253
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:56,112
<i>First, payment is inspected.</i>

254
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:58,512
<i>Then the goods
are brought to the table.</i>

255
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:01,550
<i>This standard sequence
is meant to ensure both parties</i>

256
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:03,412
- <i>against a blown deal,</i>
- Curley.

257
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:07,077
<i>but that doesn't stop some people
from bringing a little extra insurance.</i>

258
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:09,077
- Charlie!
- Mom!

259
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,624
Charlie. Oh, come here, honey.
Come here.

260
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,793
He's fine. His arm is fine.

261
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:17,625
Whether it stays that way
is up to you.

262
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,967
- Oh, sweetie. What did they do to you?
- Be careful. That's not just a cast.

263
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:25,679
See, you can't trot a kid out in public
with a bomb strapped to his arm,

264
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,180
but I had this nifty idea.

265
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:30,482
Molded plastic explosive
under the fiberglass,

266
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:32,394
radio detonator with a mile radius.

267
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,582
You can cut it off in 10 minutes.

268
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:37,602
I'd appreciate it if you'd wait to start
until I'm safely away.

269
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:39,285
Hey, guys, thanks.

270
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:42,105
It's been a real pleasure.

271
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:49,365
I got him.

272
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,122
No, stand down.

273
00:13:52,685 --> 00:13:54,285
Does he have the chip?

274
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,013
<i>Something's wrong, Michael.</i>

275
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:58,625
Let him go.
You've got to let him go.

276
00:14:06,085 --> 00:14:07,735
This isn't the airport.

277
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:09,595
No, it's not.

278
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:13,215
Samantha,
the guidance chip you stole

279
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,185
isn't just expensive.

280
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,985
It's worth lives,
and when they realize it's gone,

281
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:21,632
you're gonna have every security service
in the western hemisphere after you.

282
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:23,862
The engineer that built it
is at a conference in Tokyo.

283
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:28,242
He doesn't get back until Friday.
I figure it's a pretty good head start.

284
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,125
I could fall off the grid,

285
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:33,121
- start over.
- You could. What about him?

286
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:37,042
You want Charlie celebrating
his 8th birthday in a hut in Nicaragua?

287
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,128
You really didn't think I'd notice
he's not old enough to be mine?

288
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:43,673
- Told you he wasn't yours.
- You let me believe he might be.

289
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:48,428
So, what? You never stretched the truth
a little bit to help an innocent person?

290
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:51,223
Come on, Michael.
I don't want to run.

291
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,519
I don't. I had every intention of
putting it back, but, I mean, it's gone.

292
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,887
No, it's not. We have till Friday.

293
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,482
I'm gonna get it back
and help you return it.

294
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:04,486
- And how do you propose to do that?
- Don't... Don't say "propose".

295
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:09,866
What, she lock you out?

296
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:12,365
No, I'm just getting some fresh air.

297
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,995
Your mom's a chimney, Mike.

298
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:15,968
Plus, Miss Commando
is getting all worked up

299
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:18,462
about an armed assault
on Brennen's condo.

300
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:20,126
He strapped a bomb to a kid.

301
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:23,832
- How is Charlie?
- He'll be fine.

302
00:15:23,915 --> 00:15:26,552
Sam's got family in Chicago.
He'll be safe there.

303
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,485
I lent her my car
to bring him to the airport.

304
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:31,596
You think she'll bring it back?

305
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,848
- Well, she is a professional thief.
- Jealous, Fi?

306
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:37,060
- Don't be absurd. I'm not jealous.
- You think you could pretend to be?

307
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:47,662
<i>Some cover IDs
are about blending in.</i>

308
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:49,459
<i>Others are about making a splash.</i>

309
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:51,794
<i>It all depends on whether
it's more important</i>

310
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:54,177
<i>to fool your target or impress them.</i>

311
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,747
- Hey, fellas, just give me a sec.
- It's okay, Curley.

312
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:02,103
These two are just showing me
they're mysterious, dangerous types

313
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:05,046
that can break into my apartment.
I should take them seriously.

314
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,942
That's the idea here, right?

315
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:10,121
<i>Of course, if your target
has a background in intelligence,</i>

316
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:12,095
<i>you often can't fool
or impress them.</i>

317
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,056
<i>In that case, the best cover ID
is none at all.</i>

318
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:18,422
I'm Michael. I used to work
in covert ops. This is Fiona.

319
00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:20,687
And you're here to help me pack?

320
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:24,149
That's really sweet, guys.
The furniture stays. It's a rental.

321
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,735
- We have a mutual acquaintance.
- Acquaintance?

322
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:29,342
Samantha Keyes?

323
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:33,074
She's upset about the deal that you two
just did. She came to me for help.

324
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:37,075
That thing she stole,
she's planning on stealing it back.

325
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:39,873
I'll bite.
You're telling me this because...

326
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,412
Samantha and I
used to work together.

327
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,711
Samantha and Michael slept together.

328
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:46,630
We... we worked most of the time.

329
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,798
Anyway, everything she knows,
she learned from me.

330
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:50,800
All I learned from her
is I can't trust her.

331
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:54,315
And Michael's now moved on,
and I don't like to share.

332
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:58,145
And I figured we could take care
of our problem and yours.

333
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:01,145
We're willing to help
for the right price.

334
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:02,305
Pass.

335
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:04,939
Even if I bought your tale,
which I really don't,

336
00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:08,535
I think I can handle
a single mom on my own,

337
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:10,282
spunky though she may be.

338
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:12,653
I know Samantha
little bit better than you do.

339
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:13,991
My money's on her.

340
00:17:14,155 --> 00:17:17,782
Samantha told us that she kept
a piece of your little doodad.

341
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:20,855
You try to unload it, your buyer's
gonna kill you or make you fix it.

342
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:22,438
Either way, she gets another shot.

343
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,876
You're gonna have to test it.
I know people who can do that.

344
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:27,796
I'm just thinking out loud here,

345
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:30,543
but if I wanted to steal
a really valuable object,

346
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,966
going in as a helpful soul
volunteering to test it

347
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:35,929
might be my first move.

348
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:39,224
Convince me you're on my side,
and, hey, guys,

349
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,792
it's a solid plan.

350
00:17:41,035 --> 00:17:42,585
One little caveat.

351
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:44,405
I...

352
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,648
don't... believe you.

353
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,475
Fine. Check us out.

354
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:52,785
I'm Michael Westen, she's Fiona
Glenanne, and you need our help.

355
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:56,015
If you're as smart as
you think you are,

356
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:57,535
you'll call us.

357
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:10,839
Looks like he's planning on using
the cash from the sale to disappear.

358
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,582
Anybody who's touched that chip will be
hunted across borders. He has to run.

359
00:18:14,665 --> 00:18:16,412
Well, he doesn't need
to run to Nicaragua.

360
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,805
With the money he can get for that chip,
he can buy Nicaragua.

361
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:21,145
Well, that's why he can't ignore
a threat like you.

362
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:23,478
If you rob him, sabotage the goods,

363
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,292
he'll have to run with nothing.

364
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,625
Oh, he'll call.

365
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:29,065
I think.

366
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,193
Well, if he doesn't, there's always
tear gas and a battering ram.

367
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:35,105
My ride is here.

368
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:39,312
Michael's other woman beckons.

369
00:18:39,395 --> 00:18:41,604
I never actually thought
I'd look forward to this.

370
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,687
Excuse me.

371
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:44,685
Oh, Michael.

372
00:18:45,605 --> 00:18:46,750
You forgot something.

373
00:18:51,155 --> 00:18:53,381
That's just a little game
the two of us used to play.

374
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:54,841
It's charming.

375
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:57,835
- Are you and Michael...
- No.

376
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,978
I have to admit, you've restored
a little of my faith in your abilities.

377
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:09,535
I take it my story checked out.

378
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,193
You keep this up, and you may just be
our next employee of the month.

379
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:16,613
How about you keep the plaque
and give me my life back instead?

380
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:18,765
You think you're kidding.

381
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:20,872
Give us the man
who killed our operatives,

382
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:23,203
and you and I can have
a little chat about your future.

383
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:25,632
Show me you can keep your promise.

384
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:28,122
I've started to see guys
like them in my sleep.

385
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:31,044
Back off, and I'm telling you,
this guy will make his move.

386
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:33,695
We'll leave you alone to work,

387
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:36,202
but I can't give you
much more time, Michael.

388
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:37,535
Management's...

389
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:39,522
getting anxious.

390
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:41,555
Tell them I know the feeling.

391
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:43,185
Hello?

392
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,849
Michael Westen, I've been thinking
about your proposal.

393
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:49,042
I think we should talk.

394
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,912
Why don't you come by around 4:00?

395
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:52,295
<i>Knock this time.</i>

396
00:20:05,895 --> 00:20:07,295
I checked you out.

397
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:09,325
Some of the stories I heard,

398
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,459
I should actually have
a higher caliber, probably.

399
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:13,461
You decide to test the chip?

400
00:20:13,785 --> 00:20:15,547
- I sure did.
- Fine. I'll set it up.

401
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:18,195
I made my own arrangements,
thank you.

402
00:20:18,278 --> 00:20:20,042
But I thought
it'd be a good idea to...

403
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,172
have you two where I could
see you while I did it.

404
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,355
My friend here is gonna
take your cellphones,

405
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:27,590
and we're gonna take a ride together.
For the record...

406
00:20:28,455 --> 00:20:29,455
Pumpkin,

407
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,938
I'm exactly as smart
as I think I am.

408
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:47,155
Testing guy, spies.
Spies, testing guy.

409
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,662
- What's going on?
- Everything's fine.

410
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:52,166
You're keeping it in the Caribbean?
A little humid out there

411
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:54,022
for such delicate electronics.

412
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:55,305
The Caribbean?

413
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,552
No, not gonna take that chance
with guys like you around.

414
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:00,341
It's in the air 23 hours a day.

415
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:15,272
I know what you're thinking, Fi.
Not yet.

416
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:18,610
That's not what I'm thinking.
We've got a visitor.

417
00:21:20,885 --> 00:21:23,114
I have to say, his timing's perfect.

418
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:24,465
So?

419
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,852
I can't vouch for performance,
but the parts are there.

420
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:27,985
Off you go.

421
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,124
So, the chip is fine.

422
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:40,285
Which means your offer to test it
is looking less fine.

423
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:43,301
Samantha lied to me. If you knew her,
you wouldn't be surprised.

424
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,335
It's all so confusing...

425
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:47,885
Her lying to you, you lying to me.

426
00:21:48,135 --> 00:21:51,042
Who can keep it straight?
You know, I think a couple of bullets

427
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,472
in the back of both of your heads
is gonna simplify things a lot.

428
00:21:54,555 --> 00:21:57,440
Yeah, well, it'll certainly
simplify things for Samantha.

429
00:21:57,735 --> 00:22:00,860
Please, Fiona.
I think I know who the thieves are here.

430
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,404
Really? The guy at the fence line
on the blue pickup truck?

431
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:06,995
You can do better than that.

432
00:22:13,205 --> 00:22:15,752
- Friend of yours?
- They don't watch me being executed.

433
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,192
Samantha's scouting you.

434
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:20,032
You think it's a coincidence that
that guy's there at the same time

435
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:21,965
the chip's out in the open?

436
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:35,975
- Do you believe me now?
- Not really.

437
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:37,345
Get in the car.

438
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:43,695
I want 5% of the sale price

439
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,985
to provide security
against Samantha.

440
00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:48,950
Make no mistake.
She's coming, and you'll need the help.

441
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:51,222
I'll hear you out.
No guarantees.

442
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:53,669
Listen, first of all, you're selling
the chip at the airport,

443
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:56,632
the one place she knows about.
You're doing half of her job for her.

444
00:22:56,715 --> 00:22:58,665
Well, aren't you Mr. Helpful?

445
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,544
The location is a challenge
we're just gonna have to overcome,

446
00:23:01,627 --> 00:23:04,187
because my buyers aren't
the sort of people you call up and say,

447
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,092
"Oh, hey, change of plans".

448
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:10,462
Here's the deal. You can help me
with my Samantha problem, period.

449
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:12,245
Works out, you get paid.

450
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:15,234
How do I provide security
with you tying my hands?

451
00:23:17,885 --> 00:23:19,892
God, I'm gonna miss this table.

452
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:22,921
Lock down the hangar.
You said you taught her everything.

453
00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:26,654
Think about what you'd do
and then what you'd do to stop that.

454
00:23:27,325 --> 00:23:28,922
But we're doing the deal

455
00:23:29,005 --> 00:23:32,285
with my buyers in my hangar,
where I'm in control.

456
00:23:32,575 --> 00:23:35,175
- Understand?
- Lock it down. Understood.

457
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:38,907
Okay, so, there's no way
to get to the chip before the sale,

458
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,040
no way to move the sale,
no way to delay the sale.

459
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,172
That South American hut's
starting to look better and better.

460
00:23:45,255 --> 00:23:48,926
What we're left with is snatch-and-dash
at the airport when the sale goes down.

461
00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:51,679
Sounds messy. Brennen's gonna have
that place locked down tight.

462
00:23:51,955 --> 00:23:53,848
Well, at least I'm in charge
of the lockdown.

463
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:55,892
We're gonna have
a lot of eyes on us,

464
00:23:56,054 --> 00:24:00,054
but we might be able to sneak in
some special construction materials.

465
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:02,275
Like we did in Dublin?

466
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,359
She talking about that thing
you and I did in St. Petersburg?

467
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:13,465
I should take this.

468
00:24:14,615 --> 00:24:16,370
And I'm gonna leave... now.

469
00:24:18,015 --> 00:24:18,862
<i>Victor.</i>

470
00:24:18,945 --> 00:24:22,995
Well, you are an enigma wrapped
in a schizophrenic, aren't you, sport?

471
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:26,756
First you don't shoot at me, and then
you set up a little firing squad.

472
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:30,015
I need help selling a cover ID,
nothing personal.

473
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,306
We do have some fun, don't we?

474
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,725
I really do want to get together.
How soon can we do this?

475
00:24:37,925 --> 00:24:39,592
If you give me till Friday,

476
00:24:39,675 --> 00:24:42,647
I think I've got a way to make sure
guns stay out of the equation.

477
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:49,278
- Didn't mean to startle you.
- Now I know where he gets his stealth.

478
00:24:50,015 --> 00:24:50,902
Samantha,

479
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:53,045
I know you're busy, but...

480
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:54,408
when this is over,

481
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,652
I would love to take you to lunch,

482
00:24:56,735 --> 00:24:57,662
just to chat.

483
00:24:57,925 --> 00:25:00,252
- Now, that he didn't get from you.
- What?

484
00:25:00,335 --> 00:25:02,692
Well, he's not exactly
the chatty type, your son.

485
00:25:02,775 --> 00:25:04,675
No, guess he's not.

486
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:07,152
He failed to mention
that he had proposed to you.

487
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:09,235
Actually, I proposed to him.

488
00:25:10,015 --> 00:25:11,015
Really?

489
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:13,545
If you don't mind...

490
00:25:13,935 --> 00:25:16,514
- What happened?
- I'm not really sure.

491
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,059
We had fun. Mike was the first guy
who really understood me.

492
00:25:20,515 --> 00:25:22,382
Then one day, it was just over.

493
00:25:22,465 --> 00:25:25,690
Never knew why.
He just said goodbye, and he was gone.

494
00:25:27,755 --> 00:25:29,026
That sounds like Michael.

495
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:41,289
<i>From private homes to financial
institutions to military encampments,</i>

496
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:45,172
<i>security consulting
is a multibillion-dollar industry.</i>

497
00:25:45,255 --> 00:25:47,356
<i>And while security consultants</i>

498
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:50,702
<i>constantly tout
new materials and technology,</i>

499
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:53,935
<i>the basic techniques
haven't changed in 4,000 years.</i>

500
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:57,718
<i>Get a better view of any danger
headed your way,</i>

501
00:25:57,885 --> 00:25:59,557
<i>make your walls sturdier,</i>

502
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:05,813
<i>and arm yourself well enough
to fend off attacks.</i>

503
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:13,070
<i>Hardening a target against attacks
from outside is pretty straightforward.</i>

504
00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:17,326
<i>Which is why
it's usually best to attack,</i>

505
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,509
<i>if you can, from the inside.</i>

506
00:26:31,745 --> 00:26:34,091
Darling, are you ready
to watch me become rich?

507
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,178
I'm gonna relish this.

508
00:26:49,805 --> 00:26:51,955
What the hell?
This is not good.

509
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,442
If that plane doesn't come to us,
we got to go to it.

510
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:56,225
What if the buyers show?

511
00:26:56,685 --> 00:26:59,158
- We improvise. We're gonna need a car.
- Sam!

512
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:04,785
Yeah, that's far enough.

513
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:13,035
You can't be serious. You're not gonna
leave the plane out in the open.

514
00:27:13,118 --> 00:27:15,462
It's not that I don't appreciate
all your work on the hangar.

515
00:27:15,545 --> 00:27:17,645
I just like to change things up.

516
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,647
- Brennen, you don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.

517
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:32,229
Either your security worked
and it scared Samantha away,

518
00:27:32,312 --> 00:27:33,822
in which case, I don't need it,

519
00:27:33,905 --> 00:27:37,321
or it didn't scare her away,
she's ready for it, and I don't want it.

520
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:51,669
<i>Hola, amigos!</i>

521
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:53,337
<i>Cómo estás?</i>

522
00:27:54,995 --> 00:27:55,881
Now what?

523
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,517
<i>Una trampa!</i>

524
00:28:09,215 --> 00:28:10,146
Come on!

525
00:28:11,145 --> 00:28:12,565
Do you see? What did I tell you?

526
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,494
- How did they get into the airport?
- I locked down the hangar!

527
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:22,116
I didn't lock down the airport!

528
00:28:35,935 --> 00:28:37,340
I thought I missed my ride.

529
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:43,930
You said Samantha
was gonna try to steal the chip.

530
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:48,142
- Did that look like a robbery to you?
- Jesus, you're supposed to be smart!

531
00:28:48,585 --> 00:28:52,985
The only way out for Samantha
was to steal the chip and put it back.

532
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:55,608
When she couldn't do that,
she knew they'd find her.

533
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,819
So, she did the next best thing.
She took you down with her.

534
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,772
You wanted to buy a mansion

535
00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:04,155
and a private army
in some non-extradition country?

536
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:07,495
If I'm not mistaken,
your money just left with your buyer.

537
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:09,038
Good luck finding a new one.

538
00:29:10,405 --> 00:29:13,487
FBI, CIA, NSA,
they'll all be on high alert.

539
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,642
And after that,
in less than 24 hours.

540
00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:17,552
You used to work with Samantha.

541
00:29:17,635 --> 00:29:20,716
You said you were better than she was.
That's what you told me, right?

542
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:21,842
I am.

543
00:29:22,185 --> 00:29:25,096
You can put the chip back at AFC,
and nobody will notice it's gone.

544
00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:30,684
How stupid do you think I am?

545
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:34,555
This is what you want.
This, right here.

546
00:29:35,145 --> 00:29:36,202
You get the chip.

547
00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:38,892
I have to give it to you.
I have no choice.

548
00:29:38,975 --> 00:29:40,736
This is what you want.
Am I right?

549
00:29:41,785 --> 00:29:43,406
You're right. You've got no choice.

550
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:46,944
You're either gonna be killed or serving
a life sentence by the end of the week

551
00:29:47,027 --> 00:29:49,870
unless the chip goes back.

552
00:29:52,545 --> 00:29:54,942
It doesn't matter
what you believe, Brennen.

553
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:58,225
There's one move for all of us.
Put the chip back.

554
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:02,105
And unless you know somebody else
who can do that...

555
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:08,597
If you try to sell the chip,

556
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,625
if you don't put it back,

557
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:13,375
I will find you.

558
00:30:14,165 --> 00:30:17,165
And no clever story
you're gonna tell

559
00:30:17,495 --> 00:30:18,795
is gonna stop me

560
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:22,305
from blowing your brains
out of the back of your skull.

561
00:30:23,015 --> 00:30:24,915
Do we understand each other?

562
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:40,838
Welcome to AFC Industries.

563
00:30:41,027 --> 00:30:43,563
We manufacture satellite
and missile-tracking systems,

564
00:30:43,646 --> 00:30:45,356
we design UAV guidance chips,

565
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:48,596
and sometimes
we accidentally hire thieves.

566
00:30:50,395 --> 00:30:52,817
That's the clean room.
That's where the chip has to go.

567
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,800
The engineer that built it
comes back tomorrow.

568
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:57,502
He's got a presentation
on the chip at 3:00.

569
00:30:57,585 --> 00:30:58,898
Then, that's our deadline.

570
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:03,347
We put it back, Brennen's on the run
from his nasty South American friends,

571
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:07,072
and we're good to go,
so long as we don't hit any snags.

572
00:31:07,495 --> 00:31:10,245
- Show me the snags.
- Card reader up front.

573
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:12,974
Now, assuming they haven't updated
their employee files,

574
00:31:13,057 --> 00:31:14,412
I can get us through.

575
00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:16,457
We'll dummy up an ID
that says you work with me.

576
00:31:16,715 --> 00:31:18,092
Handprint reader here?

577
00:31:18,175 --> 00:31:22,197
Yeah. Yeah, but that's not the problem.
The problem is the clean-room door.

578
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,722
It's got a keypad that has a 9-digit
access code, changed weekly.

579
00:31:25,805 --> 00:31:28,689
Took me 45 minutes to hack it
in the middle of the night.

580
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:31,847
Today we won't have 5. There's no way
we can get out clean in time.

581
00:31:32,165 --> 00:31:34,308
Then I guess we'll just have
to get out dirty.

582
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:41,065
<i>No large security building
is designed to be 100% secure.</i>

583
00:31:41,915 --> 00:31:44,316
<i>Doing business requires flexibility</i>

584
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,099
<i>to deal with visitors, repairman,
contractors, et cetera.</i>

585
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:51,290
<i>Getting in, then,
requires using that flexibility.</i>

586
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,244
I need your IDs.

587
00:31:54,595 --> 00:31:56,664
He's got a temporary pass.
I'll sign him in.

588
00:31:58,345 --> 00:32:00,303
Would you mind calling
and letting them know that

589
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:02,747
- we'll be by to set him up as a vendor?
- Yeah, no problem.

590
00:32:02,936 --> 00:32:05,297
Can you get me a raise
while you're at it?

591
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:13,202
<i>You have to make everybody think
you're someone else's problem.</i>

592
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:16,452
<i>Even advanced security measures
are useless</i>

593
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:18,936
<i>when people leave
their keys lying around.</i>

594
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:22,385
<i>And surprisingly often,
that's what people do.</i>

595
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:30,656
<i>People leave their key cards in purses,
their passwords on desks,</i>

596
00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:32,939
<i>and their handprints on soda cans.</i>

597
00:32:37,815 --> 00:32:40,665
- You want some? He left a little.
- I'm fine.

598
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:43,627
- Diet mountain dew.
- We don't have much time.

599
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,190
Shall we don our bunny suits?

600
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:13,124
If you're shy, we can break into
the ladies' changing room

601
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:15,117
- just up the hall.
- We can do this.

602
00:33:39,845 --> 00:33:42,645
<i>Past a certain point
in a clearance facility,</i>

603
00:33:42,745 --> 00:33:44,855
<i>you stop seeing security cameras.</i>

604
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:47,524
<i>Lowly security guards
don't have the clearance</i>

605
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,362
<i>to see what's on the cameras,
so there's no one to monitor them.</i>

606
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,714
<i>Usually, in the top security areas
of a high-tech facility,</i>

607
00:33:53,797 --> 00:33:57,292
<i>it's less about monitoring
and more about fortification.</i>

608
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:58,675
And here we are.

609
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:01,455
So, tell me, Michael,
what exactly do we have planned here?

610
00:34:02,105 --> 00:34:03,457
It's a shape charge.

611
00:34:04,434 --> 00:34:06,502
The det cord explodes.

612
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:11,340
And the reinforced polyester
from the hose shapes the blast,

613
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,808
and, you'll see.

614
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:16,220
It's nice to see you've learned some
tricks since the last time I saw you.

615
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,105
I would stand back.

616
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,192
<i>In a high-security situation,</i>

617
00:34:23,275 --> 00:34:26,605
<i>most people try to create
the smallest disturbance they can.</i>

618
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:31,822
<i>The thing is, high security is built
to deal with small disturbances.</i>

619
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,656
<i>Trip one sensor, and you're toast.</i>

620
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,939
<i>Trip 100 sensors, though,
and nobody knows what to do.</i>

621
00:34:44,435 --> 00:34:45,916
These look expensive.

622
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:48,782
What? What are you doing?

623
00:34:48,865 --> 00:34:51,130
It's got to look like
we broke in for a reason.

624
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:01,262
We're trying to get everyone
out of here in an orderly fashion.

625
00:35:01,345 --> 00:35:04,045
Please have your bags
ready for inspection.

626
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:09,398
You think they're gonna buy

627
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:12,252
that someone went through
all this trouble just for some lenses?

628
00:35:12,335 --> 00:35:14,742
I don't think they're going to know
what to make of this.

629
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:16,252
Nothing major's missing.

630
00:35:16,335 --> 00:35:18,745
Hopefully, they'll double the security,
keep people like you out.

631
00:35:18,828 --> 00:35:20,585
Speaking of that, the bag?

632
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:23,370
The bag?
What do you want to see my bag for?

633
00:35:27,685 --> 00:35:31,235
It's just some platinum wire.
It's worth like, what, 8 grand?

634
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:40,796
Done.

635
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:43,265
<i>Sounds like you invited
the Miami-Dade's sheriff's office.</i>

636
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,058
Not exactly what I had in mind.

637
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,222
But it's exactly what you needed.

638
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:51,062
One day, I'm gonna figure out exactly
what game you were playing here.

639
00:35:51,145 --> 00:35:54,562
No game, Brennen. I'd focus less on me
than getting out of the country.

640
00:35:54,645 --> 00:35:56,442
Your buyers looked
pretty upset with you.

641
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:59,425
Your concern for my welfare
is much appreciated.

642
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:01,825
See you around, Michael.

643
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,129
I love you.

644
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:08,475
Charlie says hi.

645
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:10,431
He wants to know
when I'm coming to get him.

646
00:36:10,514 --> 00:36:12,064
You leave town today.

647
00:36:12,665 --> 00:36:16,102
And you need to stay out of town, Sam.
Brennen won't forget this.

648
00:36:16,185 --> 00:36:17,972
He doesn't know
what to think right now,

649
00:36:18,055 --> 00:36:20,934
but if he were ever to confirm
that we were working together,

650
00:36:21,017 --> 00:36:22,638
well, he wouldn't take it well.

651
00:36:24,925 --> 00:36:27,125
And you need to give up this life.

652
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:29,652
You got lucky this time.

653
00:36:29,735 --> 00:36:31,302
- Next time...
- I know. I know.

654
00:36:31,385 --> 00:36:34,566
I just wish my last job didn't feel
like such a failure.

655
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,890
You have your life,
you have your freedom,

656
00:36:37,973 --> 00:36:39,523
and you have Charlie.

657
00:36:42,355 --> 00:36:44,117
You know, Charlie isn't yours.

658
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:47,538
But he could have been.

659
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:51,425
A lot of things could have been.

660
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:42,265
Did it go all right?

661
00:37:42,765 --> 00:37:44,265
Yeah, it's over now.

662
00:37:46,545 --> 00:37:49,045
- Well, it's late. I should go.
- Wait.

663
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:53,815
Whatever you're gonna say, it's...

664
00:37:54,435 --> 00:37:57,585
- It's in the past.
- It is, and it isn't, Fi.

665
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:02,455
Sam and I worked
because she was like me.

666
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:06,553
She didn't mind that...

667
00:38:07,395 --> 00:38:08,972
my job was lying to people.

668
00:38:09,055 --> 00:38:10,205
She loved it.

669
00:38:10,775 --> 00:38:12,425
She did the same thing.

670
00:38:12,805 --> 00:38:14,705
It made being with her easy.

671
00:38:16,675 --> 00:38:18,625
And then I met you.

672
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,025
And it was...

673
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:24,775
It was different.

674
00:38:25,525 --> 00:38:26,925
It was never easy.

675
00:38:29,885 --> 00:38:32,185
You knew a part of me she never did.

676
00:38:35,155 --> 00:38:36,271
And I left her

677
00:38:36,885 --> 00:38:37,885
because...

678
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:42,545
You don't marry someone
when you love somebody else.

679
00:39:13,945 --> 00:39:15,952
You want to play with that
somewhere else?

680
00:39:16,035 --> 00:39:17,435
You sure slept in.

681
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:18,438
Late night?

682
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:24,735
- What are you doing?
- Fixing a camera.

683
00:39:26,035 --> 00:39:29,235
Fixing a disposable camera. Right.

684
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,202
I have a meeting to get to.

685
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,954
And if it goes well, you can go home.
You can sleep in your own bed.

686
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:36,498
You won't have to pretend
to sleep in mine.

687
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:40,225
I'm sorry.

688
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:44,282
I know I shouldn't have been
eavesdropping last night.

689
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:46,734
And honestly, I didn't hear everything,
but still, I should...

690
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:49,511
Mom, it's all right.
I don't give you much choice.

691
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:52,472
I'm sorry.

692
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:04,317
You picked the right girl.

693
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,613
I just hope you're not waiting
for her to propose, too.

694
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:45,358
What, the metal detector
wasn't enough?

695
00:40:45,665 --> 00:40:48,915
Oh, it's not that I don't trust you.
It's just that...

696
00:40:49,385 --> 00:40:50,785
I don't trust you.

697
00:40:57,745 --> 00:41:00,632
Okay, here's my
"one time, expires immediately" offer.

698
00:41:00,715 --> 00:41:04,802
You tell Carla someone else went after
her operatives, and we're friends,

699
00:41:04,885 --> 00:41:07,267
the kind of friends who don't go
bowling, don't go for beers,

700
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,548
don't even really speak,

701
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,042
but also don't try
to kill each other.

702
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:15,722
Yeah, I was looking for a little
more carrot and a lot less stick.

703
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,940
I have questions, and I think
you can answer them.

704
00:41:19,245 --> 00:41:20,495
You're serious?

705
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:22,415
That was your idea?

706
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,435
All life's mysteries revealed

707
00:41:24,518 --> 00:41:27,262
in the men's john of the Miami-Dade
city hall and municipal building.

708
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:30,779
Actually, yeah,
that's what I want exactly.

709
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:34,002
Well, that's not on the menu.
What I'm offering is this.

710
00:41:34,085 --> 00:41:35,885
We're friends on my terms,

711
00:41:37,085 --> 00:41:39,830
- or we're enemies.
- And I'm asking for answers.

712
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:10,965
<i>Spend a career in covert ops,
and you learn a lot about yourself.</i>

713
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,890
<i>Will you lie to learn
something important? Yes.</i>

714
00:42:13,973 --> 00:42:17,773
<i>Will you betray someone
to serve a higher cause? Maybe.</i>

715
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,897
<i>Will you trade another man's life
for your freedom?</i>

716
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:24,975
<i>You don't really know the answer
until you face the question.</i>
