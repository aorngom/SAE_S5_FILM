1
00:00:00,313 --> 00:00:01,750
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,179
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,751
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

4
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:09,818
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,125
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:14,771
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:16,139
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:19,040
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:22,480
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,440
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:28,318
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

12
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,696
You know spies, a bunch of bitchy
little girls.

13
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:33,115
- <i>Family, too</i>
- Is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:35,325
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:37,953
<i>Bottom line...
as long as you're burned,</i>

16
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,830
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:56,180
<i>There are advantages to training
with someone you're close to.</i>

18
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:59,725
<i>Knowing each other's moves
makes training more effective.</i>

19
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,103
<i>But being involved
in each other's personal lives</i>

20
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:05,105
<i>can also make training
a lot more painful.</i>

21
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:09,315
- Something you want to talk about, Fi?
- Not really.

22
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:12,196
I know you're not thrilled

23
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,015
about me reaching out
to the intelligence community.

24
00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:17,076
No. I don't have a problem with it.

25
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,537
You want your old job back.
I said I'd be supportive.

26
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:23,207
Not a problem.

27
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,215
Are you expecting company?

28
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,775
That's like
two days' worth of yogurt.

29
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:57,685
That is either
a brilliantly disguised bomb,

30
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:00,117
or somebody knows
the way to your heart.

31
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,688
And they're shy.
They didn't stick around.

32
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,350
A thank-you gift from a client?

33
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:10,144
Well, that's the most
you've ever been paid for a job.

34
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:12,673
Pretty soon, you'll be able
to stop bumming money from me.

35
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,929
It's a gift
from your Agency friends, isn't it?

36
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:20,175
Could be.

37
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:22,175
Good for you.

38
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:24,685
Looks like you're getting back in.

39
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,567
Yogurt
Team

40
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:44,395
<i>Meeting a new operative is a lot
like going on a blind date.</i>

41
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:47,470
<i>You're bound to be nervous
the first couple of times you do it.</i>

42
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:49,877
<i>But live through a few,
and you get to be an expert.</i>

43
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,270
<i>You should arrive early,
prepare an exit strategy,</i>

44
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:59,053
<i>and know you could be in
for an ugly surprise.</i>

45
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:02,836
I figured you'd run surveillance from
the bistro 'cause of the sight lines,

46
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:06,143
but you're the spy, right?
This place is better.

47
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:09,025
Better escape routes,
better iced tea.

48
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:13,190
- So, Michael, you like the yogurt?
- No, I haven't tried it yet.

49
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:15,945
I was always taught
"Never take yogurt from strangers".

50
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,905
Well, let's not be strangers, then.

51
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:24,535
Name's Tom Strickler.

52
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:28,624
And what is it that you do, Tom?

53
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,460
Match people with opportunities.
It's a bit like an agent.

54
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:34,521
A man with your skills is extremely
valuable, as I'm sure you're aware,

55
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:37,348
and I just make sure
all that doesn't go to waste.

56
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,763
You're operating in Miami,

57
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:45,880
with no resources,
no operational support.

58
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:47,605
That's no way to live.

59
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,950
It's not safe, for you
or the people you care about.

60
00:03:50,075 --> 00:03:53,189
- And you're the solution to that?
- Yeah. I'm not asking you to change.

61
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:55,234
You get to keep doing
what comes naturally.

62
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,403
- And what is that?
- Surviving.

63
00:03:58,065 --> 00:03:59,697
You're great at surviving.

64
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,032
Now, you're a man with enemies.
We know that.

65
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:04,450
But your enemies
have enemies of their own.

66
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:07,288
People that'll pay to have you
take care of their problems.

67
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,456
Called synergy.

68
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,708
The enemy of your enemy
is your financial opportunity.

69
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,926
- What's in it for you?
- 10%.

70
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,275
I'm putting together
a deal for you now, actually.

71
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,990
I heard a rumor about...

72
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:20,415
an old associate of yours
who's making a move to Miami.

73
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,970
Figure the smart money's
on Michael Westen in that fight.

74
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:25,035
And you're the smart money.

75
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,300
- Any details on this old associate?
- Still working on that.

76
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:30,436
Apparently, there's some Ukrainian

77
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:33,530
who's very upset about an op
you ran in the '90s.

78
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:35,454
I'll let you know more
as I get the details.

79
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:38,986
- Sorry. I'm not a killer for hire.
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

80
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,109
This might be a killing thing.
It might not.

81
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:43,449
Let me do my homework,
and we'll discuss.

82
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:45,242
There's nothing to discuss.

83
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,995
Well, the thing is, this guy's coming
one way or another...

84
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,000
You have my number.
We'll talk soon.

85
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,129
Unless the Ukrainian
cuts your tongue out first, right?

86
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:06,065
So, who's the secret admirer?

87
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:08,349
Whoever they are,
they have good taste in yogurt.

88
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,010
His name's Strickler.

89
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:12,930
He says someone I crossed paths with
in the Ukraine is in town,

90
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:14,890
looking to settle an old score.

91
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,191
And he's here to profit
from any bloodshed.

92
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,250
Charming. Who's the Ukrainian?

93
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,805
Strickler claims not to know,
which is inconvenient,

94
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,934
because there's people from that region
who would like to see me stop breathing.

95
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:31,205
I know a guy. Goes by Beck.
He might be able to help.

96
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,404
He's made a lot of money for some
very powerful people over there.

97
00:05:34,806 --> 00:05:36,710
If he's Ukrainian,
he'll be able to fill you in.

98
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,195
Based in Miami?

99
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:41,200
Started as a local gangster
and went big-time.

100
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:43,060
He hijacks cargo and ships it,

101
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:46,095
like FedEx with a Kalashnikov set.

102
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:49,598
He's about as connected as a hustler
who doesn't speak Russian can get.

103
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:52,605
Think you can get me a meeting?

104
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:54,691
You don't want me as go-between.

105
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:57,606
I may have intercepted
a couple of his shipments once.

106
00:05:58,615 --> 00:06:00,494
Sparkly new P90s, Michael.

107
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:02,695
They deserved a good home.

108
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,395
So I get to walk up to him cold?
Great.

109
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,165
At least you'll get a good coffee.
I know his favorite spot.

110
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,537
Yeah, Sam.

111
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,160
Yeah, Mike, I'm at your mom's.

112
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:17,511
She got some curtains
from a guy named Tom Strickler.

113
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:19,692
Is this a business associate
of yours?

114
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:23,716
Put it this way. You know that broker
that contacted you in Germany in '89?

115
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:24,900
Yeah, Mueller.

116
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:28,340
Tried to pay me to "accidentally"
blow up a factory during an operation.

117
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:30,760
- Bloodsucker.
- I have my own parasite.

118
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:32,763
Some Ukrainian's in town
looking for me.

119
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:34,476
If I can get to him
before he does...

120
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:37,590
Strickler cuts you a check, and you're
one step closer to being a mercenary.

121
00:06:37,715 --> 00:06:39,652
- What are you gonna do?
- Run down the Ukrainian

122
00:06:39,777 --> 00:06:41,418
through a contact of Fi's.

123
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:42,860
Sam, can you...

124
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,128
Check out Strickler?
I'm on it.

125
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:50,785
No one else gave me
a house-rewarming present,

126
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,786
not even the guy
who blew up my house.

127
00:06:52,975 --> 00:06:54,830
Maddy, I thought we were over that.

128
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,748
Forgiveness is a process.

129
00:06:57,505 --> 00:06:59,752
Pick me up some curtain rods,
and maybe.

130
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:02,379
Fine. Curtain rods.
You got it.

131
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:10,110
<i>The cold approach is something
you try to avoid in intelligence work.</i>

132
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:13,085
<i>You want to ease
into a relationship over time.</i>

133
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,210
<i>When that's impossible,</i>

134
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,895
<i>you just have to turn on the charm
and hope for the best.</i>

135
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:20,022
John Beck, right?

136
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:22,345
Name is Michael.

137
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,940
I heard that you might be able
to help me with a situation.

138
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:28,066
- Word is you're a guy with connections.
- That's what they say.

139
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,786
- I just need a little information.
- Why should I give it to you?

140
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:35,871
I'm a good friend to have.

141
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,666
Let me explain something to you.
I don't have friends. I'm a businessman.

142
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,234
I got rivals. I got associates.
I even got a few enemies.

143
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,605
But friends?

144
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:47,655
Sorry, that's not how I roll.

145
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,743
I just need help
tracking down a Ukrainian

146
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:53,097
who might be in town looking for me.

147
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:56,506
- Sounds like you're in a bind.
- Could be.

148
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:59,728
- That's what I'm trying to find out.
- Good luck. Not my problem.

149
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:08,305
A while ago, one of your shipments
of P90s was "diverted".

150
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,772
I can make sure
that kind of thing stops.

151
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:14,615
See, I don't like people
in my business.

152
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:17,996
This here friendship
has gotten off to a bad start.

153
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,950
Friendships are about give and take.

154
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:23,043
You give me the information,
I'll take care of your shipment issues.

155
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:25,837
How about I give you
one more chance to get out of here

156
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:27,422
before I shoot you in the face?

157
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,472
That Ukrainian I mentioned...

158
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,225
He brought a few extra guys
into town with him. I'd get down.

159
00:08:39,756 --> 00:08:43,760
<i>A flash-bang grenade temporarily
impairs hearing and vision.</i>

160
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:45,035
I'd get down.

161
00:08:49,635 --> 00:08:51,969
<i>It makes fighting back
or attempting escape</i>

162
00:08:52,094 --> 00:08:53,740
<i>futile and dangerous to civilians.</i>

163
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:58,269
<i>So if you have to shoot blind,
it's better to use a camera than a gun.</i>

164
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:05,465
That was a short meeting.

165
00:09:10,495 --> 00:09:11,665


166
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,853


167
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:24,095


168
00:09:41,285 --> 00:09:44,530
<i>In a hostage situation,
the same things that get you killed</i>

169
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:46,255
<i>will extend your life.</i>

170
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:50,140
Look, I don't know
who you guys are, okay?

171
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:53,550
I got no problem with you, I guarantee
that you don't want no problems from me

172
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,280
or the people that I work with.

173
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:57,221
So let's cut this thing off
right here.

174
00:09:57,595 --> 00:10:01,558
No harm, no foul. Everybody goes home,
and we just forget all about it.

175
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:04,280
<i>If you have money,
you'll live till you pay.</i>

176
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:07,397
<i>If you have information,
you'll live till you talk.</i>

177
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,380
Come on! Look, you got the wrong guy!
I'm not a part of this.

178
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:12,778
I just met him for the first time
five minutes ago.

179
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,577
What do you think they're gonna do?

180
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:17,388
Drop you off at Starbucks, give you
a couple of bucks for a cup of coffee?

181
00:10:17,513 --> 00:10:19,060
Shut up. We'll figure it out.

182
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,863
Come on. I'm serious!
You got the wrong guy!

183
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,040
<i>And if you have nothing,
you're pretty much disposable.</i>

184
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,855


185
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,158


186
00:10:30,283 --> 00:10:31,495


187
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:34,156


188
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:35,915


189
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:48,655
Excuse me.
We need to keep this area clear.

190
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:51,703
Well, you know, I was in here,

191
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:54,435
and I ran out
when those men showed up.

192
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:56,995
And my husband, he's still in here.

193
00:10:57,488 --> 00:10:58,488
Go ahead.

194
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,247
Sam, I'm at the café
where Michael was meeting Beck.

195
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:08,111
- What's wrong?
- He's gone. So is Beck.

196
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:10,415
An extraction team.

197
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,790
Professionals,
from what I'm overhearing.

198
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:15,407
Jesus. You think Mikey's Ukrainian
made his move already?

199
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:18,282
Well, he moved quicker
than anyone expected.

200
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,855
Wait a second.

201
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:25,695
Michael's cell.

202
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:30,522
He took a picture of the team.

203
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,530
You know what? We gotta find Strickler.
Maybe he can put names to these faces.

204
00:11:34,655 --> 00:11:37,380
- I don't trust that guy.
- Yeah, well, he's all we got.

205
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:39,503
Plus, it'll give us a chance
to kick his teeth in.

206
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:42,670
I'm wearing my teeth-kicking heels.
See you in five.

207
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:44,286
There is something wrong?

208
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:47,664
Not at all.
Why would you think that?

209
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,125
So why you packing your gun
and your bulletproof vest?

210
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,480
Nothing to worry about.
I just gotta run an errand.

211
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:53,605
Really?

212
00:11:53,945 --> 00:11:55,638
So tell me about this errand.

213
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,665


214
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:01,705


215
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:05,610
<i>After the adrenaline rush
of an operation comes a crash.</i>

216
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:08,300
<i>Heightened reflexes
and awareness don't last.</i>

217
00:12:08,425 --> 00:12:10,380
<i>Two boring hours of driving later,</i>

218
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:13,482
<i>even the sharpest killing machine
lets down his guard.</i>

219
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:15,901
You don't wanna meet
this guy Chechik.

220
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:21,823
When it's time, get to the back door
and open it.

221
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:23,745
What are you doing?

222
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:26,858
Just remember.

223
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,288
Set your jaw.

224
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,788
You traitor! You son of a...

225
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:35,962
Are you thinking of selling me
out to Chechik?

226
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,423
I will kill you!

227
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,609
- You've to head into the trees.
- I got nothing to do with this!

228
00:13:00,558 --> 00:13:02,114
I don't even know him!

229
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:04,408
What do you want, an apology?
Let's go!

230
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:47,908
Look, Maddy, how many times do
we have to go over this?

231
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:51,037
We're doing a little practice thing.
Mike is fine, I swear.

232
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:53,540
You're gonna hear some swearing
if you don't tell the truth.

233
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:56,418
Sam, what is taking you so long?

234
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:59,912
There's Fiona.
She never shows up when there's trouble.

235
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:01,702
I'm telling you, There's no trouble.

236
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:03,914
Fi's just here to pick me up for...

237
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:05,746
A movie.

238
00:14:06,307 --> 00:14:07,307
Really?

239
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,931
Well, I'm in the mood for a matinee.
Should I bring a gun?

240
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:14,728
Don't you patronize me.

241
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:17,935
I have a right to know what's
happening with my son.

242
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,484
Did I fall apart the last time
you told me what was going on?

243
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:24,422
Someone took Michael.

244
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,120
- They took him? Where?
- That's what we need to find.

245
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:29,831
The second you find out anything,
I expect you to call me.

246
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:33,455
Let me remind you, you're
staying in my guest room.

247
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:37,918
You call me, or god as my witness,
I will smother you in your sleep.

248
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:40,489
All right, all right.
We'll call.

249
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,013
Wait, wait.
Stop, right now!

250
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:49,554
We don't have time for this.
You wanna shoot me?

251
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,943
You'll have the same problem,
just with one less bullet.

252
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:54,643
Maybe I'll drag your ass
back to that road as a peace offering.

253
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:57,302
- I deal with Russians.
- You speak the language?

254
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:59,731
- I got guys for that.
- You better learn fast.

255
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,435
Chechik didn't hire ambassadors.

256
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,614
They're not gonna wait for a translator
before they start shooting.

257
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:06,804
I'll put a bullet in our head.


258
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:08,406
That don't require translation.

259
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,908
Listen, Beck, I got you into this.
I will get you out.

260
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,680
- If we head east...
- You wanna go deeper into the woods?

261
00:15:13,805 --> 00:15:16,957
We got enough problems without
adding alligators to the list.

262
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:19,116
You go whatever way you want.

263
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:20,349
I'm going...

264
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,116
I'm going this way.

265
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:25,791
Beck, save your ammo.

266
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:29,219
Few days wandering around here starving,
you're gonna want to eat that bullet.

267
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:35,063
If you wanna survive,
Beck, follow me.

268
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:00,709
You missed a spot.

269
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:07,868
You're Michael's friends?

270
00:16:07,993 --> 00:16:09,467
- Where is he?
- Want a mojito?

271
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:12,666
Don't look so concerned, sweetheart.

272
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:17,096
Our favorite spy is in a bit of a jam,
and you're hoping I can get him out.

273
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:20,579
I wish it was that simple.
I was the one telling him

274
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:23,315
to keep his head down 'till I find out
more about who was after him.

275
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,274
And?

276
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:26,972
- I've some calls out.
- You've got some calls out?

277
00:16:27,304 --> 00:16:28,653
I suggest you try harder.

278
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,116
No need for theatrics.

279
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:32,367
I want Michael alive
as much as the next guy.

280
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,519
Unless, of course,
the next guy's Ukrainian.

281
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:36,022
You know him?

282
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:38,453
Michael took this picture
before he was snatched.

283
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,749
I know that pretty boy.
His name's Blad

284
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:45,045
Byrubin, Balubin?
"B" something.

285
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:48,964
Last time I checked, he's part of a
criminal syndicate run by Pyotr Chechik.

286
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,134
Chechik?

287
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:51,760
That rings a bell.

288
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:54,346
Mikey met him back in'97
when he blew up a...

289
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,742
Let's just say
that he really hates Mikey.

290
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:00,100
Where is Chechik?

291
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,742
Well, guys with records like him
don't cross borders too easily.

292
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:06,994
If he is in Miami,
he didn't fly commercial.

293
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,989
I know some of the pilots that do
the Miami/Eastern Europe route.

294
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,947
Could put out some feelers.
Give me a couple of hours.

295
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:16,244
I'm not giving you a couple minutes.
I want names now.

296
00:17:23,806 --> 00:17:27,710
<i>When on the run, subtle things
like broken branches, flattened grass, </i>

297
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:31,431
<i>and disturbed ground can give you
away to an expert tracker.</i>

298
00:17:31,556 --> 00:17:35,446
<i>An inexperienced tracker may
require a more obvious trail.</i>

299
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:37,889
What is this?
You trying to get us killed?

300
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:38,901
Followed.

301
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:42,095
We need to lead them deeper in,
turn their strengths to weaknesses.

302
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,432
Their bulletproof vests ,
their guns will get heavy.

303
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:46,137
We got to get them farther

304
00:17:46,262 --> 00:17:48,297
Whatever you got planned,
they're far enough .

305
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:49,734
- Listen.
- You, listen.

306
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,029
I grew up in the Florida backwoods.
I spent my life trying to get out.

307
00:17:53,493 --> 00:17:56,105
I fought my way down to Miami
so I'd never have to swat bugs

308
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,660
in another mangrove swamp,
and now you dragged me back.

309
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:00,620
I say we make our stand right here.

310
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,706
You want to make a stand?

311
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,292
Can we make the stand over there?

312
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:26,496
Still think you can take them?
There's five of them.

313
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,869
- I got five rounds.
- That's your plan?

314
00:18:28,994 --> 00:18:30,692
You've a 100% kill rate 

315
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:32,819
It's better than running
around in a swamp!

316
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,363
I ain't too bad with a gun.
I'll  teach you .

317
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:38,575
You fire, they'll get our position.
They'll flank us and pin us down.

318
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:42,934
We have to separate them.

319
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:45,790
We got to lead them
little farther in.

320
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:49,256
- And then we strike?
- And then we strike.

321
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:15,243
Looks like the guy Strickler said
flew Chechik into the country.

322
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:17,808
Why anyone would allow him to
pilot a plane is beyond me.

323
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:19,733
Great. A drunk with a gun.

324
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:22,494
- This calls for subtlety.
- I can do subtle.

325
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,420
I don't like to.

326
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:26,933
But I can.

327
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:38,134
What is a sweet, little girl like you
doing in a big, bad bar like this?

328
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,844
I'm looking for a big,

329
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:43,056
bad man...

330
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,016
Like you.

331
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:51,157
Come with me or say goodbye
to your two closest friends.

332
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:04,219
Give me your shoelaces.

333
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:06,428
I may not be Rambo,
but if you're making a trap...

334
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:09,225
It doesn't have to work.
They'll see it and figure we're close.

335
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,875
They'll fan out, we'll injure them.

336
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,127
- We're injuring them?
- It'll slow them down.

337
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,315
If I have to drag a complaing
pain in the ass through the woods,

338
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,653
- they can, too. Give me your shoelaces.
- You know what.

339
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:21,344
Maybe it's time we listen to
the guy with a gun for a while.

340
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,303
Fine.

341
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:25,265
Now give me your shoelaces.

342
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,658
Mr. Smartass.

343
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,668
All right. Let's try this again.
Give me your shoelaces.

344
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:55,405
Please.

345
00:21:04,406 --> 00:21:07,495
Yeah, Maddy.
You wanted me to call, so I'm calling.

346
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,758
You find Michael?

347
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:12,025
No, but we found some guy who might
be able to tell us where he is.

348
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,968
We're leaving Hallandale right now.

349
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:16,655
We're heading over to the loft
to ask him questions.

350
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,298
You bring him here instead.

351
00:21:18,873 --> 00:21:21,946
It's closer than Michael's loft,
and you don't have time to waste.

352
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:59,876
<i>Fanning out in a search pattern
is a great way to cover a lot of area, </i>

353
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,096
<i>but it also divides your forces.</i>

354
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,505
- Stand back!
- Don't. We need him alive, remember?

355
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:06,592
You wanna hit him?

356
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:08,886
Anytime.

357
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:25,398
<i>Military units are
a lot like marching bands.</i>

358
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:30,150
<i>Take out the guy conducting
the operation,</i>

359
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,908
<i>and you'll throw everyone
out of sync.</i>

360
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,724
<i>Pretty soon, all you have left
is sound and fury.</i>

361
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,221
We got two guns,
explosives, a serious knife.

362
00:23:45,346 --> 00:23:46,943
We could even the odds real quick.

363
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:49,343
Not until they call Chechik.
We need to lure him out here.

364
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:50,678
What?

365
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,888
If we get Chechik, we can end this.


366
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,514
You want more men out here?

367
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,393
When you started out,
who was the biggest hijacker in Miami?

368
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:00,562
- Cuban guy. Montez.
- How did you take him down?

369
00:24:01,471 --> 00:24:04,406
Well, I paid one of his guys
to let me into his place,

370
00:24:04,531 --> 00:24:08,051
and then I stuck a gun in his mouth
until he decided to move back to LA.

371
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,907
You dealt with the problem at the top.
That's what we're doing.

372
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,842
- If they don't call Chechik?
- They will.

373
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:15,082
They're in over their heads,
and they know it.

374
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:25,713
See?

375
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:28,521
Don't get cocky.

376
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:45,942
You've been running up frequent-flier
miles with a lot of shady characters.

377
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,268
I wonder what the Feds would think.

378
00:24:49,914 --> 00:24:52,614
I told you, man.
All I do is fly the plane.

379
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:55,270
I doubt the boys in suits
would see it that way.

380
00:24:55,395 --> 00:24:58,474
Chechik is a bad guy.
War crimes, murder for hire.

381
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,299
Why do you think
I'm keeping my mouth shut?

382
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:14,285
That guy is more afraid of
Chechik than he is of us.

383
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,398
- We have to squeeze him harder.
- If by "Squeeze", you mean "Choke"...

384
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:20,628
- He can't talk if he can't breathe.
- He can whisper. I've good hearing.

385
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,786
You push him too hard,
he's gonna snap.

386
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:24,815
And then he's gonna
start making crap up.

387
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,940
Sam Axe wisdom.

388
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,660
How you doing?

389
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,537
You comfortable?
You need anything?

390
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,610
Mind if I sit?

391
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:45,961
You want a cigarette?

392
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:48,038
Mind if I do?

393
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:56,512
I don't mean to bother you.
I need a peace and quiet.

394
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,514
They get loud when they're angry.

395
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,384
Luckily,
this place is well-insulated.

396
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,570
You can't even hear
a peep from outside.

397
00:26:15,102 --> 00:26:17,033
Probably why they like it so much.

398
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:24,539
I'm sorry. I hope I didn't
give you the wrong impression.

399
00:26:24,664 --> 00:26:28,127
I have never once, ever,
ever seen them make anyone suffer.

400
00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:33,883
If they don't think you'll break,
they end it quick.

401
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,762
You sure you don't want a cigarette?

402
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,913
It's good for the nerves.

403
00:26:40,286 --> 00:26:42,892
It's not like you've to worry
about getting cancer anymore.

404
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,498
I'm sorry.
Did I hurt you?

405
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,610
There you go.

406
00:27:04,726 --> 00:27:05,726
Good, huh?

407
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,475
- I don't micromanage you.
- I'm not micromanaging you, either.

408
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,965
He dropped them off a few hours ago.
A cabin in the middle of the swamp.

409
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,468
There's no address,
but I got the latitude and longitude.

410
00:27:19,315 --> 00:27:20,315
How?

411
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,267
Honey, I've met guys like this before.
They're brave when people are yelling.

412
00:27:26,465 --> 00:27:29,865
So you gonna go get my son,
or do I have to do that, too?

413
00:27:41,185 --> 00:27:42,743
<i>When fighting in the wilderness,</i>

414
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,910
<i>the biggest threats are often
the ones you don't see.</i>

415
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:47,135
<i>Dehydration,</i>

416
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:52,128
<i>exhaustion, and nerves.</i>

417
00:27:55,695 --> 00:27:58,745
<i>But boatloads of hostiles
don't help, either.</i>

418
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,988
- There's Chechik.
- Damn!

419
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,796
Is there a Russian word
for "hardass"?

420
00:28:21,405 --> 00:28:24,956
If we can get him into the woods,
we'll have enough cover to separate him.

421
00:28:25,081 --> 00:28:28,414
You sound confident for a guy hiding
in a jungle with a pair of slacks.

422
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,632
We wanted Chechik. There he is.

423
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,425
Yeah, along with more men,
more guns, and damn airboats, man!

424
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,213
We go, we take out Chechik,
and all those guys will come after us.

425
00:28:36,406 --> 00:28:39,133
The men who work for you, if you were
taken out, what would they do?

426
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,845
- Shoot the bastards who did it.
- Really? You really think so?

427
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:44,805
You said you had no friends.

428
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,224
All right, think like a businessman.
How long would they stomp in this swamp

429
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,205
once the guy who cuts their checks
is out of commission?

430
00:29:06,235 --> 00:29:08,735
- How you doing?
- Yeah, how you doing?

431
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,499
What'll it take to rent
one of these babies for a couple hours?

432
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,043
90 bucks, plus insurance.

433
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:18,130
$25 for basic coverage,
$15 for supplemental liability.

434
00:29:18,345 --> 00:29:20,445
Does that cover small-arms fire?

435
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,386
What my friend here is saying is,

436
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:25,679
we're not big on paperwork.

437
00:29:28,515 --> 00:29:31,185
50 extra bucks,
you guys weren't even here.

438
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:33,229
Look. We just disappeared.

439
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,481
Thanks.

440
00:29:41,185 --> 00:29:42,655


441
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,765


442
00:29:48,915 --> 00:29:50,272


443
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:51,247


444
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,420


445
00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:54,347


446
00:29:54,472 --> 00:29:55,292


447
00:29:58,355 --> 00:30:00,965
That's Chechik.
Some things never change.

448
00:30:02,055 --> 00:30:02,925


449
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:08,055
So, we get him when he goes
into the woods, huh?

450
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:11,475
- Only he ain't going into the woods.
- We've to get him to move. Point is...

451
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,466
No, the point is that you wanted them
to call for backup, and they did.

452
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:16,272
Now we're outnumbered five to one.

453
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:20,489
<i>In battle, not even the best-laid plans
survive contact with the enemy.</i>

454
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,920
<i>If you want to survive,
you have to be willing to improvise.</i>

455
00:30:24,045 --> 00:30:26,782
- All right, if you distract his men...
- Wait, wait, wait!

456
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,077
Distract a dozen guys with guns?
Forget it! You and me are done!

457
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,371
I'd rather take my chances
with Mr. Hardass.

458
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,372
Beck, stop.

459
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:36,680
You're gonna get killed.

460
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:39,295
So, what you gonna do, shoot me?
Give away your position?

461
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,590
<i>Of course, there's such a thing
as too much improvisation.</i>

462
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:44,818
It's like you said.
I'm a businessman.

463
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,219
I got something they want.
Now it's time to negotiate.

464
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:49,845
I wanna make a deal!

465
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,974
You want Westen,
I can give you Westen!

466
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:01,942
Get up.

467
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,020


468
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:50,990
You think you can reach
that bank underwater?

469
00:31:51,115 --> 00:31:52,415
Guess I have to.

470
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:12,355


471
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:15,406


472
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,540
You know, I should have shot you
when you first interrupted my coffee.

473
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,625
Let's not dwell
on missed opportunities.

474
00:32:44,385 --> 00:32:45,385
You know,

475
00:32:45,555 --> 00:32:47,555
I got 25 people on my payroll.

476
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:52,665
I got people who report to people
who report to people.

477
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,682
And here I am, in the middle of nowhere,
about to die from a damn leg wound!

478
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,500
Well, you're not alone.

479
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:01,061
The hell I'm not.

480
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,981
- You gonna stick around, watch me die?
- No, we're gonna get through this.

481
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,539
What? What are you, crazy?

482
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:07,818
You've seen what happens
to people with wounds here.

483
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:10,113
Look, it doesn't have
to be that way.

484
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:11,697
But you have to decide.

485
00:33:11,995 --> 00:33:15,159
Are you ready to trust me and figure out
a plan, or do you want to die out here?

486
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,538
Is it really that tough of a call?

487
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:28,464
<i>Delaying tactics aren't the most
glamorous part of a battle plan,</i>

488
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,220
<i>but they're often
the most important.</i>

489
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:33,850
<i>Slowing the enemy down buys you time
to prepare the ground ahead of you,</i>

490
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:37,580
<i>and that, more than almost
anything else, wins battles.</i>

491
00:33:38,505 --> 00:33:39,683
Where is your friend?

492
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:41,393
I got nothing to say.

493
00:33:44,495 --> 00:33:45,981
Where is Michael?

494
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:48,400
Why should I tell you?
You're gonna kill me anyway!

495
00:33:50,015 --> 00:33:51,365
Maybe. Maybe not.

496
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:53,665
You're nobody.

497
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:55,355
I'm here for Westen.

498
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,025
You tell me where he is,

499
00:33:58,925 --> 00:34:01,413
and I'll give you some water
and bandages for the wound.

500
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,295
You see this?

501
00:34:08,605 --> 00:34:09,880
I swear on the cross,

502
00:34:10,545 --> 00:34:11,965
on the eyes of my children.

503
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,594
All right. Fine.

504
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:18,625
He went that way.
There's a swamp...

505
00:34:19,415 --> 00:34:20,933
where the airboats can't go.

506
00:34:24,665 --> 00:34:26,533


507
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:27,815


508
00:34:28,036 --> 00:34:29,265


509
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:34,555


510
00:34:47,788 --> 00:34:50,388
The pilot dropped Chechik
a few miles up.

511
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:53,882
If Michael's not there,
I hope you brought bug spray.

512
00:34:59,355 --> 00:35:00,455
Right there.

513
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,141
That must be Chechik's airboat.
They got to be close.

514
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,910
<i>For a spy,
there's no shame in retreat.</i>

515
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,850
<i>When faced with
a more powerful enemy,</i>

516
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:26,750
<i>you're trained to get out of the way
and keep moving.</i>

517
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,876
<i>It's not about running away
or giving up.</i>

518
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,860
<i>The goal of any retreat
is to find the right place</i>

519
00:35:31,985 --> 00:35:34,506
<i>to marshal your resources
and make a stand.</i>

520
00:35:43,773 --> 00:35:48,473
<i>Military history is filled with stories
of small forces taking on larger ones.</i>

521
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:50,314
<i>Whether it's David fighting Goliath</i>

522
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,691
<i>or the French resistance
fighting the Nazis,</i>

523
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,568
<i>the strategy is basically the same.</i>

524
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,484
<i>You have to choose the right ground,</i>

525
00:35:56,609 --> 00:35:58,550
<i>deploy your resources carefully,</i>

526
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:02,425
<i>and remember that the greatest weapon
in any battle is surprise.</i>

527
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:10,035
Give me the radio.

528
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:14,463
Well, well, Michael.

529
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,031
<i>Here we are again,</i>

530
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:17,350
<i>after so many years.</i>

531
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,384
<i>You, me, plenty of guns.</i>

532
00:36:20,765 --> 00:36:22,721
I almost forgot
how much I enjoyed the hunt.

533
00:36:23,185 --> 00:36:26,350
You know, I thought after serving
10 years for war crimes

534
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:28,140
you would have found a new hobby.

535
00:36:28,265 --> 00:36:30,660
10 years just made me
want to find you more.

536
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,455
<i>I never get over the one
that got away.</i>

537
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,650
I'm flattered.

538
00:36:35,106 --> 00:36:37,319
You brought a whole army
just to find little old me?

539
00:36:37,535 --> 00:36:38,612
Times change.

540
00:36:39,435 --> 00:36:41,573
An army that big,
I got to fold my laundry.

541
00:36:41,995 --> 00:36:43,408
I work for Fedor Markov now.

542
00:36:43,665 --> 00:36:44,665
Markov?

543
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:47,329
You know,
I liked you KGB officers better

544
00:36:47,565 --> 00:36:48,780
before you sold out.

545
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:50,541
At least you believed in something.

546
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:52,775
You should be happy, Michael.

547
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:56,588
We all live American dream,
dream spies like you helped make.

548
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,715
<i>Open borders, free markets.
Everyone's friends.</i>

549
00:37:00,075 --> 00:37:02,395
<i>Look at me.
Ukrainian with Russian team,</i>

550
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,970
German weapons,
funding from the West.

551
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,280
So many backgrounds, so many people
working together just to drag...

552
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:10,800
<i>every secret out of
Michael Westen's head</i>

553
00:37:10,925 --> 00:37:13,272
before we cut it off
and feed it to the dogs.

554
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:14,610
But enough talk.

555
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:16,316
As much as I'd like to catch up,

556
00:37:16,615 --> 00:37:19,065
you should have turned
your radio off.

557
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,605


558
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:42,285


559
00:37:46,675 --> 00:37:49,390
You should stick to hunting things
that don't fight back.

560
00:37:49,515 --> 00:37:52,070
Get your men to drop their guns,
do it now.

561
00:37:52,195 --> 00:37:53,145
All right.

562
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:55,135


563
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:06,314


564
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:08,535
Nothing you have
to worry about anymore.

565
00:38:10,895 --> 00:38:11,895
Get up.

566
00:38:14,385 --> 00:38:16,155
- Thanks, man.
- Easy-peasy, huh?

567
00:38:24,915 --> 00:38:27,965
I expect some serious memory loss.
You understand?

568
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,415
You think this is over?

569
00:38:30,835 --> 00:38:33,560
Shevchenkos look out for their own.
Markov will find you.

570
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,437
Don't you know it's rude
to drop names?

571
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:36,939
Yeah, stupid, too.

572
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:40,357
Especially when a nobody like me
can drop bigger ones.

573
00:38:40,545 --> 00:38:42,569
All those KGB colonels
in the Russian mafia?

574
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,863
Well, they work for
an old KGB general

575
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:47,366
who happens to be
a business associate of mine.

576
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:49,121
I don't want to name names,

577
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:53,046
but he can controls about 800 miles
of the Siberian oil pipeline.

578
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,834
Yeah, I do all
their import/export work.

579
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,711
You nearly cost them a lot of money.

580
00:39:00,175 --> 00:39:03,048
I'm gonna have to give them a call,
see how they feel about that.

581
00:39:03,365 --> 00:39:06,009
I give you $50,000,
and I swear you'll never see me again.

582
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,680
- I know I won't.
- Get this fool out of here.

583
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,055
Stop. $100,000.

584
00:39:10,785 --> 00:39:12,140
Don't be stupid! Come on!

585
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,352
There's not enough money
in the world.

586
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:20,790
Next time you get kidnapped,
can you stay out of the Everglades?

587
00:39:20,915 --> 00:39:23,800
There ain't gonna be no next time,
at least not for these boys.

588
00:39:24,605 --> 00:39:27,531
And you still owe me a shipment of P90s.
Don't think I forgot.

589
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,116
I'll make sure they get to you.

590
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:32,869
You know, one day, we're gonna look back
on this as a nice day out in nature.

591
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,537
Yeah, don't push it.

592
00:39:34,968 --> 00:39:36,081
I'll just say this.

593
00:39:37,295 --> 00:39:39,167
You said you were
a good friend to have.

594
00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:41,745
Could do worse.

595
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,887
What brings you two
out to this neck of the woods?

596
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,418
Well, you know,
it's such a sunny day.

597
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:56,055
I thought you might need these.

598
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:12,280
I'm beginning to think I should get you
one of those harness things.

599
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:14,244
You know,
like they have for toddlers.

600
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:16,997
You've been wandering off
a little too much these days.

601
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:19,249
It's nothing I can't handle, mom.

602
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:22,720
No, see, you don't get
to act that casual

603
00:40:22,845 --> 00:40:26,548
when I'm interrogating strange men
in my garage to save your life.

604
00:40:28,415 --> 00:40:29,968
I'm sorry about that, mom.

605
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:31,275
Whatever.

606
00:40:31,755 --> 00:40:35,307
Getting answers out of him was a lot
easier than getting them out of you.

607
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,560
Be careful.

608
00:40:47,265 --> 00:40:49,165
Do you like my new curtains?

609
00:40:50,205 --> 00:40:51,870
You hung your curtains by yourself?

610
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:54,701
Actually, no. Some very nice people
came over and did it.

611
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:57,240
They were sent over
by your friend Strickler.

612
00:40:57,835 --> 00:40:58,835
Wonderful.

613
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:02,825
Try not to wrinkle them
when you're sweeping them for bugs.

614
00:41:16,855 --> 00:41:18,105
No gift basket?

615
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:21,705
So nice to have you back in town.

616
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:24,773
No, no gift basket.
I got you something better.

617
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,091
Your share of the Ukrainian deal.

618
00:41:27,362 --> 00:41:30,072
Turns out a group of Baltic separatists
wanted Chechik out of the picture

619
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:31,488
just as much as you did.

620
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,972
Some quick negotiating
on my part, and, voila,

621
00:41:34,097 --> 00:41:36,080
your day-trip to the swamp
paid for itself.

622
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:38,170
I didn't fight off Chechik
for the cash.

623
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,122
I know. You did it for you.

624
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,253
This is just a wonderful by-product.

625
00:41:42,727 --> 00:41:45,133
This is just the beginning.
I can get you whatever you want.

626
00:41:45,258 --> 00:41:47,629
Let me save you some time.
I'm never gonna work with you.

627
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:51,423
Not for the money, not for the yogurt,
for the curtains.

628
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,092
I'm not a mercenary.

629
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,670
But you gotta ask yourself this.

630
00:41:56,795 --> 00:41:59,321
What is it that you want?
What is it that you deserve?

631
00:41:59,446 --> 00:42:01,430
A man with your skills,
with your background,

632
00:42:01,555 --> 00:42:04,005
burned, out in the cold,
with nothing?

633
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,105
Don't answer right now.

634
00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:07,965
Think about it.

635
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:12,005
I'll be around.
