1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,854
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...

2
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:07,135
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,223
When you're burned, you've got nothing.
No cash, no credit, no job history.

4
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:14,770
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,227
- Where am I?
- Miami.

6
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:19,272
You do whatever work comes your way.

7
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:22,567
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.

8
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:25,528
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
- Should we shoot them?

9
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:28,406
An old friend who used to
inform on you to the FBI...

10
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:30,783
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

11
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:31,993
Family, too...

12
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:33,202
Is that your mom again?

13
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:34,287
If you're desperate.

14
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:35,413
Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:38,416
Bottom line...
Until you figure out who burned you,

16
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:42,003
you're not going anywhere.

17
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:53,856
<i>Spies make great neighbours.</i>

18
00:00:54,152 --> 00:00:55,967
<i>They're polite,
they keep the lawn trimmed,</i>

19
00:00:56,087 --> 00:00:57,768
<i>and they never crank
the music at night.</i>

20
00:00:57,888 --> 00:01:01,124
<i>They don't stand out because
they don't want to be found.</i>

21
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:03,364
<i>So if you're hunting
for a covert operative,</i>

22
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:06,771
<i>and all you've got to go on are
the names of a few dozen suspects,</i>

23
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:09,841
<i>you're out of luck
unless you know where to look.</i>

24
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:11,734
That's Bill Johnson's house.

25
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:13,702
Yeah, that gets funnier every time.

26
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:17,964
So, Mike, this is, what, the 10th Bill
we've looked at?

27
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:19,499
I need a break, man.

28
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,377
You made me buy you a beer
after Bill number 8.

29
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:25,434
So I'll buy you another round
if you do the honours.

30
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:26,381
Okay. Deal.

31
00:01:31,463 --> 00:01:34,542
Come on!
Okay, that's two rounds, Mike.

32
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:38,312
<i>The garbage
someone leaves on the curb</i>

33
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,312
<i>can often tell you more than
a face-to-face conversation.</i>

34
00:01:41,472 --> 00:01:43,597
- Not a lot of junk mail.
- Well, that fits.

35
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:46,151
I had a hard time tracking
this particular Bill down.

36
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,607
Keeps himself
out of the system pretty good.

37
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:50,677
And he buys
a lot of prunes.

38
00:01:51,038 --> 00:01:52,613
<i>Shredded documents in the trash</i>

39
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:55,492
<i>used to be a strong indicator
that someone had a secret.</i>

40
00:01:55,653 --> 00:02:00,203
<i>But nowadays, everybody and their mother
shreds bills to prevent identity theft.</i>

41
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:08,088
Okay. The guys lives with his mother.

42
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:09,799
I ruined my khakis for nothing?

43
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,176
I think we found Carla's sniper.

44
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:16,978
<i>Laundry bluing is a synthetic dye
that dry cleaners use by the thimble</i>

45
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:19,428
<i>and covert operatives
go through by the bottle.</i>

46
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:23,090
<i>It blots out secrets and works
like a poor man's dye pack,</i>

47
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,873
<i>staining anyone
who digs through your trash.</i>

48
00:02:25,993 --> 00:02:27,939
Wow, the guy's pretty paranoid.

49
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:29,805
They must be using him
for something big.

50
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:32,262
Figure out what, I may get
some leverage against Carla.

51
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:35,603
I need to know everything
there is to know about this Bill.

52
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,073
I'm on it, buddy.

53
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:54,260
Excuse me.

54
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,929
Back of the line, pal.

55
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:03,718
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you're dead.

56
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:06,738
Okay, you're wrong.
Just don't tell my ex-wife.

57
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,459
Aren't you gonna invite me inside?

58
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,740
Yeah, of course, yeah.
Just hold that for a sec.

59
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:21,674
Watch yourself
because of the...

60
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,558
Michael, you think I would hurt you?

61
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:26,828
That hurts me.

62
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:32,131
Now, I always pat down guys who just
show up who used to be dead.

63
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,366
Fine, fine. If you're
gonna frisk me, frisk me,

64
00:03:34,486 --> 00:03:37,095
though that sweep on my inner
right thigh was pretty half-assed.

65
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:40,139
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Well, I missed working with you, man.

66
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:43,810
Since I retired,
I've been working freelance stuff.

67
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:47,136
I've got more work than I can handle.
I just got a gig here in Miami.

68
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:49,232
I thought maybe
you might be interested.

69
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:50,775
You want me for a job?

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,100
Yes.

71
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:55,696
I want to pay you a lot of money
to kill a lady.

Still a yogurt man, I see.

76
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,560
Well, I guess some things
haven't changed.

77
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,070
- And some things have.
- Yeah.

78
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,269
I heard you got burned.

79
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:16,885
That's all, Larry? You just heard?
You sure about that?

80
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:18,232
What?

81
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:21,348
You think maybe I had
something to do with it?

82
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:23,613
I know you're angry, Mike,

83
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,435
but you got to know
who your friends are.

84
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:28,703
It wasn't old Lar who
used you up and spit you out.

85
00:04:28,823 --> 00:04:30,023
It was the government.

86
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:31,691
It's a little more complicated.

87
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,414
Oh, please. Come on.
You went off the reservation, kid...

88
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:38,421
unauthorized kills,
selling secrets.

89
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:42,131
I read the Michael Westen dossier
that's floating around out there.

90
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:44,203
You know what I thought?
I thought, "finally.

91
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:48,166
"Finally, he wakes up.
Finally, the kid gets it."

92
00:04:48,326 --> 00:04:51,818
They put us out there, they tell us
the end justifies the means,

93
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:54,088
and sooner or later,
you believe them.

94
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:57,756
"I'm a weapon, baby. I don't need
some government aiming me.

95
00:04:57,876 --> 00:05:00,147
"I put people down.
I put some cash in my pocket.

96
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,054
So what?"

97
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:04,047
I'm behind you on this, Michael.
Believe that.

98
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,183
Murder for hire...

99
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:07,164
civilians.

100
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:10,769
Don't pretend you're some kind
of boy scout, Michael. I know better.

101
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,106
I don't know about this thing.
It's a slippery slope.

102
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:16,360
Well, slippery slopes can be
kind of fun, like water slides.

103
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,989
Just hear me out, okay?

104
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:22,332
Jeannie Anderson...

105
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,002
she is our "dead-ee."

106
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,955
That's my term.
It's trademarked.

107
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:28,565
She looks dangerous.

108
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:30,833
Some people live,
some people die, kid.

109
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:34,837
Jeannie is a cancer nurse.
She married one of her rich patients.

110
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:37,043
He got better.
Then he got sick again.

111
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:41,073
Now he's in a coma.
But she is gonna die first.

112
00:05:41,193 --> 00:05:43,596
So, who doesn't want her
to have his money?

113
00:05:43,756 --> 00:05:46,097
I can't tell you that.
All my deals are anonymous.

114
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:48,182
Everything is e-mail.
There's no mess that way.

115
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:49,727
Yeah, except for the killing.

116
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:52,813
What... You need my help, Lar?
Is that it?

117
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:56,117
I don't need help killing someone.

118
00:05:56,237 --> 00:05:59,278
If I wanted this lady dead,
she would be dead.

119
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:03,151
Now, the whole idea here is
that you will do this one solo,

120
00:06:03,502 --> 00:06:06,119
and that way, you can re-establish
some kind of a trust with me.

121
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:10,123
And if everything works out, well,
maybe we can work together again...

122
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,609
Make some money.

123
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:15,733
Come on. It's not like
you couldn't use a little cash

124
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:18,965
to buy some of the luxuries in life
like, hey, furniture,

125
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:20,752
more protein.

126
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:24,472
This one pays 20 grand.

127
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:28,911
<i>Work long enough in covert ops,</i>

128
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:31,515
<i>and you're bound to be offered
some pretty nasty assignments.</i>

129
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:34,188
<i>When a bad job comes along,
you have two choices,</i>

130
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:35,805
<i>and neither is very appealing.</i>

131
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:38,294
<i>You can pass
and watch the op go down</i>

132
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:41,314
<i>or you can take the job
and make sure the op gets blown.</i>

133
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,684
Make it $30,000.

134
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:46,862
Deal.

135
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:50,186
Go get 'em, killer.

136
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:53,758
Oh, and, Michael,

137
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:56,588
I'm gonna tell you
what I tell all my clients.

138
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,959
Keep your nose clean.

139
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,529
If a cop comes
within a mile of this...

140
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,924
I kill everybody.

141
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:03,563
And you know me.

142
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:04,995
I mean...

143
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:06,388
everybody.

144
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,420
I want you to meet

145
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:34,535
my brilliant, adorable,
paramedic boyfriend, Campbell.

146
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:40,170
It's great to meet you, man.

147
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:42,548
Fiona tells me
you're a soil scientist.

148
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:45,343
Yes. Yes, I love my dirt.

149
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:48,137
I'm sorry I called so early.
If this is a bad time...

150
00:07:48,297 --> 00:07:49,747
You didn't wake us.

151
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:51,371
We were already up.

152
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:57,287
Would you mind
excusing us just for a minute?

153
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:59,146
I have to talk with Fiona
about something.

154
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,691
it's personal... a family thing.

155
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:03,449
Yeah. No problem, no problem.
I'll just go order us up some breakfast.

156
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:06,161
I don't know about you,
but I am starving.

157
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:10,131
I know you got to be starving, too.
you want some eggs? Over easy?

158
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,495
Oh, don't you just love him?

159
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:14,930
- I've been hired to kill a woman.
- You're changing subject.

160
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,124
Yes, but I'm serious.
I don't know who wants her dead.

161
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:18,960
I have to find out,
and I need your help.

162
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:26,855
Fine.

163
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:28,302
You owe me.

164
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,689
How do you know this guy
who hired you?

165
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,147
We worked together
in the Balkans... '91, '92.

166
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,540
It was a crazy time.

167
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,110
He seemed somewhat sane
in comparison.

168
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,861
And now he kills for a living.

169
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:47,971
Yeah, he made some poor choices
before his death.

170
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:53,391
15 people watched Larry walk into
an oil refinery right before it blew up.

171
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:55,663
Apparently, it was his way
of taking early retirement.

172
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,445
Okay, that's Jeannie.

173
00:08:57,565 --> 00:09:01,316
Larry says she splits her time
between the hospital and the museum.

174
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:03,143
They're having a charity event here.

175
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:06,436
Doesn't exactly sound like the kind
of woman anyone should want dead.

176
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:09,093
- Who's bankrolling this?
- Well, that's what we need to find out.

177
00:09:09,253 --> 00:09:12,813
Then we blackmail them, make them pay
Larry to walk away. Jeannie lives.

178
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:16,517
I need to speak with Jeannie alone,
preferably someplace quiet.

179
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,124
Well, I can put you
in the same room as her,

180
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:22,899
but I'm not telling her she's been
marked for death. That's your job.

181
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:24,162
Fair enough,

182
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:26,235
but then you keep
watch on her afterwards.

183
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,388
Are you trying to keep me
away from Campbell?

184
00:09:29,508 --> 00:09:30,208
Who?

185
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:35,043
What you're doing with this event,
it's extraordinary.

186
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:38,113
Oh, I don't know.
This charity stuff's new to me.

187
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:41,015
I spend so much time
at the hospital.

188
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:42,831
You need an outlet,
you know?

189
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,754
Would you give me
your e-mail?

190
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:46,727
I really want to
get involved.

191
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:49,467
Oh, absolutely.
We could...

192
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:52,345
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.

193
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:54,758
No, don't worry about it.

194
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,870
Excuse me just one second.

195
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,233
Jeannie?

196
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:13,544
Listen to me. I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not going to hurt you, okay?

197
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:16,306
I am a friend.
I am a friend, all right?

198
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:18,755
I can't have somebody coming in
here because you're screaming,

199
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,383
so I need you to keep quiet
and listen to me.

200
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:22,838
Do you understand?

201
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,878
I'm gonna take my hand
off your mouth, okay?

202
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:26,148
Don't scream.

203
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:29,101
Who are you?

204
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,479
I'm Michael.

205
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:33,539
I'm here because someone
was hired to kill you.

206
00:10:34,477 --> 00:10:35,177
Who?

207
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:37,113
Me.

208
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,475
Okay, okay, but I'm not going to.

209
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:40,809
All right?

210
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,069
I'm on your side.

211
00:10:43,464 --> 00:10:45,514
I don't do that, you understand?

212
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:48,192
I'm gonna take my hand
off your mouth again.

213
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:51,688
Who hired you?

214
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:54,657
I don't know.
They stayed anonymous.

215
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,827
I thought you might have some idea.

216
00:10:57,987 --> 00:11:00,037
Usually, with a job like this...

217
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:02,552
... there's not a lot of suspects.

218
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:07,651
- Who wants you dead?
- Oh, god. I don't know.

219
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:12,339
- Drew.
- Who's Drew?

220
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:15,504
He's my husband's son
from his first marriage.

221
00:11:15,756 --> 00:11:17,506
Oh, I can't believe this.

222
00:11:19,207 --> 00:11:22,601
He was very, very angry
when I got written into the will.

223
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:24,478
He thinks I'm some kind of gold digger.

224
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:25,715
Where is Drew now?

225
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:29,358
He might be at the house.
He moved in when Robert got sick.

226
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:32,653
What if I just give him the money?
I don't care.

227
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:36,014
No. You can't tell Drew that you know.
He might kill you himself.

228
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:38,617
But what happens when I go to the cops?
I have to go to the cops.

229
00:11:38,777 --> 00:11:40,953
No. You can't go to the cops, either.

230
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:44,457
The people who are involved in this,
if they find out, we'll all be dead.

231
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:45,413
Trust me.

232
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:47,383
What do you expect me to do?

233
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,504
Nothing.
I will handle this for you, okay?

234
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:52,548
Now, you met Fiona just now,

235
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:54,050
all right?

236
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:57,898
She is going to be an old friend
from out of town.

237
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,014
She will stay with you
for a couple of days.

238
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:02,624
She'll keep an eye on you
and on Drew.

239
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:06,986
You have to trust me.
It's gonna be all right.

240
00:12:16,815 --> 00:12:19,825
I got some leftovers.
I thought maybe... Hi, honey.

241
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:22,168
Oh, my god.
Michael, what happened to you?

242
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:24,800
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- No, you're not fine.

243
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,976
Look, I'm fine. I just fell down
at work, that's all.

244
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:28,918
This, see?

245
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:31,791
This is the thing
I cannot deal with, all right?

246
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,101
This wall that you put up.

247
00:12:34,843 --> 00:12:37,474
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to have an...

248
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:40,554
honest exchange with you
when you're withholding like this?

249
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:43,263
You reading a book
or something?

250
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:44,925
I'm seeing a counselor, Michael,

251
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,103
he's pretty sure you're the one
who has the problems.

252
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:49,762
So you're actually here, twisting my arm
until I go to counseling?

253
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:50,815
That's honest.

254
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:53,984
Besides, we tried counseling.
You quit, remember?

255
00:12:55,703 --> 00:12:57,154
Well, I want to try again.

256
00:12:57,533 --> 00:13:01,826
This new guy says the best place
to facilitate a dialogue is in the home.

257
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:04,328
I made an appointment
for tomorrow.

258
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,368
If you're not gonna do this
for me, Michael,

259
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:09,752
then I don't know what to say.

260
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:12,336
Fine.
I will be there.

261
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:15,214
Great, then.

262
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,058
1:00.

263
00:13:20,235 --> 00:13:21,385
Yeah, I know.

264
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:23,815
I'm late,
but I come bearing gifts.

265
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:26,350
That's the military jacket
on our favorite Bill Johnson.

266
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:29,937
Buddy of mine pulled it
in exchange for some Sam time.

267
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:32,898
Not all my buddies are guys.

268
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:34,775
Your methods, your business, Sam.

269
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:39,315
So, it looks like our buddy Bill
had a hell of a career in the Marines.

270
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:42,000
Big-deal sniper,
awful busy during Gulf 1,

271
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,660
and the fact that Carla put a Dragunov
in this guy's hands...

272
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,879
Probably wasn't a birthday present.

273
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:48,747
Looks like
he was dishonorably discharged.

274
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,959
Yeah, right. The guy was a model Marine.
He was in for 20 years.

275
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:53,633
I followed him for a little bit.

276
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:56,008
Sublets a room from the lady
with the little yappy dog.

277
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,888
- So that's his landlady, not his mom.
- We got to get a bug in there.

278
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:01,056
You want to go over there now
and take a crack at it?

279
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:03,304
Tomorrow.
Right now, I got to do a job...

280
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,848
- with Larry.
- Larry?

281
00:14:06,474 --> 00:14:07,349
Dead Larry?

282
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,019
Oh, man!
I hated that guy.

283
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:10,978
He's back.

284
00:14:11,905 --> 00:14:13,710
Okay. I hate him,
present tense.

285
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,317
He's a bad influence, Mike.
Don't tell me you're working with him.

286
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:18,427
No, I'm not working with him.

287
00:14:18,677 --> 00:14:20,153
I'm working against him.

288
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:21,834
Well, in that case, can I help?

289
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:23,319
You have a lovely home.

290
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:25,389
That's the problem, isn't it?

291
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:27,141
I mean, all this...

292
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:29,428
Whatever. I just wanted Robert.

293
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:32,666
He was the strongest patient I ever had.
That's what got me.

294
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,000
Then I had to watch it come back.

295
00:14:39,623 --> 00:14:41,773
I just want to be there for him...

296
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:43,386
to the end.

297
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:45,573
You will.

298
00:14:48,683 --> 00:14:50,947
How much longer
before Drew gets back?

299
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,944
20 minutes?

300
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:57,939
He runs a restaurant
that Robert bought him,

301
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,735
but he's not much of a worker, so

302
00:15:00,328 --> 00:15:03,890
he usually comes home early, showers,
and then goes out with friends.

303
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,032
Give me a heads-up if you hear him.

304
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:06,902
Okay.

305
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:15,482
This is disgusting.

306
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:18,125
Oh, come on, Fi.

307
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:21,046
It's one garbage can.
You're getting off easy. Trust me.

308
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,508
Here's something interesting.

309
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:25,135
Drew made made a copy
of Jeannie's datebook.

310
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:27,846
At least now we know
how Larry got his information.

311
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:29,456
Drew just pulled up!

312
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:31,141
That's my cue, gentlemen.

313
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:34,019
Michael, keep this line open.

314
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:37,439
You owe me a new cellphone.
I'm stashing this one.

315
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,277
- Drew, is that you?
- Yeah, whose Saab is that out front?

316
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,202
Oh, I have a girlfriend in
from out of town.

317
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:44,572
She's just sleeping up
in the guest room.

318
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:47,138
Hustle, Fi. If he catches you
and it gets back to Larry,

319
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:48,867
the body count on this will go way up.

320
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,580
Hey, hey, Roth.
Man, it's Drew.

321
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,112
No. I'm straight.
That last eight ball did me just fine.

322
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,686
I got a problem here.
Yeah, about that other thing.

323
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:29,123
I need you to make a few calls.
The hit can't go down here.

324
00:16:29,243 --> 00:16:31,118
Yeah, she's got some bitch
staying with her.

325
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:35,044
If they're planning on getting to her
here, you have to find another way.

326
00:16:35,164 --> 00:16:36,014
Thanks.

327
00:16:36,387 --> 00:16:38,914
I don't want to hurt your feelings,
but it sounds like

328
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:42,284
you're not the only person
Drew hired to kill Jeannie.

329
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:53,265
You hiding Sam Axe in here?

330
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,740
You told him.

331
00:16:57,758 --> 00:17:02,733
Been a while. Been a while.
And you look... great.

332
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:04,902
You, too, Larry.
Very youthful.

333
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:07,905
Still drinking
the blood of children?

334
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:12,065
Well, I'm glad you called, kid.

335
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:14,304
Got an e-mail from our client.

336
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:16,835
Seems Jeannie
has a houseguest.

337
00:17:16,955 --> 00:17:18,999
Yeah, we got bigger problems
than that, Larry.

338
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:21,293
It seems Drew has double-booked the job.

339
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:24,145
He put the word out
through his coke dealer.

340
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:26,489
No. No. No! Damn it!

341
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,463
I'm not gonna get angry.

342
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,265
I'm not gonna get angry.
Just cool down, all right?

343
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:37,601
I feel a cleansing rash
of heart attacks coming on.

344
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,187
Larry, there's no need
to poison anybody.

345
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:42,856
Yes, there is.
My name is in the mix.

346
00:17:43,183 --> 00:17:45,520
There's amateurs on this.
Gonna be cops all over it.

347
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,485
We need to start putting people
in the ground.

348
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:50,225
Drew, dead. Jeannie, dead.
The houseguest, dead.

349
00:17:50,345 --> 00:17:52,448
The coke dealer,
anyone you hired, et cetera.

350
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:54,034
That's a lot of bodies.

351
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:55,325
Oh, come on.

352
00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:57,394
Are you gonna stand there,

353
00:17:57,514 --> 00:18:00,833
you're gonna tell me that
you don't have the same impulse?

354
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,698
I know how you used to look at
people when they betrayed us,

355
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:07,089
when their stupidity
disappointed us.

356
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:09,591
Come on!
I know that look.

357
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:11,323
And you know how easy
this would be?

358
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:12,928
It's not
the smart play here.

359
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,140
I'll go to Drew.
I'll tell him to call off the job.

360
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:18,400
You know how convincing I can be.

361
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,019
The cops will never hear your name
if Jeannie lives, Larry.

362
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:24,638
Well,

363
00:18:25,032 --> 00:18:27,609
I guess the baby bird has got
to leave the nest sometime.

364
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,192
Your call, kid.

365
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:31,942
But...

366
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:35,964
if being a softy turns
around to bite you in the ass,

367
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,140
I will be here...

368
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:39,431
to say...

369
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:42,043
"Told you so."

370
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:49,423
That's our Larry.

371
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:53,382
<i>Covert operatives try to avoid</i>

372
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:56,221
<i>assuming other people's
identities whenever possible.</i>

373
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:58,514
<i>There's just too many pitfalls
when you're dealing</i>

374
00:18:58,634 --> 00:19:00,685
<i>with someone your new identity
has corresponded with.</i>

375
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,663
<i>What have they said?
What have they been told?</i>

376
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,520
<i>What have they agreed to?</i>

377
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:06,778
<i>Of course, it helps
if the person you're deceiving</i>

378
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:09,526
<i>is terrified of the person
you're pretending to be.</i>

379
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:11,857
Sorry to interrupt,
but I need to borrow this guy.

380
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:12,821
Who are you?

381
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:15,449
I'm Drew's friend. We met
on the internet. Facebook buddies.

382
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:18,826
Uh, yeah. Guys, just, uh...
Just give us a few minutes.

383
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:25,501
So, uh, so you're...

384
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:26,668
Larry Sizemore.

385
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:28,600
I thought we were never gonna meet.

386
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,881
You made it clear in your mails
we were never gonna meet.

387
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,675
I didn't want to, kid, believe that.
But you got sloppy.

388
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:37,567
Sloppy? No, no, no.
I followed all of your instructions.

389
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:38,805
No, you didn't.

390
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:42,881
You were one stupid,
careless son of a bitch.

391
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:45,270
- Wait. I don't understand.
- No kidding.

392
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:50,862
I thought we had a deal, Drew.

393
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,153
I would do the job,
and you would keep your nose clean.

394
00:19:53,313 --> 00:19:54,530
I was. I did.

395
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,534
I don't think you actually understand
what "Keep your nose clean" means.

396
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:00,244
Because if you did,

397
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:03,997
you wouldn't have told your coke dealer
to hire other people to do my job.

398
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:08,168
What's the rule, Drew?
No cops.

399
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:10,671
- I didn't think that Roth was gonna...
- What's that?

400
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:12,390
You didn't think what?
What?

401
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,134
You don't think Roth would ever
get arrested for selling cocaine?

402
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:18,474
What then, chucklehead?

403
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:21,723
He's gonna flip!

404
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:26,397
"I know a rich boy...
he wants his stepmom dead."

405
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:27,896
That's conspiracy.

406
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:31,233
- And then we're all in.
- What if we get rid of Roth?

407
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:33,235
No, if I'm killing anybody,
I'm killing you.

408
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,779
Some people live,
and some people die.

409
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,198
Which are you gonna be, Drew?

410
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:40,742
There's one way you live.
You call off this hit.

411
00:20:40,902 --> 00:20:43,287
- How many other people did you hire?
- Two.

412
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:45,252
You're going to make two

413
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:48,264
"I'm sorry, but I have to let you go"
phone calls right now.

414
00:20:48,384 --> 00:20:50,794
I can't. I don't have time.
I have to get ahold of Roth.

415
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:53,130
- Look, give me till 5:00.
- I'm coming back at 4:00.

416
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,629
And when I come back,

417
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:58,135
I want good news
or you're my next dead-ee.

418
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:07,068
And that's why I like to say
that trust is a bridge, and...

419
00:21:07,815 --> 00:21:09,771
it needs a strong foundation.

420
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:13,547
And you can't build a bridge
out of pain and fear, can you?

421
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:16,441
Can you, Michael?

422
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:18,521
No, because that would make it...

423
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,032
structurally unsound.

424
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,252
I'm detecting a lot
of negativity in this room.

425
00:21:25,372 --> 00:21:27,041
You see what
I'm dealing with here.

426
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,610
- Now, that's not helpful, either.
- Not helpful.

427
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,794
You both have to commit to this work.
You owe it to each other.

428
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:35,505
And I would like
to remind you of that. So...

429
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:39,301
there's something I want both of you
to do for our next session.

430
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,831
Are you giving us homework?

431
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:44,181
I prefer to call it "lifework."

432
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:46,975
In fact, that's the title
of the book I'm writing.

433
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:50,604
I would like each of you
to make a list...

434
00:21:51,453 --> 00:21:54,960
five things you're grateful
to the other person for.

435
00:21:57,755 --> 00:21:59,571
I think that's a great idea.

436
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:04,167
Mom, do you still have
dad's old gas-company jacket?

437
00:22:04,342 --> 00:22:06,591
Probably not. I threw away
most of his work stuff.

438
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:09,161
- What do you need it for?
- I just do.

439
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:11,857
Michael, you're supposed
to be honest with me.

440
00:22:11,977 --> 00:22:13,827
What happened to the bridge?

441
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:17,516
Fine. I need to get a shut-in
and her yappy dog out of her house.

442
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,186
I was gonna tell her
she had a gas leak.

443
00:22:21,877 --> 00:22:24,227
What about this exterminator uniform?

444
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:30,634
Tell her you're spraying her yard
with some toxic material,

445
00:22:30,754 --> 00:22:33,355
and now her poor little puppy
is gravely ill and has to go to the vet.

446
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,610
Yeah, you just send
the bill to that address there,

447
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,070
we'll pay for the visit.

448
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,990
- I don't understand how it could happen
- Yeah, neither do I.

449
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,112
It was a total accident,
but I had to own up.

450
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:46,702
Now, this stuff is toxic,

451
00:22:46,862 --> 00:22:50,442
this spill, and from what I hear
of pets, the little pads on the feet...

452
00:22:50,562 --> 00:22:53,487
it just sucks it up like a straw.
And you don't want

453
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:56,878
your little loved one here to be paws up
next to the water bowl, so...

454
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,450
- Paco?
- Yeah.

455
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,049
Maybe you want to also
have yourself checked out.

456
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:03,093
The vet will take good care
of both of you.

457
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:18,316
You're a wizard, Mikey.

458
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,860
I don't know where
you come up with this stuff.

459
00:23:57,766 --> 00:23:59,608
Look what our friend
was hiding in the wall.

460
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:04,404
I guess Carla talks to her sniper
the same way she talks to you.

461
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:08,033
She needs to freshen it up a little bit,
try the jumble for a change.

462
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:11,263
Hey, Lar, not a good time.
What do you need?

463
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,502
Just checking in.
How are things?

464
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:15,239
Things are good.

465
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:18,519
You don't need to be checking in.
It's under control.

466
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:20,545
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just listen.

467
00:24:20,705 --> 00:24:24,299
I want to repitch my idea,
and in case you don't remember,

468
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:27,094
the outline is,
"Let's kill everyone."

469
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:31,069
No need for that.
Not necessary.

470
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:32,925
I'm heading
over to Drew's now,

471
00:24:33,045 --> 00:24:35,400
and he's handing out
pink slips as we speak.

472
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,844
It's under control.

473
00:24:36,964 --> 00:24:39,463
I hope so, kid.
I really do.

474
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:42,400
Just checking in?

475
00:24:42,768 --> 00:24:44,818
He's got a weird thing for you.

476
00:24:45,636 --> 00:24:47,146
'cause he doesn't have any friends.

477
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,716
Because he's killed most of them, Mike.

478
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:57,811
<i>When a pro plans an ambush,</i>

479
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:00,331
<i>they capitalize
on the element of surprise.</i>

480
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:01,901
<i>They attack aggressively</i>

481
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:05,222
<i>so their opponent has to react
from a place of weakness.</i>

482
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:07,200
<i>An amateur, on the other hand,</i>

483
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,690
<i>is more likely to take
a defensive posture,</i>

484
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,931
<i>which means they are the one
acting from a place of weakness.</i>

485
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:24,067
Hey, buddy, what are you
doing back there?

486
00:25:24,227 --> 00:25:25,637
I'm... I'm sorry, man.

487
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,279
What are you doing with a gun?

488
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:29,866
You said that you were gonna kill me
if I didn't call off the hit.

489
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:33,445
- You didn't call off the hit?
- I tried. I tried to call off the hit.

490
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,070
but I got through to one guy,
and then I couldn't get through

491
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,550
and then the other guy...
But I know he's gonna be killing her.

492
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,042
- Today?
- Yeah, I think it's happening now.

493
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:43,673
Now? What do you mean right now?

494
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:45,714
I called this one guy about Jeannie.

495
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:48,227
He said it was gonna take him
two days to get it put together.

496
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,973
he told me he's gonna get a dump truck,

497
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:52,345
and he was gonna hit her
when she was coming home.

498
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:56,283
You're gonna call her right now.
you will call Jeannie, and you warn her!

499
00:25:56,403 --> 00:25:58,199
I already tried! It didn't go through!

500
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,022
The guy put in a cell jammer in her car
to block all of her calls.

501
00:26:02,182 --> 00:26:03,148
It's too late.

502
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:07,110
Okay, your name's not involved.
The cops aren't involved either.

503
00:26:07,537 --> 00:26:09,458
I promise it's just gonna look
like an accident.

504
00:26:09,578 --> 00:26:12,928
No cops? Who do you think investigates
fatal car crashes?

505
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:16,328
Please. Please.
You can't.

506
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:17,808
No, I could.

507
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:22,042
You know how easy
you're making this for me, Drew?

508
00:26:22,202 --> 00:26:26,171
Okay. I could run. Just let me run.
Please let me run.

509
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:28,715
Please. Please let me run.

510
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:30,108
Run.

511
00:26:36,665 --> 00:26:39,315
<i>Cellphone jammers emit radio waves</i>

512
00:26:39,435 --> 00:26:41,937
<i>at the same frequency
as commercial cellphones.</i>

513
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:44,237
<i>They're useful when
you really want to make sure</i>

514
00:26:44,357 --> 00:26:45,899
<i>someone stays out of touch.</i>

515
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:51,674
<i>The caller you are trying
to reach is unavailable.</i>

516
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,518
<i>It doesn't matter if you're trying
to take out a moped or a dump truck.</i>

517
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,566
<i>Every vehicle has three areas
of vulnerability...</i>

518
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:24,938
<i>the driver, the engine,
and the tires.</i>

519
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:28,228
<i>A can of paint across the windshield
could blind the driver.</i>

520
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:30,635
<i>A 50-millimeter cannon
could kill the engine.</i>

521
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:35,318
<i>But neither will guarantee the truck
won't swerve into oncoming traffic.</i>

522
00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:58,809
<i>But if you force a vehicle's
front tires off the road,</i>

523
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:01,391
<i>you drastically diminish
its maneuverability.</i>

524
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,185
<i>That way, it can't swerve.</i>

525
00:28:05,061 --> 00:28:08,231
<i>Of course, getting a dump
truck's tires off the ground</i>

526
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:10,567
<i>is even more difficult than it sounds</i>

527
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:12,736
<i>and a hell of a lot
more dangerous.</i>

528
00:28:32,207 --> 00:28:34,132
That's right!
Come here you son of a bitch!

529
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:54,247
I took care of it.
You're in the clear.

530
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,832
Drew is on the run,
and there aren't any homicide detectives

531
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:58,902
looking for a guy named Larry.

532
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:02,557
You know the last guy
who cost me a bunch of money

533
00:29:02,677 --> 00:29:04,968
didn't tell me about it
with a smile on his face.

534
00:29:05,088 --> 00:29:07,123
Lar, you're looking at it all wrong.

535
00:29:07,283 --> 00:29:09,933
I didn't cost you a bunch of money.
I saved you a lot of hassle.

536
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:12,544
This way, you're not gonna have
to kill four or five people.

537
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,424
- Four or five people... What's that?
- Well, that is something.

538
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,358
If you say so, Michael.

539
00:29:18,918 --> 00:29:21,570
But a dump truck. Wow.
I wish I'd seen that.

540
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,340
I mean, I got to tell you,
kid, I'm a fan.

541
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:26,770
Well, you were always
very supportive. Thanks.

542
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,574
Who knows? Maybe we'll get another
chance to work together again some day.

543
00:29:29,694 --> 00:29:30,944
Yeah, maybe not.

544
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:32,683
Could've been great.

545
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:36,038
I got to go. Got another gig.

546
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:37,904
Got to shuffle off to Buffalo.

547
00:29:39,364 --> 00:29:42,032
- See you around, kid.
- I'll see you, Larry.

548
00:29:49,844 --> 00:29:50,953
Listen to this, Mike.

549
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:52,709
Your sniper just made a call.

550
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,879
<i>Saturday. I'll be there at 1500.</i>

551
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,189
<i>When are you going to give me
the name of the target?</i>

552
00:29:58,378 --> 00:30:02,028
<i>And this is it, right... No more games?
I get my pension back?</i>

553
00:30:02,297 --> 00:30:03,802
This sounds like another play

554
00:30:03,922 --> 00:30:07,048
from Carla's "Do what we say
or we'll ruin your life" playbook.

555
00:30:07,168 --> 00:30:08,435
At least she's consistent.

556
00:30:08,734 --> 00:30:11,084
Sounds like Bill Johnson's got a date.

557
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,820
I guess I do, too.

558
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:20,376
Drew,

559
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:21,705
for your sake,

560
00:30:21,825 --> 00:30:24,155
I hope you're calling me
from someplace far.

561
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:27,326
Yeah, yeah. I'm really sorry, man.
I tried. I tried. I did.

562
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:30,330
I tried to go away. I swear.
But this guy showed up.

563
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,106
He just showed up and told me that
the job was on. I tried to tell him...

564
00:30:33,226 --> 00:30:35,116
Drew, slow down. Slow down.

565
00:30:35,815 --> 00:30:38,161
Okay. All right. This guy...

566
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:40,842
He knew I wanted Jeannie killed.

567
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:44,365
I tried to tell him the job was off.
He said it's still on.

568
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:47,575
- He told me I have to pay, otherwise...
- Guy? What guy?

569
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,229
He's tall.

570
00:30:49,497 --> 00:30:50,847
He's an older guy.

571
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:53,354
He said his name's Michael Westen.

572
00:30:57,451 --> 00:30:59,020
We're adding four more,

573
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,990
but there could be a possibility
of six or eight. I'm not really...

574
00:31:04,881 --> 00:31:06,331
Excuse me a moment.

575
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:08,466
But you said it was over.

576
00:31:08,586 --> 00:31:10,705
We had one slip through the cracks.

577
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,000
- Who?
- It's complicated.

578
00:31:15,244 --> 00:31:17,645
I have to admit
that it's pretty exhausting.

579
00:31:17,765 --> 00:31:20,048
I know, but at least we know
who's coming this time.

580
00:31:20,553 --> 00:31:22,938
You still have that charity lunch today.

581
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:25,684
You're gonna go to it.
Fi will explain what you have to do.

582
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:28,174
It'll be a little
out of your comfort zone,

583
00:31:28,294 --> 00:31:30,344
but we'll keep you safe,
okay?

584
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:31,392
Okay.

585
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:40,755
Hey, Mike, come on.

586
00:31:40,971 --> 00:31:42,372
You want to lock this?

587
00:31:42,492 --> 00:31:44,423
That sociopath is still out there.

588
00:31:44,543 --> 00:31:48,693
Larry won't come after me. He thinks
we're brothers in arms or something.

589
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:50,489
I don't know, man.

590
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,688
He used your name.
I think you pissed him off.

591
00:31:52,808 --> 00:31:55,142
No, that was just his way of saying,

592
00:31:55,262 --> 00:31:57,752
"Hands off my operation.
Sit this one out."

593
00:31:57,983 --> 00:32:00,380
Hey, you were right about how
Larry's coming after Jeannie.

594
00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:02,465
Drugstore across the street
from his hotel

595
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,284
had a little fire last night.

596
00:32:04,404 --> 00:32:07,095
Enough to mask him swiping
something nasty, I'm sure.

597
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,472
- He always did like his poisons.
- Yeah.

598
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:12,392
Any guesses on when or where
he's gonna make his next move?

599
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,199
Drew was told to have
his money ready by 1:00.

600
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:17,489
The poison plus the time...

601
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:19,993
Larry's going to Jeannie's lunch.

602
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:23,084
After she's dead,
Drew brings Larry the money,

603
00:32:23,204 --> 00:32:25,254
and that's
when you're gonna...

604
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:28,527
Look, you want me to do it?

605
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:29,347
No.

606
00:32:32,026 --> 00:32:33,276
It should be me.

607
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:37,750
- "No teeth were left to ident..."
- Yeah, yeah.

608
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,689
Michael Westen's a real dangerous man.

609
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:42,130
I don't need you to read me his file.
We go way back.

610
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,007
- So this is gonna work out?
- Oh, sure.

611
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:46,785
Just not for you, 'cause
when you pay him, you're dead.

612
00:32:46,905 --> 00:32:49,012
- Why would he kill me?
- You've seen his face.

613
00:32:49,396 --> 00:32:50,847
Wait. Well, then, I'll run.

614
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:52,015
You should run,

615
00:32:52,192 --> 00:32:55,518
but you should make damn sure Michael
Westen is dead before you do that.

616
00:32:55,901 --> 00:32:57,812
- How?
- By serving him up for me.

617
00:32:58,153 --> 00:33:00,732
You're paying him today, right?
I just need to know where.

618
00:33:02,052 --> 00:33:05,543
He said he was gonna direct me
to the hand-off once the job's done.

619
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:08,406
He said, "Just be in your car with
the money in the gables, ready to go."

620
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,856
He's doing it walking distance
from the hit.

621
00:33:10,976 --> 00:33:13,578
Oh, that is nice. Okay.
This is what we're gonna do.

622
00:33:13,738 --> 00:33:15,079
You will go where he says,

623
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:16,789
you will give him your cash,

624
00:33:16,949 --> 00:33:19,326
and you'll hit the deck
when the bullets start flying.

625
00:33:19,446 --> 00:33:22,410
Once Michael's dead, then you can run.
And Drew,...

626
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:25,965
if you ever come back, I will find you.

627
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,575
- I won't.
- Good.

628
00:33:28,414 --> 00:33:29,164
Good.

629
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:32,096
Because you've seen my face,
and I don't like you.

630
00:33:41,273 --> 00:33:44,359
Well, aside from a few
really hideous dresses,

631
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,819
there's not much to be
scared of in here yet.

632
00:33:47,088 --> 00:33:48,982
He's got to be around there
somewhere, Fi.

633
00:33:49,102 --> 00:33:50,323
He's tall, dyes his hair,

634
00:33:50,806 --> 00:33:51,908
<i>face like a ferret.</i>

635
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:56,579
Where did the man in black
come from?

636
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:59,670
- Wait a minute. You've got him?
- He's good.

637
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,958
He came out of nowhere.

638
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:02,921
Good-looking, too.

639
00:34:03,507 --> 00:34:05,298
Yeah, he's all right, I guess.

640
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,640
He's no Campbell, though.

641
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,634
<i>Who is? He's the only boyfriend I've
ever had who comes with his ambulance.</i>

642
00:34:16,028 --> 00:34:19,352
Larry just sprayed
Jeannie's fork with something.

643
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:22,021
Wait. That's probably atropine.
You might want to tell Jeannie

644
00:34:22,181 --> 00:34:24,431
<i>she's about to have a heart attack.</i>

645
00:34:26,352 --> 00:34:27,902
Lunchtime. Got to go.

646
00:34:28,771 --> 00:34:32,009
Don't be a hero here, all right?
You got a problem, you let me know.

647
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:32,879
Geez.

648
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,245
You a soil scientist, too?

649
00:34:37,648 --> 00:34:38,996
Oh, yeah. Big time.

650
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:03,923
Take a couple of bites.
Excuse yourself to the bathroom.

651
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:07,024
I'll follow and discover
your body and call 911.

652
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:10,401
Bon appétit.

653
00:35:31,189 --> 00:35:32,139
Excuse me.

654
00:35:35,755 --> 00:35:37,205
Oh, my god! Jeannie!

655
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:42,727
<i>Staging a fake death in
a believable emergency response</i>

656
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:44,479
<i>is almost impossible on a budget.</i>

657
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,732
<i>One lone ambulance
isn't going to sell it.</i>

658
00:35:50,688 --> 00:35:54,112
<i>So unless you happen to have
a fleet of fire-and-rescue vehicles,</i>

659
00:35:54,232 --> 00:35:56,361
<i>uniforms, and a dozen actors you trust,</i>

660
00:35:56,481 --> 00:35:58,772
<i>you really do have to call 911.</i>

661
00:36:00,178 --> 00:36:03,028
<i>You just have to have called
your people first.</i>

662
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:05,208
All right, Jeannie!
Hold on!

663
00:36:05,612 --> 00:36:07,409
How did you guys get here so fast?

664
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:08,879
We're losing her!

665
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:19,753
You were fantastic.

666
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:22,141
Why do you seem to be so relaxed?
Never again.

667
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,901
Hey, Jeannie, how you doing?

668
00:36:24,021 --> 00:36:25,770
- Well, I'm alive.
- That's good, right?

669
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:29,315
- Where to, Sam?
- Anywhere you want, buddy.

670
00:36:30,476 --> 00:36:31,326
Hang on.

671
00:36:38,202 --> 00:36:39,974
<i>All right. I'm pulling in.
I don't see you.</i>

672
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:42,144
That's the point, but I see you.

673
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,955
Now hang up,

674
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:45,745
get out of the car,

675
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:47,666
leave the money in the trunk,

676
00:36:48,688 --> 00:36:50,338
and make him come to it.

677
00:36:50,616 --> 00:36:54,173
<i>Spend a career in covert ops, and</i>
<i>you're going to know some bad people.</i>

678
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:57,635
<i>You'll work with them, live with them,
you might even trust your life to them.</i>

679
00:36:57,795 --> 00:37:00,304
<i>But none of that makes them
your friend. It can't.</i>

680
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:02,311
<i>Because one day,</i>

681
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,202
<i>you might have to end them.</i>

682
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,268
Over here, kid.

683
00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:08,729
Jesus, kid, put your hands down.

684
00:37:15,062 --> 00:37:16,362
How you want to do this?

685
00:37:16,522 --> 00:37:18,072
You give me the money.

686
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,365
Then I have the money.

687
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,665
- It's in the trunk.
- Good.

688
00:37:22,785 --> 00:37:23,578
Go get it.

689
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,123
And pick up the pace. I'm in a hurry.
I just killed a lady in there.

690
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:29,125
No, no, no, no, Drew.

691
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:31,407
Make him come out in the open.

692
00:37:36,156 --> 00:37:37,300
What are you doing?

693
00:37:37,682 --> 00:37:39,432
Don't you want the money?

694
00:37:41,018 --> 00:37:42,668
Who are you looking for?

695
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:45,391
Oh, you brought a friend.

696
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:57,153
Do you think he'll shoot you?
'Cause I would shoot you.

697
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:19,133
Yeah, Larry?

698
00:38:20,854 --> 00:38:24,004
Not bad for an old man, huh?
Two Andersons, one day.

699
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:32,521
Or was it just one?

700
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:35,231
You got what you wanted.
Leave it alone.

701
00:38:35,507 --> 00:38:38,693
She is alive.
That is beautiful, beautiful.

702
00:38:38,813 --> 00:38:42,563
You know, kid, that's really good work.
Really, really good work.

703
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:50,643
Time for you to shuffle off
to Buffalo, Lar.

704
00:38:50,907 --> 00:38:52,760
Shuffle off to Buffalo
and never come back.

705
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,709
<i>Nice, nice.</i>

706
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:56,251
Cops will be all after me, won't they?
I better get going.

707
00:38:56,371 --> 00:38:58,345
But I got just one thing to say.

708
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:00,615
You knew that kid was dead anyway.

709
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:02,635
Why didn't you take the shot?

710
00:39:04,153 --> 00:39:05,262
I didn't have it.

711
00:39:05,624 --> 00:39:07,740
No. That's not it.

712
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:09,952
Let's face it.

713
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:13,844
You couldn't bring yourself
to shoot your old friend.

714
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:16,591
<i>Hey, kid...</i>

715
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:18,864
some people live.

716
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:19,986
Some people die.

717
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:21,988
See you around.

718
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:30,623
And the last thing
I'm grateful for, mum,

719
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,470
is that you gave me
your great eyesight.

720
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:36,198
I can't tell you how many times
I've been working,

721
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:37,964
- and I just...
- Jesus, Michael.

722
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:38,934
Vision?

723
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:40,936
Are you serious?

724
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:43,175
You couldn't come up
with five real things?

725
00:39:43,658 --> 00:39:44,760
I did. I did.

726
00:39:45,026 --> 00:39:47,546
He doesn't even think I ever did
five things for him...

727
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:48,716
in his life.

728
00:39:49,531 --> 00:39:50,725
I was a terrible mother.

729
00:39:51,115 --> 00:39:52,329
No wonder you ran away.

730
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:54,303
- You ran away?
- No, I didn't.

731
00:39:54,423 --> 00:39:56,272
I joined the military when I was 17.

732
00:39:56,534 --> 00:39:59,150
My dad signed a form. He couldn't wait
to get me out of the house.

733
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:01,380
I signed the form.

734
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,154
I forged his name.

735
00:40:04,398 --> 00:40:06,866
He would never let you
go to the military, Michael.

736
00:40:07,221 --> 00:40:08,779
Why didn't you tell me?

737
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:11,212
Because I didn't want to
take away the one thing

738
00:40:11,332 --> 00:40:13,420
that you were grateful
to your father for.

739
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,541
I would have if I'd known
my list was so short.

740
00:40:15,944 --> 00:40:18,560
You forged dad's name?
Why?

741
00:40:18,773 --> 00:40:19,923
Because I knew

742
00:40:20,322 --> 00:40:22,339
if you didn't leave,
you'd end up in jail...

743
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,549
Or worse.

744
00:40:26,672 --> 00:40:29,322
There's always been
a part of you, Michael.

745
00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:32,547
Maybe it's from your father.
I don't know.

746
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:35,186
You could have turned out different.

747
00:40:36,544 --> 00:40:37,646
I let you go

748
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,983
because you needed
to focus on something good.

749
00:40:43,452 --> 00:40:45,362
This is what I've been talking about.

750
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:46,920
You've crossed the bridge.

751
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,658
- Oh, get out of my house!
- Get out of the house!

752
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,250
Mom...

753
00:40:55,992 --> 00:40:56,916
... thank you.

754
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,516
1500. This has got to be the place.

755
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:37,957
Wow, he looks grumpier than you do
when you're going to meet with Carla.

756
00:41:38,548 --> 00:41:40,667
Well, she hasn't had me kill anyone yet.

757
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:44,226
<i>Black-bag missions are often
broken into separate parts.</i>

758
00:41:44,346 --> 00:41:48,008
<i>Operatives are given discreet
tasks to ensure secrecy.</i>

759
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,844
Sam, the badge.

760
00:41:50,004 --> 00:41:51,512
<i>They're like jigsaw pieces,</i>

761
00:41:51,672 --> 00:41:54,005
<i>and you never know if any
of the ones you're given</i>

762
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:55,474
<i>are from the same puzzle.</i>

763
00:41:55,594 --> 00:41:57,601
<i>But if you can get
your hands on a corner piece,</i>

764
00:41:57,984 --> 00:42:00,812
<i>the part where the puzzle
starts to take shape...</i>

765
00:42:00,973 --> 00:42:04,012
<i>... sometimes you realize
all your pieces fit together.</i>

766
00:42:04,132 --> 00:42:06,234
It's the same one Carla had me forge.

767
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,571
Damn, Mike...
the badge, the rifle.

768
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,511
Carla's turned you into
this sniper's personal shopper.

769
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:16,281
Everything I've done has been
tactical support for one big op.

770
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:20,788
I think I know how to find out
what she's planning.
