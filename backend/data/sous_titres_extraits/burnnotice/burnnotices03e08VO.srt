1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,917
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,346
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,918
<i>We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.</i>

4
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:09,985
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,292
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,563 --> 00:00:14,938
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:16,306
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:19,207
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:22,647
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,607
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:28,485
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

12
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,863
You know spies, a bunch of bitchy
little girls.

13
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:33,282
- <i>Family, too</i>
- Is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,492
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:38,120
<i>Bottom line...
as long as you're burned,</i>

16
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:39,997
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:52,669
<i>When you prepare for a mission,
it's the little things that count.</i>

18
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:56,090
<i>Firepower is great, but an operation
is more likely to be saved</i>

19
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:58,482
<i>by a fresh set of batteries
than a gun.</i>

20
00:00:58,607 --> 00:00:59,725
Bring a camera.

21
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:02,853
- That's all about this gig?
- Strickler plays it close the vest.

22
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,773
- And you're going right along with it?
- I don't have much choice.

23
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,770
If I want my old job back,
he's the guy that can make it happen.

24
00:01:08,895 --> 00:01:11,343
The fact he's a weasel
doesn't give you pause?

25
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:13,781
Fi, right now
he's the only dance partner I have.

26
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:15,709
You know what I mean.

27
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:17,952
He's my ticket back in, Fi.

28
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,805
- Fiona Glenanne, always a pleasure.
- Pleasure's all yours.

29
00:01:39,547 --> 00:01:42,685
Okay, well, I'd love to stay and chat,
but Michael and I have work to do.

30
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,145
Ready to go, Michael?

31
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:50,111
Michael, I know how much
this job means to you...

32
00:01:50,883 --> 00:01:54,155
But if it doesn't feel right,
promise me you'll walk away.

33
00:01:55,335 --> 00:01:56,685
Fi, I have to go.

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,407
I sense you're not entirely comfortable
with this arrangement, Michael,

35
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:12,568
so I just wanna remind you
what's at stake.

36
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:14,633
You do this, and you have my word,

37
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,772
the powers that be will review
your burn notice.

38
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:17,897
Your word?

39
00:02:18,298 --> 00:02:20,851
Laugh if you like, but I wouldn't
be driving an Aston Martin

40
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:22,767
if I didn't know
how to keep a promise.

41
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,851
- You'll get your call from Washington.
- Tell me about the job.

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,356
That is a safe house
for an American intelligence agency,

43
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,510
and they use it to store weapons
for missions abroad.

44
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:35,696
Now, what if I told you I know
the exact moment it's left unguarded?

45
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:39,325
Don't worry.
I'm not asking you to steal them.

46
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,562
Somebody's already
taking care of that.

47
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:44,580
I got word that thieves were ripping off
a stash of military equipment.

48
00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:46,373
We should alert the owners.

49
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,741
We will, but timing is everything.

50
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,463
Now, I paid a hefty sum to learn
they're selling the stuff on Friday,

51
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:54,632
but nobody knows
the buyer or the location.

52
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,676
That's where you come in, superstar.

53
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,094
The crew has a cleaner.

54
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:01,138
Give this man a prize.

55
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:02,973
He's the key to tracking the sale.

56
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,977
I'm no ace operative, but a picture
of his license plate would be helpful.

57
00:03:07,518 --> 00:03:09,218
<i>Heists are like parties.</i>

58
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,276
<i>The worst part is cleaning up.</i>

59
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:14,045
<i>Someone has to stay behind
to get rid of all the evidence.</i>

60
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:20,366
<i>Of course, tidying up after a heist
often involves methods</i>

61
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,284
<i>not suitable for parties.</i>

62
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,460
Moment of truth.

63
00:03:45,473 --> 00:03:48,092
- You going somewhere?
- Going out with Ms. Reynolds.

64
00:03:48,217 --> 00:03:50,020
Got new underwear and everything.

65
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:52,524
Buddy of mine's gonna
loan me his villa.

66
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,725
Got a full bar,

67
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,767
hot tub with a 14-jet
water-massage system.

68
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:59,079
Nice. Any luck running
that license plate for me

69
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:00,538
with your cop buddies?

70
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:03,880
Yeah, but Mike, I mean, come on.
Are you really working with Strickler?

71
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:06,745
- The guy's a parasite.
- He can help clear my name.

72
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,663
I don't get to be choosy.

73
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:12,226
Anyway, look,
the car was rented with a stolen visa,

74
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:14,170
so that's no surprise, but get this.

75
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:17,406
Same card bought gas three times
in a neighborhood in Doral.

76
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:18,259
And?

77
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,352
The only place
that doesn't ask for ID

78
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:22,877
when you check in
is the Wages Motel.

79
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:25,532
I'll bet you a minty mojito
that's where he's hiding out.

80
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:26,557
Great work.

81
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,838
I need to get eyes on him
before he makes a move.

82
00:04:28,963 --> 00:04:30,464
Hold your horses there, cowboy.

83
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:32,813
The motel is across the street
from a bingo parlor.

84
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:35,253
You won't blend in
with the senior citizens,

85
00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:38,777
we gotta set up a rotating surveillance
in a storefront down the street.

86
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,197
Do me a favor.

87
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:44,072
That kind of wrecks the top of them.
Just a little fold is good.

88
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:45,675
Do you have a better idea?

89
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:49,703
Don't shut me down right away, Mike,
but I'm thinking this could work better

90
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:51,916
if we had someone
who could blend in with bingo.

91
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:55,986
Somebody we trust,
someone close to home.

92
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:57,588
You talking about my mom?

93
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,040
It's a watching job,
so there'll be other people around.

94
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:01,423
She should be fine.

95
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:03,092
I'll talk to her.

96
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:05,656
About that, I should mention...

97
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:08,641
She's been a little out of sorts
since the roof started leaking.

98
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,726
Leaking? How bad we talking?

99
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:11,760
Pretty bad.

100
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:15,064
For some crazy reason, she thinks it has
to do with the time I blew up the house.

101
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,995
Strictly need-to-know, Mike.

102
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:22,265
Anyway,
FI's in there helping clean up.

103
00:05:26,074 --> 00:05:27,469
Will there be any shooting?

104
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,308
No, mom, no shooting.

105
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:31,163
All you'll be doing is watching.

106
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,200
Damn it! See?

107
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,407
Every time it rains,
I'm telling you,

108
00:05:38,856 --> 00:05:40,422
this place turns into Noah's ark.

109
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,591
Mom, I'll fix the roof.
I need your help.

110
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:47,966
Fine.

111
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:50,357
It'll be good
to get out of the house.

112
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:52,671
I'll get my purse.

113
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:54,636
Really, Michael?

114
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,189
It's one thing to do this job
but involving your mom?

115
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,400
I'm adapting to the needs
of the operation.

116
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:07,807
Mike, you're there.
Thank god. It's Barry.

117
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:10,716
Look, you know all those favors
you owe me?

118
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:14,027
- I'm calling in all of them.
- I'm right in the middle of something.

119
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:18,156
I'm at the Carlito, and bring Fiona,
'cause this could get a little...

120
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,753
violent.

121
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:21,714
Yeah, I'll be right there.

122
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,222
- What's going on, Barry?
- Someone stole my ledger, Mike.

123
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:34,222
The list of my clients
and all the accounts where I...

124
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:36,401
protect their money.

125
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:38,897
So, it's like a little black book
for money launders?

126
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,828
Only instead of blondes named Chloe,

127
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:43,234
I got a bunch of angry rich guys
who will dismember me

128
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,701
when they find out it's gone.

129
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:46,820
You keep that all written down
in one place?

130
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,866
Yeah, I know.
It's part of my sales pitch.

131
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,909
You keep data on a computer,
it's like open season for hackers

132
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,225
and the IRS,
so I run things old-school, you know?

133
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,662
Anyway,
I got a phone call this morning.

134
00:06:56,787 --> 00:06:59,292
This new friend, he wants $5 million

135
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,463
by Thursday
or he's gonna sell the ledger!

136
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:06,133
And if somebody starts
blackmailing my clients, it's like...

137
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,656
Seriously?
You're gonna make me beg?

138
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:13,891
I need help, Mike.

139
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,059
I say beg.

140
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:18,348
We're not gonna make you beg.

141
00:07:22,472 --> 00:07:24,322
Any idea who's behind this?

142
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,321
I kept him in a private storage space
I took out under an alias.

143
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,315
Could someone
have followed you to it?

144
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:32,534
When I got there, I keep an eye
over both shoulders simultaneously.

145
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,329
Was anything else in your storage space
besides the ledger?

146
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,259
No, it was just the ledger,
some cash,

147
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:39,676
and a little paperwork
Amy asked me to hold on to.

148
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:42,836
Girlfriend.
We're going on three months now.

149
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,673
This scumbag stole her will
and the deed to her house.

150
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,995
She's gonna be pissed,
and when Amy gets pissed...

151
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,886
You ever hear of a trojan horse?

152
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:54,390
You put a tracker on a document,
you give it to someone to hide...

153
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,517
Follow the signal back to the place.

154
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,644
A tracker on a document?
They can do that?

155
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,106
Standard technique.

156
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:02,230
That's impossible.

157
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:04,509
Amy's in Atlanta
taking care of her aunt.

158
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,943
She was out of town the same week
that the ledger disappeared?

159
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:09,565
What, you don't think Amy...

160
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,490
Come on, she's my special lady.

161
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,658
Oh, man.

162
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:15,994
Don't worry, Barry.
We'll sort it out.

163
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:20,546
All right, we've got
some lucky people here today.

164
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:24,169
<i>Anyone trained in counter-surveillance
knows most field ops</i>

165
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,964
<i>are between 22,
when people finish training,</i>

166
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,216
<i>and 55, when they retire,</i>

167
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:32,677
<i>which is why even wary operatives
don't usually pay attention</i>

168
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,340
<i>to kids or anyone
on social security.</i>

169
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:37,024
How was that?

170
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:39,977
- Casual enough?
<i>- It's just fine, Maddy.</i>

171
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:43,697
<i>You're just playing bingo. Just think of
this as a normal afternoon.</i>

172
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:46,441
A normal afternoon,
I'd be in my aqua-aerobics class,

173
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,440
not being afraid
someone's gonna shoot at me.

174
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,280
No one's gonna get shot.
Just keep a low profile.

175
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:54,740
Now, if you see our guy,
don't stare, don't take pictures,

176
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,411
don't do anything.
Just call us, okay?

177
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:00,298
<i>Just remember, low profile, Maddy.</i>

178
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:01,498
I got it, Sam.

179
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:03,780
Under the "I",

180
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:04,626
26.

181
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:06,475
I-26.

182
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:07,785
Bingo!

183
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,173
We have a winner!

184
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,593
I still think we're wasting our time
going after Amy.

185
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,361
Her aunt Sandy has, like,
type-2 diabetes.

186
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,205
Stay calm, Barry.
Michael's just doing a perimeter check.

187
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,108
We have a Range Rover
parked out back,

188
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,910
music blaring inside the house.

189
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:25,387
Either aunt Sandy made a miracle
recovery or Amy never left town.

190
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:28,275
- I bought her that car.
- Love is a fragile thing.

191
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:31,369
Wait here. We'll be right back.

192
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,041
Fresh scratches.

193
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:39,575
Looks like someone beat us to it.

194
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:51,298
- You're trespassing.
- You must be Amy.

195
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:56,084
I don't know who you are,

196
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:58,680
but you've got five seconds
to get the hell off my property.

197
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:01,558
No need for drama.
We wanna have a conversation.

198
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:07,481
I warned her.

199
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:11,193
A ledger?

200
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,400
I don't know anything about it.
I could sue.

201
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:16,236
Amy, you think people running
a $5-million extortion scheme

202
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:18,533
are gonna let you walk away?
You're a loose end.

203
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,240
There's a trembler switch
under the driver's side of your car.

204
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:22,313
Not bad work.

205
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:25,582
Put any weight on it, it will blow up
like it's made of solid gasoline.

206
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,594
Somebody wants you dead, Amy.
You want to tell us what's going on?

207
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:31,838
A trembler switch? Right, whatever
you say. I'm calling the cops.

208
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,140
I think a demonstration is in order.

209
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,010
Wait a minute. That's my car!
What are you doing?

210
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,683
Oh, my god!

211
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,643
Trembler switch. Voilà.

212
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,855
But he was gonna pay me $100,000.

213
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,983
I like Barry, but 100k,
are you kidding me?

214
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,902
- Do you remember his name?
- I can't remember his name.

215
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:55,620
He was some kind of foreign.

216
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,031
- Where did you meet him?
- At a house in Coconut Grove.

217
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,300
Okay, that's all I know!
I swear to god!

218
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:02,120
It's time to leave town, Amy.

219
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:17,489
A window? I mean, shouldn't we
just pick the lock on the door,

220
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:18,844
like civilized people?

221
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,054
The back door is too exposed.

222
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:38,780
<i>Searching a pre-furnished house
is pretty straightforward.</i>

223
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,907
<i>Without a lot of furniture
or customized safes,</i>

224
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:43,535
<i>there aren't many
great hiding places.</i>

225
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:54,004
<i>So once you've checked
all the usual "slicks",</i>

226
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,775
<i>the spots pros would use,</i>

227
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,300
<i>you're stuck calling it a day
or ripping out the drywall.</i>

228
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:08,884
It's not here, Mike.

229
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,230
You've got company.
Get out of there, Michael.

230
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:13,608
Time to go?

231
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
We leave now,
they'll know we were here.

232
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:19,613
- Barry's ledger disappears forever.
- What exactly are you proposing, Mike?

233
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,973
We owe him, Sam.

234
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:26,995
Man and a woman.

235
00:12:27,473 --> 00:12:28,823
Get out of there.

236
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,708
Get out of there.

237
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,924
Welcome home.
We need to talk.

238
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:42,969
- Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
- Shut up!

239
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,235
That's no way to treat a lady.

240
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,266
- Tell us where the ledger is.
- You want to know where it is?

241
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,934
Fine. I'll tell you.

242
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:56,525
I was afraid something like that
was gonna happen.

243
00:12:58,197 --> 00:12:59,197
Hey, lady?

244
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Stop that.

245
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:03,225
Get some pillowcases.
We're gonna need head bags.

246
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,199
Head bags?

247
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,909
Oh, goody.

248
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:11,405
- So, you just kidnapped him?
- Not so loud, Barry.

249
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:13,333
We swept the house.
There's no ledger.

250
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,877
We're gonna have to ask
our new guests where to find it.

251
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,457
So break out the electrodes.

252
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:20,213
I heard you can attach them
to a car battery, spark it up, and...

253
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:23,051
Torture just gets you the fastest lie
to make the pain stop.

254
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:26,471
Mikey and me will interrogate them,
so don't worry your spiky little head.

255
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,431
- They'll talk.
- Can you do it quick?

256
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,587
I got clients coming,
and without the ledger,

257
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:32,727
I don't know where their money is.


258
00:13:33,026 --> 00:13:35,772
About that. You should avoid
your clients for a while.

259
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,899
I'm known for my customer service.

260
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,610
Don't you think it'll be
suspicious if I stop taking calls?

261
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:42,654
Dodge calls now or bullets later.

262
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:45,389
Fair enough.

263
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:47,325
All right, I'll be in touch.

264
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,661
I guess we better get at it.

265
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,680
Running out of time
before Ms. Reynolds and I blow town.

266
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:56,751
I don't wanna mess things up,
but this might take a while.

267
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:59,545
Plus, I need a big private space

268
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,465
to work two captives
at the same time.

269
00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:05,662
How many days do you and Ms. Reynolds
have that villa?

270
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:08,064
Mike, if there's one thing
you would never do to me,

271
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:10,152
it's ruin my love-capade
with Ms. Reynolds.

272
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:12,783
I mean, come on,
you cannot expect me to just...

273
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:18,718
You know, Mike...

274
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:21,447
Sometimes it's hard
being your friend.

275
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:22,907
Straight-up.

276
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:26,507
I gotta call Ms. Reynolds,

277
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,617
explain why she's not getting
her Sammy time.

278
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,488
She's not gonna like it.

279
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:32,459
I'm sure she'll get by.

280
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,876
<i>- Yeah, mom?</i>
- Michael, he's here.

281
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,504
Your cleaning friend.
He just parked his car.

282
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:42,547
- Calm down.
<i>- I know what I'm doing.</i>

283
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:45,801
If you want to know where he goes,
you better get over here.

284
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,480
Great work, mom.

285
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:49,221
Yeah, well, don't forget my roof.

286
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,630
I know, mom.

287
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,404
She found the cleaner.

288
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:57,425
I should probably help Sam
with the interrogations.

289
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,650
Could you...

290
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,194
Set up a tail on him, see
if he scouts a location for his deal.

291
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,401
Thanks, Fi.

292
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:09,475
The bar inside, Mike.

293
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:11,040
Nine different kinds of rum.

294
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:12,911
Now, Ms. Reynolds and rum?

295
00:15:13,036 --> 00:15:16,409
I'm sorry we're using your love nest
as a holding cell, Sam.

296
00:15:16,534 --> 00:15:19,084
Well, I just didn't expect
to be wearing pants here.

297
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:21,226
Look, I'm over it, all right?

298
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,633
I stuck the lady in a bedroom.

299
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:29,387
Big guy's cooling his heels
in a utility space under the house.

300
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,154
- It's kind of like a dungeon.
- Any idea who we're dealing with?

301
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,182
Neither one had ID.
He just had some money,

302
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:37,269
this key chain, and some smokes.
She had some kleenex...

303
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,895
And this.

304
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:42,607
Nothing like a personal memento
to find a soft spot,

305
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,913
so I'll take a run at her while you work
the big guy. 'cause, you know, Mike,

306
00:15:46,038 --> 00:15:48,345
- I got a way with the ladies.
- Yes, you do.

307
00:15:57,094 --> 00:15:58,344
That Marmaduke,

308
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:00,000
he'll never learn.

309
00:16:00,337 --> 00:16:01,937
Do you like Marmaduke?

310
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,686
I see.

311
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:05,361
The silent treatment.

312
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,712
You know,
it's a great anti-interrogation method,

313
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:10,341
as long as you can keep it up
for a couple of weeks.

314
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,309
What do you people want?

315
00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:19,488
She speaks.

316
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:22,564
Well, for starters,
you can tell me your name,

317
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:25,150
where you're hiding the ledger,
and we'll just go from there.

318
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,010
Natalie,

319
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:30,154
I'm a property manager,

320
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,908
and I don't know anything
about your ledger, okay?

321
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:36,411
- Tell me about your friend.
- He's a monster!

322
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,336
And you're just an innocent doe
in the woods, is that it?

323
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:41,161
You wouldn't understand.

324
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:43,934
I have a son,

325
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,546
and he needs me.
Please let me go.

326
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:49,715
Let me make
something very clear to you.

327
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,189
Until we get what we want from
your friend, you're not going anywhere.

328
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:55,264
If it takes a day or a month.

329
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:58,475
So, now that we're on the same page,
anything you want to add?

330
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,843
You're totally gonna kill me,
aren't you?

331
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:11,570
<i>Work in the field long enough,
you recognize hard targets</i>

332
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,281
<i>for interrogation.
People who shut down</i>

333
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,284
<i>at the first hint of confrontation.</i>

334
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,414
<i>Best way to get them talking?
Avoid confrontation</i>

335
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,080
<i>as long as possible.</i>

336
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,685
I want to apologize about earlier.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

337
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,214
Now, you and I,
we both want the same thing.

338
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,924
For all of this to just go away.

339
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,480
Are you one of Barry's clients?

340
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:35,858
Well, let's just say I work for a man,
a very private man,

341
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:38,431
who has kept some money off-book.

342
00:17:38,743 --> 00:17:41,059
Barry has been taken care of.

343
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,829
Regrettable, but necessary.
You understand, Mister?

344
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:45,897
Washington. George Washington.

345
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:49,727
Mr. Washington,

346
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,736
your friend is going to...

347
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,363
crack.

348
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:54,656
And when she does,

349
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,304
you will cease to be useful.
I don't wanna see that happen.

350
00:17:57,429 --> 00:17:59,077
I still think we can
have a friendship.

351
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:03,017
I've known this woman for three days.
She doesn't even know my name.

352
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:05,327
Ask her what you want.

353
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:08,837
You'd be surprised what I can do
with a little information.

354
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:11,423
I wanna make you
an offer of friendship.

355
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,842
You tell me where the ledger is,
and you go free.

356
00:18:14,235 --> 00:18:15,135
You don't...

357
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:20,014
- It's just a matter of time.
- If I tell you,

358
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,267
your boss will have me killed,
like Barry.

359
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:24,305
But I have an insurance policy.

360
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:26,729
If I don't show up for the sale,

361
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:29,024
a friend posts it on internet.

362
00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:32,208
A private man like your boss,

363
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:33,820
he won't like that.

364
00:18:34,174 --> 00:18:35,860
You have a gun to my head.

365
00:18:35,985 --> 00:18:37,485
I have one to yours.

366
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:40,994
- Who shoots first?
- I'll get back to you on that one.

367
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:49,620
- Everything all right in there?
- Yeah. Just super.

368
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:51,085
How'd it go with the boss?

369
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,706
He knows we're in the dark.

370
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,223
He's not gonna crack
unless we get more intel.

371
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:58,512
- What did you get out of her?
- I was reeling her in, and then bam!

372
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,837
Niagara falls.

373
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,070
She's got more to give,
but she's scared, Mike. Real scared.

374
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:04,315
Nice place.

375
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,740
Don't rub it in.

376
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,057
Well, I should get back in there.

377
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,096
Sure you don't think
you should lay off?

378
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:12,387
Well, she's a delicate flower,
but lucky for us,

379
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:14,012
I got a green thumb.

380
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:19,157
I tailed your cleaner to a park.

381
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,715
He scouted it for an hour.

382
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,828
If I know my arms deals, that's
where his deal's going down Friday.

383
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:25,856
Thank you, Fi.

384
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:28,375
Would you stop thanking me, please?

385
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,079
You have any idea who would pay
Strickler for this job?

386
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,826
I'm just taking a few pictures.

387
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:38,014
It's not like I'm doing
wet-work or something.

388
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,640
It's not like anyone got blackmailed
or killed from a few pictures, right?

389
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,685
Have you thought about who Strickler's
getting you into bed with?

390
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,851
All right.

391
00:19:46,976 --> 00:19:50,271
I'm pulling the rip cord here.
We need a whole new approach, Mike.

392
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:53,913
What would you think
about using a softer approach?

393
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,085
You're looking to me for "softer"?

394
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,241
You two are desperate.

395
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:06,579
<i>There's a reason fear often fails
as an interrogation technique.</i>

396
00:20:07,324 --> 00:20:10,224
<i>Most interrogation subjects
are already scared.</i>

397
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,376
<i>Scaring them more doesn't help.
What they need is a friend.</i>

398
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:17,048
I thought you might want some tea.
I'm Kim.

399
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:19,306
He's cute.

400
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:21,970
His name is Jared.

401
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:24,933
Look, I know you want
to get back to Jared.

402
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:28,116
We want you to get back to him,
but you're gonna have to talk to us.

403
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:31,104
I don't know anything.
I'm in real estate, for God's sake.

404
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:35,121
A lot of people are in real estate.
They aren't usually in your situation.

405
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:37,968
I know what it's like
to make some mistakes.

406
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,758
How'd you get yourself into this?

407
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:48,378
I'm a single mom,

408
00:20:48,503 --> 00:20:50,735
and times are tough.

409
00:20:51,475 --> 00:20:54,377
So sometimes I take
a little extra cash from people

410
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:57,171
and let them use
places off-the-books.

411
00:20:57,652 --> 00:21:01,050
You know, like foreign guys
who want a condo for their girlfriend.

412
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:03,890
Three days ago, he shows up.

413
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:05,915
He says that he heard of me,

414
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,255
that he'll hurt my son if I don't do

415
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:12,437
what he wanted.
He took my money and my passport,

416
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:15,841
and then
he made me drive him around.

417
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,189
Used me as his own personal
real-estate agent,

418
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:21,723
and...

419
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:24,397
For other things.

420
00:21:28,226 --> 00:21:29,476
Son of a bitch.

421
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:33,458
I'm sorry that it happened to you.

422
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,837
But isn't that all
the more reason to help us?

423
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:39,623
We can take him down together.

424
00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:43,538
I have to get to my sister's
'cause that's where...

425
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:45,053
I left my son, with her.

426
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,432
The people I'm working for
are not letting anyone go

427
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,140
unless they get what they want.

428
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,108
But I don't know anything!

429
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,963
Maybe you know more than you think.

430
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:55,239
Tell me about these properties
you showed him.

431
00:21:55,808 --> 00:21:58,365
I showed him tons.
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

432
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,318
Did he look at any place
more than once?

433
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:05,823
There was a condo.

434
00:22:06,665 --> 00:22:09,035
He said that he need something
near the airport.

435
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:24,692
A safe in a fireplace.

436
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,559
With its own ventilation system.

437
00:22:27,684 --> 00:22:29,013
Time to go shopping.

438
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,225
<i>Used in embassies to store secrets, </i>

439
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:36,742
<i>burn safes depend on an internal
ignition device to start a fire.</i>

440
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:40,086
<i>Pump in liquid CO2, and,
if you do it right,</i>

441
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:42,777
<i>you can turn that ignition device
into a popsicle.</i>

442
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,282
<i>Do it wrong,</i>

443
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,635
<i>you turn everything inside the safe
to a pile of ash.</i>

444
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,462
No ledger.

445
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:02,453
But...

446
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:06,508
Natalie Rice.

447
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,133
He had her passport,
just like she said.

448
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:11,180
Our mystery man,

449
00:23:11,812 --> 00:23:12,849
Milovan Dragas.

450
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:17,812
Who have we here?

451
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:20,629
Bennett Tash.

452
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,861
He must be very important
to have made Milovan's burn safe.

453
00:23:30,346 --> 00:23:32,216
How you doing?
Good to see you again.

454
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:33,391
I'm Finley,

455
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,539
and I'm told that you go
by the name George Washington.

456
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,642
I gotta tell you, love the name.

457
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:42,295
Rolls off the tongue
a lot easier than Milovan.

458
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:44,244
I want a cigarette.

459
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:45,511
Your life.

460
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,897
What were you before you became
a rich man's errand boy,

461
00:24:02,794 --> 00:24:04,484
- a cop?
- Let's focus on you.

462
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,492
So, by now, you probably figured out

463
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:09,197
that we found your safe house,
we cracked your burn safe.

464
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,602
So imagine what's gonna happen
when we get our hands

465
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:12,889
on Bennett Tash.

466
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:16,248
You know him? The fella who's gonna
post the ledger on the web?

467
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,151
Your "insurance policy"?

468
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,514
Good luck finding him
in the yellow pages.

469
00:24:21,864 --> 00:24:22,964
I was wrong.

470
00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:26,107
You are an ex-military.

471
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:27,293
Washed up,

472
00:24:27,418 --> 00:24:29,258
soft now, but I see it.

473
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,261
Okay, that's enough.
Now, my boss, he's a reasonable man.

474
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,138
He can make arrangements
to let you go.

475
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,641
You have to tell me where the ledger is
before it's too late.

476
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,351
What were you, a coast guard?

477
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:41,813
- Try Navy Seal, pal.
- Navy Seals, little girl.

478
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:43,645
Son of a bitch.

479
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:49,237
Pathetic! How stupid can you be?

480
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:58,053
Not stupid enough to put
a loaded gun in your hand.

481
00:24:58,956 --> 00:24:59,872
Have a seat.

482
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:01,666
Please.

483
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:10,638
We got the name of the mystery man.

484
00:25:10,763 --> 00:25:11,973
Milovan Dragas.

485
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,594
That's good, right?

486
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,097
Normally what we would do
is comb through his bio,

487
00:25:16,403 --> 00:25:19,725
create a psych profile, and try
and break him in interrogation, but...

488
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,728
The guy was Serbian intelligence.
He's an interrogation specialist.

489
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,564
What does that mean?
He's unbreakable?

490
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,650
For now,
Milovan knows he's in control

491
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,323
until we find Tash,
the third member of his team.

492
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:32,702
Can you do your thing,
see if Tash has a paper trail?

493
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:34,365
Whip up some Barry computer magic,

494
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:37,925
see if he rented an apartment,
ordered a subscription tocat fancy?

495
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,050
I'm on it.

496
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,754
Fi and I have to update Strickler
on the cleaner job.

497
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:43,666
You okay alone here for a while?

498
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:53,885
Cleaner scouted
that driveway on the water.

499
00:25:54,246 --> 00:25:56,849
My guess is they exchange
crates boat to truck.

500
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,391
It'll be hard doing surveillance
out here in the open.

501
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,662
You set up for your photo shoot here.
I'll be sunbathing over there in a hat.

502
00:26:03,787 --> 00:26:05,787
If there's any trouble,
I'll back you up.

503
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:08,316
Sorry to insist on a meet.

504
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,673
I'm not usually this hands-on,
but it's our maiden voyage.

505
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:12,790
I want it to be perfect.
How we doing?

506
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:15,156
There are a couple things
you could clear up for me.

507
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:16,567
I'm here to serve.

508
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:19,193
How did you know the exact time
the hardware would be stolen?

509
00:26:19,318 --> 00:26:21,383
Or that the thieves would sell it
to someone else?

510
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,664
That's need-to-know info
that you don't need to know.

511
00:26:23,914 --> 00:26:26,574
And to be honest, it's bad form
to ask for that kind of detail.

512
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:29,231
Like it's bad form
to sit back and take photos

513
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:31,088
while lowlifes
waltz away with this stuff.

514
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,364
Fi, please.

515
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:33,841
You don't have a problem?

516
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,470
I'm gonna go.

517
00:26:38,754 --> 00:26:40,754
You guys have much to discuss.

518
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:44,964
Gee, I hope she's not getting
cold feet for the operation

519
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:47,772
'cause I've already made promises
to important people on this job.

520
00:26:48,465 --> 00:26:49,565
I'll handle it.

521
00:26:51,851 --> 00:26:54,393
So, you found what you're looking for.
I can go now?

522
00:26:54,518 --> 00:26:56,739
No, not yet.
We need to find Bennett Tash.

523
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,357
You know who he is?

524
00:26:58,698 --> 00:27:01,994
Look, I just showed Milovan
a bunch of properties.

525
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:04,789
Kim, just tell me the truth.

526
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,497
You're not gonna let me see Jared again.
You're just...

527
00:27:07,622 --> 00:27:09,627
- You're stringing me along.
- Look at me.

528
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:12,003
You will see your son again.

529
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:15,341
But you have to work with me
to make that happen.

530
00:27:17,265 --> 00:27:18,594
This better be important.

531
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,350
That guy, Bennett Tash,
opened bank accounts in overtown.

532
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:24,160
My magic 8 ball says he's somewhere
in the neighborhood, but I don't know.

533
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:25,685
I'll check it out.

534
00:27:26,835 --> 00:27:29,230
Natalie, you ever take your boss
anywhere in overtown?

535
00:27:30,545 --> 00:27:32,045
You did, didn't you?

536
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:35,194
If we can get Bennett, we can crack
Milovan, and you can go free.

537
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,220
But if Milovan finds out
that I told you...

538
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:39,615
He controls you with fear.
You need to be brave, all right?

539
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,965
Tell Jared you'll be home soon.

540
00:27:50,145 --> 00:27:52,628
It's a storefront on Poe Street.

541
00:27:58,075 --> 00:27:59,875
Hi. It's me.
Jared there?

542
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:03,025
Hi, sweetie. It's mommy.

543
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:09,786
So, this is Bennett's place.
What's our approach?

544
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:11,897
Milovan keeps his business
compartmentalized.

545
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:13,769
Nobody knows each other.
Let's use that.

546
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:16,345
The old "we're all in this together"?
I like it.

547
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:24,201
Yeah, the boss sent us. All hell's
breaking loose. We got to talk now.

548
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,662
Boss got pinched. The whole
network's in trouble. Let us in.

549
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:30,937
- Come on in. Get off the street.
- Could be DEA, FBI.

550
00:28:31,305 --> 00:28:33,836
He was picked up yesterday.
We've been dark since.

551
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:37,997
Nobody's checked in with me, either.
I had a bad feeling, but this is bad.

552
00:28:41,035 --> 00:28:42,136
I need a drink.

553
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:45,264
<i>In any new situation
where you're going in cold,</i>

554
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,141
<i>you have to be alert
to warning signs.</i>

555
00:28:47,815 --> 00:28:50,715
<i>The sound of Mac-10's bolt action,
for example.</i>

556
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:56,859
<i>A Mac-10 can fire 50 rounds
in a few seconds,</i>

557
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,197
<i>but it's one of the least accurate guns
in the hands of an amateur.</i>

558
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,160
<i>Survive the first burst,
and you've got a decent chance.</i>

559
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:16,862
You know, you could use some time
at the gun range. Where's the ledger?

560
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,507
Look, I had instructions
to kill any visitor on sight.

561
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,176
Look, do me a favor, all right?
Just put a bullet in my head.

562
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:23,803
Stay on task.
Where's the ledger?

563
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,721
I don't know.
I just handle the buyer.

564
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,100
The deal's set for 5:00 this afternoon.
I'm just waiting on a call to see where.

565
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:32,867
Yeah, nice try. We know it's your job
to post it on the internet

566
00:29:32,992 --> 00:29:35,310
if you don't hear from your boss.
We know you have it.

567
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:38,000
You think that psycho would trust
anyone with the merchandise?

568
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:40,736
The only one who knows
where that ledger is is her.

569
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,238
- "Her"?
- "Her"?

570
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,366
No, I'm talking about the guy, Milovan.
He's a foreigner. He talks like this.

571
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:49,273
The Serbian dude? He's a fall guy!
She threatened his kids.

572
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:50,913
She's a killer.

573
00:29:52,765 --> 00:29:56,043
Tell her I'm dead. You hear me?
You gotta tell her that you killed me!

574
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:06,887
I'm gonna get something to eat.
You want something?

575
00:30:13,205 --> 00:30:14,305
Come on, Fi.

576
00:30:17,945 --> 00:30:21,545
Actually, I think that something
might calm me down a little.

577
00:30:21,965 --> 00:30:24,515
What kind of yogurt
did you say you had?

578
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:27,032
Blueberry, vanilla, peach...

579
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,825
Peach sounds good.

580
00:30:29,115 --> 00:30:30,619
Fi, call me back.

581
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,195
I know that I shouldn't ask this,

582
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,322
but do you think that
you could take the cuffs off?

583
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:43,924
Because I really have to go
to the bathroom.

584
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:47,975
Please. I've been holding it
for so long.

585
00:30:51,885 --> 00:30:52,933
All right.

586
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,947
- Barry, has Fiona called?
- No, what's up?

587
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,312
If you hear from her,
Natalie is the boss.

588
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:10,640
She stole the ledger.

589
00:31:10,765 --> 00:31:13,525
- Natalie, the realtor? What?
- Keep your phone on.

590
00:31:18,895 --> 00:31:21,445
They must have taken
the keys with them.

591
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:27,440
I'll get something to pick the lock.

592
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:30,820
Come on, Fi. Come on, Fi.
Fi, if you get this, call me back.

593
00:31:30,945 --> 00:31:34,558
- She's not picking up, Sam.
- That's bad, Mike. That's real bad.

594
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:41,148
Take a bathroom break, wash your face,
pull yourself together.

595
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:44,696
<i>Like good poker players,
spies know it's impossible</i>

596
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:47,488
<i>to hide the tells that come
with a bloodstream full of adrenaline.</i>

597
00:31:48,745 --> 00:31:52,243
<i>If showing fear or concern
jeopardizes a mission,</i>

598
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,537
<i>you replace it
with an emotion that won't.</i>

599
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,840
Kim, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

600
00:31:56,965 --> 00:31:59,291
You think this is a tea party?
Social hour's over!

601
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:02,795
Please, stop them!

602
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,088
Leave her alone!

603
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,339
Leave her alone!

604
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:09,275
Milovan was bluffing.
Tash didn't have the ledger.

605
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,971
He was just arranging a time
for the sale.

606
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:15,599
Poor bastard never even got the call
from Milovan to set the location.

607
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:19,105
- You...
- I'm sorry.

608
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,604
I'm sorry.

609
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,691
Listen.
She's the one selling the ledger.

610
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,250
We're going to let her go,
follow her,

611
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,487
and grab it when she tries
to make the sale.

612
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:30,625
I'm sorry.

613
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,331
What did you do with Tash?

614
00:32:39,573 --> 00:32:42,060
I gave him 12 stem roses
and a box of chocolates.

615
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:44,420
What do you think I did?
I put two in the back of his head.

616
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,750
Look, the boss wants to clean
this whole mess up, everybody included.

617
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:50,426
We're gonna move Milovan
to the bathroom. We'll do him there.

618
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:52,175
Better drainage.

619
00:32:52,915 --> 00:32:55,233
Tell her to take the Buick.
It's easy to tail.

620
00:32:57,255 --> 00:32:59,059
Do you think you can handle
your girlfriend?

621
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:03,272
I promised we'd let her go.
I gave her my word.

622
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,890
Well, that's sweet.

623
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:06,850
The faster you kill her,

624
00:33:06,975 --> 00:33:09,236
the less time she'll have
to be disappointed.

625
00:33:11,315 --> 00:33:13,365
You're a goddamn piece of work.

626
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,914
I'm gonna pull the tape off,
and you're gonna scream,

627
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,459
and you're gonna keep screaming
until we shoot.

628
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:25,670
Now, you make a noise
after we shoot,

629
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,417
we're gonna have to shoot you for real.
You understand?

630
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:30,405
Here we go.

631
00:33:31,575 --> 00:33:34,386
- No, no! No, please!
- Sorry about this, Milovan.

632
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,890
The time for begging has ended.

633
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:46,341
You see that? His leg's moving.
I think his leg's moving.

634
00:33:49,514 --> 00:33:51,195
Wait. No, no!
Kim! Please, please!

635
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,663
There's a red Buick in the driveway.

636
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,865
You take it.

637
00:33:57,345 --> 00:33:59,453
<i>Spies don't keep a lot of prisoners.</i>

638
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,748
<i>When you hold someone,
you only learn what they tell you.</i>

639
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:08,800
<i>Let them go and you can learn
what they do and where they go.</i>

640
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:11,111
- What's going on in there?
- Go! I'll take care of them.

641
00:34:11,236 --> 00:34:12,383
Kim, open this door!

642
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,259
- Thank you!
- Go see your son!

643
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:24,255
<i>Anybody with training
can detect a tail from a single car.</i>

644
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:27,105
We need new transportation.
Let's go.

645
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,942
<i>Pros watch for anyone
who makes the same turns</i>

646
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,696
<i>or runs too many yellow lights.
To beat a pro, then, you need a team.</i>

647
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:39,260
<i>It's best to start a tail
midway along your target's route,</i>

648
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:41,180
<i>when they're sure
no one's following.</i>

649
00:34:41,305 --> 00:34:44,493
<i>To do that, you need someone
down the road to give you a heads-up.</i>

650
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:47,960
- She just turned down Sherman Way.
- <i>Nice work, Barry.</i>

651
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:01,590
- Fi, you wanna go in for a closer look?
- <i>I'm on it.</i>

652
00:35:01,715 --> 00:35:03,320
<i>Once you have eyes on the target,</i>

653
00:35:03,445 --> 00:35:06,937
<i>it's just a matter of handing off
surveillance at regular intervals.</i>

654
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,331
Hey, Mikey! Ain't she grand?

655
00:35:16,835 --> 00:35:18,282
Turn it loose, Sam.

656
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:22,780
<i>Hang behind your target too long,</i>

657
00:35:22,905 --> 00:35:24,830
<i>and they'll wonder
why you're not passing.</i>

658
00:35:25,215 --> 00:35:28,584
<i>Best way to avoid their suspicion,
pass them.</i>

659
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:34,381
She's turning in
to South Pointe Park.

660
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,450
What is she waiting for?
It's been a half-hour.

661
00:35:47,575 --> 00:35:48,771
Fi, you see anything?

662
00:35:49,955 --> 00:35:52,608
Just some street vendors
and a few tourists with back hair.

663
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:56,320
Hold on a sec, Michael. That's
the third time I've seen the bike guy.

664
00:36:09,195 --> 00:36:11,919
The guy on the bike
just dropped something.

665
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,925
They just exchanged keys.

666
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,265
Fi, what's biker doing
behind the palm trees?

667
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:27,035
Beach lockers.

668
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,186
He's got the ledger.

669
00:36:32,385 --> 00:36:34,565
Fi, I'm going after the buyer.
Take Natalie.

670
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:36,860
My pleasure.

671
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:48,997
- Don't hurt me! I just...
- We don't care about you. We want this.

672
00:36:57,335 --> 00:36:58,485
Hello, again.

673
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,585
It's over, Natalie.

674
00:37:01,765 --> 00:37:04,471
You know what?
Natalie's just a name on a passport.

675
00:37:04,745 --> 00:37:06,845
Whatever your name is, you lose.

676
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,437
I always tell my buyers
to put two things in the trunk.

677
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:16,316
A duffel full of cash
and a gun full of bullets.

678
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:19,807
You were so sweet about Jared,

679
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:23,574
or whatever his name was, 'cause
that was just a picture in a key chain.

680
00:37:24,395 --> 00:37:26,118
Now, I know that you're not the type

681
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:29,405
to shoot into a crowd
of little kids,

682
00:37:30,265 --> 00:37:31,265
but I am.

683
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,192
You leaving without your cash?

684
00:37:34,317 --> 00:37:37,067
You take one step towards me,
I'll drop one.

685
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,797
You have my word.

686
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,215
See you around.

687
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:43,435
Count on it.

688
00:37:56,835 --> 00:37:58,637
The cops find a car
full of dirty cash,

689
00:37:58,762 --> 00:38:02,065
and the people who wanted my ledger
get shafted for $5 million?

690
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,190
It's beautiful.

691
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:06,390
Sam called immigration,
and Milovan's being deported.

692
00:38:06,515 --> 00:38:07,784
And Natalie vanished?

693
00:38:08,105 --> 00:38:10,412
Well, she's smart.
She won't be returning anytime soon.

694
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:14,374
This clears the tab
on all the debts you owe me.

695
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:16,715
- Thank you.
- You ducked a lot of phone calls.

696
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,922
- What are you gonna tell your clients?
- Your mom hooked me up with a story.

697
00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:23,168
I've been purifying in an ashram.

698
00:38:23,515 --> 00:38:25,719
No carbs, no e-mail, no phone.

699
00:38:26,395 --> 00:38:28,472
- Nice, mom.
- Thanks, Mrs. Westen.

700
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,477
And let me know how it works out
with my roof-repair guy.

701
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,825
- Bye, Barry.
- See ya.

702
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:42,194
How did that business
with the hotel cleaner turn out?

703
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:45,015
Fi and I are finishing that
tomorrow.

704
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:47,410
We couldn't have done it
without you, mom.

705
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:51,352
Well, maybe one day you'll tell me
what it was really about.

706
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,465
But no need to go into it tonight.

707
00:39:09,678 --> 00:39:11,598
I thought you were gonna go
as a sunbather.

708
00:39:12,315 --> 00:39:15,644
Michael, I know I said that
I would go along with you on this job,

709
00:39:16,403 --> 00:39:18,355
but I don't want you
to work with Strickler.

710
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:20,345
Not now,

711
00:39:21,145 --> 00:39:22,145
not ever.

712
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:23,819
I can't help you with this.

713
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,154
It's a two-person job. I need you.

714
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:30,125
I've seen the site.
You can handle yourself.

715
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:32,960
I'm not worried about that.
I'm worried about you.

716
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:36,581
Working with someone like Strickler,
it changes you little by little.

717
00:39:38,183 --> 00:39:40,043
He's the only one
who can get me back in.

718
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,515
What do you want me to do?

719
00:39:48,775 --> 00:39:50,625
You do what you have to do.

720
00:39:52,865 --> 00:39:54,015
I understand.

721
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:57,615
I just can't stay here in Miami,

722
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:58,995
and watch.

723
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:21,251
<i>There's no greater luxury in the field
than working with a friend you rely on.</i>

724
00:40:21,745 --> 00:40:24,254
<i>When you find someone
you can trust absolutely,</i>

725
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:26,631
<i>you want them
on every operation you do.</i>

726
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:40,385
<i>And nothing hurts worse
than losing a friend to bullets,</i>

727
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:42,915
<i>politics, or something personal.</i>

728
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:52,210
<i>But when you have
to work alone again,</i>

729
00:40:52,335 --> 00:40:55,369
<i>you lock those feelings away
and do the job at hand.</i>

730
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,060
<i>Because as every spy knows,</i>

731
00:41:05,185 --> 00:41:07,580
<i>there's plenty of time to think
about what you've lost</i>

732
00:41:07,705 --> 00:41:09,505
<i>after the mission is over.</i>

733
00:41:15,955 --> 00:41:17,920
Did you shoot these with a tripod?

734
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:19,476
I mean, look at that photo.

735
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,978
I should put you up for a job
with National Geographic.

736
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,410
What happened to those men who
drove away with the military equipment?

737
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:26,935
Gee, I don't know.

738
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:30,237
- I hope they're brought to justice.
- These photos, who are they for?

739
00:41:30,895 --> 00:41:33,281
You gonna get hung up
on all these details now, Westen?

740
00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:34,616
Come on.

741
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,748
It's for you.
Happy birthday.

742
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:53,125
Diego Garza,
your favorite intelligence contact.

743
00:41:53,325 --> 00:41:55,525
I just got a call from Washington.

744
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:58,210
There's been some movement
on your burn notice.

745
00:41:58,335 --> 00:42:01,184
- Any idea how that happened?
- Surprise to me.

746
00:42:02,305 --> 00:42:04,505
I'll be in touch to set a meeting.

747
00:42:06,935 --> 00:42:09,985
Is it me, or is someone on their way
back to the promised land?

748
00:42:10,735 --> 00:42:12,362
I get it. You need to digest.

749
00:42:12,675 --> 00:42:13,975
We'll talk soon.

750
00:42:14,355 --> 00:42:16,805
This is just the beginning,
superstar.
