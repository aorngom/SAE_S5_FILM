...and everything you love.

00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,467
Of course you will,
brennen.

870
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:01,667
She's your family.

[ vehicle door opens ]

872
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,368
You'll hear from me again,
michael.

873
00:38:16,433 --> 00:38:18,834
Yeah, you owe me
a christmas card.

877
00:38:39,968 --> 00:38:41,834
Hey, nate.

878
00:38:41,901 --> 00:38:44,367
How's the arm?

879
00:38:44,434 --> 00:38:47,334
Um, it's okay.
it's a little bit sore.

880
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:50,968
What'd you tell mom?

881
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:52,901
I told her i was attacked
by a mugger.

882
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,068
I didn't want her
to get scared.

883
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:59,133
You thinking about
sticking around for a while?

884
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,267
I don't know.

885
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:02,634
Feels a little weird
being back now.

886
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:06,068
You know, i thought i was here
to land this big deal, and...

887
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:07,400
And instead...

888
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,300
You were being used
by a sociopath to get to me?

889
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:11,801
Yeah.

890
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:16,434
You know, i really thought
i had something this time.

891
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,200
Nate, i know it's hard sometimes
being my brother.

892
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:21,500
It's okay, bro.

893
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,534
I'm getting used to it.

894
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:27,133
Michael.
i didn't hear you come in.

895
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,500
Here, honey, drink this.

896
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:29,834
Hey, mom.

897
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,734
I just came by to see
how nate was feeling,

898
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:33,200
You know,
after his mugging.

899
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:34,801
Yes.

900
00:39:34,867 --> 00:39:37,634
You know, michael,
it seems like --

901
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:40,500
I don't know,
such a big coincidence

902
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:45,300
That sam, fi, and barry
were all mysteriously busy

903
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:47,300
At the exact same time

904
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:49,200
That nate was being beaten up
by his mugger.

00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:50,334
[ chuckles ]

906
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,300
Well,
maybe it's because...

907
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:53,567
Michael, please.

908
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:56,300
I'd rather you not lie
right to my face.

909
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:58,634
I'm just glad
both of my boys are home.

910
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:00,334
And that
i got to know barry.

911
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,701
He's coming over later

912
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:04,233
With some new
eucalyptus-infused hair gel.

913
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,968
We're gonna have
a product party.

914
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:14,367
How's nate doing?

915
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:15,467
Healing.

916
00:40:15,534 --> 00:40:18,734
You know,
i'm starting to think...

917
00:40:18,801 --> 00:40:22,300
I screw up his life
better than he does.

918
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:23,968
Oh, don't be so hard
on yourself.

919
00:40:24,034 --> 00:40:26,100
He wouldn't be breathing
if it weren't for you.

920
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:27,734
I had a little help.

921
00:40:29,233 --> 00:40:30,200
Thanks, fi.

922
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:33,367
Hey.
he's family.

923
00:40:33,434 --> 00:40:34,801
[ knock on door ]

924
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,701
Expecting someone?

Paxson:
mr. westen.

926
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:42,834
May i have a word?

927
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:47,200
Detective, you look unhappy.
come on in.

928
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:49,701
Is your friend coming?

929
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:51,001
Oh, detective lopez?

930
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:52,467
No.
he's been suspended.

931
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,434
Ooh, has he been naughty?

932
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,267
He's been doing his job,
actually.

933
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:58,367
He grilled a mayor's aide
for three hours

934
00:40:58,434 --> 00:41:00,534
About some mysterious
bank account she opened

935
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:02,034
With a michael westen.

936
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,767
Turned out
to be a bank error,

937
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:05,634
But not before the mayor
got upset enough

938
00:41:05,701 --> 00:41:06,801
To have his badge yanked.

939
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:08,200
That's too bad.

940
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:10,001
I assume you were trying
to get to me.

941
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,434
You'll be glad to know

942
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,500
I didn't come by
to ask you questions this time.

943
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:15,601
I came by to say this --

944
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:19,767
You want to play rough,
i can give as good as i get.
