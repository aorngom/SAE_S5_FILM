1
00:00:00,396 --> 00:00:01,833
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,262
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

3
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,834
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

4
00:00:07,697 --> 00:00:09,901
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

5
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:12,208
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

6
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,854
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

7
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:16,222
- Where am I?
- Miami.

8
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:19,123
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

9
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,530
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

10
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,523
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

11
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:28,401
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,779
You know spies, a bunch of bitchy
little girls.

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,198
- <i>Family, too</i>
- Is that your mom again?

14
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,408
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

15
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,036
<i>Bottom line...
as long as you're burned,</i>

16
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:39,913
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

17
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:46,156
<i>In any operation,
whether it's sneaking into an embassy</i>

18
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:48,005
<i>or collecting debts for a bookie,</i>

19
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,834
<i>it's important to lay out a plan
before you go into action.</i>

20
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:52,365
<i>If you're going to disagree,</i>

21
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,262
<i>it's best to get it out of the way
before any shots are fired.</i>

22
00:00:56,145 --> 00:01:00,090
I'm gonna ask this guy one more time,
politely, for my client's money back.

23
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:03,180
- If he doesn't pay...
- We shove him into a trunk at gunpoint?

24
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:05,272
Do you have a better way
to make 5 grand?

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,880
The guy is a charmless sleazebag.

26
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:10,755
No one's getting hurt.
It's the perfect job.

27
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:14,845
The perfect job, Fi? Seriously?

28
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:16,966
We can use the cash, Michael.

29
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:19,495
We're setting up a nice business.
We ought to do it right.

30
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:21,706
I've got my eye
on a new ankle holster.

31
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,875
God knows the charger could use
some air-conditioning.

32
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,796
Actually, I was hoping to use my share
to get in touch with some old contacts.

33
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:31,300
Bribing people
to get your old job back.

34
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,009
Honestly, Michael,
I'd rather you spent it on drugs.

35
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:36,460
Why don't we compromise?

36
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:39,473
I'll buy you dinner tonight,
someplace nice.

37
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:41,465
Fine.

38
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:43,065
It's a date.

39
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,625
Give me exactly three minutes.

40
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:48,820
If I'm not out, come with this.
There's a breaching round for the door

41
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:51,170
and rock salt for the sleazebag
and his friends.

42
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:52,449
Wish me luck.

43
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:56,035
<i>For many operations,
two-man teams are ideal.</i>

44
00:01:56,455 --> 00:02:00,044
<i>Simple chain of command,
easy to delegate responsibility,</i>

45
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:01,640
<i>and little room for confusion.</i>

46
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:05,515
- Does Randall know you're coming?
- I want it to be a surprise.

47
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:14,840
<i>Of course, with a two-man team,
there's not a lot of margin for error.</i>

48
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:17,750
<i>All it takes is a cop
showing up at the wrong moment,</i>

49
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,734
<i>and the team ceases to exist.</i>

50
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:21,891
Detective Paxson, good to see you.

51
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,109
Mr. Westen.

52
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,855
You're a tough one to track down.
You have a moment?

53
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,482
Another time maybe.

54
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:33,270
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm asking politely one last time

55
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:35,279
for my client's 20 grand.

56
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,531
I told you, I ain't got it.
And I'm not paying.

57
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:40,743
Tell Scotty if he wants it
he can come here and get it himself.

58
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:44,622
You look preoccupied.

59
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,707
I'm picking up a friend
from a poker game.

60
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,377
She consumed an alcoholic beverage.
I volunteered to be her driver.

61
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,384
- You know, I should give her a call.
- Don't rush on my account.

62
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,221
I'm not going back empty-handed.

63
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,681
If I can't deliver the money,
then I'll deliver you.

64
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,975
You will?
You gonna carry me out yourself?

65
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:06,852
No. I'll have a little help.

66
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:12,066
Were you expecting someone?

67
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,880
She may have consumed
two alcoholic beverages.

68
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:43,260
Everything OK here?

69
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:44,685
Absolutely. Why?

70
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,018
Great party!
I'll see you later!

71
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,537
I'm sure you can explain all this,
but I've had enough of your explanations

72
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:55,276
so that's why I brought you
some babysitters.

73
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:57,903
A police tail. Lucky us.

74
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:01,118
We can make
your extracurricular activities

75
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:03,137
a lot more dangerous for you...

76
00:04:03,262 --> 00:04:04,470
and for your friends.

77
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:07,680
So, I answer your questions,
or you get us killed.

78
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:09,210
- Is that the idea?
- No.

79
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:12,735
You answer my questions
before you get yourselves killed.

80
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:18,007
Looks like we have a chaperone
on our date tonight.

81
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:29,476
I distinctly recall you saying
"some place nice".

82
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,090
We're at the Carlito.
We eat half of our meals here.

83
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:34,000
Have you forgotten what a date is?

84
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,901
I said that when I thought
we were gonna be 5 grand richer.

85
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:41,069
- Would you like anything else?
- Your most expensive desert, please.

86
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,325
So, Randall's off to party in Cancun
with my client's money.

87
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,827
Look at the bright side, Fi.
You weren't killed.

88
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,622
Please, if a loser like Randall
can kill me, then I deserve it.

89
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:52,875
Well, you two look
as good as I feel.

90
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:55,095
You invited him?

91
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:57,815
I need an invite to Carlito's now?

92
00:04:58,295 --> 00:04:59,695
I'm being audited.

93
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:01,425
Fun, fun, fun.

94
00:05:01,705 --> 00:05:03,719
Is that courtesy
of Detective Paxson?

95
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,860
No, it's been building up
for a while.

96
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:07,728
Something about deducting mojitos.

97
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,340
Speaking of Paxson,

98
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:11,920
Is this gonna be like
a 24-hour-a-day-type deal?

99
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,080
For now.
And with our lifestyle,

100
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:16,732
one of Paxson's surprise visits
could get someone killed.

101
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,505
Yeah, I know. I've been trying
to come up with something on her.

102
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,363
Problem is she's a good cop.
She's too clean to blackmail.

103
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,910
We got to come up
with a whole new angle here.

104
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:28,855
OK, wait a second.
Is this a date?

105
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,664
- Yes.
- No. This is officially not a date.

106
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,532
All righty.
Can you bring us another spoon?

107
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,893
You're not gonna eat
that cherry, are you?

108
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:45,141
<i>When you're being followed
by the police,</i>

109
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:47,990
<i>it's important to remember
that having cops around</i>

110
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,965
<i>is a problem for criminals.</i>

111
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,669
<i>But it's an even bigger problem
for a detective</i>

112
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:55,229
<i>trying to remain inconspicuous
on a stakeout.</i>

113
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,947
Waiting for a friend?

114
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:00,734
I'm on police business.
You need to get out of here now.

115
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,048
I'm police business.

116
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:04,613
Apparently, I'm important enough
to have a 24-hour tail.

117
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:09,827
- This is a bad time.
- Are you on a stakeout?

118
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:13,430
Are you waiting for someone?
Do you need help with your cover ID?

119
00:06:13,555 --> 00:06:17,251
I could be a fellow coffee lover,
a boyfriend, anything you need.

120
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,930
I'm working another case here,

121
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:21,955
a case I've spent eight months
trying to crack.

122
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:24,925
People are dying, Mr. Westen.

123
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,710
- I don't have time for these games.
- Neither do I.

124
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:29,135
I'm telling you,

125
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,723
we're on the same side.

126
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,100
I'll determine what side you're on.

127
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,602
You say we're on the same side?
Prove it to me.

128
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,646
You know, maybe
you do need some proof.

129
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:40,255
You're right. We should talk later.

130
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:45,937
Sam, I think I found a new angle.

131
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:50,066
I need you to find out a little more
about another case Paxson's working on.

132
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:57,915
Cookies.

133
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:01,427
After your birthday cake,
I decided I'd take up cooking.

134
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:03,643
It's supposed to be relaxing.
I'm not convinced.

135
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:05,111
Let me know how that goes.

136
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:07,926
Mom, if the cops out front ask,
tell them I've run to the store.

137
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,430
You know, Michael,

138
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,486
I'd appreciate it
if when you stopped by,

139
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:14,224
- it wasn't only to lose police tail.
- Mom, please.

140
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,410
- I'm supposed to meet Sam.
- Fine.

141
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:18,085
Pick me up some eggs.

142
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,189
And some cigarettes!

143
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,450
- Mikey, what's up with the new car?
- 300 bucks.

144
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:36,171
Statistically, it's the second-most
popular car in Miami.

145
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:37,915
It should make tailing me
challenging.

146
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,412
So, turns out there was
a harassment complaint

147
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:42,540
filed against Paxson a month ago.

148
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:44,755
So you're not the only guy
she's pursuing.

149
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,360
- And I thought I was special.
- Guy's name is Matheson.

150
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:49,985
Has got a habit of ripping off
drug dealers.

151
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:52,555
Left a trail of bodies across Miami.

152
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,058
The guy they're putting in the ground,
he was a neighbor at one of the heists.

153
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,781
- Caught in the crossfire.
- Does she have a case against him?

154
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:01,647
No. He covers his tracks like a pro.

155
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,033
Paxson took a bunch of swings at him
and missed,

156
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:05,700
so he filed the harassment suit.

157
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:08,946
DA made her back off, so he doesn't
even have to hide anymore.

158
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,864
Do we know where he's not hiding?

159
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:12,385
We do.

160
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:16,495
I think it's time Paxson got
a little help with her case.

161
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,082
We take Matheson down the right way,
she'll have no choice but to get off me.

162
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,751
- I don't think she wants our help.
- Well, she's getting it.

163
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:25,794
He deserves some jail time,
and she deserves a break.

164
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:30,634
Well, you enjoy your new wheels.
I got to get to my audit.

165
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,810
- You gonna be all right?
- I think so.

166
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:35,222
The IRS agent's name
is Stacey Conolly.

167
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:38,175
Time to deploy the Sam Axe arsenal.

168
00:08:44,835 --> 00:08:48,443
<i>In any sort of operation,
flirtation is always a tactical option.</i>

169
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:50,362
<i>Romance is a powerful force,</i>

170
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,782
<i>and under the right circumstances,
it can achieve your objective.</i>

171
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:56,625
<i>Of course, not every circumstance
is the right one.</i>

172
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,370
Good afternoon, Mr. Axe.

173
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,015
Stacey Conolly. IRS.

174
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:07,838
Now, this is a rather unfortunate place
for an audit meeting.

175
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,256
We've a lot of work,

176
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,967
and the calypso music
is a distraction we do not need.

177
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:13,605
Two cosmos.

178
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,431
I assume the pink beverages
are an attempt to get me drunk.

179
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:20,976
Well, it's not gonna work
because I do not drink, Mr. Axe.

180
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:22,735
- I audit.
- Right.

181
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:25,275
No, actually, these are...

182
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:26,648
These are for me.

183
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,870
I see.

184
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:29,359
Well, you'll need them.

185
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:33,010
I pulled your file. It's not pretty.
It's not pretty at all.

186
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:36,033
Now, this is to inform you that
your pension checks are being held.

187
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:40,059
They'll be released once we reconcile
every penny spent over the last 3 years.

188
00:09:40,184 --> 00:09:42,164
Now, I assume
you brought your records.

189
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:46,445
No, I just thought
we would get acquainted.

190
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:52,883
This is not a good start.
This is not a good start at all.

191
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:56,428
My office will contact you
with a new appointment.

192
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:00,599
Remember, Mr. Axe,

193
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,741
the IRS can't be charmed
with a fancy shirt,

194
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:04,680
smooth talk, and pink drinks.

195
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,147
The IRS demands the truth, OK?

196
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:08,774
Good day.

197
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:22,955
Michael, this Matheson creep
rips off drug dealers for a living.

198
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,490
This is the easiest way
to get Paxson off your back?

199
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:28,610
The easiest way to get her off my back
is to answer her questions.

200
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,903
This way, it doesn't involve me
going to jail.

201
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:35,313
<i>Finding a way
into a criminal organization</i>

202
00:10:35,438 --> 00:10:37,688
<i>is about observing social dynamics.</i>

203
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,640
<i>You start with the target.</i>

204
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,365
I'm like, "Good luck".

205
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:48,272
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm in the middle of a story.

206
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,650
Just leave my drink alone
until I'm done talking, OK?

207
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,753
He seems lovely.

208
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:56,064
Watch your step, kid.

209
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,880
<i>You're looking for just
the right person to approach.</i>

210
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:02,202
<i>People in the inner circle
are usually too tough to go after.</i>

211
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:06,305
<i>Anyone with real power
is bound to be cautious.</i>

212
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:10,750
<i>Drivers and bodyguards are easier,</i>

213
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,425
<i>but they usually
don't have real access.</i>

214
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:18,330
<i>You want someone with enough juice
to be hungry for more,</i>

215
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:20,554
<i>someone desperate to make a move.</i>

216
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:24,182
<i>In short, you're looking
for a frustrated middle manager.</i>

217
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,950
What did I say, Tommy?

218
00:11:27,015 --> 00:11:29,030
How many times I got to tell you?

219
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,604
No business talk here.

220
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,606
None.

221
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,152
See, that's your problem, Tommy.
You don't think.

222
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,029
- Sorry.
- All right. You're sorry.

223
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,697
Now get out of here.

224
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:48,373
- I think I found our guy.
- Good, 'cause we need to leave.

225
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:51,220
Hear those sirens?
Those are for us. Sam called.

226
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:54,796
Detective Paxson found my car on 6th.
She's gonna start searching the area.

227
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,049
If Mr. Personality here
sees you with Paxson...

228
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,917
It'll be almost as bad as Paxson
seeing us with him. Let's go.

229
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,395
Detective. Always a pleasure.

230
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,649
I see you left your police escort
back at your mother's house.

231
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:17,859
- I knew I forgot something.
- Let me be clear, Mr. Westen.

232
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,739
Every time you ditch your escort,
you dig yourself a deeper hole.

233
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,282
I'm taking you down.

234
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,300
It's just a matter of time.

235
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:34,770
Hold still, Mike.

236
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:38,570
<i>To the educated eye,
a prison tat tells a story.</i>

237
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:40,094
<i>Where you did time,</i>

238
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,950
<i>why you did time,
and who you did it with.</i>

239
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:45,764
<i>It's a little like
a job résumé for criminals.</i>

240
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:50,405
Leave you two alone for a minute...

241
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,855
I'm just giving Mike
his prison ink, Fi.

242
00:12:56,136 --> 00:12:57,740
I might have a second career here.

243
00:12:57,865 --> 00:13:00,960
Sam checked out that guy Tommy,
the one Matheson was smacking around.

244
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,447
Yeah, Tommy d'Antonio.

245
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:05,904
He's pretty small-time.
Some counterfeit concert tickets,

246
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:08,870
some B&E, did two years in Allendale
for armed robbery.

247
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,791
Now he's a fixture at the dog track when
he's not hanging around with Matheson.

248
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,001
You think he's gonna get us
onto Matheson's crew?

249
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,130
- He's the best we got.
- OK. There you go. That'll do it.

250
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,298
I should charge you for those.
That's art.

251
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,716
Beautiful, Sam.

252
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:27,520
I got to take the "over the roof
and down the rain gutter" exit.

253
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:30,308
- Mind keeping them busy for me?
- Sure thing, Mikey.

254
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:37,300
<i>Every kid who ever went
to a new school</i>

255
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:39,420

256
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:40,980
<i>Copy everyone else.</i>

257
00:13:41,105 --> 00:13:42,805
<i>Spies do the same thing.</i>

258
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:46,247
<i>Tailor their wardrobe, their movement,
and their behavior</i>

259
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:47,951
<i>to imitate their targets.</i>

260
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:51,369
<i>All the little things that say
"I'm your kind of guy".</i>

261
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:53,635
Freaking dogs.

262
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,121
Looks like you got my luck.

263
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:02,048
I should just throw my money
on the ground, save myself some time.

264
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,884
I got some good picks coming up.

265
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,502
You got some picks?
Yeah, I need them.

266
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,348
You're...
You're Tommy d'Antonio, right?

267
00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:13,395
- Who's asking?
- Hey.

268
00:14:13,715 --> 00:14:15,770
Name's Milo.
I got some friends.

269
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:18,725
They told me if I ever come down
to Miami, you're the guy to talk to.

270
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,600
I heard you like the dogs.

271
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:23,487
- These friends, they from Allendale?
- Yeah, bingo.

272
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,198
I did a nickel for grand theft.
Got out last year.

273
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,533
Oh, yeah?
I got out right before you went in.

274
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:32,037
So, those guys up there,
they talk about me a lot?

275
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,955
Are you kidding me? Yeah.

276
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,582
They all got respect for you.

277
00:14:36,062 --> 00:14:39,016
I thought, when I come down to Miami,
if I could just meet Tommy d'Antonio,

278
00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:41,610
- maybe I could learn things.
- What are you doing in Miami?

279
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:43,465
I'm trying to earn.
That's what I'm doing.

280
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,634
I brought my girl.
As soon as I get in Miami,

281
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,927
as soon as she's here,
I can't keep a buck in my pocket.

282
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,596
- You know women.
- Yeah, I know women.

283
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:53,892
- Hey, Mr. D'antonio, do you think...
- Hey. Call me Tommy.

284
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,585
- Really?
- Yeah.

285
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:58,200
All right. I just...

286
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:00,926
I'm just looking to be pointed
in the right direction, you know?

287
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:03,693
- I mean, I got my crew, you know?
- Yeah? You got a crew?

288
00:15:04,073 --> 00:15:05,735
- Yeah. It's a small crew.
- Me too

289
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,698
It's just me, my buddy, and my girl.
It's not big time like you.

290
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,230
We're tight,
but we don't make a lot. Thanks.

291
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:14,520
You know, we make a grand here,
2 grand there, but it adds up.

292
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:15,695
Yeah, sure.

293
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,930
So, listen, why don't you
bring them around tonight?

294
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:22,337
Maybe we could have a little dinner,
show you and your crew the ropes.

295
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:24,420
Mr. D'Antonio, that would...

296
00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:25,545
Tommy.

297
00:15:26,555 --> 00:15:29,855
- That would be incredible. You sure?
- Sure, I'm sure.

298
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,345
You like seafood?

299
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,960
That's another $383

300
00:15:37,085 --> 00:15:39,390
in deductions for "business drinks".

301
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:42,816
- Can I ask what business you're doing?
- I told you, it's classified.

302
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,930
The IRS does not allow
classified deductions, Mr. Axe.

303
00:15:46,055 --> 00:15:48,530
I'm disallowing this until
the operation is made public.

304
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:50,615
And then, there's...

305
00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:52,465
this.

306
00:15:52,988 --> 00:15:55,662
You wanted documentation of my trip
to the Middle East. That's it.

307
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,623
That's all I got. Got it off a guy
from the group we were targeting.

308
00:15:58,877 --> 00:16:00,709
- So, you stole it.
- I didn't steal it.

309
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,961
The guy... He was done with it.

310
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:05,735
- So, it was a gift.
- It's not a gift.

311
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:08,484
There was this thing, and then...

312
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,844
the gun didn't have
an owner anymore.

313
00:16:14,855 --> 00:16:18,602
I'm just gonna mark that down
as a windfall income.

314
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:21,395
OK, with those
disallowed deductions,

315
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,803
you have a tax deficiency of 17%.

316
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:25,172
Over 25%,

317
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:28,737
the statute of limitations on your audit
is extended another three years,

318
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,656
so we could be spending a lot of time
in your friend's sunroom.

319
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:35,619
- Fresh-baked chocolate-chip cookies?
- No. I'm allergic to chocolate.

320
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:37,954
And to wheat flour.
And to eggs.

321
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:40,105
I'll take one, Maddy. Thanks.

322
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:43,184
OK, so, for tomorrow,

323
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:47,106
I'm gonna need you to estimate the value
of meals, rent, and transportation

324
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:50,261
provided to you by your "lady friends",
as you call them,

325
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:53,364
over the last three years.
By financial quarter, please.

326
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:54,638
I'll let myself out.

327
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,875
Take care.

328
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,729
I have a headache in my eye.

329
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:05,023
- Another cookie?
- I'm good.

330
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:09,447
<i>For a spy, knowing how to follow</i>

331
00:17:09,572 --> 00:17:11,984
<i>is at least as important
as knowing how to lead.</i>

332
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,598
<i>Sensitive operations often depend on</i>

333
00:17:14,723 --> 00:17:17,889
<i>knowing how hard to laugh
at the boss's jokes.</i>

334
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:20,414
I got four more
where those came from.

335
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:25,023
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you about him?

336
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:26,940
He can hook us up, right?
Look at this.

337
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:30,335
Milo here couldn't get a table
this good at Burger King, huh?

338
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,440
Hey, you just got to know
how it works.

339
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:34,300
We should order, all right? OK?

340
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:37,972
It's on me, so whatever you like,
except the lobster.

341
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:40,975
Lobster? They look like bugs.

342
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:43,019
Come on, Brianna.
Show some respect.

343
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,813
Don't talk about bugs and stuff.

344
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,649
Milo, just some people are not
too comfortable in nice places.

345
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:48,942
Order what you like.

346
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,861
Milo says you're the guy to talk to
in Miami about looking for work.

347
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:55,045
It could be, if you know
how to use your head.

348
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:57,482
We hit a few car dealers up north.

349
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:59,536
I'd act like I was taking
a car for a test.

350
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,956
You know, I'd grab the keys. Brianna
would strut her stuff, keep them busy.

351
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,916
Chuck, he'd step in
if things got rough.

352
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,329
And the dealerships, they got wise,
so it was too hot.

353
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,796
Now we're dying down here.

354
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,240
See, that's your problem.
You don't think big.

355
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:14,870
Last month, I hit
a check-cashing place in Boca.

356
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:16,603
Walked away with 3 grand.

357
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,639
3,000 bucks.
Man, that's a hell of a score, huh?

358
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:23,910
And the one that got me pinched
was a credit union, basically a bank.

359
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:26,062
Nearly walked away with 40 large.

360
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,772
Now, that's the big leagues.

361
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,108
I don't mean to be out of line,

362
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,599
but I was thinking that maybe we could
come on to one of those jobs, you know,

363
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:36,239
- make some real money.
- We'll see what happens tonight.

364
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:38,742
We're gonna do a little job,
see how you do.

365
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:43,930
I just smoke one a day
since I got out of the joint.

366
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:45,270
It's called Willpower.

367
00:18:45,395 --> 00:18:47,453
- You want one?
- No. No, thanks.

368
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:50,423
- Where we headed?
- Dry cleaner's here. We're hitting it.

369
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:52,714
I got the whole score worked out,
like clockwork.

370
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,105
The register's got everything
from the weekend in it.

371
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,676
Only one guy working the counter.

372
00:18:56,865 --> 00:18:59,960
Big Chuck over here throws a few rocks
at the place, gets the guy to come out.

373
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:02,015
You mean like a distraction?

374
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:05,226
Exactly. Right.
Then the little lady runs over...

375
00:19:05,704 --> 00:19:08,104
Spray-paints the security camera
by the door.

376
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:12,050
- Red is my favorite color, Tommy.
- Good. That's good.

377
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:15,365
Then me and Milo run in,
grab the cash, and run out the back.

378
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,586
Like clockwork.

379
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:19,360
Wait, just so
I can be sure about this.

380
00:19:19,485 --> 00:19:22,000
She kills the camera
with the spray paint

381
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,996
or did you want her to cut
the cable on the roof?

382
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:28,815
You see?

383
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:33,338
He's learning.
She should cut the cable on the roof.

384
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:36,466
- You're the boss, Tommy.
- That's right. I am the boss.

385
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:39,803
Is that...
You gonna shoot somebody?

386
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:43,306
No, no. It's not loaded.
It's just to scare the guy in case...

387
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,434
You just point it at him like that.
That's how they do it now.

388
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,271
No, not that way. More like that.
There you go.

389
00:19:50,615 --> 00:19:51,715
That's good.

390
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:53,395
You ready?

391
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:56,015
Show me what you got.

392
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:09,582
Who's there?

393
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,804
Come on! I'm calling the cops!

394
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:27,185
It's stuck!

395
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,310
I'm calling the cops!
Get out of there! Come on!

396
00:20:30,435 --> 00:20:32,396
<i>The lock on a cash-register drawer</i>

397
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:34,610
<i>is designed to keep it
from pulling open.</i>

398
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,785
<i>Whack it hard enough the other way,
and it breaks.</i>

399
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:50,165
- Aren't we supposed to go out the back?
- Yeah, right.

400
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,160
Christ, there's a padlock
on the back door for...

401
00:20:56,285 --> 00:20:58,172
We're gonna get pinched over here.


402
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,133
You're saying unless
we break the lock.

403
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,635
Yeah. We got to break the lock.

404
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:15,315
<i>When a padlock's held onto a door frame
by three-inch wood screws,</i>

405
00:21:15,915 --> 00:21:19,919
<i>it's no match for a dry-cleaning rack
that can move 30,000 pounds of clothes.</i>

406
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:28,105
Not bad, kid.

407
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,126
I boosted a ride. You get the cash?

408
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,587
- Clockwork, like Tommy said.
- You did good.

409
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:50,619
Detective Paxson.

410
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:51,976
Mr. Westen.

411
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,729
- How's the investigation going?
- Pretty well, actually.

412
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:57,523
It's amazing what a crime lab
can do these days.

413
00:21:57,755 --> 00:22:00,020
They can trace wire,
solder, duct tape,

414
00:22:00,145 --> 00:22:02,570
and link it to various devices
found at crime scenes.

415
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:05,310
So, this is an "I'm onto you" visit.

416
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:06,783
- Great.
- There's more.

417
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:09,440
There was an incident
last night at 17th avenue.

418
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:12,540
A dry cleaner was robbed,
an Impala was stolen,

419
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,541
and the lead thief managed to keep
his face hidden the entire time.

420
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:19,045
- I thought of you.
- I am so glad that I am on your mind.

421
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:20,750
But can we cut to the chase?

422
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,799
- Are you arresting me?
- Not yet.

423
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,843
I'm just giving you a chance to explain 
before the lab work gets done.

424
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,220
Pass, but thanks.

425
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,222
Well, if you change your mind,

426
00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:32,450
you'll always have a couple officers
in the car behind you.

427
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:34,268
See you soon, Mr. Westen.

428
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:35,895
She's shotgunning it,

429
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,356
trying to tie me to anything
on her database.

430
00:22:38,575 --> 00:22:42,443
I'll bet she's asking for an electronic
surveillance warrant for this place.

431
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:46,462
- She's good. You got to give her that.
- Did you ditch the car from last night?

432
00:22:46,587 --> 00:22:49,325
It's in a boathouse on the river.
The cops won't find it for months.

433
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,090
So, after giving the dry cleaner back
all his money,

434
00:22:52,215 --> 00:22:55,748
- last night's heist cost us a grand.
- That's the least of our worries.

435
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,293
Mike, once that stuff comes back
from the crime lab, you are on the run.

436
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,753
We need to wrap this up.

437
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:02,797
We need to get to Matheson.

438
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,856
It's time for Tommy's crew
to run into some cash-flow problems.

439
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:07,625
Looking good.

440
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:17,290
<i>The sight of a fresh injury
has a primal effect on people.</i>

441
00:23:17,415 --> 00:23:18,833
<i>If you need to make a point,</i>

442
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,774
<i>sometimes, there's no substitute
for a good shiner.</i>

443
00:23:22,645 --> 00:23:23,710
<i>It's never fun,</i>

444
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,863
<i>but if that's what sells your story,
it's worth a little pain.</i>

445
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,631
All right. Good luck, buddy.

446
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,869
Hey, Milo.
What happened?

447
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:36,330
I'm all right, I'm all right.
Sorry, but, I got to leave town.

448
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,791
- What are you talking about?
- There's these guys up north.

449
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:41,586
I owe them some money,
and they found me, and...

450
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,963
anyway, the point is, I got to earn.

451
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,425
You've been great, but ripping off
dry cleaners is not gonna do it for us.

452
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,343
Listen, I know
we're just getting started

453
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,346
and you were a little nervous
last night, but you did real good, man.

454
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,110
Coming from you,
that means so much to me. But...

455
00:23:55,615 --> 00:23:57,852
I need a real score,
real soon, so...

456
00:23:58,665 --> 00:23:59,815
Listen to me.

457
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:03,015
You know the worst odds
I ever saw on a dog?

458
00:24:03,345 --> 00:24:04,375
200 to 1.

459
00:24:04,755 --> 00:24:07,840
He was so excited, raring to go.
I put a C-note down.

460
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,970
Figure if he wins, I got a new car.

461
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:11,095
He win?

462
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,270
Busted his leg out of the shoot.

463
00:24:13,395 --> 00:24:15,530
They were gonna put him down,
so I took him.

464
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,110
A perfectly good dog.

465
00:24:17,235 --> 00:24:18,535
Got a gimpy leg.

466
00:24:18,755 --> 00:24:21,042
He's not a new car,
but the point is,

467
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:23,961
you gotta wait for the door to open
before you can run.

468
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,550
Working with you has been like
a dream come true,

469
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:30,134
but unless I make some money, they're
gonna break my leg like that dog.

470
00:24:30,495 --> 00:24:31,495
I'm sorry.

471
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,355
Wait, Milo.
I might got something for you.

472
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,975
Meet me over at Jimmy's
with the guys later.

473
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,187
I want to introduce you
to an associate of mine. Rick Matheson.

474
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,857
- What? He work for you or something?
- No, no, we work together...

475
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:47,735
On the big jobs, of course.

476
00:24:48,327 --> 00:24:49,445
So you dress nice.

477
00:24:50,935 --> 00:24:52,435
Yeah, I'll be there.

478
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,279
Care to explain why you deducted

479
00:24:56,404 --> 00:24:59,705
a $452 his-and-hers spa weekend?

480
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:03,167
- I was conducting business.
- Business, as defined by tax law,

481
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:07,054
does not involve the application
of "cucumber lotion".

482
00:25:08,235 --> 00:25:09,285
Disallowed.

483
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:13,445
Your tax deficiency is nearing 25%,
Mr. Axe.

484
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,670
Now, one more suspect deduction,
and we're gonna...

485
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:19,100
We're gonna have to...

486
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:22,812
Wait a minute.

487
00:25:22,995 --> 00:25:24,021
I know you.

488
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,939
Your mom's Josie Conolly.

489
00:25:26,145 --> 00:25:28,045
I dated her back in the day.

490
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:29,630
We used to play catch.

491
00:25:29,755 --> 00:25:31,779
You were the little boy
with the girl name.

492
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,574
OK, there are a lot of men
named Stacey through history.

493
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:37,618
Stacey Andrews, male offensive tackle
for the Philadelphia Eagles.

494
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,227
Stacey Roest, male hockey player
for the Detroit Red Wings.

495
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,451
Tv's Stacy Keach was a wonderful male
actor. I think he's best known for...

496
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:46,000
You know what?
Let's just focus on business now.

497
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,880
Do you remember the one time
I bought you a pack of baseball cards?

498
00:25:49,544 --> 00:25:51,883
I've no idea
what you're referring to, Mr. Axe.

499
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:55,303
You have to remember. You had a bike.
It was a Schwinn. I got some tape.

500
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,055
OK, you must be recalling
some other child acquaintance.

501
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,434
We took the cards, put 'em in the spokes
of your wheel, when you rode around...

502
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,302
It sounded like a motorcycle.
You'd call me Evel Knievel.

503
00:26:08,945 --> 00:26:10,556
You acted like you liked me.

504
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:14,071
And then one day, you disappeared,
and you never came back.

505
00:26:15,955 --> 00:26:17,455
It wasn't like that.

506
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:19,410
I thought you were a good kid.

507
00:26:19,906 --> 00:26:22,050
When your ma broke things off,
I called a couple times,

508
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:24,590
tried to take you
to a game or something,

509
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:27,418
but she didn't want to have
anything to do with me.

510
00:26:28,065 --> 00:26:29,355
You know how it goes.

511
00:26:30,985 --> 00:26:33,549
I think I have everything I need
for my audit.

512
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,469
Stacey, wait a second.
Let's grab a beer and catch up.

513
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,387
Or no beer. We'll just...

514
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,315
- You dated Stacey's mother?
- Just for a bit.

515
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:47,254
Looks like it was long enough
to make an impression.

516
00:26:49,805 --> 00:26:50,855
I guess so.

517
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,201
<i>It's a challenge to place a bug
on someone's body without them noticing.</i>

518
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:03,791
<i>It helps if they always carry
something you can reproduce.</i>

519
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,566
<i>A phone, a watch,
or a pack of cigarettes.</i>

520
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:10,430
<i>Then it's just a matter
of planting it on them</i>

521
00:27:10,555 --> 00:27:12,776
<i>and hoping they keep ignoring
the surgeon general</i>

522
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:14,799
<i>until you get what you need.</i>

523
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:25,673
This is a dicey time to be doing this.
You're only wanted for questioning now,

524
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:28,428
- but it'll be a full-fledged hunt...
- Don't have a choice, Sam.

525
00:27:28,553 --> 00:27:31,023
Hope that Paxson's still keeping
her distance from Matheson.

526
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:32,725
Nice jacket.

527
00:27:32,925 --> 00:27:34,443
Very sharp. Real professional.

528
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,363
- How good does he look, Chuck?
- Yeah, not bad, yeah.

529
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:40,540
Listen, this...

530
00:27:40,665 --> 00:27:43,661
This guy Matheson is gonna
size you up for the real jobs.

531
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,880
We'll just watch you, Tommy.
We'll do what you do.

532
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:50,084
Good. Yeah, you do what I do. All right.
Just don't talk too much, OK?

533
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:51,785
We ready?

534
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:53,425
OK. Let's go.

535
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:59,640
<i>Building up an asset
is a little like raising a kid.</i>

536
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:00,890
They're good.

537
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:02,805
<i>You can give him
the tools to succeed,</i>

538
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:06,058
<i>but when the first day of school
rolls around,</i>

539
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,518
<i>they're on their own.</i>

540
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,895
Well, well. How about that?
Tommy's got a crew now.

541
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,230
How about that, huh?

542
00:28:11,795 --> 00:28:15,067
Let me introduce you.
This is Milo, Brianna, big Chuck.

543
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,111
They're from up north,
like I told you.

544
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,920
Milo did some time
up in Allendale, like me.

545
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:22,575
- You a tough guy, Milo?
- I'm tough enough.

546
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,160
I've been wanting to get you guys
together for a while.

547
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:27,400
We're getting real tight together,
and...

548
00:28:27,525 --> 00:28:29,553
I heard you were putting
a big job together.

549
00:28:29,678 --> 00:28:32,128
I thought maybe
we could get in on it.

550
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:35,830
- You want to talk louder, Tommy?
- What?

551
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:39,270
You want to talk louder, maybe so
a few more people I don't know can hear?

552
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:41,670
- No, I was just...
- You got to think.

553
00:28:41,795 --> 00:28:43,554
These people could be anybody.

554
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,367
They could be cops, right?
They could be feds, right?

555
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:48,960
- They're not cops. They're my crew.
- Shut up.

556
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:50,235
See this one?

557
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:52,063
This one's got a cop haircut.

558
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:54,115
Yeah, you.

559
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,469
- You wearing a wire, cop?
- A cop? Yeah, right.

560
00:28:57,594 --> 00:29:01,197
I thought you guys already searched us,
or did he just want to get in my pants?

561
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:04,475
Well, maybe I should frisk
this one again.

562
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:07,429
What do you say, sweetheart?
Do you need a good frisking?

563
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:08,965
Try me.

564
00:29:09,485 --> 00:29:10,664
They're not cops.

565
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,210
I hit the dry cleaner's
last night on 17th.

566
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,045
These guys did it with me.
It was like clockwork.

567
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,863
They're real pros, man.

568
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:21,634
All right.

569
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:24,678
You know what? If Tommy says
you're pros, I might have something.

570
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,265
Why don't we talk? Come on.

571
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,184
Milo, I'll catch you at the track.

572
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,231
You want a drink?
Let's get some drinks over here.

573
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,359
<i>You should have seen
these guys in action.</i>

574
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,904
Seriously, I think Tommy's gonna have
a heart attack before we get any info.

575
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:43,739
<i>They were terrific.</i>

576
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,825
Relax. I'm sold.
I'm taking you on a job.

577
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:46,951
I'm in?

578
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,120
- <i>You're moving up in the world.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

579
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:50,960
<i>I won't let you down.</i>

580
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,529
We're gonna hit that meth lab
in Little Dominica.

581
00:29:53,654 --> 00:29:56,585
And after we bust in, it's gonna take
a minute before the dealers show up.

582
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,684
<i>All right,
you're gonna drive the van.</i>

583
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:01,910
Your crew, they're gonna lock down
the front of the place,

584
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:03,259
handling security.

585
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:08,241
Those dealers, they have,
like, machine guns, right?

586
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:12,559
- There's got to be another way?
- Why don't you leave me the planning?

587
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:14,673
How long you been on me
to take you on a job?

588
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:16,689
- A while.
- You trying to back out?

589
00:30:16,872 --> 00:30:18,995
I'm good. I'm in. We're in.

590
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:21,277
I got to take my shot, right?

591
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:23,821
- I'm moving up.
- Yeah. You're moving up.

592
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,976
You need to get a van and a four-door.
Just get your crew, and we do this.

593
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:28,409
- <i>All right.</i>
- We're in.

594
00:30:32,585 --> 00:30:34,851
- How'd it go?
- It was good. He...

595
00:30:34,976 --> 00:30:36,610
He liked you.
He really liked you.

596
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:38,866
That's great.
So, what's the job? What's the job?

597
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:41,245
- About that...
- Tommy.

598
00:30:42,295 --> 00:30:45,531
There's no job, not this time.
I'm sorry, OK?

599
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:47,915
What is this?

600
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:51,575
You trying to cut us out?
I need this job.

601
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:53,142
You can't do that to us.

602
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,520
You don't tell me what I can do.
You don't understand.

603
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,148
This guy was gonna get you
killed just to make a few bucks.

604
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:01,400
That ain't gonna happen.
You guys are out.

605
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,493
Go back up north.
Get the hell out of town.

606
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:06,729
What are you talking about? 
We're a tight crew. We can do this.

607
00:31:06,854 --> 00:31:08,646
<i>Work in intelligence long enough,</i>

608
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:11,017
<i>and you get good
at predicting human behavior,</i>

609
00:31:11,142 --> 00:31:13,454
<i>but sometimes, people surprise you.</i>

610
00:31:13,835 --> 00:31:16,989
Listen, Milo, a while back,
I met this Matheson at the track,

611
00:31:17,114 --> 00:31:19,764
and he says I could do
some stuff for him.

612
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:22,710
Sell hot stereos
and stuff like that.

613
00:31:22,835 --> 00:31:24,350
I thought if I got a crew,

614
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:27,593
maybe I could, you know, move up
the ladder, but that ain't me.

615
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:28,761
It ain't me.

616
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:31,845
<i>And when they do,
you can surprise yourself.</i>

617
00:31:32,065 --> 00:31:34,265
Tommy, I gotta tell you something.

618
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:37,311
I wanted in on the heist because
I'm trying to take Matheson down.

619
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:39,245
So you lied to me?

620
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,482
- Not quite.
- What, you a cop or something?

621
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,276
- No, I'm not a cop. I'm a good guy.
- You're a good guy?

622
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,367
You were gonna show up
tomorrow without us.

623
00:31:46,492 --> 00:31:48,920
Matheson would have had you killed.
You know that, right?

624
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:50,658
Yeah, I know.

625
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:53,285
He's hurt a lot of people,
and he's gonna keep doing it.

626
00:31:54,015 --> 00:31:57,015
But we're gonna take him down.
We need your help.

627
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,255
I thought we'd just go to the cops.
You don't know Matheson like I do.

628
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:06,923
He'll kill us all. I'm serious.

629
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,577
So are we.
He's outmaneuvered the cops before.

630
00:32:09,702 --> 00:32:11,564
No, we need to get him
caught red-handed.

631
00:32:13,338 --> 00:32:14,722
Brianna's Fiona.

632
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,181
Can you get us that Impala
that we stole?

633
00:32:17,306 --> 00:32:18,285
Where I left it.

634
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,896
We're gonna need to time out
the police response to the meth lab.

635
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,244
There's a substation right near there.
I'm on it.

636
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,363
- What do I do here?
- You're the key to this, Tommy.

637
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:29,780
As far as Matheson knows, we're all
doing this job, just as he wants.

638
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,709
You need to find him
the van he needs,

639
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:34,660
you need to get us the location,
so we can do our prep work.

640
00:32:37,103 --> 00:32:38,248
I can handle that.

641
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,600
It's gonna be fine, Tommy.
Just like clockwork.

642
00:32:45,818 --> 00:32:47,604
Nothing like driving a hot car

643
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:50,009
with every cop searching for you.

644
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,733
They're not searching too hard.

645
00:32:51,858 --> 00:32:53,553
We can't have Paxson showing up now.

646
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,760
- You think Tommy's gonna hold up?
- We'll know soon enough.

647
00:33:00,335 --> 00:33:02,107
That lab's right around the corner.

648
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,421
Cooker's gonna go out for supplies.
That's gonna be our window.

649
00:33:06,546 --> 00:33:09,292
Me and my guys, we go in the front,
take out the alarm.

650
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,169
You three stay outside
the door like Tommy told you, OK?

651
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:14,441
- Tommy's the boss, right, Tommy?
- Right.

652
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,057
All you got to do is hold
off a couple of met heads

653
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:19,908
while we take the stuff
out the back.

654
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:21,707
Tommy's gonna drive around,
pick us up

655
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,529
and we meet later
to split the score.

656
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,256
There he is.

657
00:33:32,523 --> 00:33:34,253
Let's do it.
Look sharp, Tommy.

658
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:41,419
Anything goes wrong, the dealers
will be coming from there and there.

659
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:43,371
These guys gonna be armed or what?

660
00:33:43,496 --> 00:33:45,322
Nothing you can't handle, killer.

661
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,545
<i>Superglue's cheap,
quiet, and powerful.</i>

662
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,435
<i>Lay it on thick and force-dry it
with canned air,</i>

663
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,357
<i>and you can cut bonding time
to less than a minute.</i>

664
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:09,666
I am not in love
with this tactical position,

665
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:11,674
not even with Fi's prep work.

666
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:14,028
My prep work, as you call it,
could hold off an army.

667
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:15,238
I'm just saying.

668
00:34:15,363 --> 00:34:17,297
I love explosives
as much as the next guy.

669
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,811
We need to keep the guys from killing
each other until the cops get here.

670
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:22,393
By standing in between them?

671
00:34:26,294 --> 00:34:27,467
Why cook at home

672
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,323
when there's takeout?

673
00:34:39,982 --> 00:34:41,046
Hello, police?

674
00:34:41,171 --> 00:34:43,798
I'm at 17th and Palm,
in Little Dominica.

675
00:34:43,923 --> 00:34:45,874
I saw some guys
with automatic weapons.

676
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:12,484
OK, Tommy. Let's go.

677
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,160
The box...
Go! Come on!

678
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,647
What are you doing?
Move the van.

679
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:42,149
The front.

680
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,790
Come on!

681
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:45,955
Come on!

682
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:51,857
Boss, I'm not sure about the plan.

683
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:54,536
It's almost like you were trying
to get us killed.

684
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:57,282
Look, open the door.
Tommy screwed up. Something isn't right.

685
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,499
Actually,
I think it's you that screwed up.

686
00:35:59,788 --> 00:36:01,013
You screwed up bad.

687
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,454
- Here are the cops. Got to run.
- You're setting me up?

688
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:07,372
Not used to being
the guy in the trap.

689
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,930
What made you think
you could piss off every drug dealer

690
00:36:10,055 --> 00:36:11,923
and cop in town
and not get any payback?

691
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:15,422
Wait. That's your problem.
You don't think.

692
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:16,965
Son of a bitch!

693
00:36:17,252 --> 00:36:18,270
Let's go.

694
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:39,074
It's your lucky day, bitch.

695
00:36:39,725 --> 00:36:41,748
I should get myself
a lottery ticket.

696
00:36:42,725 --> 00:36:44,672
And you should get
yourself a lawyer.

697
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:50,224
Detective, found the other
getaway car on the street.

698
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:52,537
It's a silver'09 Impala LT.

699
00:36:52,662 --> 00:36:53,876
A silver Impala?

700
00:36:54,657 --> 00:36:56,093
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

701
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,215
You'll never believe
what we found in the trunk.

702
00:37:06,706 --> 00:37:08,213
Remember my 200-to-1 shot?

703
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:10,413
It's just him and me now.

704
00:37:10,787 --> 00:37:11,937
Time to go straight.

705
00:37:12,224 --> 00:37:14,711
If I ever see you
in a police computer again...

706
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:16,495
You don't have to worry about that.

707
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:19,508
My mom's back in Saint Louis.
I was thinking,

708
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,364
I might move there,

709
00:37:21,804 --> 00:37:24,244
- start a kennel or something.
- Sounds good.

710
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,380
Hey, thanks.

711
00:37:26,937 --> 00:37:29,023
The way you and your friends
had my back...

712
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:35,419
I think you guys are
gonna be okay without me.

713
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:49,287
I closed my biggest case today.

714
00:37:50,222 --> 00:37:51,257
Congratulations.

715
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:52,749
Thanks.

716
00:37:52,882 --> 00:37:53,907
The thing is,

717
00:37:54,032 --> 00:37:57,649
he was a master criminal, who managed
to get stuck in a locked meth lab

718
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,239
with C-4 in a getaway car
parked outside.

719
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:02,069
Tough break.

720
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,911
The funny thing is, is he's never
been tied to any cases with C-4.

721
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,118
And that C-4
that was found in his trunk,

722
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,240
it's the same used in seven explosions
in the Miami area.

723
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:12,749
Any thoughts?

724
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,076
It seems like you can close 
those cases,

725
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:17,702
or you can keep coming after me

726
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,714
and have the case
against Matheson unravel.

727
00:38:22,538 --> 00:38:25,385
So I get Matheson
and you get a free pass?

728
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,640
If I got a pass, which I'm not saying
that I did, it was anything but free.

729
00:38:32,036 --> 00:38:34,836
It's like I told you, Detective,
we're on the same side.

730
00:38:41,848 --> 00:38:44,048
Just remember where the line is,
Mr. Westen.

731
00:38:45,037 --> 00:38:46,490
I will be watching you.

732
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,165
I'd expect nothing less.

733
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:56,462
Thanks for your call, Sam.

734
00:38:56,863 --> 00:38:57,863
Man...

735
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,717
I was so mad at you.

736
00:38:59,842 --> 00:39:02,538
When your name came across my desk,
I thought, "this is it".

737
00:39:02,663 --> 00:39:04,463
"This is my chance to get you back".

738
00:39:04,714 --> 00:39:05,925
I'm glad you found me.

739
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,199
I am, too.

740
00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:11,389
How about another drink?

741
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,938
Coming right up.

742
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:16,979
- There you go.
- OK.

743
00:39:20,387 --> 00:39:21,825
Is there alcohol in this?

744
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,603
'cause it's masked by sort of a...

745
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:26,762
- peachy citrus flavor.
- It's a Fuzzy Navel.

746
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:29,391
It's not my kind of thing,
but we got to start you off easy,

747
00:39:29,516 --> 00:39:32,472
- work your way up to the good stuff.
- I got to tell you, you're like a...

748
00:39:32,597 --> 00:39:34,297
You're like a drinking genius.

749
00:39:34,753 --> 00:39:37,332
I've forgotten more about the subject
than you will ever know.

750
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,234
If I'm in a bar and I can't get
the bartender's attention 'cause

751
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:47,926
I need information about a drink,

752
00:39:48,462 --> 00:39:49,761
Would it be okay if I...

753
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,805
Would it be okay if I call you?

754
00:39:52,586 --> 00:39:53,891
Absolutely, Stacey.

755
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:55,338
Anytime.

756
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,519
Is this not the best audit ever?

757
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:02,815
I got rid of the rest of the C-4.

758
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,151
Such a waste.

759
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:06,597
Small price to pay for
getting the cops off our back.

760
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:08,412
I guess.

761
00:40:08,858 --> 00:40:10,407
Now that we're in the clear,

762
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:12,784
there's a few gigs
I've lined up for us.

763
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,410
Not the good time.

764
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:18,656
Paxson's backing off, but we still have
no idea who's coming after me next.

765
00:40:19,842 --> 00:40:21,168
I still need back in.

766
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:25,263
Michael, priorities change.

767
00:40:26,003 --> 00:40:27,091
People change.

768
00:40:27,621 --> 00:40:29,645
Tommy always thought
he'd be a criminal.

769
00:40:31,817 --> 00:40:32,971
Maybe you'll find...

770
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:36,732
You sure?

771
00:40:38,043 --> 00:40:38,893
I'm sure.

772
00:40:40,885 --> 00:40:42,811
I'm free of the people
who burned me.

773
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,071
I'm clear of the cops.

774
00:40:46,688 --> 00:40:48,652
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

775
00:40:49,005 --> 00:40:51,321
This is moment
I've been waiting for, too.

776
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:06,169
Let's just enjoy dinner.
