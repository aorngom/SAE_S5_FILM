1
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,071
Tickle tickle tickle!

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,169
Hey Bret, how come you
don't tickle me anymore?

3
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,839
- What?
- Huh?

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,508
Oh, I'm just joking.

5
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:19,245
Tickle tickle.

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:21,276
Actually, seriously though,
you guys are just

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,289
tickling each other and,

8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,518
you know, it might be nice to include
someone else as well.

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,755
Yeah. What are you
up to today, Jemaine?

10
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,127
Uh, I don't know.
Actually I'm really bored.

11
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,292
Come on, man, you got
to get out of here.

12
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,699
I'm trying to get
onto first base.

13
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,225
- I live here too.
- Yeah, but go into Dave's

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,238
and make some
cake or something.

15
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:43,003
- I don't like doing that.
- But I can't be tickling all night.

16
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,635
- I'm not even ticklish.
- Aren't you?

17
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,008
- No, I'm faking it.
- Really?

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,570
Yeah she's faking it
as well, I think.

19
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,515
Oh that's not fair.
I'm really ticklish.

20
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,551
- Jemaine?
- Oh, hi, Sally.

21
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,118
I thought it was you.

22
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,062
- You looking for something?
- Uh, no.

23
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,794
I mean, yes. Yes. Mm.

24
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,234
Uh, oh, there they...

25
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,760
there they go there.

26
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,501
Hey, I, uh, saw your
music video online.

27
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,806
"The year 2000,
the year 2000."

28
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,710
Well, that was you, right?

29
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,270
Affirmative.

30
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,783
- You were robots.
- We were just dressed up as robots.

31
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,409
Yeah, but you were robots.

32
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,976
Yeah, just, you know,
acting as robots...

33
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,114
No, yeah, no, I... I know
you weren't actually robots.

34
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,389
So, you got a boyfriend
at the moment?

35
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,764
Me? No. You?

36
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,201
Me? I don't
have a boyfriend.

37
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,330
Or a girlfriend.

38
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,567
No, not me.
You can't tame the J-Dog.

39
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,975
- The J-Dog's just...
- What's the J-Dog?

40
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,775
Uh, well, that's me,
I'm the J-Dog.

41
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,338
Where is that from?

42
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,111
Well, it's street language.

43
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,016
You know, you just take
the first letter of your name

44
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,644
and you put "Dog"
on the end of it

45
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,518
and all the other dogs
sort of respect you.

46
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,183
Okay.

47
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,953
I thought it was from
a kid's book or something.

48
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,954
No, the thing
about the J-Dog

49
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,486
is you can't put
a leash on the J-Dog.

50
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,192
What? You don't ever
want to settle down?

51
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,099
Me?

52
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,002
No. Uh, do you?

53
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,903
Oh yeah. I do.

54
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,965
I really do.

55
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,772
Oh.

56
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,732
# Ah, yeah #

57
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,501
# Girl, tonight
we're gonna make love #

58
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,065
# You know how I know?
Because it's Wednesday #

59
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,976
# And Wednesday night is the night
that we usually make love #

60
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,913
# Tuesday night is the night that we
usually go to your mother's place #

61
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,782
# And I teach her how to
use the video machine again #

62
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,342
# But Wednesday night #

63
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,354
# Is the night that
we're making love #

64
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,379
# It's when everything
is just right #

65
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:48,326
# You're not too tired from your
afterwork social netball team practice #

66
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,023
# There's nothing good on TV #

67
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,157
# Mm, conditions
are perfect #

68
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,826
# For making love #

69
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,858
# You turn to me and say
something sexy like #

70
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,236
# "I might go to bed,
I have to work in the morning" #

71
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,138
# I know what you're
trying to say, baby #

72
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,268
# You're trying
to say "Ah, yeah #

73
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,369
# It's business time" #

74
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,778
# It's business #

75
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,479
# It's business time #

76
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,009
# I know what you're
trying to say #

77
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,453
# You're trying to say
it's time for business #

78
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,480
# It's business time, ooh #

79
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,856
# It's business #

80
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,418
# It's business time #

81
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,398
# Oh oh oh, yeah #

82
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,297
# Yeah, ooh #

83
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,030
# The next thing you know we're
in the bathroom brushing our teeth #

84
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,265
# That's all part of it,
that's foreplay #

85
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,365
# Foreplay is very important #

86
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,239
# In lovemaking #

87
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,412
# Then you go
sort out the recycling #

88
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,346
# Which isn't
part of the foreplay #

89
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,350
# But it's still
very important #

90
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,089
# The next thing you know
we're in the bedroom #

91
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,921
# You're wearing that same
old ugly baggy T-shirt #

92
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,586
# With the stain on it
that you got #

93
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,151
# From that
team-building exercise #

94
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,288
# You did for your
old work several years ago #

95
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,562
# Team Building Exercise '99 #

96
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,671
# I take off my clothes,
but I trip over my jeans #

97
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,298
# Because I'm still
wearing my shoes #

98
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:12,107
# But it's okay because I
turn it all into a sexy dance #

99
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,681
# The next thing you know,
I'm wearing absolutely nothing #

100
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,412
# Except for my socks #

101
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,443
# And you know when
I'm down to just my socks #

102
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,579
# What time it is #

103
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,852
# It's business time #

104
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,792
# It's business #

105
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,162
# It's business time #

106
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,757
# You know when
I'm down to my socks #

107
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,325
# It's time for business #

108
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,769
# That's why they're
called business socks, ooh #

109
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,171
# It's business #

110
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,437
# It's business time #

111
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,172
# Oh oh oh, yeah #

112
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,043
# Yeah, ooh #

113
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,149
# Making love #

114
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,846
# Making love for #

115
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,753
# I'm making love for two #

116
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,553
# I'm making love
for two minutes #

117
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,083
# When it's with me, you only
need two minutes, girl #

118
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,028
# Because I'm so intense #

119
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:07,055
# Two minutes in heaven is better
than one minute in heaven #

120
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,624
# Mmm #

121
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,135
# You turn to me and say
something sexy like #

122
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,330
# "Is that it?!" #

123
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,839
# I know what you're
trying to say, girl #

124
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,206
# You're trying to say
"Ah, yeah, that's it" #

125
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,040
# Then you tell me
you want some more #

126
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,570
# Well, uh,
I'm not surprised #

127
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,845
# But I am quite sleepy #

128
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,283
# Mmm #

129
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,617
# It's business #

130
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,714
# It's business time #

131
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,022
# Business hours are over #

132
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,153
# Baby #

133
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,629
# It's business #

134
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,258
# It's business time. #

135
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,899
- Jemaine, Jemaine!
- Hmm, what?

136
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,805
- I'm going home.
- Oh I'll walk with you.

137
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,406
Well, here's the doghouse.

138
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,042
Thanks for walking
me home, Sally.

139
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,213
Um, should I come up
for a cup of coffee?

140
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,223
What are you...
are you serious?

141
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,021
Oh, in my... up there?

142
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,390
Yeah.

143
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,362
I mean, obviously
if you're busy...

144
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,761
No, I'm not busy at all, I...

145
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:15,131
Wait, you're not still
living with Bret, are you?

146
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,033
Maybe. Yes.

147
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,661
Actually, definitely yes.

148
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,229
And if we go up there
he'll be, oh...

149
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,299
I can't believe you're
still living with Bret.

150
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,276
Jemaine, you gotta
get your own place.

151
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,573
You need your own space.

152
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,943
We could go back
to the launderette, maybe?

153
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,845
- Yeah, I don't think so. I gotta go...
- No?

154
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,645
Call me when you get
your own place, Jemaine.

155
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,278
Bret, I'm moving out.

156
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,756
I've decided
I need my own space.

157
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,624
It's time to take life a little
more seriously, you know?

158
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,391
It's time for me to look each
day in the eye and say

159
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,627
"Hey, Jemaine you're...
you're doing this for you."

160
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,760
- What's that, man?
- Oh didn't you hear that?

161
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,429
What did you say?
I wasn't listening.

162
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,766
Oh, I'm moving out.

163
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,303
Why are you moving out?
Is it something I've done?

164
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,835
- No.
- Was it because of the towel?

165
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,745
- What towel?
- Because I used your towel

166
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,613
and I got athlete's foot.

167
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,845
- Do you?
- It's not that?

168
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,820
No. Well... no.

169
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,846
Is it my mold farm?

170
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,619
- No.
- Are you sick of my mold farm?

171
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,922
- No.
- Is it aspergillus fumigatus?

172
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,952
- No.
- You sure?

173
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,985
Yeah it's fine.

174
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,554
Was it something
from a while ago?

175
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,965
- No it's just...
- When we were at school

176
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,799
and you said you got
a hickey from Judy Bailey,

177
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,828
I told everyone it was
the vacuum cleaner.

178
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,568
- No, that's not it...
- Is that it?

179
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,075
- No, it's not that.
- But you did.

180
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,009
- No I didn't.
- Yes you did.

181
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,409
Was a perfectly round hickey.

182
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,879
She had a perfectly
round mouth anyways...

183
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,711
It's not exactly the same size
as a vacuum cleaner tube...

184
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,046
It's not that, it's not that.

185
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,245
Is it because I drank
all the orange juice?

186
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,083
- No.
- Because I drank all the apple juice?

187
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,214
- No.
- Was it something psychological?

188
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,248
Because I put you down
in front of other people?

189
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,884
He wouldn't know,
because he's got no idea.

190
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,417
Why you moving out, Jemaine?

191
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,986
Is it because
I didn't fix that leak?

192
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,793
- No.
- Is it because I left the wires out

193
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,299
- and you shocked yourself?
- No.

194
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,461
Is it because the new
paint job's a little brown,

195
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,970
too nouveau riche?

196
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,565
- A little too recherché?
- No.

197
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,666
Is it because
sometimes I'll sneak in

198
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,303
when you're sleeping and give you
a little kiss on the cheek?

199
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,143
No.

200
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,210
Here we are.

201
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,686
Is it because I ask
too many questions?

202
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,154
No.

203
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,657
- Was it something subtle?
- Yes it's subtle, Bret.

204
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,182
- Is it because I eat too loudly?
- Yes.

205
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,092
- It is?
- Yeah.

206
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,029
- I knew it.
- I didn't wanna say, but there it is.

207
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,532
- You eat too loudly. It's deafening.
- It's not that loud.

208
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,797
- It's so deafening.
- Well, I eat with my mouth shut.

209
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:30,927
I don't know
how you do it.

210
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,702
Jemaine.

211
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,230
- Present.
- Bret!

212
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,209
- Yeah.
- And Murray.

213
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,610
Yes, present, thank you.

214
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,113
I'm always here anyway.

215
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,809
I don't know why
I bothered with my line.

216
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,373
All right, first
on the agenda:

217
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,851
Band investment portfolio.

218
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,049
- What's that?
- Our retirement fund, Jemaine.

219
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,613
Over the last few months
I've been

220
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,626
creaming a bit off of the top of
the band income and investing it.

221
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,888
- Well, that sounds good.
- Yeah.

222
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,021
Well, it sounds good,
but it is good.

223
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,861
All right, I've
done the research

224
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,526
and everyone thinks
property is the way to go.

225
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,092
So I'm proud to announce
that as of this morning

226
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,502
we're the official owners
of three stars...

227
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,267
intergalactic real estate.

228
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,743
All right,
so there's mine, Murray.

229
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,473
Bret, yours is up here.

230
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,141
And Jemaine, you're on the other
side of the nebula there.

231
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,209
But that's as close as we could get
the three that were available, but...

232
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,913
Who took that photo?

233
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,286
That's the real estate
people take that.

234
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,621
Right. How much
do they cost?

235
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,320
Well, that's
the best part.

236
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,953
Only $50 a star

237
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,930
and that includes
a certificate.

238
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,831
Here we go.
Planet Bret for you.

239
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,358
- I hope that's all right.
- That's good, that's great.

240
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,496
And Jemaine,
Planet Jemaine.

241
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,904
And mine's Murrayland.

242
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,670
I thought that
had a ring to it.

243
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,678
Planet Murray was already taken.
I like it... Murrayland.

244
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:50,375
- Welcome to Murrayland.
- This is a waste of money.

245
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,145
No it's not, Jemaine.
What are you talking about?

246
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,981
In 10 years' time
we'll be able to move up there.

247
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,544
And besides, I was thinking

248
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,148
two words, guys:
Natural resources.

249
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,385
Like coal, think about it.

250
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,121
Imagine a planet full of coal.

251
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,459
You get up there,
oh my God, it's coal everywhere.

252
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,522
Imagine how much
that would be worth.

253
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:07,691
I don't know.

254
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,997
It be worth a lot,
wouldn't it?

255
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,697
A real lot.

256
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,762
What about a planet of, um,
diamonds and rubies?

257
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,400
No.

258
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, it would be nice.

259
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,306
A lot of things
would be nice, Bret,

260
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,903
particularly
if they were real.

261
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,141
Do we have any gigs, Murray?

262
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,412
Uh, yes, I've got
an answer for that.

263
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,419
No.

264
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,785
I was going to wait until you
move into your new apartment.

265
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,416
- Who told you?
- Why are you moving out?

266
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,018
Is it because I keep coming
around when I'm sad?

267
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,359
- Is it because I always...
- Oh, we've been through this, Murray.

268
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,125
- It's because I eat too loud.
- Really?

269
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,826
You eat too loud, Bret?

270
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,130
Well, I didn't notice.

271
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,296
Here, eat this.

272
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,867
Oh yeah. Whoa.

273
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,001
Who's eating?

274
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,102
Greg, did you hear that?

275
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,474
- Welcome back, Mr. Clemaine.
- Thank you, Sebastian.

276
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,951
John.

277
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,578
So this is my new place.

278
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,521
This is fancy, man.

279
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,219
Ah, yeah, it is quite fancy, but it's
cheaper than the other place actually.

280
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,022
Flippin' hell.

281
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,754
- Oh hey, guys.
- Hey, Mel.

282
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,822
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

283
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,198
I was walking my dog.

284
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,499
Look, is this your
new place, Jemaine?

285
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,233
It's crazy. I was
just walking past here.

286
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,140
That's so weird. I didn't even
know you'd moved.

287
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,837
- How could I know?
- Yeah, where's your dog?

288
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,312
Wow, this place is classy.

289
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,213
Is that a guard?

290
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,843
He looks like he could
really mess someone up.

291
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,413
Is there always someone
at the door, 24/7?

292
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,980
Why?

293
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,889
Oh, nothing.

294
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,360
Just making conversation.

295
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,260
Oh hi, guys!
Sorry I'm late.

296
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,960
I was up all night looking
at stars trying to find ours.

297
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,060
They all look the same.
Really a waste of time.

298
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,731
Hey, Mel, hey, has
Jemaine told you about

299
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,638
the housewarming party
on Sunday night?

300
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:59,201
- You should come along.
- Oh, I'd love to come. Thank you.

301
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,179
Hey, Jemaine,
where do I park?

302
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,046
- Can you park around here?
- I don't know, I don't have a car.

303
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,449
I can't get any more tickets,
mate, I'll go to jail.

304
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,952
I don't know.

305
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,784
I'll just leave it here.

306
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,355
You're not taking
any of the weight, Murray.

307
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,256
- Yes, it's all here.
- You are not.

308
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,357
- Is this it?
- Mm-hmm.

309
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,264
- No number on the door.
- Don't need one.

310
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,830
This is it.
What do you think?

311
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,171
It's not a room,
it's a cupboard.

312
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,972
- It's not a cupboard.
- It's a cleaning cupboard.

313
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,808
It's not a cleaning cupboard.

314
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,145
Is it... what's...
is that cleaning products?

315
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,775
Yeah, I don't know
what they're doing here.

316
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,013
Well, it must have at one stage been
a cleaning cupboard.

317
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,521
It's not a cleaning cupboard.
It's an apartment.

318
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,615
It's my studio apartment.

319
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,853
More like a compartment.

320
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,691
- Hmm?
- A compartment. Not an apartment...

321
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,856
- Is that a joke?
- Yeah.

322
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,525
That's pretty good.

323
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,194
- You did get it, eh?
- Yeah that's a good one.

324
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,601
- Because it's small.
- You can't have a party in here, man.

325
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,538
Yeah, I can. I'll just put
some lights up and have some music.

326
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,303
Where's the bathroom?

327
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,934
Listen, guys,
I... I've got to go.

328
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,774
Where?

329
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,609
Out, nowhere.
No, out.

330
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,342
You're going nowhere?

331
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,849
I'm going on a date.

332
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,715
Oh, okay.
Bachelor life now, eh?

333
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,219
Watch out, ladies.

334
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,586
- Who with?
- No one.

335
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,916
No one.
That's not a date.

336
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,155
That's just going out.

337
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,685
I do that all the time.

338
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,595
Do... do you want
to go for a walk?

339
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,396
- It's Sally, isn't it?
- No.

340
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,699
Oh, Jemaine!
No, not her again.

341
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,664
Bret went out with her.
She broke your heart and yours as well.

342
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,473
Anyway, I thought
you said Sally was shallow.

343
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,502
- Oh, she's not shallow.
- She is shallow.

344
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,310
But she's really hot.

345
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,509
She's the hottest girl
I've ever touched.

346
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,676
Ever seen.

347
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,709
Well, she was the hottest girl
I'd ever seen,

348
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:48,981
but then I
touched her.

349
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,455
She's not shallow
once you get to know her.

350
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,855
- Do you like butter?
- Butter, yes.

351
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,589
- I don't.
- No.

352
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,824
- I don't really like yellow things.
- No, me neither.

353
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,059
Hey, is that Bret?

354
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,895
No, I don't think so.

355
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,065
Well, he's waving at us.

356
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,938
It looks like him,
but I don't think it's him.

357
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,875
Jemaine, Sally!

358
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,403
- No, that's not him.
- It's me, Bret.

359
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,143
- Maybe it is him.
- He's coming over here.

360
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,879
- Is he?
- It's definitely him.

361
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,649
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Bret.

362
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,212
Yeah, it is him.
You're right.

363
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,588
- Hey, Bret.
- Fancy seeing you here.

364
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,559
Yeah, what
an amazing coincidence.

365
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,221
- Who are you here with?
- Oh, that's just Coco.

366
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,992
- It's his long-term girlfriend.
- Yeah, just a friend.

367
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,966
Well, why don't
you guys join us?

368
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,695
- There's no room, though.
- Thank you.

369
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,038
Do you want to get Coco?

370
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,601
- Sorry?
- Coco, your girlfriend...

371
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,169
you want to get her?

372
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,771
Oh, yeah yeah yeah.

373
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:53,148
Hey, Coco, do you
want to sit over here?

374
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,685
Well, this has been
a really great evening,

375
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,217
but I gotta go.
I got yoga in the morning.

376
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,321
Hey, um, Sally, on Saturday

377
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,161
I'm going to have
a great party at my place,

378
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,497
my new, uh, pad
where I live by myself.

379
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,265
It's going to be
a lot of people, a DJ.

380
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,771
- Next Saturday?
- Mm.

381
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,774
Well she can't go.
It's her birthday, the 14th.

382
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,504
- I think, maybe.
- Yeah, no, that's right.

383
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,446
Anyway, I'm having this thing,

384
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,540
- it's a shame you guys can't come.
- Oh, I can come no matter what.

385
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,313
- No, you... you gotta be my DJ.
- Well, yeah...

386
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,150
There's only going to be
five people if you don't come.

387
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,053
Well, it was really nice
meeting you, Coco.

388
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,524
It was really nice to meet you too.
Hopefully see you soon.

389
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,686
- Sally, I'll walk you home.
- Oh, no no.

390
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,195
It's okay, I'm tired. Stay.

391
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,856
You don't want
to see my new place?

392
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,661
I'm really tired.
Maybe some other time.

393
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,866
Sally is nice.

394
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:15,466
# If it's a Chinese junk
or Roman galley #

395
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,369
# I'll find my way
to you, Sally #

396
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,067
# Happy birthday, Sally. #

397
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,974
- That's beautiful.
- That's a sure thing, bro.

398
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,005
What's a Chinese junk?

399
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,677
Oh, it's a kind of ship.

400
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,381
Oh yeah, sure. Women love that kind of
sensitive nautical shit.

401
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,151
- Really?
- Yeah.

402
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,885
Haven't you ever
seen "Watership Down"?

403
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,654
- No.
- Well, me neither,

404
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,217
but women
love that film.

405
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,288
I was just going to give her
this card that I made.

406
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,593
Whoa.

407
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,328
Holy shit,
did you make that?

408
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,268
- Yeah.
- Well that's beautiful.

409
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,271
- She's going to love that.
- I don't know.

410
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,738
Oh yeah, she is.

411
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,331
It's just a bit of paper
and five hours' work.

412
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,969
No, that is super sensitive.

413
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,070
I mean, that reminds me of
when I saw a puppy being born.

414
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,513
I mean, just to see
its little head

415
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,882
just coming out
of that dog's pussy.

416
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,513
What an incredible
moment, man... beautiful.

417
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,093
Come in.

418
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,826
Hey, man.

419
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,298
Bret, come on, let's go.

420
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,636
Yeah, just a minute.
I'm trying to get the eye color right.

421
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,437
Do you think that
looks like Sally's eyes?

422
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,036
I don't know, Bret. I don't think
about her as much as you do.

423
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,444
Yeah, that's true.
Well, forget I asked.

424
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:48,419
How did you get all seven verses
on that tiny little pebble?

425
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,587
Well, it took ages.

426
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,155
Oh, it's good.

427
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,689
- That's good. It's exquisite.
- Yeah.

428
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,134
Is that what you're gonna give
to Sally for her birthday?

429
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,933
Yeah. What are you
going to give her?

430
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,065
- That glass butterfly.
- Oh yeah.

431
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,438
That's good.
I think they're about even.

432
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,807
Yeah.

433
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,540
You're coming
to my party, aren't you?

434
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,172
- Yeah yeah.
- How you going to get that to her?

435
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,183
I'm just going
to post her this.

436
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,278
Oh, where's it gone? Oh...

437
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,421
Having a good time, Greg?

438
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,432
Hey, Murray, glad you made it.

439
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,058
Hey, get off my pillow.
You're on my pillow.

440
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,830
Oh, sorry.

441
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,702
There's something I want to talk to you
about, actually, Jemaine.

442
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,400
Um, it's not good news.

443
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,635
Planet Jemaine supernova'd.

444
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,673
Yeah, there's nothing
left of it apparently.

445
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,873
Just a huge
gaseous cloud

446
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,940
and the beginnings
of a black hole.

447
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,712
When did this happen?

448
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,777
Uh, about
four million years ago.

449
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,378
Yeah. Sorry.

450
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,185
Well, that was
a waste of 50 bucks.

451
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,749
Thanks, Murray.

452
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,260
- Hey, Coco.
- Hi.

453
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,990
- Hey, is Bret here?
- No.

454
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,225
No. Well he was
supposed to DJ.

455
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,597
- I only got a cassette.
- L... I don't know.

456
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,693
He... he said...
I saw him this afternoon

457
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,260
on his way
to get his haircut.

458
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,967
He said he would
meet me here.

459
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,532
Cassette...
to get his haircut?

460
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,272
Yeah.

461
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,108
- The party's over.
- What?

462
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,082
- The party's over, everyone.
- What are you doing, Jemaine?

463
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,550
- The party's over.
- Greg's about to do his party trick.

464
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,850
This is the one that got him
in "The East Village News."

465
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,049
No, the party's over.

466
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,614
- Jemaine...
- Jemaine!

467
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,626
I need to talk to you about Bret.
I know where he is.

468
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,355
I know where you're going
and when you see him...

469
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,072
- Hey, Jemaine.
- Hey, Sally.

470
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,838
Hello, Bret.

471
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,572
Sorry your party
was canceled.

472
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,638
Yeah, me too.
Nice haircut, Bret.

473
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,676
I made you this
for your birthday.

474
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,242
Aw.

475
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,083
It's a butterfly.

476
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,783
I sat on it
in the subway.

477
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,850
- Oh, you shouldn't have.
- But I also got you some glue.

478
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:05,624
- Oh.
- And that's... that's multipurpose.

479
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,359
You can use... use
that around the house.

480
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,630
Well, thanks. That's,
um, really sweet.

481
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,862
Hey, did you see this amazing
painting Bret made me?

482
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,497
Painting?

483
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,007
A painting?

484
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,907
- Oh, yeah yeah.
- See, that's me,

485
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,913
and that's some
really weird kind of wolf.

486
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,414
Well, it's difficult
to draw a wolf,

487
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,407
so I used a picture
of myself and then adjusted it.

488
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,443
It's kind of creepy,
but it's pretty.

489
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,978
Oh, I'm just glad
you like it.

490
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,086
Well, thanks, guys,
for these amazing gifts.

491
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,322
Oh, have you heard my news?

492
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,461
What's happened?

493
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,831
- Is it Mark's birthday as well?
- No!

494
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,837
I got engaged. Mark and I are
getting married.

495
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,669
- Who's Mark?
- Mark, he was my boyfriend

496
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,005
and then we broke up
and now he's my fiancé.

497
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,908
He bought me a BMW.

498
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,208
Mark, come here and meet
these friends of mine.

499
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,943
- This is, uh, Bret and Jemaine.
- Hey, g'day, guys!

500
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,245
He's Australian.

501
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,273
Go on and show
them your abs.

502
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,718
- No...
- No, go show them.

503
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,084
- No, I'm... no.
- Rock hard.

504
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,419
- Hey you guys want to see them?
- Yes.

505
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,947
No, no thank you, Mark.

506
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,857
- No worries.
- He is so strong.

507
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,657
- Pick up Bret.
- No, I can't...

508
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,062
Just lift him up. He's little, he's like
a pixie. Come on.

509
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,158
Brettie, aye, ohh yes!

510
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,170
Isn't he strong?

511
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,831
What's that?

512
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,500
Oh, that's
a broken butterfly.

513
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,602
This is my song!

514
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,113
- Oh, baby.
- Come on, Mark, let's dance.

515
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,638
Let's go.
See you later, guys.

516
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,291
# Sally, I love you #

517
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,922
# Sally, I love you #

518
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,762
# Sally, I need you #

519
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,668
# Sally, I need you too #

520
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,697
# I need to be with you #

521
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,941
# But I don't just
love and need you #

522
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,741
# I love and need
and want you too #

523
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,407
# I don't just
love and need you #

524
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,609
# I love and need
and want you too too #

525
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,380
# Yeah, well, I love, need and want you
too too too #

526
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,887
# There's too many of those #

527
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,286
# It's just ridiculous #

528
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,188
# Oh, you could be with me #

529
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,988
# Oh, you could be with me #

530
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,017
# If you wanted to be #

531
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,895
- # If you wanted to be with me #
- # Or me #

532
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,956
# The only thing stopping you
from being with me #

533
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,900
# Is that you don't
want to be with me #

534
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,630
# It's the same with me,
except with me #

535
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,228
# But if you did
I'd hold you tight #

536
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,399
# Into every single night #

537
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,409
# And we'd fall
asleep together #

538
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,569
# And we'd wake up
in the sunlight #

539
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,476
# Well, maybe I'm a dreamer #

540
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,708
# But maybe one day you'll
see that dreams are... #

541
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,684
- # Yeah yeah, she gets it...
Stop cockblocking me #

542
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,210
- # Who knows what #
- # Who who who #

543
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:47,419
# Makes love stop or start? #

544
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,324
# I can't help #

545
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,852
# But think that
now you're engaged #

546
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,422
# We're drifting apart #

547
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,934
# And who am I to say #

548
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,799
# That love will last? #

549
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,328
# It won't or it will #

550
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,364
# But maybe Mark
will be involved #

551
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,932
# In an accident
and you'll get #

552
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,376
# A life insurance payment
of half a mil #

553
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,039
# It's not about the money #

554
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,947
# But it could
set us up financially #

555
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,281
# If you came back to me #

556
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,809
# Or me #

557
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,046
# Sally #

558
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,422
# I wrote you this song so I could
tell you how much I love you #

559
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,490
# Quite a lot, actually #

560
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,225
# Um, even sometimes
a little bit more #

561
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,199
# Than my current girlfriend #

562
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,134
# Sally, I co-wrote
this song to tell you #

563
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,798
# How much I love you #

564
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,364
# It's quite a lot, actually #

565
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,000
# Well, he's basically said
just the same thing #

566
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,011
# I think he's been looking over
at my bit of paper #

567
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,945
# Except for
the girlfriend bit #

568
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,481
# Ooh, I love you #

569
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,041
# I love you you you #

570
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,746
# Oh, and I need you #

571
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:52,382
# I need you you
you you you #

572
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:56,053
# I need to be with you #

573
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,721
# Ditto that #

574
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,696
# Because you and me
we were meant to be #

575
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,255
# Bret's got a girlfriend #

576
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,164
# Yeah, but Sally and me,
we were meant to be #

577
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,725
# Bret, you got a girlfriend #

578
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,202
# Yeah, well, I'd break it
off with her if I knew #

579
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,263
# Sally wanted to be with me #

580
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,898
# Well just so you know,
Sally, unlike Bret #

581
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,636
# I'm available immediately #

582
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,043
# Sally, I love you. #

583
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,381
Hey, Jemaine, I was wondering
if you'd think about

584
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,284
moving back in together,
because I'm having trouble paying rent.

585
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,220
I spent all my money
on art supplies.

586
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:27,783
That's a good idea. I haven't really
been sleeping very well lately.

587
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,851
Oh, Coco told me
to tell you you're dumped.

588
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,227
Oh... oh, sorry, man.

589
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,891
What?

590
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,765
I'm sorry, she... she said that
you're emotionally immature.

591
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,860
- What else did she say?
- She said to say

592
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,496
that you've
been ignoring her

593
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,473
and that you're clearly
still in love with Sally,

594
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,236
- which I agree with, actually...
- That's not true.

595
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,506
She said you'd say that
and she said to say

596
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,570
it is true
and you know it.

597
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:51,548
- Oh, but, I mean...
- No buts, she said to say.

598
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,346
Well, did she say
we could talk about it?

599
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,580
- She said we are talking about it.
- Well, we're not though are we?

600
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,247
Well, no.

601
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,984
I don't know what
she meant by that.

602
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,855
Can we still stay in touch?

603
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,759
She doesn't know.
She needs some time alone.

604
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,820
Well, I mean... I mean,
what else can I do?

605
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,627
I mean, I'm... I'm sorry.

606
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,796
It's too late.
It's over, you bastard.

607
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,633
What, did she
call me a bastard?

608
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,537
Uh, no sorry,
I added that bit.

609
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,201
- Oh, okay.
- I got carried away.

610
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,574
I might just give her a call about it
and see what she says.

611
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,273
- What was that?
- Well she told me to do that.

612
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,839
I was supposed to start
with that actually,

613
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,714
I'm sorry, I forgot.
