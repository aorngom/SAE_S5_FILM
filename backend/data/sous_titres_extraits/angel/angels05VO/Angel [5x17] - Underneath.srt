1
00:00:13,906 --> 00:00:15,806
- Harmony...
- [Harmony] I know.

2
00:00:15,908 --> 00:00:18,172
- I called everyone. They're just...
- Not here.

3
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:21,542
I can see that.
If they were here, I wouldn't be alone.

4
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:22,944
Why am I alone?

5
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:25,882
Well, you can be super grouchy.

6
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:29,216
- The meeting?
- Everybody's otherwise <i>ocupado,</i> boss.

7
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:30,983
<i>Wesley's stuck babysitting...</i>

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,287
Miss I Used To Rule the World,
Bow Down Before Me, Minion Scum.

9
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:36,918
- Why are we not killing her again?
- Gunn?

10
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:40,328
Maybe, if we had a really big one.

11
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:41,832
Where is Gunn?

12
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:44,664
Oh. The hospital still.

13
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,830
You know,
from when Wesley... Krrr!

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,104
- And Lorne's kinda M.I.A. Since...
- Fred.

15
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:57,682
Okeydokey, then.

16
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:05,419
Where's the rest of the crew?

17
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,424
Apparently not coming.

18
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:11,690
- But this is an important meeting.
- At least somebody...

19
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:15,597
My first official parley as a very
loosely affiliated member of the...

20
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,670
What are we?
Tell me we're not Scoobies.

21
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:22,639
- We don't have a...
- A name? That's probably for the best.

22
00:01:22,742 --> 00:01:25,540
You'd wanna be
"Angel's Avengers" or something.

23
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:28,842
"Angel's Avengers"?
That's...

24
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:30,813
So, what's on the agenda?

25
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:37,053
- Uh, I have assignments for people...
<i>- [Pops Can Top]</i>

26
00:01:37,156 --> 00:01:38,953
What?

27
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,322
I'm listening with beer.

28
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:44,396
Forget it.
This isn't a meeting.

29
00:01:44,497 --> 00:01:46,965
This is you being annoying.

30
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,899
- Oh!
- Hey, bullet points.

31
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:52,493
Classy.

32
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:54,766
Why am I always reconnaissance?

33
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:58,173
I should get a decently flash gig
like "save the girl,"

34
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:00,006
or "steal the emerald with the girl."

35
00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:04,071
- "Handsome man saved me from the monsters."
<i>- Exactly.</i>

36
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:06,879
Or... What's that, now?

37
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:11,150
That's the first thing
Fred said to me in Pylea.

38
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,694
She was trapped, hiding, afraid.

39
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:21,494
Nearly crazy.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,568
Crazy, but brave.

41
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:28,368
I should never
have let her come here.

42
00:02:28,474 --> 00:02:30,374
Bad things always happen here.

43
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:33,502
Hate to break it to you, mate,
but bad things always happen everywhere.

44
00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:38,172
<i>Besides, she wanted to be here.</i>

45
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:40,081
- It was her choice.
- Was it?

46
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:43,717
Bugger.

47
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:45,916
You're fixin' to do
something stupid, aren't you?

48
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:47,959
Done it.
Came here.

49
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,121
<i>Spend every day lying to myself...</i>

50
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:54,756
about making the world a better place.

51
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:57,233
<i>Welcome to the planet.</i>

52
00:02:57,336 --> 00:03:00,863
We all paint on our happy faces
every day, when all we really want...

53
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:04,033
is to pound the neighbor's missus,
steal his Ben Franklins...

54
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,703
<i>and while we're at it not think about...</i>

55
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,643
the third of the world
that's starving to death.

56
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:10,648
<i>I'm not saying that</i>
<i>I can fix everything.</i>

57
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,811
I just... l... I have to do better.
The senior partners have a plan.

58
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,785
Yeah, the prophecy.

59
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,914
That ever-lovin' apocalypse
you keep goin' on about.

60
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:21,926
Yeah, which apocalypse?
The one last year, or the year before that?

61
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:23,962
No, the senior partners
are up to something now...

62
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:25,963
and I'm not waitin' for them
to spring it on us.

63
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:28,226
We're through operating in the dark.

64
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:30,734
Okay, then.

65
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:34,431
Might be easier if we knew anyone
who had a direct line to the big guys.

66
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:40,174
No way. Even if my connection
to the senior partners...

67
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,839
wasn't completely severed,
I'm done helping you.

68
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:44,745
This isn't a negotiation, Eve.

69
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,342
Ooh, I'm intimidated.
What could you possibly do to me?

70
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:51,753
- I've been trapped in this house for weeks like a...
- Rat?

71
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,587
Snake?
Beady little rat snake?

72
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,992
You're not trapped, Eve. You're hiding.
You know the second you step out that door...

73
00:03:58,097 --> 00:04:02,431
<i>the second you don't have these symbols</i>
<i>keeping you invisible to the partners...</i>

74
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:04,594
they're gonna zero in.

75
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,570
So don't bother playing the pity angle.

76
00:04:07,673 --> 00:04:10,540
The only thing you care about
is saving your own ass.

77
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:13,043
The only thing I care about is gone.

78
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:16,046
You gave him up to the senior partners.
Let them suck him into the...

79
00:04:16,148 --> 00:04:19,777
Could do the same to you. Tell 'em
how to see through your security system.

80
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,445
- You wouldn't.
- Not if you tell me what I wanna know.

81
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:25,820
<i>[Rumbling]</i>

82
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:28,393
- You bastard! You told them!
- Wasn't me.

83
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:32,396
<i>Oh, God.</i>
<i>They're coming.</i>

84
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:35,624
Please, don't let them take me!

85
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,669
Angel, please! I'll tell you!
I'll tell you anything you wanna know!

86
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:49,344
[Creaking]

87
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:48,102
<i>[Singing]</i>

88
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:58,242
<i>She's gonna say no, isn't she?</i>

89
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,978
I should've gotten the bigger ring.

90
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:04,578
June wedding.
There's rain, so get a tent.

91
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,158
- She's gonna say yes?
- Ain't love grand?

92
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,784
- I'm gettin' hitched?
- Yeah.

93
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:13,160
More sea, less breeze, huh?

94
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:16,928
- From now on, your money's no good here.
- All right.

95
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:20,836
I was wonderin'...
about the possibility of a Carlos Junior.

96
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,999
What do you think?

97
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:26,600
What do I think?
I think I'm tired.

98
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:30,204
<i>I think I'm sick and tired</i>
<i>of wearin'bells on my toes...</i>

99
00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:32,580
and making like everything's
gonna be okay.

100
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:35,779
<i>I think it's pathetic that lately</i>
<i>I'm too scared and sad...</i>

101
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:39,449
to tell people the truth, so I just say
what they wanna hear instead.

102
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:41,458
Most of all,
I think the term "happy hour"...

103
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,358
should be banned
from the English language.

104
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:46,658
There's nothing happy about
this hour or any other.

105
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:49,165
Oh.

106
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:52,203
What I know is,
I started drinking...

107
00:06:52,304 --> 00:06:57,708
the moment that I found out
that a girl I loved was gonna die.

108
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,710
And every time I get
to the bottom of the glass...

109
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:04,010
I hope that that last drop
is gonna take me the distance.

110
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:10,212
- Okay.
- A simple plan that failed utterly.

111
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:13,485
Which is why I'm going to heave
my tokus off this stool...

112
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:16,152
strap the bells on...

113
00:07:16,262 --> 00:07:20,392
and with a smile and a quip
go back into the belly...

114
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:24,663
of a very ugly beast
and pretend like I can help.

115
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,465
Mmm.

116
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:29,132
'Cause that's what the green guy does.

117
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:33,576
- Harmony?
<i>- Yepper?</i>

118
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:35,579
Call Security.
Put 'em on red alert.

119
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:37,581
Nobody gets in this building
without clearance from me.

120
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:39,844
I want a guard at every entrance,
every elevator, every stairwell.

121
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:42,216
- Cover the whole building.
- Okay, but you know how that never works...

122
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:44,221
- Harmony.
- On it.

123
00:07:44,323 --> 00:07:47,190
All right. Stay with Eve.
Anything gets past Security, kill it.

124
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:50,490
- Where are you goin'?
- To see my lawyer.

125
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:07,277
We have a problem.

126
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,507
Senior partners found Eve.
They sent somethin' to take her out.

127
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,517
<i>I need to know if I have</i>
<i>jurisdiction to protect her.</i>

128
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,281
What's protocol here?

129
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,950
- I don't know.
- Right.

130
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,963
Well, when you're through reading
about important things like...

131
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,392
"Trista and Ryan's Big Baby Plans"...

132
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:33,630
maybe you can put
some thought into it.

133
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,434
- I'm just not sure.
- Gunn.

134
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:42,071
You paid a high price
for what's in that brain, so use it.

135
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:50,581
There's a proviso in your contract.

136
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:53,249
<i>Says that as C.E.O. Of</i>
<i>a Wolfram and Hart branch...</i>

137
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:55,486
you can invoke a <i>rapio salvus</i> order.

138
00:08:55,594 --> 00:08:59,086
Basically says you're taking custody
of a wayward employee.

139
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:01,257
It's not usually used for protection,
but it should work.

140
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:03,892
- Great. How do l...
- I'll make a call.

141
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,596
Good.

142
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:12,640
Listen, Gunn.

143
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:16,272
I know you feel bad about your part...

144
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:19,613
what happened to Fred.

145
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:22,118
And you should.

146
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:26,783
<i>For the rest of your life, it should</i>
<i>wake you up in the middle of the night.</i>

147
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:29,122
And it will...

148
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:31,128
because you're a good man.

149
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:35,833
You signed a piece of paper.
That's all.

150
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:38,266
But I knew.

151
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,433
Not about Fred, but when I signed,
I knew there would be consequences.

152
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:49,481
Thing about atonement is, you never run
out of chances. But you gotta take 'em.

153
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:53,813
<i>You can't hide in some hospital room</i>
<i>and pretend it's all gonna go away...</i>

154
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,953
'cause it never will.

155
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:06,026
<i>[Fred]</i>
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

156
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:08,531
I thought I was in isolation.

157
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:16,002
Whose fault is that?

158
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,041
Tell me a joke.

159
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,215
Two men walk into a bar.

160
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:33,723
The first man orders
a scotch and soda.

161
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:36,659
The second man remembers
something he'd forgotten...

162
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:40,129
and it doubles him over with pain.

163
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:43,099
He falls to the floor shaking...

164
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:46,899
and then through the floor
and into the earth.

165
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:50,634
He looks back up at the first man,
but he doesn't call out to him.

166
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:55,112
They're not that close.

167
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:57,739
Yeah.

168
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,875
You always know where you are.

169
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:02,545
It's my particular skill.

170
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:14,030
This is only the first layer.

171
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,760
Don't you wanna see how deep I go?

172
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,404
[Illyria]
You've been sitting for a long time.

173
00:11:27,513 --> 00:11:31,609
Yeah. Dozed off.

174
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:34,709
You drank a great deal
of that poison.

175
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,052
<i>You called me a lot of names</i>
<i>meant to hurt feelings I no longer have.</i>

176
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,320
And then you sat there for hours
making noise with your nose.

177
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:45,157
I was dreaming, you twit.

178
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:47,129
You said her name.

179
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:50,463
<i>Fred.</i>

180
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:52,799
It was a nightmare.

181
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:58,036
I don't suppose
you have nightmares or sleep...

182
00:11:58,143 --> 00:12:00,703
or any of that human crap.

183
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:03,144
In my time,
nightmares walked among us.

184
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:07,207
<i>Walked and danced,</i>
<i>skewering victims in plain sight...</i>

185
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:11,153
laying their fears and worst desires out
for everyone to see.

186
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:14,357
This to make us laugh.

187
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:19,796
I'll bet you were jolly as frat boys.

188
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:24,892
And now, nightmares are trapped
inside the heads of humans.

189
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:27,528
Pitiful echoes of themselves.

190
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,336
I wonder whom they angered so
to merit such a fate.

191
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:36,972
This world must be a terrible
disappointment to you.

192
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:40,217
Grievous.

193
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:45,222
I'm not too impressed with it myself.

194
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:51,319
Why don't you leave?

195
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:58,629
<i>Brilliant. Really.</i>

196
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:03,606
They'll never look for me here.
I'm gonna die.

197
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:05,870
You make it hard for me
to wanna help you.

198
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:09,675
We don't wanna help her,
but we will.

199
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:12,944
- You're under my protection.
<i>- Thank the gods.</i>

200
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:15,246
But, you know, I can take it away
with one phone call.

201
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:17,584
- Convince me not to, Eve.
- How can I?

202
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:21,056
- Let's start with something easy, huh? You.
- Me?

203
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,320
What are you?
What do you do for the senior partners?

204
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,591
I'm a liaison.
I liaise.

205
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:33,063
What do you want me to say?
I'm a leprechaun. I'm from Brigadoon.

206
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:35,332
If I had a nickel for
every time I heard that one...

207
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,670
There are layers upon layers
at Wolfram and Hart, Angel.

208
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:41,109
Things you'll never understand.
What am I?

209
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:44,671
I'm a child of the senior partners,
created to do their bidding.

210
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:49,116
You're an immortal.

211
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:51,849
- Why are you here?
- To watch.

212
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:55,620
Tell them what I see.
Pass on messages to you, if there are any.

213
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:57,718
<i>So you're, uh, middle management?</i>

214
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:00,798
<i>- What are the senior partners?</i>
<i>Huh? What are they?</i>
- No idea.

215
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,424
- Eve...
- Do you honestly believe...

216
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:05,867
the senior partners would let me
have access to that information?

217
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:09,737
Angel, for someone so old,
you're so young.

218
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:13,470
I only know what they want me to know,
and only when they want me to know it.

219
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:18,038
- You don't know anything?
- Maybe. Maybe I know a lot.

220
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,981
But I don't have access to it.

221
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:23,577
It's locked in my head somewhere,
and I don't have the key.

222
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:29,584
Ready for the funny part?

223
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:33,096
There was someone who could have
told you everything you want to know...

224
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:36,292
and you let the senior partners
take him away.

225
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:39,063
Lindsey.

226
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:42,072
Lindsey's dedicated years of his life
to the study of the senior partners.

227
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,142
No one knows more
about them than he does.

228
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:48,645
<i>- What they've done, what they plan to do.</i>
- I thought he was after me.

229
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:52,615
You're saying bringing Spike back, the
fail-safe... that was all about the senior partners?

230
00:14:52,718 --> 00:14:56,449
No, it's about you too.
He really doesn't like you.

231
00:14:56,555 --> 00:15:01,857
<i>But he may know more about you</i>
<i>than, well, than you do.</i>

232
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:04,961
Which is why
they snatched him up.

233
00:15:05,063 --> 00:15:07,497
Yeah. They couldn't risk
him and you havin' a sit-down.

234
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:11,330
And now,
what he's going through...

235
00:15:11,436 --> 00:15:16,703
- They didn't kill him?
- They would want him to suffer horrors.

236
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:22,178
Lindsey is in some hideous,
awful hell.

237
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:33,556
- Good morning.
- Mmm. So far.

238
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:37,826
- Stop it!
- Hey!

239
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:40,363
- That's how I get sisters.
- Oh, really?

240
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:43,195
Is that right?

241
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,797
So, what are we gonna do today?

242
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,176
<i>There's thousands of</i>
<i>different kinds ofhells.</i>

243
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:34,082
You got your fire hell,
your ice hell, your...

244
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:40,218
ice hell,
your upside-down hell...

245
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:42,589
Look, I don't care if he's
in toy poodles on parade hell.

246
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:44,594
He's got information that we need.

247
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:47,688
According to the girl,
whose only reason for being is to see...

248
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,699
<i>- her little pookie bear again.</i>
- I'm not lying.

249
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,235
Tell him I'm not lying.

250
00:16:52,337 --> 00:16:55,795
No one can fake it through the piña colada
song, not once the chorus kicks in.

251
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:59,468
If Lindsey can tell me what the senior
partners have planned, I want him.

252
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:01,443
You got a better idea
how to do it, I'm totally open.

253
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:04,606
Didn't say that.
Just pointed out that this one sucks.

254
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:07,913
<i>We're lookin'for a hell dimension in</i>
<i>a haystack. How are we supposed to know...</i>

255
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:10,817
<i>I know, and I can get us in.</i>

256
00:17:10,922 --> 00:17:12,412
Us?

257
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,820
Okay, from the top.

258
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:19,863
- The Earth's outer layer is called...
- The crust.

259
00:17:19,965 --> 00:17:23,162
- And what's underneath that?
- Um, the mantle?

260
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:26,066
Yeah. And under that?

261
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,900
Come on.
You know this one.

262
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,633
The outer core.

263
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:33,837
- And under that?
- The inner core.

264
00:17:33,945 --> 00:17:38,439
- And under that?
- Underneath that? Nothing.

265
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,075
- Just a soft, chewy center.
- Ha-ha.

266
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,518
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Hey, hon?</i>

267
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:46,489
Oven light just went out.
I need a bulb from the cellar.

268
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,093
Should be some in the hall closet.

269
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,925
Just regular ones.
Little ones are downstairs.

270
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,962
Well, Zach, uh... Zach was gettin' ready
to fill me in on the lithosphere.

271
00:18:01,673 --> 00:18:03,641
I kinda need it now.

272
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:07,143
All right.
I'll be right back.

273
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:20,858
They're on that shelf
where we keep those thingies.

274
00:18:57,662 --> 00:19:00,096
<i>I started flippin'through the brain files</i>
<i>as soon as Harmony told me.</i>

275
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:02,496
- Figured there had to be some kind of precedent.
- And?

276
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,467
Senior partners had trouble with a guy
in the Tokyo division way back.

277
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,767
Lindsey probably got the tattoo idea
from studying up on him.

278
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:11,103
- And wherever they sent this guy,
that's where Lindsey is.
- Yep.

279
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:14,076
I hope it's Toy Poodle hell.
I've had my fill of fire.

280
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:16,670
It's not hell.
It's a Wolfram and Hart holding dimension.

281
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,080
Meaning what? The senior partners
haven't decided what to do with Lindsey?

282
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:23,348
- Their version of a penalty box.
- Great.

283
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,548
So, how are we
supposed to get there?

284
00:19:25,657 --> 00:19:27,750
Ever taken the Camaro?

285
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,091
This is weirdin' me out.

286
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,033
Is this weirding you out?

287
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:43,073
What, you never heard of <i>Knight Rider?</i>
Knight Industries 2000?

288
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:45,369
KITT?

289
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:47,445
- Never mind.
- Car's built to get us there.

290
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:49,775
Once we have Lindsey,
it's on us to find the Wrath.

291
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:52,873
The Wrath?
You know that's gonna be a giggle.

292
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,952
Whatever it is,
we gotta go through it to get out.

293
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:57,487
I've never seen
these streets before.

294
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:01,320
Where we're goin',
not in the <i>Thomas Guide.</i>

295
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:03,485
There's gonna be fire.

296
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,501
This isn't hell.
It's the burbs.

297
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:24,241
- Close enough.
- This is Lindsey's punishment for trying to kill me?

298
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,147
[Scoffs]
Maybe it's a reward.

299
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:30,949
<i>- You could go anywhere. You could leave.</i>
- That's not possible.

300
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:33,991
Of course it's possible.
Are you telling me the great Illyria...

301
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:37,152
idol of millions,
was limited to one small dimension?

302
00:20:37,262 --> 00:20:40,060
I traveled all of them as I pleased.

303
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:45,834
I walked worlds of smoke
and half-truths intangible.

304
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:51,200
Worlds of torment...

305
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:53,709
and of unnameable beauty.

306
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:59,139
Opaline towers
as high as small moons.

307
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,209
<i>Glaciers that rippled</i>
<i>with insensate lust.</i>

308
00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:07,758
And one world
with nothing but shrimp.

309
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:11,693
- I tired of that one quickly.
- Then why stay in this one?

310
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:14,924
Surely there's a world
more appealing.

311
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:19,402
Maybe not the shrimp one, but one where
you'd be welcome like you never will be here.

312
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,040
Why don't you go?

313
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:24,972
You can go.

314
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,203
Why don't you go?

315
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:29,303
[Panting]

316
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,678
[Grunts]
It's too small.

317
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:33,717
<i>It's too small.</i>
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

318
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:36,480
I can't live with these walls.
I can't breathe.

319
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,681
<i>There's no room for anything real.</i>

320
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,556
- It's all right.
- I should gut you where you stand.

321
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,563
You challenge me. But there's
not enough space to open my jaws.

322
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:51,294
<i>My face is not my face.</i>
<i>I don't know what... what it will say.</i>

<i>Illyria, come with me.</i>

324
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:46,316
Oh, so we just open with being on fire.
That's great.

325
00:22:46,424 --> 00:22:49,120
Well, we can put our coats over our heads
and make a run for it.

00:22:49,227 --> 00:22:52,287
[Both Yell]

327

Alternate dimension, remember?
Sun's the non-frying variety.

328
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:59,096
- Figured that.
- Oh, right.

329
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:01,138
Can we go?

330
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:02,763
Yeah.

Yeah.

No, the only lawyer I know is the one

Now he's gettin' it.
Ever heard of something called the Wrath?

L... Come on.

00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:08,861
Well, he's not so bad.

499
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:15,465
<i>Are you all right?</i>

500
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,540
I breathe easier.

501
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,841
The walls don't press in as hard
when you can't see them.

502
00:35:23,948 --> 00:35:27,816
- But they're still here.
- Yes.

503
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,555
All I am is what I am.

504
00:35:32,656 --> 00:35:36,387
I lived seven lives at once.
I was power and the ecstasy of death.

505
00:35:36,493 --> 00:35:38,654
<i>I was god to a god.</i>

506
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,730
Now...

507
00:35:43,233 --> 00:35:46,725
I'm trapped on a roof...

508
00:35:46,837 --> 00:35:50,864
just one roof,
in this time and this place...

509
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:54,775
with an unstable human who drinks
too much whiskey and called me a Smurf.

510
00:35:54,878 --> 00:35:57,506
[Chuckles]

511
00:36:00,651 --> 00:36:02,516
You don't worship me at all, do you?

512
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:07,685
And you really can't leave.

513
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:13,018
I... don't know.

514
00:36:15,032 --> 00:36:18,468
I fear in any other dimension in this form,
I'd be but prey to those I knew.

515
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:26,407
- I reek of humanity.
- Don't flatter yourself.

516
00:36:37,054 --> 00:36:39,716
Your world is so small...

517
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:45,318
and yet you box yourselves
in rooms even smaller.

518
00:36:45,429 --> 00:36:50,594
You shut yourselves inside,
in rooms, in routines.

519
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:53,769
There are things worse than walls...

520
00:36:56,407 --> 00:37:00,901
terrible and beautiful.

521
00:37:02,446 --> 00:37:06,974
If we look at them for too long,
they will burn right through us.

522
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:09,552
Truths we couldn't bear.

523
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,452
Not every day.

524
00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:17,159
We are so weak.

525
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:20,594
Yes.

526
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,665
Yes, we are.

527
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,602
Ouch!
Take it easy, Green Jeans.

528
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:38,875
Yeah. Fraid I don't have
Fredikin's gentle touch.

529
00:37:38,982 --> 00:37:41,883
- Just get on with it.
<i>- Mmm.</i>

530
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,514
<i>Look.</i>
<i>It's the hero of the hour.</i>

531
00:37:46,623 --> 00:37:49,558
I'm not your hero.
I'm your warden.

532
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,685
It's all how you look at the glass.

533
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:54,161
<i>I'd have thought</i>
<i>a few months of torture...</i>

534
00:37:54,264 --> 00:37:57,290
at the hands of the senior partners
would've dug a little deeper.

535
00:37:57,401 --> 00:38:00,996
Just scratched the surface.
Turns out they can...

536
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:04,666
only undo you as far as
you think you deserve to be undone.

537
00:38:04,775 --> 00:38:08,142
I wonder how Gunn's
gonna make out.

538
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:11,043
The senior partners... I wanna know
everything you know about them.

539
00:38:11,148 --> 00:38:13,309
About the apocalypse,
about their plans for me.

540
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:17,911
And for me. Guy with the pen said,
"Welcome to the team."

541
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:21,320
- Must've meant something.
- You know what I know.

542
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:24,053
<i>Look around.</i>
<i>The world's a cesspool...</i>

543
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:26,493
<i>filled with selfish and greedy beasts.</i>

544
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:30,931
We live.
We die.

545
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:33,730
- Even you, babe.
- Lindsey, don't.

546
00:38:33,837 --> 00:38:37,773
- You still happy to see me?
<i>- [Angel] Yeah, hell's on earth.</i>

547
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:40,435
Holland Manners tried to sell me
that line three years ago.

548
00:38:40,544 --> 00:38:44,275
- Did you ever prove him wrong?
- All how you look at the glass.

549
00:38:46,183 --> 00:38:49,778
You know, Lindsey,
we can philosophize all night.

550
00:38:49,887 --> 00:38:52,913
Hell, we can do it forever.

551
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:59,353
<i>I don't need to eat, sleep, drink.</i>
<i>How about you?</i>

552
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:02,899
That's what I like to see.
Angel of yore.

553
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,696
<i>Takes no prisoners.</i>
<i>Suffers no fools.</i>

554
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,862
How about this?
It's here.

555
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:12,339
<i>It's been here all along, underneath.</i>

556
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:16,640
- You're just too damned stupid to see it.
- See what?

557
00:39:16,747 --> 00:39:20,581
The apocalypse, man.
You're soakin' in it.

558
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:26,246
I've seen an apocalypse or two in my time.
I'd know if one was under my nose.

559
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:30,383
Not <i>an</i> apocalypse.
<i>The</i> apocalypse.

560
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:33,657
<i>What, did you... did you think</i>
<i>a gong was gonna sound?</i>

561
00:39:33,764 --> 00:39:36,562
<i>Time tojump on your horses</i>
<i>and fight the big fight?</i>

562
00:39:38,368 --> 00:39:40,996
Starting pistol went off
a long time ago, boys.

563
00:39:41,104 --> 00:39:43,004
You're playing for the bad guys.

564
00:39:43,106 --> 00:39:47,270
<i>Every day you sit behind your desk</i>
<i>and you learn a little more...</i>

565
00:39:47,377 --> 00:39:49,311
<i>how to accept the world the way it is.</i>

566
00:39:49,413 --> 00:39:51,779
Well, here's the rub.

567
00:39:51,882 --> 00:39:54,407
Heroes don't do that.

568
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:57,612
Heroes don't accept the world
the way it is.

569
00:39:57,721 --> 00:39:59,621
They fight it.

570
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:05,418
You're saying everything we do...

571
00:40:07,497 --> 00:40:12,264
it's a distraction to keep us busy
from lookin' under the surface.

572
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:15,099
Ding. We got a winner.

573
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:18,606
<i>World keeps sliding towards</i>
<i>entropy and degradation.</i>

574
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,109
And what do you do?

575
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:25,204
You sit in your big chair
and you sign your checks...

576
00:40:25,315 --> 00:40:27,306
just like the senior partners planned.

577
00:40:30,654 --> 00:40:33,987
The war's here, Angel...

578
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:36,719
and you're already two soldiers down.

579
00:40:40,664 --> 00:40:42,393
Come on.
You know this one.

580
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:44,364
The outer core.

581
00:40:44,468 --> 00:40:46,595
And under that?

582
00:40:46,703 --> 00:40:48,796
- The inner core.
- Under that?

583
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:52,068
Underneath that?
Nothing.

584
00:40:52,175 --> 00:40:54,973
- Just the soft, chewy center.
- Ha-ha.

585
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:58,070
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Hey, hon?</i>

586
00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:01,048
Oven light just went out.
I need a bulb from the cellar.

587
00:41:02,486 --> 00:41:04,386
Uh, should be some
in the hall closet.

588
00:41:04,488 --> 00:41:07,218
Just the regular ones.
Little ones are downstairs.

589
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,060
Zach's about to fill me in
on the lithosphere.

590
00:41:15,065 --> 00:41:17,033
I kinda need it now.

591
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,707
Grr! Arrgh!
