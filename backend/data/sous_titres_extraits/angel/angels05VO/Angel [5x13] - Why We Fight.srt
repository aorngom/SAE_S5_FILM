like Steve Rogers
or Captain America.

166
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:10,313
Steve Rogers <i>is</i> Captain America,
you eight ball.

167
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,412
- What?
<i>- We're all that's left.</i>

168
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:16,616
An ensign, a helmsman...

169
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:19,559
a handful of petty officers.

170
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,790
Afraid we're not much.

171
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:24,696
- Not against them.
- What's your name, Ensign?

172
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:27,497
- Lawson, sir. Sam Lawson.
<i>- Okay, Lawson.</i>

173
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:30,095
Keep everyone in this room.
Lock it up tight.

174
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,868
Yes, sir.
Sir.

175
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:33,875
I have seen what those things
can do to a man.

176
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:38,311
- I wouldn't go in there unarmed,
not by yourself.
- Keep it. You may need it.

177
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,484
It's okay, Lawson.
I know what I'm up against.

178
00:12:42,586 --> 00:12:45,749
Don't open up this door
for anything other than me.

179
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:48,188
Yes, sir.

180
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,379
Angelus.

181
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:22,583
They'll let anyone in here.

182
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:32,830
Of all the bloody faces
I expected to see down here.

183
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:35,268
- You're a Nazi?
- What?

184
00:13:35,372 --> 00:13:38,432
Oh, no.
I just ate one.

185
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,874
So, they got you too, eh?

186
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:44,711
[Sighs]
Nabbed me in Madrid.

187
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:48,250
Sneaky bastards, the S.S.
Don't ever go to a "Free Virgin Blood" party.

188
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:50,251
Turns out it's probably a trap.

189
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:52,287
You were captured at
a "Free Virgin Blood" party?

190
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:54,823
I know.
Who would've thought?

191
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:57,951
One minute I'm askin' a fella
why all the virgins look like Goebbels.

192
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:02,555
Next minute, I'm stuck in a box
in this cursed ship.

193
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,998
I feel better knowin'
that they got you too.

194
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:07,365
Though I can't say I'm surprised.
From our company...

195
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,439
it looks like they're roundin' up
the baddest of the bad.

196
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,735
- You'll have to introduce me.
- Of course.

197
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:15,310
But I gotta warn you, uh,
they're a bit stiff.

198
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:23,414
Oh, Angelus, this is, uh,
Nostroyev and the Prince of Lies.

199
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,148
Nostroyev, Prince of Lies,
this is Angelus.

200
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:29,487
<i>- The</i> Angelus.
- Angelus.

201
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:32,118
Used to be quite a terror
back in the day.

202
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:34,789
Haven't heard much
of you lately, though.

203
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:36,661
Haven't heard much of you ever.

204
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:40,702
Nostroyev, Scourge of Siberia.

205
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:42,601
Butcher of Alexander Palace.

206
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:46,164
- Sorry.
- I was Rasputin's lover!

207
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:49,177
Uh, look, I broke these two out
just shortly after I got free.

208
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,941
Didn't know you were back there.
Would've come for you as well.

209
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:55,245
Suppose we had our hands full
with the sailors, didn't we?

210
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,752
[Sinister Chuckling]

211
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:07,123
- Anybody still alive back here?
- Nah. We just finished off the last of'em.

212
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,130
What about back there?
You save us anything?

213
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:12,497
- Couple men left in the torpedo room.
- Well, what are we waiting for?

214
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:13,830
- No.
- What?

215
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:16,098
We're not killing any more humans.

216
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,106
- Well, not right now.
- Why the hell not?

217
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,076
'Cause in case you haven't noticed, Spike,
we're trapped at the bottom of the ocean.

218
00:15:22,178 --> 00:15:25,773
- Yeah? So?
- We're underwater?

219
00:15:27,684 --> 00:15:31,450
So unless you know how to operate one of
these things, we're gonna need their help.

220
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:34,318
Oh, come on.
How hard can it be?

221
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:37,120
Forward, back, up, down...

222
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,856
<i>- [Alarm Blaring]</i>
- [Hissing]

223
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:43,524
<i>[Alarm Stops]</i>

224
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:46,067
Tell you what.

225
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:49,696
<i>We'll leave one alive</i>
<i>to work the boat...</i>

226
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:52,741
and eat the rest.

227
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:55,902
- No.
- Uh, yeah. Probably should warn you.

228
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:58,480
He likes to pretend he's the boss.

229
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:02,176
You may have made a name for yourself
muscling around weaker vampires...

230
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:04,583
- Hang on.
- But I'm Nostroyev.

231
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:08,388
I will tear you open and play...

232
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:13,292
"Coachman, Spare Your Horses"
on the lute of your entrails.

233
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:16,424
Get out of my way.

234
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:24,673
[Screaming]

235
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:30,178
We don't kill the humans till
we reach land. Is that clear?

236
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:34,347
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

237
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:41,616
<i>Hiya, Chief.</i>

238
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:46,025
Oh, come on.
Don't tell me you don't recognize me.

239
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:49,428
Spend time in a tube, you should know
your crew like the back of your hand.

240
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:51,193
Lawson.

241
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,896
You see there?
I'm touched.

242
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:58,803
Aren't you gonna ask me
how I got in here?

243
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:01,900
No. You'd be amazed at how many people
break into this building...

244
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:04,741
- on a regular basis.
- But I had a whole bit planned...

245
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:08,944
about how I was always good with technology,
and you, of all people, should know that.

246
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:11,646
Yeah, sorry.

247
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:13,814
This place might as well be
a bus station.

248
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,053
Seems like you're doing
pretty well for yourself.

249
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:23,758
It's a far cry from all those years
you spent in the gutters eating rats.

250
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:27,963
You've been following my life.
I'm touched.

251
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:30,938
I just check in
every decade or so.

252
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,099
Imagine my surprise when
I found out that...

253
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:37,009
Mr. Vermin Eater himself
was suddenly fighting evil...

254
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:40,708
<i>and running Wolfram and Hart.</i>

255
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:43,547
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>Mind explaining that one to me?</i>

256
00:17:43,653 --> 00:17:45,746
Those two don't exactly
go hand in hand.

257
00:17:45,855 --> 00:17:47,948
It's complicated.

258
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,393
I find that's true
about most things these days.

259
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:56,795
I don't mean to sound
like an old man, but...

260
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,697
we used to live in
simpler times, didn't we?

261
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:02,101
Never thought I'd miss
bein' on that sub.

262
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:05,766
Things made a kind of sense.

263
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,946
Keep your head down,
watch each other's backs...

264
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,914
And stay alert.
Follow our lead.

265
00:18:14,017 --> 00:18:16,349
We'll get out of this.
All right?

266
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:29,727
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>Lawson, this is Spike, the Prince of Lies.</i>

267
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:33,291
Put 'em to work if you need 'em.

268
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:39,036
Spinelli, take Heinrich up to the galley.
Then do a full systems check.

269
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:41,042
You got five minutes.
Start with the batteries.

270
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:43,669
I want juice as soon as possible.

271
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,374
O'Shea, you're at the helm.

272
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:49,816
<i>Tyler, you're gonna have</i>
<i>to handle bow and stern for now.</i>

273
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,820
If we have to surface, we can't outmaneuver
theJerries on batteries alone.

274
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,822
I'll work on the engines
once we're underway.

275
00:18:54,924 --> 00:18:57,825
- But right now, I just wanna get moving.
- And where does the captain sit?

276
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:59,656
Uh, right there.

277
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:03,664
Oh. Right.
And now, uh...

278
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:05,893
who brings the captain his drink?

279
00:19:06,002 --> 00:19:09,529
Hodge, you're on communications.

280
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:11,607
<i>Hodge.!</i>

281
00:19:14,677 --> 00:19:17,510
What should I do?

282
00:19:18,848 --> 00:19:20,713
Sit down over here, Prince of Lies.

283
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:28,253
This bathysphere is perplexing.

284
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:48,807
Let's get these bodies out of here.

285
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,417
May I speak freely, sir?

286
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:04,486
I recognize there's a lot goin' on here
that I don't understand.

287
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:06,653
But those monsters butchered my crew.

288
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:08,958
Apparently, they're in the S.S.

289
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:11,761
Spike's not in the S.S.
He just likes wearin' the jacket.

290
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:15,269
Yeah, that doesn't help me understand
why we're workin' with 'em.

291
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:17,271
Or keepin' 'em alive,
for that matter.

292
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:20,206
- I got 'em under control.
- That's not the point.

293
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:25,238
- He killed my captain, sir.
- We may be able to use them.

294
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:27,475
- We don't have much of a crew left.
<i>- I don't think we'll need 'em.</i>

295
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:30,144
- They're extra hands.
- They're monsters.

296
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:32,778
- And I don't know why we...
- You don't need to know why.

297
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:36,825
We gotta bring this sub in.
Those are our orders.

298
00:20:39,662 --> 00:20:43,063
<i>Isn't that the point?</i>
<i>Following orders?</i>

299
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:51,507
There's a difference between
orders and purpose, sir.

300
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:55,009
Now, I didn't sign on
'cause I needed directions.

301
00:20:55,111 --> 00:20:57,807
<i>Hell, growin'up,</i>
<i>I used to make fun of the military boys.</i>

302
00:20:57,914 --> 00:20:59,882
Always figured they wouldn't know
how to tie their shoes...

303
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:03,282
if someone didn't
give 'em the go-ahead.

304
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:07,379
Then I saw pictures of
what the Krauts were doin'.

305
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,982
Evil's spreadin', sir.
And it's not just over there.

306
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:14,325
It was on my ship.
It killed my crew, and we gotta stop it.

307
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,196
Now, I've been scared out of my mind
since I signed on for this duty.

308
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:20,963
But I can keep it together.
I can even handle dying...

309
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,970
if I know it's for a greater purpose.

310
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,267
We got a job to do.

311
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,742
That job is gonna
help us win the war.

312
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:34,044
I don't need you
to understand every detail.

313
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,914
Just know we're fightin'
on the same side.

314
00:21:39,455 --> 00:21:43,551
I need you to trust that
I'm gonna get us all through this...

315
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,560
safe and sound.

316
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:53,161
"Safe and sound."

317
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:58,205
Guess now's not the time
to argue semantics, is it?

318
00:21:59,842 --> 00:22:02,242
Did you care about any of it?

319
00:22:02,345 --> 00:22:04,506
The ship?

320
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,777
The mission?
The men?

321
00:22:07,884 --> 00:22:12,048
- Or were you just in it to save your own ass?
- What do you want, Lawson?

322
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:14,749
Same thing I've always wanted...

323
00:22:14,857 --> 00:22:16,757
to understand.

324
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:21,626
Understand what, exactly?

325
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:23,858
Why we do what we do.

326
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:25,900
<i>How you manage to always...</i>

327
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:31,399

492
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,644
We're dead
without propulsion.

493
00:33:45,748 --> 00:33:50,082
- Tell me what to do.
- I'm the only one.

494
00:33:50,185 --> 00:33:53,211
I'm the only one.
[Coughing]

495
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,086
I'm not gonna let
any more die.

496
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:00,890
I can fix it.

497
00:34:02,731 --> 00:34:04,722
I can fix it.
[Coughs]

498
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:07,097
I know you can.

499
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:44,235
Air's about gone.

500
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:48,173
Your new boy better get the engines
runnin' before the fish start floppin'.

501
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:52,278
He'll get it done.

502
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:55,373
Hope it's in time.

503
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:57,782
<i>The one on the end</i>
<i>looks like he's done for.</i>

504
00:35:00,022 --> 00:35:03,116
Be a blessing to put him
out of his misery.

505
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:06,558
<i>[Engines Powering Up]</i>

506
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:10,257
Get 'em on their feet.
We need to surface.

507
00:35:10,365 --> 00:35:13,334
Your lucky day, isn't it?

508
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:24,477
- You did it.
- I told you I could.

509
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,343
Good work.

510
00:35:26,448 --> 00:35:29,884
Thanks, Chief.

511
00:35:29,985 --> 00:35:32,112
You too.

512
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:39,221
- We're surfacing.
- Yeah.

513
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:43,094
Is that a sharp maneuver with
Jerry still trollin' for us?

514
00:35:43,198 --> 00:35:47,328
We're out of air. Crew's not gonna
make it if we don't vent.

515
00:35:49,638 --> 00:35:53,404
They swore to give their lives
for their country, just like me.

516
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:56,910
- Besides, I'm hungry.
- They're still your men.

517
00:35:57,012 --> 00:36:00,880
But they're not the mission.
Are they?

518
00:36:04,953 --> 00:36:09,185
You're new at this.
I'm not. Let's take a walk.

519
00:36:30,178 --> 00:36:32,271
They look smaller.

520
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:38,451
Eight hours to sunrise.
Twenty miles from land.

521
00:36:38,554 --> 00:36:41,853
I just might make it.

522
00:36:41,957 --> 00:36:46,223
Hey. I'm sorry
for what happened.

523
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:51,630
But if I ever see you again,
I'm gonna have to kill you.

524
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:53,701
Aye, aye, Chief.

525
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:58,562
Take good care of her.

526
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,642
She's a good boat.

527
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:10,911
Bloody brilliant.

528
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,785
Turn the poor sod
to save the ship...

529
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,589
then make him dash for dry land before
Mr. Sunshine scorches him a new one.

530
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,289
You're still a dick.

531
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:25,855
Yeah. I am.

532
00:37:34,676 --> 00:37:36,644
Bollocks.

533
00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:46,176
<i>Did they at least torture you?</i>
<i>Please tell me they did.</i>

534
00:37:46,288 --> 00:37:49,052
Never gave them a chance.

535
00:37:49,157 --> 00:37:51,387
<i>Jumped ship</i>
<i>off the coast of Maine.</i>

536
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:55,122
Went underground till
the war was over.

537
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,358
- Like any other coward.
- Wars are won and lost by men.

538
00:37:58,467 --> 00:38:00,367
You mean, like me?

539
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:02,801
No, wait.
That doesn't apply anymore, does it?

540
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:06,203
- I never wanted to do this to you.
- Oh, put your hanky away.

541
00:38:06,308 --> 00:38:09,004
<i>I know how important the technology</i>
<i>they pulled from the sub was...</i>

542
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:11,375
<i>to helpin'us stop the Germans.</i>

543
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,380
Sounded like a fair shake.

544
00:38:13,482 --> 00:38:15,712
One person damned to make the world
safe for future generations.

545
00:38:16,985 --> 00:38:19,010
Except these guys.

546
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:21,681
Killing them's not gonna
change the past.

547
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,221
But it'll hurt you.
Maybe that's enough.

548
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,389
Never is.

549
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:33,935
Then maybe I found my mission
again after all these years.

550
00:38:34,036 --> 00:38:36,368
Being an evil son of a bitch
not keeping you busy?

551
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:40,999
We all need a reason to live,
even if we're already dead.

552
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:43,600
Mom, apple pie, stars and stripes...

553
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,806
<i>That was good enough for me</i>
<i>till I met you.</i>

554
00:38:46,915 --> 00:38:49,645
Then I had this whole "creature of the night"
thing goin' for me...

555
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:53,482
the joy of destruction and death...
and I embraced it.

556
00:38:53,588 --> 00:38:55,613
I did all the terrible things
a monster does.

557
00:38:55,724 --> 00:39:01,219
<i>Murdered women and children, tortured</i>
<i>fathers and husbands just to hear 'em scream.</i>

558
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:04,992
<i>And through it all, I felt nothing.</i>

559
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:10,163
Sixty years of blood
drying in my throat like ashes.

560
00:39:10,272 --> 00:39:13,730
So what do you think?
Is it me, Chief?

561
00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:15,742
Or does everyone you sired
feel this way?

562
00:39:15,844 --> 00:39:21,111
You're the only one
I ever did this to... after I got a soul.

563
00:39:21,216 --> 00:39:23,741
Do I have one too?

564
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,752
I don't think
it works that way, son.

565
00:39:32,894 --> 00:39:34,794
Didn't think so.

566
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:51,737
<i>You gave mejust enough,</i>
<i>didn't you?</i>

567
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:56,341
Enough of your soul to keep me trapped
between who I was and who I should be.

568
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:01,646
I'm nothin' because of you.

569
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:20,473
You really want it
to end like this?

570
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:22,543
Sounds like a plan.

571
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:37,023
Come on, Chief.
Give me a mission.

572
00:40:57,846 --> 00:41:02,408
Really oughta do somethin'
about security.

573
00:41:02,517 --> 00:41:05,179
[Chuckles]
They'll let anybody in here, won't they?

574
00:41:10,592 --> 00:41:14,289
Fred gave me the Cliff Notes.

575
00:41:14,396 --> 00:41:17,991
So sailor boy finally
came back for a yo-ho-ho, did he?

576
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:19,999
Finally came back.

577
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:23,298
Took him long enough.

578
00:41:23,405 --> 00:41:27,000
I know revenge is best served cold and all,
but his must've been frozen solid.

579
00:41:28,343 --> 00:41:30,971
I don't think that's
what he was after.

580
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,946
No? Then what
was he looking for?

581
00:41:36,985 --> 00:41:39,385
A reason.

582
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,228
Grr! Arrgh!
