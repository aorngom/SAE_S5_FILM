1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,979
Previously:

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:06,429
Angel's son is part of
the prophecy and sought by many.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,849
- Adorable.
- Sweet.

4
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:10,779
- The baby.
- I meant the hot mama.

5
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:13,000
She's an extraordinary young woman.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,960
- We got a term in Pylea: kyrumption.
- I know.

7
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:22,170
Everyone is very anxious
for Her Majesty...

8
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:25,530
- ...to com-shuk with the Groosalugg.
- Sounds dirty.

9
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,300
It's not terrible, it's wonderful.

10
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,879
- Your visions will pass to me.
- I can't give them up.

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,579
- Cordelia.
- What about her?

12
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,750
Let her know what's inside.
Don't miss that shot.

13
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,000
You've become a truly
extraordinary woman.

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,350
- I think that we--
- Groo?

15
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:46,070
Yes, we grew closer....

16
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:48,609
- Groo!
- Princess!

17
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:51,399
- Oh, God!
- He just showed up.

18
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,979
I thought she was meant
to be with Angel.

19
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:55,600
I'm gonna check on Connor.

20
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,539
- He's sleeping.
You can't predict those things.

21
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,780
- It's strange.
- Hmm....

22
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,560
I remember him being taller.

23
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,189
A trick of the light.

24
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,140
They don't actually get smaller
till they're very, very old.

25
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,140
- I didn't mean the baby.
- I know.

26
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:30,650
- I meant the Groosalugg.
- I know you did.

27
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:35,469
He seem-- I don't know, short?

28
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,319
Oh, absolutely.

29
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,269
Clearly, the guy shrank.
All over, probably.

30
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,599
He's nothing but a muscly midget.

31
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,640
Once Cordelia gets him home,
she'll just pop him in a small drawer.

32
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:51,469
She took him home?

33
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,650
Good. We won't have to put him up.
Place was turning into a hotel.

34
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,099
- You don't have a problem with that?
- Of course not. Why?

35
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:07,629
Because I don't remember you wearing
perfume when you left this evening.

36
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,259
- There may have been some magic.
- You see?

37
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:15,639
Actual magic, Lorne.
Whatever happened was a spell.

38
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,680
There's nothing between
Cordelia and me.

39
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,650
Sure there is. It's got arms like
steel cables and ironic timing.

40
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,009
No, it's good the Groosalugg
showed up.

41
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:30,469
Cordelia deserves a champion.
Now she's got one.

42
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,939
- What about you?
- I'm fine.

43
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,159
I've been solo
most of my 240 years.

44
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,900
When I wasn't, it never went well.
I like being alone.

45
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:43,379
Fine, Miss Garbo.
Have it your way. Be alone.

46
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,509
- So you got deposed, huh?
- Yes.

47
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,650
- That sucks.
- The people turned against me.

48
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,610
- They'll do that.
- Endless committees formed.

49
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,060
They splintered into factions.
The factions into coalitions.

50
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,000
Coalitions into subcommittees.

51
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,229
Until the radical elements,
spurred by a charismatic leader...

52
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,129
...did the dance of revolution.

53
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,419
- And here you are.
- Yes.

54
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,889
So, you don't miss it?

55
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,930
You know. The power, castle...

56
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,050
...concubines...

57
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:50,199
...and the royal chippies.

58
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,569
There was never anyone else.

59
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,909
- Oh.
- I welcomed the overthrow.

60
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:04,280
The tedium of government was hard
to bear after battlefield life.

61
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,139
But your heart wasn't in it.

62
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,430
No. That left when you did.

63
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:41,879
Princess?

64
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,589
Something wrong?

65
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,009
Hey.

66
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,689
- Morning.
- You the only one here?

67
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:51,779
So far.

68
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,310
- How's young Connor today?
- He's good.

69
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:58,699
Cordelia's usually in by now,
isn't she?

70
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:02,959
I imagine she and Groosalugg
were up late catching up.

71
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,439
Right.

72
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:07,810
They.

73
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:11,779
I was hoping we could talk
before the others got here.

74
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:14,470
Sure. What is it?

75
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,110
Well...

76
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,899
...it's the fact of him.

77
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:28,370
His sudden arrival was something
we all needed to digest.

78
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,240
- There are questions.
- You're suspicious.

79
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,939
- Cautious might be a better word.
- You think he's evil.

80
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,509
- Evil?
- Okay, maybe not evil.

81
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,860
But he's definitely hiding something.
He seem shorter to you?

82
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,329
We are talking about Connor,
aren't we?

83
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,300
- What about Connor?
- He shouldn't exist.

84
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,819
His birth was foretold.
How many can say that?

85
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:02,250
He has a role to play, that's true.
We still don't know what that role is.

86
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,699
We can't be afraid to ask the
questions. His enemies won't be.

87
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,339
You're right. We should be prepared.

88
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:12,959
I'm glad you agree.

89
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,149
Without the Nyazian prophecies,
we must look elsewhere for answers.

90
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,699
We know where they went.
It's time to assault Wolfram and Hart.

91
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,370
That might not be necessary yet.
There are other sources.

92
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,689
Ancient works accumulate
scholarship, commentary.

93
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,779
- You think somebody has done the work.
- That's my hope.

94
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:37,160
I've been looking into it.
I felt you should know.

95
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,009
- I want to be involved. Completely.
- Involved with who?

96
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,569
You're here...

97
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:47,649
...and so is he.

98
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,589
Angel, your weapons
are most impressive.

99
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,300
Thanks. Thank you.

100
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:00,629
Can you ask him
not to handle my weapons?

101
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,959
Relax. If there's one thing Groo
knows, it's how to handle a weapon.

102
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:09,949
Poor guy. Looks like
that's about all he'll be handling.

103
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,569
You mean, you two didn't...?

104
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:17,040
I got him home last night,
and we started-- You know.

105
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,759
But then, I couldn't go
through with it.

106
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,279
- You couldn't?
- No.

107
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,480
Not after seeing
that disgusting spiny thing.

108
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:32,470
- Spiny?
- Right up in my face.

109
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,080
That's what the visions are like.

110
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,750
No pain, less artsy, sometimes floaty,
and often stinky.

111
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:42,250
- You had a vision?
- Yeah. Big as life.

112
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:47,070
Last night, while we were getting
reacquainted. Kind of a mood killer.

113
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:50,440
- You should have called one of us.
- Oh, please.

114
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:54,490
Like I'd bother you because
I want sex and can't have it.

115
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,830
I meant the vision.

116
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:01,830
Oh, that. Well, it's not rising up
till sometime later today.

117
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,470
- Oh. Why can't you have sex?
- I could lose my vision-ity.

118
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,490
- If you want to play it that way.
- Vision-ity. The visions.

119
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,799
When that one hit me last night,
it hit me. In Pylea...

120
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,960
...the visions were to pass
to Groo if we did the com-shuk.

121
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:24,600
- How do I know that won't happen here?
- You don't.

122
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,950
Your transformation
could have changed that.

123
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,549
Still, you know,
better safe than sorry.

124
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:36,490
- You're doing the right thing.
- I know. I know.

125
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:42,129
I can't risk it.
It's just, I'm so....

126
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:46,700
And he's such a....

127
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,110
Don't you think?

128
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:53,190
- Yeah, sure.
- Certainly.

129
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,549
There's gotta be things we can do...

130
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,870
- ...to relieve the tension.
- Jogging.

131
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,570
- Perhaps a paranormal prophylactic.
- Because jogging--

132
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:07,120
I guess we could probably com
without actually shuking.

133
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:13,009
That could be a slippery slope that
once you're on, that you could slide.

134
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,379
At least I won't upset
the average here.

135
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,759
Nobody in this office
is ever gonna get any.

136
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:27,549
It's funny.

137
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:30,899
- The way I chew?
- No.

138
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,600
Until that kiss, I thought you
and Wesley had a thing.

139
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:36,409
- Wesley?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,299
No, we're just good friends.

141
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,529
- You want another order of those?
- Yes, please.

142
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,019
Oh, no. Wait. No, I'm not hungry.

143
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,990
You sure? I love watching you eat.

144
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,720
Wow.

145
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:56,909
We should probably go.
People might start to talk.

146
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,529
- Why would they?
- Well, you know, us.

147
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:05,379
"Us" has been doing breakfast for
weeks now. Everyone knows.

148
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:10,700
But now that we've kissed, things are
different. I mean, they are, right?

149
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:13,360
Oh, yeah.

150
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,970
So you don't think they can tell?

151
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,919
From here?

152
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,580
I'm sorry.
I'm being ridiculous, I know.

153
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:33,250
I don't have much experience with
this. I spent five years in a cave.

154
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,759
- I know what that's like.
- How could you?

155
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,179
Because now, everything's so bright,
my eyes hurt.

156
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:45,409
Here you go.

157
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,600
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

158
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,539
- How will we work this?
- Like always. We'll split it.

159
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,950
But you hardly ordered anything.
I'd be getting so much more value.

160
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,879
I think I'm making out okay.

161
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,649
- Wesley.
- Wesley.

162
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,230
We've identified the demon from
Cordelia's vision as a Senih'D.

163
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,409
It'll rise in the mid-city area...

164
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,419
...sometime before nightfall.

165
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:26,309
The Senih'D manifests
physically for one purpose.

166
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,330
- Seen it.
- To feed.

167
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:33,080
Upon rising, it'll search for a victim.
We've got to keep it from finding one.

168
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:37,600
Angel will take the sewer.
The rest will go to Sorenson Park.

169
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,000
We'll enter the underground,
double back.

170
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,309
- By the time we meet up--
- I know this creature.

171
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,629
It's like the Bleaucha, nested in
the Scum Pits of Ur.

172
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,750
- I have slain many.
- Really?

173
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:53,129
Tracking it will be simple.
Killing it, more difficult.

174
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,289
Well, yeah.

175
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:58,889
All right, then. Groo, you go
with Angel. Let's move out.

176
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:07,330
I don't think that's
such a great idea.

177
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:11,309
Me and him. I'm more of a loner,
really. Plus, he's so, like, bulky.

178
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,820
He could slow me down.

179
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,940
He's an experienced warrior.
He should be a great asset.

180
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:20,139
Here's a nice one.

181
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,000
- That's my favorite broadsword!
- It's fine.

182
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:28,710
Sure you'll be warm enough?
The sewers are damp.

183
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,570
- I shall be fine.
- Here.

184
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,080
Okay.

185
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,799
Let's go.

186
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,210
I'll present this beast's head
to my princess.

187
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,860
Right. She'd love that.

188
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:03,639
- You sense anything?
- A deep sadness.

189
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:11,299
My princess. She is unhappy.
I fear I am the cause.

190
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:16,379
No, she's not unhappy
you're here, Groo.

191
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,529
She's thrilled.

192
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,350
Then what keeps her from me?

193
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,789
There is a distance,
as if her heart is not free.

194
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,450
I think maybe she's afraid
to get too close.

195
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,970
She's scared if she does,
she'll lose something.

196
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,419
I would give my soul to--

197
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:51,750
It is wounded. It bleeds.

198
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,090
It's better than bread crumbs.
Let's go.

199
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:46,000
Come.

200
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:20,200
You're safe.

201
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,909
Well done.

202
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:27,149
I must say, excellent.

203
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:34,950
Well done, I must say.

204
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:44,370
You think you know someone.

205
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:48,460
You think your place is secure
and there's a future there.

206
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:50,440
And then something happens.

207
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,750
No, strike that.
Someone happens.

208
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:58,929
They insinuate themselves,
pushing you out, taking your place.

209
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,819
What makes you think this other
woman's a witch, Ms. Frakes?

210
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,480
Why else would Jerry cheat on me?
We've been engaged eight years.

211
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,220
She had to have put
some kind of a spell on him.

212
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,380
I'm looking for it in the original
Greek, if possible. Certainly.

213
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,839
You do? Excellent.
Could I get a quote on that?

214
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,599
Give me her name. Someone will check.

215
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,269
See if we can find out
if she's a witch.

216
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:42,390
Hot blond 3-7-1-5-9.

217
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:48,140
I got these off e-mails I took
from Jerry's computer.

218
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,720
It's gonna--

219
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:54,349
It's gonna be pretty difficult
to find her based on this.

220
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,230
Just follow Jerry.
He'll lead you right to her.

221
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,990
Ms. Frakes here wants us...

222
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,900
...to stake out her fiancé.

223
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,400
I was trying to explain--

224
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:09,240
We can spare someone to watch
Ms. Frakes' fiancé. Gunn?

225
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,400
If witchcraft is involved,
we should look into it.

226
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,640
- What's up?
- Gunn.

227
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,180
Ms. Frakes needs surveillance.

228
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,950
- If you're free.
- Sure.

229
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,680
She'll fill you in.

230
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,809
- I'll leave it in your hands.
- Sure thing.

231
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,380
We won't let you down.

232
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,150
Maybe they should just do it.
Get it over with.

233
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,210
I'm sorry?

234
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,059
Cordy and Groo.
She's being noble for the team.

235
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:43,589
She should just com-shuk.
That's what she wants.

236
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,569
- May I help you?
- Yes.

237
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,000
Here for Grammaticus'
Third Century Greek Commentaries,

238
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,200
- The GTCGC, I'll be just one moment.
- Thank you.

239
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:55,519
I mean, why not, you know?
Life's short.

240
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,730
Okay, not mine, but most people.

241
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:02,890
If Groo does it for her, she should go
for it. Make him and her happy.

242
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,470
Everybody happy.

243
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,579
Still...

244
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:12,529
...office romance complicates things.

245
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,569
What if they have a row,
or break up?

246
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,140
All of us fight with each other.

247
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,569
It's not like anybody else is having a
romance. It won't change things much.

248
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,769
Well...

249
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:29,299
...she said it.
Could risk the visions.

250
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,369
Yeah, okay. So the visions pass to
Groo. He gets them instead of her.

251
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,609
So what?

252
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,490
Are you suggesting Groosalugg
could replace Cordelia?

253
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,000
Maybe not Cordelia.

254
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,059
I see. You think he could replace you.

255
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:54,079
Yeah.

256
00:19:57,049 --> 00:19:58,309
I don't know.

257
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,819
Seems to me, here's a guy
who can do everything I can...

258
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:05,609
- ...and a few things I can't.
- That's not true.

259
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:11,009
You saw it this afternoon.
If Groo hadn't been there--

260
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,339
Then the rest of us would have.

261
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,240
Angel...

262
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:20,470
...you're the reason
we've come together.

263
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:23,579
It's your mission which animates us.

264
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:26,440
We each contribute, it's true.
But you....

265
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,690
You're unique.

266
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,700
You're like a rare volume.
One of a kind.

267
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,029
I got three of them.

268
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,430
- Are you sure?
- I am sure.

269
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:53,599
Good. Don't worry. I practiced plenty
on my cousin Timmy when we were kids.

270
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,670
It's not like your strength
is in your hair or anything, right?

271
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,619
No, I believe it is in my muscles.

272
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:08,470
Okay. So we'll lose
the Battlefield Earth hair.

273
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,160
Get you out of those animal skins,
and it'll be a new you.

274
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:17,500
And will this new me be one
that you can allow yourself to love?

275
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,809
What?

276
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,609
Will the new me please you in ways
the old me could not?

277
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,559
It's a haircut.
It won't make me like you better.

278
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:32,539
Oh. I understand.

279
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:43,509
You didn't give up your throne and
come this far for a makeover, did you?

280
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,470
You came for something
I can't give you.

281
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,809
Me.

282
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,799
It's not that I don't want to. I do.
I've never met anyone like you, Groo.

283
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:05,039
You're so open and sweet...

284
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:09,240
...and there is a definite thing here.
It's just--

285
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,720
You are afraid that with me,
you will be less than what you were.

286
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:51,000
Looks like this is it.
Better get the camera.

287
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:55,940
Do you really think he's possessed
or under some spell?

288
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,259
It's hard to say.
There's all kinds of magic.

289
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:04,329
You got demon love spells,
mojo sex chants, voodoo booty rituals.

290
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,569
Voodoo booty rituals?

291
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,720
You're making that up.

292
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:17,599
Then there's the all-powerful
big, brown, soulful eyes kind of magic.

293
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:20,539
Kind of familiar with that one myself.

294
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,160
We should....

295
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:29,960
Right, because we're
all about the work.

296
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:35,569
Maybe it's not magical, but chemical
when two people are attracted.

297
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:41,210
Maybe the DNA knows, and when it
finds it, nothing gets in its way.

298
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,390
- It just takes it.
- It does?

299
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:57,210
- Charles.
- Yeah?

300
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,319
We're not the ones
having a rendezvous.

301
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,180
- We're not?
- No. He is.

302
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:06,240
But he's cheating on someone.
We got a right.

303
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,279
I know,
but we're supposed to be working.

304
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:11,829
You're right.

305
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:14,690
Damn.

306
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:18,950
I'll get started
translating this material.

307
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:22,230
Wesley,
thanks for what you said before.

308
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,339
You put things into
perspective for me.

309
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:26,609
Glad I could.

310
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:30,740
While I believe having another
warrior might be an asset...

311
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,690
...the truth is, you and the Groosalugg
are two different people.

312
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,619
- Hello.
- Who look exactly alike.

313
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,990
- He's wearing my clothes.
- Good fit.

314
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:49,839
Where's Cordelia?

315
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,910
- Good, you're back.
- He's wearing my clothes.

316
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:57,920
What? Yeah, I didn't think you'd mind.

317
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:01,900
You guys are about the same size.
He's a little taller.

318
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,309
Looks great, though, doesn't he?
Angel, I need your help.

319
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:08,720
What happened?

320
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:12,210
- You had a vision.
- What?

321
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:17,990
No. It's nothing like that.
This is personal.

322
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,269
- What is it?
- I wouldn't ask...

323
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:28,150
...except, there's no one else I can
trust with this. Only you can do it.

324
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,250
Tell me.

325
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,210
You've done so much for me already.

326
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:47,210
- This is one more thing for the list.
- There's no list. You know that.

327
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,509
- Just tell me what I can do.
- I need you to help me have sex.

328
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,470
With Groo.

329
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,869
I realized something today.

330
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:23,109
It's not the threat of losing the
visions keeping me from being close.

331
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,410
It's me.

332
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:32,920
The visions are just an excuse.
I mean, there's always some excuse.

333
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,769
Right.

334
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,119
I am tired of being lonely.

335
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,509
- Yeah.
- So we worked it out.

336
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,630
- You did?
- Yes. It was something Wesley said.

337
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,549
A paranormal prophylactic.
And it got me thinking.

338
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:55,259
I can't be the only woman who loses a
supernatural gift through intimacy.

339
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,849
- Stands to reason.
- So I researched.

340
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,299
And anyway, I'm right.
There's a protective potion.

341
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:03,670
I take it and, bang, I can.

342
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,200
- A potion?
- Yeah.

343
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,920
This woman, Anita, is in the business.
Makes love potions, elixirs, etc.

344
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,440
She says she's got just the thing
at this address.

345
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:18,710
You want me to get this for you?

346
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,079
I got cash from my ATM. Nearly
cleaned me out, but it's worth it.

347
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:27,420
- So you and Groo can--
- Com-shuk like bunnies. You bet.

348
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,849
- Why don't you send him?
- I am sending him.

349
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,230
He insists on it.

350
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,269
- But that's why I need you.
- Huh?

351
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:38,359
He doesn't know this world.
He can't go to a demon brothel.

352
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:40,940
- I'm not crazy.
- Brothel?

353
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,400
You'd be safe there.
No woman will tempt you, right?

354
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:46,349
Right.

355
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,619
Are we ready?

356
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:52,630
I think so.

357
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,789
We're most grateful for your help,
Angel.

358
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:58,910
You have been a true friend.

359
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,410
Yeah.

360
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:06,589
There's nothing.

361
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,900
A lot of nothing.
How are we gonna explain this?

362
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,910
- We were macking and lost him.
- We didn't lose him so much as--

363
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,069
Okay, we lost him.

364
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:20,630
But his car's still here,
so he's gotta be close, right?

365
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:24,200
- I'm sure there's an explanation.
- The camera.

366
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,920
Yeah, maybe he saw the camera.

367
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:30,160
- Whatever happened, we got it on tape.
- Right.

368
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:37,009
- There he is.
- Press play.

369
00:28:41,329 --> 00:28:42,869
Well, that can't be good.

370
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,970
You have a great smile.

371
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:57,259
- So I love your outfits.
- I really wouldn't call them outfits.

372
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,390
- But you are together.
- Yes. Two champions here together.

373
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,759
Just getting the potion together.

374
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,470
- So I may com-shuk my princess.
- Just to reiterate, not the princess.

375
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,569
The room is enchanted.

376
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:25,569
Everything that happens in there,
every touch, emotion, desire...

377
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:28,789
...is extended for maximum pleasure.

378
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,480
I can check the schedule if you'd like
to bring someone special.

379
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:44,109
Just right in here.

380
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,089
Hello.

381
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,119
Fear not, friend!
We're here to save you.

382
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,119
Hey, get off!

383
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,329
Groo, I think he's happy there.

384
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:01,079
- As a slave?
- Don't judge me.

385
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:04,650
Come on. Sorry.

386
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:07,259
If you just give us the potion--

387
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,309
You brought cash?

388
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:20,589
Make sure you tell your princess
to drink it all at once.

389
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,299
I know why your earnest friend's here,
but why are you?

390
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,430
What's in it for you?

391
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:34,079
Angel, your coat is singing.

392
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,250
Hello.

393
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,089
What? Gunn?

394
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:42,529
I can barely hear you.

395
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:45,160
- Reception's not so great.
- Where are you?

396
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,809
- Under Plummer Park.
- Under it?

397
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,960
We tailed that woman's fiancé...

398
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:52,289
- Jerry.
- ...and we kind of lost him.

399
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:54,769
We found him, sort of.

400
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,460
Him and his date. Some
root-crazy, treelike demon-thing.

401
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,049
With what looks like a DSL connection.

402
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,210
He chats up the lonely online and
sucks them down for food.

403
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:10,039
- Maybe it gets its power that way.
- It has a joint jammed into him.

404
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,049
I think it's sucking
the life out of him.

405
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,369
Have you called Wesley?

406
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,930
We were hoping we wouldn't have to.

407
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:21,450
I don't understand.

408
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,920
- We didn't want to bother him.
- Bother him?

409
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:30,049
I'm not sure Wes could help us at
the moment. What we need....

410
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:35,069
Oh. Uh-huh.

411
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:39,130
Um.... It's for you.

412
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,519
I'm honored they
requested the Groosalugg--

413
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,759
I wouldn't say requested,
more like included.

414
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,029
- Here. Did you feel it?
- Something evil.

415
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:56,509
Easy. Slow down, champ.
We need to be very careful here.

416
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,890
You're right.

417
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:04,180
Will you keep this safe?

418
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:09,819
Fine. But we've just got to be,
you know, a little bit more...

419
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,849
...patient.

420
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:18,650
- Groo!
- Over here!

421
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:27,259
What are we gonna do now?

422
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,569
That's my shirt.

423
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,750
- Is it made out of wood?
- No, it's flesh.

424
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:45,430
Flesh I can deal with and kill.

425
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:50,119
Hacking it won't do any good.
It doesn't have any vital organs.

426
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:52,180
It uses people as batteries.

427
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,259
Draws power from them.

428
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,480
It's strengthening from Groo.

429
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,319
Really? Stronger?

430
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,109
- He can't be that great.
- He is the Groosalugg.

431
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,390
What do you think?

432
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:16,240
Honestly, is he really better
than other men?

433
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:18,819
- Magnificent.
- Really?

434
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:22,920
I'd say more like
magnificently stupid.

435
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,670
Because him with the beer
tap in his chest...

436
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:31,529
...and me just walking around.

437
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:35,200
I'm really getting tired
of the Groosa-worship.

438
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,289
Nothing personal.

439
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,720
Everyone makes such a big deal.

440
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:47,079
The Groosalugg's a champion, so rugged,
so emotional. See him in daylight!

441
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,029
But I'm smarter, stronger
and I pick out my own clothes.

442
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,589
Okay.

443
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,900
It's okay, no one's using my heart.

444
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,480
Kill you.

445
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,829
Sorry. Already dead.

446
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:14,050
- Vampire.
- Yeah. Did I mention that?

447
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,730
Cold.

448
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,639
It's cold in there.
But don't let that stop you.

449
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,760
- So cold.
- So dead!

450
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,849
How is he?

451
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:54,389
Pretty beat up, but still alive.
Thanks to you.

452
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,849
Yes, Ms. Frakes, we are too.

453
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,199
You're welcome.

454
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,690
Goodbye.

455
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:13,690
Ms. Frakes is very happy.
He saved her fiancé's life.

456
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,199
- So he'll be okay?
- Yes.

457
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,039
- That's good.
- Yes.

458
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,409
Good work.
You should probably get cleaned up.

459
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,869
- Yeah, good idea.
- Charles, a word?

460
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:37,519
- Good night.
- Good night.

461
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,289
What is it?

462
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:48,809
When it became more than a tryst,
you should've told me.

463
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,090
It happened fast.
It grabbed the guy and he was gone.

464
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,710
That's not what I meant.

465
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,369
Oh. You mean...?

466
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,360
I'm not so sure
that's any of your business.

467
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,659
No, you're probably right.

468
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,889
Still...

469
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,429
...she could get hurt.

470
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,920
- I trust that won't happen.
- What are you, her brother?

471
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,340
Apparently.

472
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,670
- Wesley, I--
- She chose.

473
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,550
It's just important to me
that she's taken care of.

474
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:43,909
She will be.

475
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,920
Good.

476
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:09,150
Sorry.

477
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,570
It's okay. It was already ruined.

478
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:16,340
I planned to rip it off him later,
anyway.

479
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:20,050
- You did get the potion?
- Yeah. We got it.

480
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,309
Well, this isn't so bad.
You heal almost as fast as he does.

481
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,670
- Princess, I have a confession to make.
- Groo.

482
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:34,769
What confession?
Did something happen at the brothel?

483
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,409
You were supposed to look after him.

484
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:42,039
Nothing happened.
Except your boyfriend here was...

485
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,780
...very brave and saved the day.

486
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,619
You did? You big hero!

487
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,570
No. I was reckless.
I put everyone in grave peril.

488
00:37:58,889 --> 00:38:00,610
Angel is the true champion.

489
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,949
- He saved us.
- Did you hear that?

490
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,210
Yeah, but--

491
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:11,150
How many guys would
give away the credit like that?

492
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:15,360
That is just so noble. The potion.

493
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,489
Let's get out of here.

494
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:21,010
See you.

495
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:24,079
Cordelia.

496
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,170
What?

497
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:36,219
What is it?

498
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,510
- What's this?
- Just some money I saved up.

499
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,170
Why? What for?

500
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:51,000
I did something for you tonight. Now
I want you to do something for me.

501
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:57,500
Don't come in tomorrow.
Don't come in for a couple of weeks.

502
00:38:58,889 --> 00:39:03,489
Take Groo someplace nice.
Someplace where there's sun.

503
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:06,820
You'd like that.

504
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:10,809
- Angel--
- Promise me.

505
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:15,650
Okay.

506
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:25,809
You sure you don't need
some patching up?

507
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,829
I'm good. Didn't hurt a bit.

508
00:39:56,489 --> 00:39:59,750
All right, now.
You get some rest, big boy.

509
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:04,619
Yes. You go to sleep.
Get you nice and tucked in.

510
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,250
Yes.

511
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:13,480
- Thanks for looking after him.
- Yeah, sure. You okay?

512
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:18,650
Yeah.

513
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,769
- Working late?
- Yes.

514
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:57,110
- You startled me.
- Oh, we didn't mean to.

515
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:02,440
- I thought I was alone.
- Yeah. So did I.
