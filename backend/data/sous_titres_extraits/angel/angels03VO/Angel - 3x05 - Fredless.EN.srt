1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,799
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:04,950
Fred disappeared five years ago.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,629
Cordy's in the Host's dimension.

4
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:10,250
They use you as a slave,
then your body gives.

5
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,009
- Fugitive?
- Oh, no!

6
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:15,400
Okay.

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,469
Handsome man saved me
from the monsters.

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,079
I love tacos.
Do they still have them?

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,399
The Host reads souls,
senses their futures.

10
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:26,910
Yes, but he can only do it
when they sing karaoke.

11
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,820
My club! Friends of yours, Gunn?

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,320
You wouldn't dare.

13
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:45,140
You were gonna toss in a Prothgarian
broadsword with a Sancteus dagger?

14
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:48,990
Let's see....
Long, metal, pointy. Yep.

15
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,210
Cordy, the purpose of an inventory--

16
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:55,030
That "purpose of an inventory"
speech again.

17
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,159
This wasn't my idea.

18
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:01,770
Angel keeps complaining that
the weapons cabinet is all different.

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,319
But who's the boss? You, or the guy
with the pancreas dagger?

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,939
What time is it?

21
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:13,000
6:24. For those of you
playing the home game...

22
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,950
...that's three minutes
from the last time you asked.

23
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,950
I'm sorry. I believe the more you're
aware of time, the slower it moves...

24
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,280
...which could make light-speed
travel possible, but--

25
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:28,310
He'll be back when he's back.

26
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,409
Now that she's alive again,
will they get back together?

27
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:38,609
- Angel and that girl with a goofy name?
- Fred, that's a difficult question.

28
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,310
I think it's fair to say no.
Not a chance. Never. No way.

29
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,390
Not in a million years.
And also nuh-uh.

30
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,019
You said he loved her.
Of course she loves him back...

31
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,810
...because he's strong and handsome
and he really listens when you talk.

32
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,620
If you go for that sort of thing,
why wouldn't it work?

33
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,329
Let me break it down for you, Fred.

34
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:10,909
Angel, I know that I am a slayer...

35
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,810
...and you're a vampire.

36
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,439
And it'd be impossible
for us to be together, but--

37
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,740
But....

38
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,780
My gypsy curse sometimes
prevents me from seeing the truth.

39
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,139
- Oh, Buffy.
- Yes, Angel?

40
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,539
I love you so much,
I forgot to brood.

41
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:39,280
And just because I sent you to hell
doesn't mean we can't just be friends.

42
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,050
- Or possibly more.
- Gasp! No! We mustn't!

43
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,090
- Kiss me.
- Bite me.

44
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:55,099
- How about you both bite me?
- You're back!

45
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,719
- How'd it go?
- Those two summed it up.

46
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,210
To be honest,
I don't want to talk about it.

47
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,840
But, Angel, we're your friends.

48
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,129
It's unhealthy
to repress stuff like this.

49
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,949
You need to share your pain.

50
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,580
Express those feelings
of grief and longing.

51
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:21,500
- Or the curiosity's gonna kill me.
- Oh, no. Wouldn't want that.

52
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,840
- I don't care at all what happened.
- Shut up, Fred.

53
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,180
Actually, you know
what I need right now?

54
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,960
Ice cream.
You wanna get some ice cream?

55
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,259
I like ice cream.

56
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,960
- Now we'll never, ever know.
- That's right.

57
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,729
This is the best night.
First, there's ice cream.

58
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,909
Then that monster jumps out
of the freezer and you're all brave.

59
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:59,030
Then we chase it into the sewers,
which are bleak, oppressive and homey.

60
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:03,300
- I could build a condo here.
- Glad you're having fun.

61
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,849
You think the monster wanted a cone?

62
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:09,520
Durslar beasts don't
usually come aboveground.

63
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:12,729
- They stick to the sewers.
- Lucky stiffs.

64
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,100
They lead lives of mysterious sewage,
while I'm boring old Fred.

65
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,500
Boring? That's not a word
I'd use for you.

66
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,939
Fine. "Nutty old goon-bird,
in her room, mooching off Angel" Fred.

67
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:29,350
I don't know how you put up
with me. I need flash cards to--

68
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,689
Pretty crystals.
Look, they're everywhere.

69
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,019
- It wasn't me!
- We must be near the Durslar's lair.

70
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,220
Why don't you head back?

71
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,779
But shouldn't we call Wesley
and the Army?

72
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,040
They're Faulknerian, lot of sound,
no fury. Can you find your way?

73
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:52,470
I think so.
128 meters back, eastward fork.

74
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,949
2O7 meters to the southward fork.
Hang a right 12 meters in--

75
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:00,550
I'm just being a big nerd again,
aren't I?

76
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,839
I'm gonna go now.

77
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:08,100
Are you sure you'll be okay?
I can stay with you.

78
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,740
- I'll be fine.
- You don't need me. Okay, bye.

79
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,350
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.

80
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,360
Okay. Bye, then.

81
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,060
Three-pronged Scythian death spear.

82
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,269
Category 6, weapons cabinet,
third shelf.

83
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,220
Back when I was a rogue
demon hunter, I used that spear...

84
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:29,029
...to pin down what I thought
was a small Rodentius demon.

85
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,250
- The poodle's owners weren't happy.
- Hurry and get a vision already.

86
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,579
Gunn, much as I'd love
to endure another...

87
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,209
...soul-splittingly agonizing
psychic invasion for your benefit--

88
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,439
- Yes! Yes!
- No!

89
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,810
Fred! God, I wish she wouldn't
leave her toys laying around.

90
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,829
Pretty wicked-looking toy.

91
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,120
I'll say. It almost looks like
a spring-loaded decapitation device.

92
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,660
Or it makes toast.
With her, you never know.

93
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:05,420
Excuse me.
Is this Angel Investigations?

94
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,480
- Yes. Can we help you?
- I sure hope so.

95
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,100
I'm Roger. This is my wife, Trish.

96
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,329
We're sorry to barge in
on your arsenal here.

97
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:21,860
- But we really need to talk to you.
- Of course. Step into my office.

98
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,899
I'm Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.
These are my colleagues.

99
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:31,930
- Hello. A pleasure to meet you.
- What can we do for you?

100
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:35,490
- It's our daughter. She's missing.
- Oh, no.

101
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,149
- Kidnapped by evil fiends?
- We're not sure.

102
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,560
- Was your daughter a demon worshiper?
- Of course not.

103
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,800
Could be a vampire.
Hard luck tracking those in this city.

104
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:52,750
But don't worry, we're detectives.
We can find anyone.

105
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,160
- We've already hired a detective.
- And he couldn't locate her.

106
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,079
He said she was staying here,
in your hotel.

107
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,139
Her name is Winifred Burkle.
We call her Fred.

108
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,970
- Fred's your daughter?
- Yes. You know her?

109
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,519
Is she all right?

110
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,639
She's fine. And out at the moment
with one of our associates.

111
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,649
Who is not an evil fiend or a vampire,
because they don't exist.

112
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,909
In case you're unfamiliar with
our L.A. gumshoe detective slang.

113
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,100
What happened? It's been five years.
Has she been here this whole time?

114
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,509
We've only known Fred
a few months, really.

115
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,169
You see, we found her in....

116
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,379
- A fit of depression.
- Fred was depressed?

117
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,519
- Mmm.
- Over what?

118
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,309
She had recently relocated
and was having trouble adjusting.

119
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,710
So how did you come to find her again?

120
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,940
- A month ago, we got a letter from her.
- With no return address.

121
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,000
She said she was fine
and to not bother looking for her.

122
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:23,909
Five years of not knowing
if your daughter's alive or--

123
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,710
- How could we let it go?
- We hired the PI.

124
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,299
He tracked her through an envelope?
We could do that.

125
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,480
Wait till you hear what happened.

126
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,759
These things don't put up a fight.
But this one....

127
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,100
I'm gonna have it mounted. Hello.

128
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,059
Angel, you're alone.

129
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,360
And you brought a prop
from your movie.

130
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,879
Angel makes monster movies.

131
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,240
Angel, these are Fred's
very normal parents.

132
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,679
Ah.

133
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:07,259
Fred has parents.

134
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:26,860
Well, it sure is nice
to meet you both.

135
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:31,269
Son, your prop is dripping.

136
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:38,820
Oh, yeah. This. Fake. You know,
a little glue, papier-mâché.

137
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,820
Possibly some lead.
So, Fred's parents....

138
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,029
We heard so much....

139
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:54,429
Well, sure is nice to meet you folks.

140
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:01,379
- No address on the envelope?
- No, none.

141
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:05,440
Do you know when Fred will be back?

142
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,769
Oh, me? Well, I sent her back here
right before I picked up that prop...

143
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,840
...so I'm sure she's up in her room.

144
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:22,460
Right now.

145
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,409
Fred?

146
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,820
She's not here.

147
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,659
No. She was.

148
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,200
This-- It's her writing.

149
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,330
But what does this mean?
It's just crazy.

150
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:48,740
We might have to call them
in sooner than we thought.

151
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:53,190
Guys, when was the last time
Fred ever left the hotel by herself?

152
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,970
Couple of weeks after never.

153
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:59,730
We want our daughter.

154
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,629
So, what's she running from?

155
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:29,139
There's just something
off about them...

156
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,929
...and I can't put my finger on what.

157
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:35,600
Fred must've returned,
seen her parents and--

158
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,179
Took off. Not a good sign.

159
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:42,090
She sent a letter. Can you see
her sneaking off to do that?

160
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,370
Sneaking off. Right.
Fred can barely tie her shoes...

161
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,539
...without Mr. "You're my big fat hero"
around.

162
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:51,129
You think I'm fat?

163
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,659
Unless it's a ruse to trick us
into letting them get close to her.

164
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,519
Making it seem like
she'd contacted them.

165
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,710
But if the letter's real,
she told them not to look for her.

166
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:06,230
- Fred never talks about her family.
- So where do we start?

167
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,990
Where would Fred go?

168
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,379
We could hit
all the local taco stands.

169
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,019
Joke. Kind of.

170
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,639
Come on, you guys. Think.
What do we know about Fred?

171
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,700
- Well, I knew about the tacos.
- She seemed comfortable in the sewers.

172
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,610
They're dark, cavelike. She felt safe.
I'll head back there.

173
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:34,440
She worked at the public library.

174
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:38,490
What about them?
We can't just leave them there.

175
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,480
What if Fred comes back?

176
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:49,509
- Is it time?
- Not yet.

177
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:54,399
We're gonna try a few places Fred
may have gone. Would you like to come?

178
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,309
All six of us? Wouldn't it
make more sense to split up?

179
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:00,700
Perhaps.

180
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,070
I'm gonna check my industry contacts,
so it'll be you five.

181
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,279
Industry contacts? What--?

182
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,600
Fred's not making movies, is she?

183
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:15,019
Movies? You mean--?
No! No, no. Of course not.

184
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,110
It's just that these contacts
know things sometimes.

185
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:23,169
- They're underground.
- Right. Shall we go?

186
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,450
- Call me as soon--
- Yeah.

187
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,750
Figures. Right when Judge Judy's
about to lay the smackdown.

188
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,669
I'm coming. I'm not deaf, you know.

189
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,750
Can't you read the sign on the door?
Se habla closed.

190
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:47,820
Fred, it's you. The bar is closed.

191
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:50,610
Good seeing you.
It's been fun. Bye-bye.

192
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:51,960
Row, row, row your boat

193
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,639
Turn the sirens down a notch,
would you?

194
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,230
All that fear and panic's
blowing out my fuses.

195
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,710
I'm sorry. It's just....
Something awful's happened.

196
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:06,279
Really? Wonder what that's like?

197
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:09,039
Oh, no. Was there another massacre?

198
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:13,830
Just the one. But massacres are
like sitting through Godfather III,

199
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,500
Once is enough.

200
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,799
I'm not--
I mean, I don't want to sound....

201
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,659
Why's it still like this?

202
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,700
Honey, I don't think you're here
to discuss interior decorating.

203
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,710
Am I wrong?

204
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,409
Now, what can I do for you?

205
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:41,919
I need cash. And I don't want to talk
about it. I'll sing if I have to.

206
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,100
Easy. Forget the singing, sweetheart.
Your aura's practically screaming.

207
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,190
You are in a bad place,
aren't you, doll?

208
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:56,299
You thought you could outrun them.

209
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:00,039
That maybe you were free.

210
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:03,740
But those old monsters
hunted you down.

211
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,860
I know why you're running away,
and you know what your problem is?

212
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:14,789
I'm not strong enough
to stay and face my fear?

213
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:17,929
No. You haven't run far enough.

214
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,480
Fred?

215
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:31,080
Fred, it's just me.

216
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,450
I'm alone.

217
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:40,070
Listen, whatever this thing is
with your parents...

218
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:44,000
...we can help you.

219
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,860
Fred?

220
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,299
Does Fred come to the library often?

221
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:02,139
Well, this was the first place
I ever saw her.

222
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:05,279
She loved the community library
back home.

223
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,460
Every day, I'd pick her up there
after my rounds.

224
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,730
A doctor. No wonder Fred's so smart!

225
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,769
- I drive a school bus.
- Oh.

226
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,329
I've actually never ridden
in one of those...

227
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,450
...but I hear they're very nice.

228
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:26,210
What does Fred do for you?
It strikes me as odd:

229
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,059
A physicist working
for a detective agency.

230
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,950
Well, Fred's gone through
some changes.

231
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:35,849
And whose fault is that?

232
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,069
We've checked all the floors.
Nothing.

233
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,190
So, what's next?

234
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,740
Give me one second to confer
with my colleagues.

235
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,859
I knew she wasn't here.

236
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,720
- If you know so much, where is she?
- The taco stand's not looking so bad.

237
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,609
Mr. and Mrs. Bickerson,
a little focus, please.

238
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:02,029
There is definitely
something going on with them.

239
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,990
So where do we go next?

240
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:10,329
Where would Fred go for help?
For guidance?

241
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,430
Fred?

242
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,279
Nothing to be afraid of.

243
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,259
What?

244
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:27,930
No. You?

245
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,630
The place where she'd go
for help and guidance?

246
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:39,289
And we call ourselves detectives.
I'll meet you there.

247
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,880
- Isn't this a lovely surprise?
- He's surprised?

248
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,599
I didn't even think
he owned terrycloth.

249
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,490
Such a small entourage tonight.

250
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,829
Gunn, why didn't you bring your
friends? Because they make a party.

251
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,049
Maybe I should wait outside.

252
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,700
You know, I'm not entirely
uncomfortable with that suggestion.

253
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:07,029
- What kind of a place is this?
- Do you like it?

254
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,549
I was going for a
Dresden-after-the-bombing sort of feel.

255
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,869
Is this your industry contact?
Some guy wearing makeup and fake horns?

256
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,990
They're not fake.
And it's only eyeliner.

257
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:23,690
Lorne, meet Fred's parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Burkle.

258
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,519
They're here visiting,
from the country.

259
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,269
Forgive us hicks down in Texas.

260
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,779
We don't get guys who wear eyeliner.
Not for long, anyway.

261
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:36,819
He's teasing.
He just got back from a shoot.

262
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:41,930
He and Angel do monster movies
together. Right, Lorne?

263
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,869
Uh.... No.

264
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,190
Can I talk to you for a second?

265
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,970
Some detectives. You have no idea
where our daughter is, do you?

266
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,319
Maybe they do.
Maybe they don't want us to find her.

267
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,029
I'm sorry about the bar,
but Fred's missing. We need help.

268
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:09,670
Really? I'm not some mystical vending
machine here to spit out answers.

269
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:13,140
I have a heart.
Granted, it's in my butt...

270
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,140
...but it's still a heart
and it's broken.

271
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:18,720
Why is it no one cares
about my destiny?

272
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:21,819
Everyone here is all about me, me, me.

273
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:25,099
What about my me? My me's important.

274
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,019
- You know where she is, don't you?
- Another thing.

275
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,549
How do they get the pimientos
in the olives, huh?

276
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,430
Do they stuff each one by hand?
That's time-consuming.

277
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:42,000
Or do you think they have
a little pimiento-stuffing machine?

278
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,259
Fred doesn't want to see her parents.
She has reasons.

279
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:53,480
- Why force a showdown?
- Because it won't be over.

280
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,519
They found her, they'll do it again.
We can be there to protect her.

281
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,680
Please tell me where Fred is.

282
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:10,099
- I know you're not a slot machine.
- Vending machine, you big palooka.

283
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:16,309
All right, but play
this one delicately, bro...

284
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,740
...because it's gonna get messy.

285
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:22,289
I can do this. Sure, I can.

286
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,750
I can get on that bus
and be a whole new person.

287
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:31,039
Like origami. Plastic.
Move someplace I've never been.

288
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:36,900
No money, no friends, no job.
Easy as pie.

289
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,079
3.1415926--

290
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,240
Oh, hey, I was just
calculating pi to relax.

291
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,460
I'm not dangerous.

292
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,009
I could go to Vegas.
Learn to play blackjack.

293
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,230
Memorize 452 consecutive digits of pi,
a few hundred cards should be easy.

294
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,309
Nine, ten, jack, queen, king....

295
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,400
- No.
- Fred?

296
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:09,509
No, you're not here! Go away!

297
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:10,930
Honey, it's us.

298
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,769
You're not them. You can't be.
They don't know!

299
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,119
- It's Mom and Dad.
- Stop saying that. You can't be.

300
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,529
Don't you remember us?

301
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:25,349
I was five years and so lost--
And at night I would....

302
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,019
I was all by myself,
and you weren't there!

303
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,430
I don't understand.

304
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,089
I got lost, and they did
terrible things to me!

305
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:41,130
But it was just a storybook. It was
just a story with monsters, not real!

306
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:47,369
Not in the world, but--
But if you're here and you see me...

307
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,609
...then it's real, and it did happen!

308
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:56,420
If you see what they made of me!

309
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:59,460
I didn't mean to get so lost!

310
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,839
Honey, it doesn't matter
what they did to you.

311
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:05,920
- Mommy.
- We're gonna make it all right.

312
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:09,970
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I got so lost.

313
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,750
- It don't matter. You're our girl.
- I missed you. I didn't mean to.

314
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,190
Everything's okay now. You'll see.
You're safe now.

315
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,170
- Tell me that's from the movies.
- No, that's gonna kill us.

316
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,960
- Everybody outside.
- Angel.

317
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:41,250
Get them out of here.
I can handle this. Move!

318
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:42,339
Let's go!

319
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,250
- What the hell is that?
- Our weapons aren't here!

320
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,900
Angel said he could handle...

321
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:54,730
...it.

322
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,630
- Maybe in the trunk.
- What's with his face?

323
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,180
Angel's a vampire. It's a long story.
I'll tell you if we don't die.

324
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:06,769
Here!

325
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,700
Hey! Bug boy!

326
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:36,519
Get out of here!

327
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,759
That's my daughter,
you damn cockroach!

328
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:47,420
Here, baby. Come on, come on.

329
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:14,029
Did I get it? Did I get it, y'all?

330
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,819
You do a lot of bandaging
in your line of work?

331
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,990
Occupational hazard.

332
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:29,059
Sure, there's the occasional demon,
who tries to kill us with pillows...

333
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,420
...but sadly, those cases are rare.

334
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,960
How about him? Was he a demon?

335
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:38,549
I think Angel called it
a Durslar beast.

336
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,900
He and Fred tracked it down
when they went for ice cream.

337
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:45,369
You know how to track these things?

338
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:48,900
No. Mostly I was just there
for the ice cream.

339
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,569
I wish you didn't bring it out.
I have the willies.

340
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:55,920
Don't be silly.
It's just a severed head.

341
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,849
I got it. Lady makes bug soup
with a bus...

342
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:03,329
...but show her a papier-mâché head
and she gets the willies. Women!

343
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:08,160
Gunn, you do know
it's not papier-mâché.

344
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,660
We still got that bleach
in the bathroom?

345
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:21,049
I gotta say, this is not
how I pictured this turning out.

346
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:24,480
They look happy.

347
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:28,319
Voilà! That's French for
"I think we stopped the bleeding. "

348
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:32,869
- Thanks, Cordelia.
- Next up, multiple stab wounds. Angel!

349
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,380
That's my turn.

350
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,630
What a dork.

351
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:44,529
How does it feel?

352
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:49,349
Like my heart's been put in one
of those orange juice squeezers and--

353
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:55,269
Kind of like a giant bug tried
to rip my arm off, and Angel saved me.

354
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:59,480
- He does that a lot, doesn't he?
- It's what he does.

355
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:05,269
Angel's the champion, and
Wesley's the brains of the operation.

356
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,460
And Gunn's the muscle
and Cordy's the heart.

357
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,529
And I'm....

358
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:21,329
To think, we were gonna call
the police on a bunch of superheroes.

359
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:25,180
- I'm not a hero.
- More like a bloodsucking fiend.

360
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,740
I don't care if you drink
pig's blood, cow's blood...

361
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,940
...or those froofy imported beers.
You saved my girl.

362
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,900
I wouldn't have had to if she hadn't
whacked it with a club.

363
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:41,660
I hadn't seen a stroke like that since
Nicklaus took on Player in the '63...

364
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,230
...Bob Hope Desert Classic.

365
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:48,900
- All right.
- I wanna go home.

366
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,569
I'm just not cut out for this.

367
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,779
If Angel hadn't gotten me
out of the way...

368
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:08,240
...you'd all be laughing
in the morgue right now.

369
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,660
Okay, maybe not laughing, but....

370
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:18,460
But the point is, I think I should
go home, where it's quiet and safe...

371
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:21,579
...and monsters don't eat your family.

372
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:31,279
You're not disappointed
in me, are you?

373
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:34,150
Oh, Fred.

374
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:39,779
Never. Oh, it's going to be so good
to have you home.

375
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,789
She'll probably be happier there.

376
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,589
Yeah. That's good.

377
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,119
Angel. Hi.

378
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,019
I invite you in.

379
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:10,930
You only have to do that
the first time.

380
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:14,319
I know. I just figured
since I'm going home now...

381
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:18,589
...I'm not gonna be inviting
you in anywhere.

382
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:22,480
Unless, of course, you come to Texas.

383
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,470
Or if you build that condo
in the sewer.

384
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,950
- So how you doing?
- Oh....

385
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,890
Fizzy.

386
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,720
Kind of weird and fizzy.
But excited.

387
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:45,309
A little sad. Thankful.

388
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:50,000
Sort of cautiously happy.
Relieved and worried at the same time.

389
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,180
Slightly nauseous,
while still hopeful.

390
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,619
Well, that about covers it.

391
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,859
- Will you remember everything up there?
- Sure. It's a story.

392
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:17,730
Once upon a time, there was a girl who
lived all alone in a horrible cave...

393
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,079
...so far from home
that it made her chest hurt.

394
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:28,259
Every day in that horrible cave, she
tried to figure out a way to escape.

395
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:32,250
None of her plans ever succeeded,
of course...

396
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,710
...and she'd almost given up hoping...

397
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,990
...when one day...

398
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,730
...just like in a fairy tale...

399
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,559
...a handsome man rode up
on a horse and saved her...

400
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:51,309
...and took her back to his castle.

401
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,400
Now, you'd think that was
the end, wouldn't you?

402
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:02,920
Dumb old fairy tales and their
"happily ever afters. "

403
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:12,480
But, see, the minute
they got back to the castle...

404
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,940
...the handsome man went away again.

405
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:21,900
And even though she didn't
mean to and want to...

406
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:28,289
...high up in that castle, the girl
just built herself another cave...

407
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,779
...hoping that he would
save her again.

408
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:39,410
But you can't save me this time...

409
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:42,319
...can you?

410
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:50,930
Rog likes those disgusting alien
movies with all that slime and teeth.

411
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:54,220
He just can't get enough of them.

412
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:59,160
Except for that last one they made.
But I just can't believe it's all real.

413
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:04,200
I don't know about aliens. But demons
and alternate dimensions, I know.

414
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,509
Takes getting used to.

415
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:10,700
I'm so glad Fred's coming home.
This place is too dangerous.

416
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,420
Honey, would you look at this?

417
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,720
- Fred made this.
- Cool, ain't it?

418
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,259
It's a mechanized weapon.

419
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:23,019
Influenced by the medieval catapult,
designed for outright decapitation.

420
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:26,200
- Or it makes toast.
- Or it makes toast.

421
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:31,950
You got everything packed? What about
the shirt with the bug guts on it?

422
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:35,730
You threw that out?
You're not taking it home?

423
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,799
I don't know. Kind of thought
I'd take it with me, guts and all.

424
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,940
- You know, as a souvenir.
- That's my girl.

425
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:51,539
In the shower, I had all these
pretty things I was gonna say.

426
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:54,329
I was gonna be all fancy and....

427
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:56,250
Oh, hell.

428
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,829
I mean, heck.

429
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:19,839
Between you and me,
I'm almost a little jealous.

430
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,329
Thank you.

431
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:35,869
For everything.

432
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:44,839
Bye, Fred.

433
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:51,789
We better go before I get all runny.

434
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,389
Your room is just the way you left it.
Except for the guy renting it.

435
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,949
- But his lease is up in a month.
- You rented out my room?

436
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,949
After the fourth year,
we heard nothing from you.

437
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,480
Daddy, I was kidnapped
into an alternate dimension.

438
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:22,989
Well, she was.

439
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:31,880
I'm just gonna miss them.

440
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,719
Turn the car around!

441
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,670
In a really weird way,
you know who I miss?

442
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,579
Fred.

443
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,030
Actually, I was going
to say her parents.

444
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,550
Is that wrong?

445
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,510
I don't think so.
They were very nice.

446
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:56,130
Nice?

447
00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:00,780
- They weren't just nice. They were....
- Parents.

448
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:06,780
They loved her. Supported her.

449
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:12,500
Didn't grind her down
into a tiny self-conscious nub...

450
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,260
...with their constant berating...

451
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:19,800
...and their never-ending tirade
of debasement and scorn and....

452
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,659
At least now Fred's got
a shot at a normal life.

453
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:34,519
Not that I don't love you guys
and L.A. and my work...

454
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:40,449
...but things are just never normal
around here, you know?

455
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,119
She was so smart.

456
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,949
I'm gonna miss her.

457
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:01,039
She was just this nice,
quiet kind of crazy.

458
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,820
I found that soothing.

459
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,420
And what? I'm not soothing?

460
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:12,409
I can be soothing.
I could soothe your ass off, pal.

461
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:16,150
Plus, she was pretty handy
with a five iron.

462
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,110
Right before she almost got killed.
Personally, I'm glad she's gone.

463
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,840
It's gonna be a load off...

464
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:29,380
...not having to worry
about crazy taco lady anymore.

465
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,829
She'll come back to visit.

466
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,739
Do you really think
she'll come back and visit?

467
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,969
Well, that's it.

468
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:47,230
I'm not gonna sit around here
and mope like you bunch of mopers.

469
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,420
I'm gonna go home...

470
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,929
...eat some comfort food...

471
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:57,230
...have a good cry,
crawl under my big, fluffy--

472
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,699
Giant bug!

473
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,809
We hit it with a bus.
A bus won't kill it?

474
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,349
I don't think it's the same one.

475
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:12,409
- We are so immensely dead.
- Weapons.

476
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,989
- Angel, we--
- I'm here!

477
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:27,449
- Fred?
- I'm late. Okay.

478
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,849
- Who's helping me here?
- I am.

479
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:59,210
So, not a toaster.

480
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,789
Fred, how did you--?

481
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,840
The crystals in the sewer.
They were on the Durslar head too.

482
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,570
I thought they came from the Durslar,
but then I saw this. Daddy.

483
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,929
Those crystals are dried-up bug goop.

484
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:17,530
It laid eggs in the Durslar's head,
so the Durslar came out.

485
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,289
Wouldn't you be crazy if you had eggs
in your head? I know I would.

486
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:27,510
That'd be fine, except Angel killed
the Durslar and brought the head here.

487
00:38:28,449 --> 00:38:31,360
So the bug tracked him down
to get its babies back.

488
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,789
- And when Trish ran over the mother--
- Or father.

489
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,860
It might be a hive species, gender-
neutral, but I'd have to do research.

490
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:43,360
The whole hive came
to reclaim its offspring.

491
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,900
Brilliant deduction, Fred.

492
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,369
And that little ax gadget is tight.

493
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:54,469
That was just a random thought.
What if you had to battle without arms?

494
00:38:55,449 --> 00:39:00,579
Sure, you'd hemorrhage to death, but
you could take your enemy with you.

495
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,380
- Nice going, Fred.
- Oh, it was nothing.

496
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,130
Just a stunning revelation
of my true path in life.

497
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:12,099
Come again, honey?

498
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:15,239
Look.

499
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:20,949
I could go home with you and pretend
the last five years didn't happen.

500
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:25,429
I might even pretend
to have a normal life.

501
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:30,440
But the truth of it is, well,
I'm not normal anymore.

502
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:40,079
I guess what I'm getting at is...

503
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,309
...I missed you both so bad.

504
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:49,110
But I belong here.

505
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,300
Unless I don't, which if you all
don't want to put up with me--

506
00:39:54,849 --> 00:40:00,150
Let's vote. All in favor say aye. Aye.
Motion passed. Good, you're staying.

507
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:05,710
Mama.

508
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,320
Daddy.

509
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,719
This is my life now.

510
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:14,460
We were hoping you
wouldn't figure that out.

511
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,159
Course, we'll stick around
for a couple of weeks.

512
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:19,929
Daddy.

513
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:25,739
Days. You know.
Just to catch up and get reacquainted.

514
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,489
And to make sure that you are
positive about your decision.

515
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,920
I think I know where I'll end up.

516
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:43,480
- Spiro Agnew. I know he was a--
- Grathnar demon. You knew that?

517
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,210
- I thought I was the only one who knew.
- What else would he be?

518
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:53,190
- Not horizontally, vertically.
- Vertically, you get those ugly drops.

519
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:56,760
I don't want to hear
any fighting over there.

520
00:40:57,409 --> 00:41:00,389
- Okay.
- Did someone order pizza? Fred, pizza?

521
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,940
In a minute.
I just want to finish this section.
