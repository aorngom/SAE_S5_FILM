NARRATOR:
<i>Previously</i>:

2
00:00:02,373 --> 00:00:04,489
CORDELIA: The fire,
blotting out the sun...

3
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:07,042
...those were the first steps
to something bigger.

4
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:09,363
Connor, we're having a baby.

5
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:12,245
- Gwen.
- Hi, there.

6
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:13,687
- What are you?
- I'm a freak.

7
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:16,083
Move! There we go.

8
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:17,288
Angelus.

9
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:21,651
- I'm telling you, I don't know this Beast.
- But Angelus might. We need Angelus.

10
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:24,208
Angelus.

11
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:27,286
There's something bigger.
The Beast has a boss.

12
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:28,926
[ANGELUS WHISTLING]

13
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:31,725
LILAH: He's gonna kill us.
- I know.

14
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:35,964
Why do you think I let him out?

15
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:40,729
Killing Angelus is the only way
to guarantee our family's safety.

16
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:44,929
Connor, it's over. It's me.

17
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:46,851
- We're back.
- It would seem.

18
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,890
ANGEL: I know things...
CORDELIA: Sorry...

19
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:52,608
...but if this is the speech
about how the worst is behind us...

20
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:55,492
...you may want to save it for later.

21
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:01,082
CORDELIA:
I know it's a bit of a shock.

22
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:05,081
I mean, nobody's more shocked than me.
Okay, maybe him.

23
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:13,171
Um, sorry to be so...

24
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:18,486
But I'm, like you said,
kind of shocked.

25
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:24,051
Yeah, because hasn't it only been like...?
Definitely shocked.

26
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:27,444
I haven't been hiding
or ashamed or anything.

27
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:30,969
It's just with the Beast
and his psycho master...

28
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:34,682
...and then Faith and Willow
and all that dramarama.

29
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:37,606
- Not to mention...
- Angelus?

30
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:42,803
Everything's just been
so <i>Clash of the Titans</i> around here.

31
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:47,248
I didn't want to be a distraction.

32
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:51,172
Well!

33
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:55,087
Put me on the short bus
and send me off to clueless school.

34
00:01:55,253 --> 00:02:00,964
A mystical pregnancy right under
my beak and not even a tingle.

35
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:02,970
Huh.

36
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:05,047
How long have you known?

37
00:02:05,413 --> 00:02:08,291
Some time after we
brought forth Angelus.

38
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:11,126
That's a couple weeks.
Looks more like eight months.

39
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:15,167
The last time Cordelia was impregnated,
she came to term overnight.

40
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,886
That was a crawly, evil demon thing.

41
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:20,887
This is different.

42
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:25,484
Still, shouldn't we try
and find out what's in there?

43
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:27,206
We already know.

44
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,724
Our baby.

45
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:34,525
Well, congratulations.

46
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,411
You're gonna have a grand-spawn.

47
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:38,570
You don't know what it's like.

48
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,212
How scary it is.

49
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:46,126
I'm gonna have a child, and all you
can do is joke because you don't like me.

50
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:50,523
We shouldn't have told them.

51
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:57,883
- Cordelia.
- I know it's hard to understand.

52
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:01,769
None of you have ever had a living being
growing inside of you.

53
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:05,085
And this...

54
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:09,005
...my sweet baby...

55
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:11,250
We're connected.

56
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:15,965
I feel what it feels, and I can't explain it,
but I sense its goodness...

57
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,171
...its love.

58
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:29,892
You'll see.

59
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:35,083
My baby will be here soon,
and then you'll all see.

60
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,252
Players

61
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,132
How'd you do that?

62
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,166
I'm a thief. Got my stuff?

63
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,610
Would you stop it?

64
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:04,327
- Stop what?
- Acting shifty.

65
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:08,728
You've never done this before,
have you?

66
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:12,004
Let me give you a tip, sugar bear.

67
00:05:12,173 --> 00:05:14,812
There are over 8 million
people in this city...

68
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:18,329
...as far as anyone can tell,
we're two of them, just a normal couple.

69
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:21,809
Nobody's gonna give us a
second look if you stop acting shifty.

70
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:25,886
Look, these are very powerful people
that you're going up against.

71
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:28,892
- Lf they catch you, they'll kill...
- I know the risk.

72
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:31,362
But I'm going in there
with or without your help.

73
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:34,007
And I'm not coming out without Lisa.

74
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:39,293
So are we gonna dance, or what?

75
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:51,369
That's everything.
Security, blueprints, background.

76
00:05:54,373 --> 00:05:57,365
There, wasn't so bad, was it?

77
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,531
So is it that obvious?

78
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:10,212
- That I've never done...?
- Trench coat, definite rookie mistake.

79
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:13,888
So I should dress more like you?

80
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:21,889
You know, maybe when this is all over,
you and I could...

81
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:23,924
[THUNDER ROLLS]

82
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:26,886
Holy!

83
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:33,002
Really, I'm fine.

84
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,409
Thanks for asking.

85
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:42,972
Were we too harsh?
I was just asking.

86
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,723
No. They were bound to skulk off
to neutral corners.

87
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:48,042
Two vampires hook up...

88
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:51,364
...and for the only time in vamp history,
have a kid, our boy Connor.

89
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:55,526
Connor grows up, knocks it out with
Cordelia, part-demon, former high being.

90
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:59,692
Quick as you can say Easy-Bake Oven,
there's a gigantic bun in hers.

91
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,525
I don't think we were too harsh.

92
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:05,169
The first time Connor tried to attack
Angelus, Lorne's sanctuary spell...

93
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,962
...knocked him to Abilene.
- Which means Connor is part-demon.

94
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:12,324
Yeah, well that was before my
spell went all flop-a-palooza.

95
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:16,327
Having two part-demon parents
might explain the "whoosh" factor.

96
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:18,802
Not gonna be long until
"whoosh" turns into "pop."

97
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:23,808
Speaking of pop, don't you think our
leader should be part of this confab?

98
00:07:24,493 --> 00:07:29,726
Easy-Bake, flop-a-palooza,
whoosh, pop. I don't skulk.

99
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:35,002
I've been thinking
about the past few weeks and Angelus.

100
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:38,251
Angel, you can't feel guilty
for anything Angelus did.

101
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:40,723
I don't. I knew the risks.

102
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,446
We all did.

103
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:45,408
Some of us paid
a higher price than others.

104
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:50,331
Angelus didn't kill Lilah.

105
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:55,202
She was already dead,
killed by the Beast.

106
00:07:57,453 --> 00:08:00,968
Well, that's less terrible.

107
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,483
There's no excuse...

108
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:06,690
...for what Angelus did to her...

109
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:09,929
...but I'm sorry for your loss.

110
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,926
We got two pressing matters:

111
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:19,729
Figuring out Cordelia's pregnancy
and destroying the Beastmaster.

112
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:22,532
- Lorne, you're...
- Reliable as a cheap fortune cookie?

113
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,803
I was gonna say
a guy with good contacts.

114
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:27,084
Must be rumblings
about the new player.

115
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:30,404
Talk to your sources.
See if anyone knows anything.

116
00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:32,285
- I'm your demon.
ANGEL: Fred, Wesley.

117
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:35,644
If there's experts on mystical births,
we're it.

118
00:08:36,013 --> 00:08:39,688
We'll pull the files on Darla and her
pregnancy, see what we can find.

119
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:42,248
Gunn, I want you to sit tight for now.

120
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:44,244
Never hurts to have muscle on deck.

121
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:48,765
In the meantime, has to be a reason
why the Beastmaster wanted Angelus.

122
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:50,406
I'll piece together what I know.

123
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,081
Things he said when he was
in my head, everything.

124
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:56,086
- Maybe something will...
GWEN: Strike you?

125
00:08:57,813 --> 00:09:00,611
Careful what you wish for.

126
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,931
Well, look who's back,
now that the lights are on.

127
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:05,811
Oh, missed you too, babe.

128
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:08,851
Gwen, it's really not a great time
for a social call.

129
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:11,049
We're pretty swamped. You know...

130
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,325
...Apocalypse.

131
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:18,685
The thing is, there's a girl,
she's in trouble.

132
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:21,402
- That's what you guys do, right?
- Well, yeah.

133
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:23,370
I'm in a jam.
Can't get out of it alone.

134
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:26,923
I need someone suave, a guy
who can handle himself in a tight spot.

135
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,127
- Gwen, I'd love to help...
- I meant him.

136
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:48,807
I've been looking all over for you.

137
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:55,850
Connor...

138
00:09:56,373 --> 00:10:00,491
...what they said,
you can't let it bother you.

139
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:02,723
- I don't care what they say.
CORDELIA: Really?

140
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:06,290
That why you retreated
to the Fortress of Solitude?

141
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,723
It doesn't make sense.

142
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:14,169
Freaking out over pregnancy is the m.o.
With the gang around here.

143
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:18,970
Not them. You.
All that stuff you said about Angelus.

144
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,802
And Willow,
she didn't open a gate to evil...

145
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:25,409
...she put back Angel's soul.
I almost killed him.

146
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:29,927
But you didn't. Angel's back,
everything worked out.

147
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:34,327
Everything happens for a reason,
even if it doesn't always seem that way.

148
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:37,048
- How can you say that?
- Think about it.

149
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:39,602
You sinking Angel
to the bottom of the ocean...

150
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:44,205
...being kicked out of the house, me not
knowing who I was and coming to you...

151
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:48,004
...all of those moments
and a million others led to this miracle.

152
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:50,602
But sending me down to the basement?

153
00:10:51,253 --> 00:10:54,404
I had the stake.
What was the reason for that?

154
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:57,725
I thought our baby was in danger.

155
00:10:57,893 --> 00:11:03,365
All my instincts told me that killing
Angelus was the only way to protect it.

156
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:08,567
But you were wrong.

157
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:19,491
What's important is when I needed help,
you were there for me.

158
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:27,444
Now I know I can trust you completely,
no matter what.

159
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:32,007
See? Everything happens for a reason.

160
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:45,284
Connor, before our baby comes,
I might ask you to do some things...

161
00:11:45,493 --> 00:11:47,131
...for us.

162
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:51,211
And I want you to remember...

163
00:11:51,893 --> 00:11:54,168
...there's always a reason.

164
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:58,244
I'll remember.

165
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:08,811
So why me?

166
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:12,124
I told you,
I need a suave guy in a tight spot.

167
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:16,286
Suave.
You been collecting these for a while?

168
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:20,241
Yeah, I get one each trip. Just brought

from Boyle Heights...

...piece of vamp stake I picked up
in Alhambra...

She's the daughter of the guy
who hired me.

- Of what I did.

to save her and I can't do it alone.

He's the head of the company I tanked.

00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:13,007
Don't you, Mr. Gunn?

335
00:23:13,173 --> 00:23:17,291
Something seems to be coming,
just ain't so sure I'd call it wonderful.

336
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,405
Uh, If you'll excuse me.
Gwen, you're not gonna...

337
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:26,372
- What is it?
- They're gonna kill her, tonight.

338
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:28,452
Not gonna happen.

339
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:31,002
We have to act fast.
You get Lisa and get out.

340
00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:33,249
- You mean, "we" need to?
- No, I mean you.

341
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:36,450
I'm going over there to create
one hell of a distraction.

342
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:40,208
By the time they figure it out,
you'll have her halfway to my place.

343
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:41,692
This is our one shot.

344
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:45,523
Like I said when I signed up,
it feels good to be doing good.

345
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:49,641
Okay, work your way over there.
Wait for my signal.

346
00:24:23,373 --> 00:24:26,843
Oh, my God. Somebody's trying
to hurt that little girl.

347
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:29,811
This is Bravo 9,
we have a situation in progress.

348
00:24:39,973 --> 00:24:42,203
Hang in there, we're almost out.

349
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:02,292
Now you did it.

350
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:06,412
I'm gonna have to get your lame-ass
blood all over my sweet, new suit.

351
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:44,128
I spent the last couple of weeks...

352
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,729
...whacking on a giant lava demon
and more vamps than I can count.

353
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:51,488
Almost forgot how good it feels
to just let off a little steam.

354
00:26:03,293 --> 00:26:05,363
All right, let's get you out of here.

355
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:11,170
- It's okay. I'm here to take you home.
- I am home.

356
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:16,804
- No, you've been kidnapped.
- Get out of my house.

357
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:20,566
Your name's not Lisa, is it?

358
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:24,687
I'm Aiko Morimoto. And when my daddy
finds out you tried to hurt me...

359
00:26:24,853 --> 00:26:26,844
...he's going to kill you.

360
00:26:39,053 --> 00:26:41,009
- It's you.
- It was the scanners, wasn't it?

361
00:26:41,173 --> 00:26:43,209
Why you wanted me.
Angel, no heartbeat.

362
00:26:43,373 --> 00:26:46,012
Security scan of a dead guy
might raise eyebrows.

363
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:49,569
For about five seconds, I thought
you might care about something.

364
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,963
So what if I didn't tell you
about my plan?

365
00:26:52,173 --> 00:26:56,610
So what if set you up for a fall? When's
the last time you had this much fun?

366
00:26:57,453 --> 00:26:59,523
I saw your face.
You were having a great time.

367
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:02,526
- It's because I thought I was doing good.
- You were.

368
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:06,163
Just not the kind that involves
saving a princess from an evil king.

369
00:27:06,453 --> 00:27:09,206
- So Lisa doesn't exist?
- Yes, she does.

370
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:13,366
I'd have liberated her from this steel
tomb by now if you'd stop yapping.

371
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:18,807
It's a military acronym.
Localized Ionic Sensory Activator.

372
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:22,688
- L-l-S-A.
- A weapon? Lisa's a weapon?

373
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:25,613
Not a weapon,
a covert device worn by black-ops.

374
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:28,333
Regulates body temp,
heartbeat, body chemistry.

375
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:32,168
Morimoto's company designed it, and
I've been hired to steal the beta test.

376
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:35,370
- God bless America.
- Actually, China or North Korea.

377
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:38,809
Not really sure. Morimoto's selling it
to the highest bidder.

378
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:41,168
And who are you stealing it for?

379
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,927
Look, there are two things
that make me a good thief.

380
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:46,891
I steal what I'm paid to,
and I don't ask many questions.

381
00:27:47,053 --> 00:27:48,452
Well, good luck with that.

382
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:53,481
Nothing's changed. Morimoto's
still a bad guy, you're still a good one.

383
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:57,089
I can't believe I took time
out of the Apocalypse for this.

384
00:27:57,373 --> 00:28:01,969
Even the pres takes vacations.
Besides, they need you, they'll call.

385
00:28:04,413 --> 00:28:08,611
Come on, we started this together.
Let's finish it the same way.

386
00:28:09,053 --> 00:28:11,851
- It's not the same.
- You can keep the suit.

387
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:29,410
You know, this would be a lot easier
if you two weren't hovering.

388
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,050
- No rush.
- Take your time.

389
00:28:35,853 --> 00:28:38,367
I think that's it.

390
00:28:38,573 --> 00:28:40,131
CORDELIA:
What's it?

391
00:28:40,293 --> 00:28:41,965
Passage from Lilah's beastie book.

392
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:45,762
The one Angelus destroyed after the
big voice threatened to re-ensoul him.

393
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,731
Angel's been visualizing the text,
trying to re-create it.

394
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,168
Just, you know, a little thing I can do.

395
00:28:52,253 --> 00:28:54,244
You think there was
something in that book...

396
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:56,404
...that High-and-Spitey
didn't want us to know?

397
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:57,728
He's hiding something.

398
00:28:57,893 --> 00:29:01,408
I recognize the text.
It's early Fallorian code system.

399
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:07,052
Let's see.
"The green cartlike vehicle...

400
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:08,652
...eats...

401
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:13,847
...I am not a buckethead."

402
00:29:14,893 --> 00:29:17,088
- Damn it!
- It's a tricky language.

403
00:29:17,293 --> 00:29:20,012
An inverted serif can alter
the meaning of a passage.

404
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:23,411
- What now?
- I try again.

405
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:41,443
- Crap.
- No, this is the easy one.

406
00:29:50,013 --> 00:29:51,287
We're out of here.

407
00:29:51,493 --> 00:29:53,723
- We should split up...
- No, we're not doing that.

408
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:57,568
- Either we both make it out or...
- Neither of us do.

409
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:06,005
Try this one.

410
00:30:08,013 --> 00:30:11,483
Something about strangling poultry.

411
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:18,404
- That's it. I gotta get out of here.
- Easy does it, <i>compadre</i>.

412
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:21,565
No huffy exits before
I spill the joyous news.

413
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:23,451
- About the baby?
- About <i>El Jefe</i>?

414
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:28,284
No and no. My sources got nothing
on mystical birth and/or the Big Kahuna.

415
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:31,048
But Wanda,
that demon you recommended...

416
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:37,163
...what a peach. She sold me a cleansing
abracadabra to clear my muddled mind.

417
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:39,171
You're empathic again?

418
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:43,406
Please. You think this Dungeons and
Dragons cloak is a fashion statement?

419
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:46,691
- I gotta do this whole song and dance.
- We're getting nowhere.

420
00:30:46,853 --> 00:30:50,084
- Lf you need extra hands.
- Sorry, I can only take my two.

421
00:30:50,253 --> 00:30:52,323
Ritual has to be performed solo.

422
00:30:52,493 --> 00:30:56,884
Just me and my shadow,
secluded in a dark, dusty nowhere-land.

423
00:30:57,253 --> 00:31:00,245
But the upside is,
I will be all systems go come sunrise.

424
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:03,331
- Then you'll be able to read me?
- No worries, dumpling...

425
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:08,487
...come morning, I will be a lean,
mean, belly-reading machine.

426
00:31:12,173 --> 00:31:14,846
Put that on the desk and step away.

427
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:20,290
- Set it down now.
- No.

428
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,801
I don't think you realize
who you're up against.

429
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:27,050
If it's those two girls,
I already kicked their ass once.

430
00:31:28,693 --> 00:31:31,810
But when you put it like that...
Maybe we should.

431
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,531
I won't give it back.

432
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:35,771
I can't.

433
00:31:36,413 --> 00:31:38,847
- I'm not dying for this.
- I'm finishing the job!

434
00:31:39,013 --> 00:31:41,243
- We're busted.
- I'm not leaving without it.

435
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:43,927
- Then you're not leaving. Finish it.
- Give it to him.

436
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:45,964
- No, I need it.
- I said, finish it!

437
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:47,532
It's mine!

438
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:06,486
Liar.

439
00:32:07,013 --> 00:32:10,528
You're not stealing it for someone else.
It's for you.

440
00:32:10,693 --> 00:32:12,570
You think it'll fix you.

441
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:26,013
LORNE:
Oh, fudgicle.

442
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:59,248
Back where he belongs.

443
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:01,883
I gotta give you credit.
You are stubborn.

444
00:33:02,253 --> 00:33:06,451
- I know what I want.
- I get that. At least I used to.

445
00:33:06,613 --> 00:33:09,650
- Things aren't so clear anymore.
- You seemed pretty clear tonight.

446
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:13,005
Adrenaline rush,
when I was trying to save that girl.

447
00:33:13,173 --> 00:33:15,562
I meant when you were saving me.

448
00:33:16,213 --> 00:33:17,931
Hey, I'm just the muscle.

449
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:21,763
Don't knock the muscle, buddy.
Makes the girls go knocky in the knees.

450
00:33:22,453 --> 00:33:25,365
If that's all you were, we couldn't
have gotten into that party.

451
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:29,328
You would've gotten in. The damage
would've been significantly higher.

452
00:33:29,493 --> 00:33:31,563
Thanks to your
brains-over-brawn approach.

453
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:34,287
Not so much brains
as too many movies.

454
00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:39,529
Man, they have done a number on you.
You believe this "I'm the muscle" crap.

455
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,691
- This your version of a pep talk?
- Could be. Need one?

456
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:46,568
- No.
- Good. Not my area of expertise.

457
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:51,644
So why do you stay,
if that's all they see in you?

458
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:55,005
I'm a fighter, born and raised.

459
00:33:56,853 --> 00:33:58,684
You love being a thief?

460
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:01,170
I'm a freak.

461
00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:04,327
Being a thief
makes me part of something...

462
00:34:04,493 --> 00:34:06,927
...and not a part at the same time.

463
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,441
Tonight...

464
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:10,964
Yeah, kind of loved it.

465
00:34:12,453 --> 00:34:14,728
You know, for someone loving life...

466
00:34:15,093 --> 00:34:17,323
...you seemed awfully willing
to die for this.

467
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:22,613
What you saw tonight,
that's as bad as it gets.

468
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:24,764
But even at its best...

469
00:34:26,253 --> 00:34:28,403
That thing might let me be...

470
00:34:29,173 --> 00:34:32,006
Well, not normal, but...

471
00:34:32,213 --> 00:34:34,681
Hold hands maybe.

472
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:40,762
So, yeah, guess I was willing to die,
or even...

473
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,371
- You wouldn't understand.
- Sure I do.

474
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:47,729
Brainy, remember?

475
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:55,052
You want to show
me how this thing works?

476
00:35:17,653 --> 00:35:19,564
How you fire it up?

477
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:22,686
It's not an X-Box.
Just put it on.

478
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,846
Careful.

479
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:31,252
Ow.

480
00:35:32,453 --> 00:35:34,284
Like I said.

481
00:35:41,853 --> 00:35:43,491
It's chilly.

482
00:35:46,493 --> 00:35:49,007
[HUMMING]

483
00:35:51,493 --> 00:35:52,482
What's it doing?

484
00:35:52,813 --> 00:35:55,611
You ever see one of those
body-snatcher movies?

485
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:02,923
Feel any different?

486
00:36:03,173 --> 00:36:04,845
Yeah.

487
00:36:06,293 --> 00:36:08,170
Not so much.

488
00:36:24,613 --> 00:36:26,683
I think it worked.

489
00:36:33,413 --> 00:36:35,165
It feels good.

490
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:40,165
So...

491
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:42,164
...if you couldn't touch...

492
00:36:43,653 --> 00:36:46,087
...guess that means you've never...
- Nope.

493
00:36:48,093 --> 00:36:49,412
Nope.

494
00:36:51,653 --> 00:36:53,405
Anyway, um...

495
00:36:53,573 --> 00:36:56,087
...thanks for turning me...

496
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:57,811
...off.

497
00:36:58,813 --> 00:37:00,690
