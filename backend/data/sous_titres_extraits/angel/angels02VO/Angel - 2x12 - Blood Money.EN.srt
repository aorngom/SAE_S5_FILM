1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,819
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:11,300
- For God's sake, help us.
- People are going to die.

3
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:13,320
I just can't seem to care.

4
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:16,670
Holland Manners is dead,

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,609
Angel....

6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,130
- What you did is wrong.
- You went too far.

7
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,409
The three of us are all that's standing
between you and real darkness.

8
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,390
You're all fired.

9
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:52,729
- You think I don't have what it takes.
- I know you don't.

10
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,689
I guess we'll just have to find out.

11
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,310
Go on, English, make your move,
because it'll be your last.

12
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:16,170
Now I rule Europe, Australia
and South America!

13
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,049
I still got Kamchatka.

14
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:21,219
Three-fifths of the world is water,
the rest is me.

15
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,849
Who's your ruler, baby?
What's my name? Say it.

16
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,459
Fun as it is having you guys over day
and night, it's getting kind of late.

17
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:35,790
- It's only 7:30.
- Really? Oh, in that case...get out!

18
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,650
- What if you have a vision?
- I'll call.

19
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:42,890
- What if Angel--?
- We're not saying the "A" word.

20
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:46,310
Don't say the "A" word,
but wait for him to call.

21
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,769
We're not waiting for him to call.
He fired us.

22
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,409
We're a separate unit,
fighting the good fight.

23
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:57,540
Right. With no plan or office
or business cards.

24
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:00,359
He's never gonna call, is he?

25
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,849
The first thing we're scrapping:
these stupid calling cards.

26
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:10,490
They are not stupid. I designed them.

27
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,259
- That's an angel.
- The symbol of what we don't have.

28
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:19,270
That's an angel? Looks like
a lobster with a growth or....

29
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,530
- We'll make our own logo.
- Yes. Something sleek, but edgy.

30
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,139
- That says: "You need us, we're here."
- Exactly. "Danger is our business.

31
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:33,189
- We'll catch you when you fall."
- I like it.

32
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,000
Guys.

33
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:40,740
- Easy. Breathe. Breathe.
- What is it? What'd you get?

34
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,939
It has two heads and it breathes fire.
It's gigantic...

35
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,340
...and it's rising up in the sewers
beneath Kenyard School for Girls.

36
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,930
Don't go alone!

37
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:07,379
- Sorry.
- It's me. I didn't hurt you, did I?

38
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,360
- I'm fine.
- I couldn't see over the box.

39
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:15,360
I was rushing. I'm late for work.

40
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,050
You do clown work?

41
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:22,840
No. Just some old clothes
that got donated.

42
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,379
East Hills Teen Center.

43
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,960
It's on the box.

44
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,500
Oh. Right.

45
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,490
You missed one.

46
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,810
Hold on. Sorry.

47
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,129
Okay, I think I'm good.
I'm really sorry.

48
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:48,889
- No problem.
- They're for the kids.

49
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,219
There's always a feeding frenzy
when a new batch comes in.

50
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,550
- You work with runaways?
- Some of them.

51
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,830
Some are from around here
with nowhere to go.

52
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:03,919
We give them food, clothes,
somewhere to stay.

53
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:08,050
That's good that someone's--
Well, it's good to do.

54
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,159
- Well, I'm late.
- Right.

55
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,550
See you around.

56
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,439
- So it's big.
- Big.

57
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:58,660
- Fire-breathing.
- Breathing.

58
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,290
- Big, two-headed, fire-breathing--
- We have the picture.

59
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,779
He shouldn't be attending
the Kenyard School for Girls.

60
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,500
- I wouldn't mind having--
- Don't say it.

61
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,670
We don't.
It's no good wishing we had him.

62
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:16,339
- I was gonna say, some dynamite.
- Oh.

63
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,329
Dynamite.

64
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,959
Maybe it's not too late
to go back--

65
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,569
Oh, God.

66
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:37,730
The tunnel's 20 feet tall.
He was crouching.

67
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,110
We'll take another look,
and then we'll--

68
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,839
Die.

69
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:51,699
Wait, wait!
Wait till his back is turned.

70
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:53,439
Now!

71
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,439
I thought she said he breathed fire.

72
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:08,319
Evening, Merl.

73
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,300
What do you want, man?
I ain't inviting you in.

74
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:15,439
Demon lairs. No invite needed.

75
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:18,829
- But it's polite--
- You avoiding me, Merl?

76
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,829
I ask you for a favor, and you're
avoiding me. That's impolite.

77
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:29,410
Nearly drowning me and leaving me
in a sewer ain't exactly Emily Post.

78
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:32,980
So we're both rude.
Do you have the information...

79
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,199
...or must I see what the inside
of that head looks like?

80
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:38,759
Fine!

81
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,899
I checked out the girl. She's clean.

82
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,560
Changed her name twice, but no record.

83
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,139
- Her connection to Wolfram & Hart?
- She runs a shelter on Crenshaw.

84
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,569
Recently, they almost
lost their lease.

85
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,589
Wolfram & Hart step in,
clear it all up pro bono.

86
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,819
- But she's still working for them.
- You know so much, why ask?

87
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,689
Why do you need me?

88
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:08,720
What happened to that
hot chick working for you?

89
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,600
- Pro bono. It's gotta be an angle.
- Always is.

90
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,540
But as far as I could tell,
the shelter itself is strictly legit.

91
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:24,139
- Hey, what about my hundred bucks?
- Know what? I'll owe you.

92
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,879
Just make sure you use it
for some new furniture.

93
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:31,100
Beanbag chairs?

94
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,840
Merl....

95
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,019
What am I supposed to do?

96
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,029
Say no. Benny knows the rules.
He's not coming in here drunk.

97
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,179
Turn him out. Don't listen to him.

98
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:57,279
- Hey. Guy I ran over.
- Hey. Girl who ran over me.

99
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,549
- You can call me Anne. It's shorter.
- Angel.

100
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:06,000
- I don't know if they're good--
- That's great.

101
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,649
We can take them over here.

102
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,389
Well, let's see. What do you got?

103
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,200
Well, that's not what I expected.

104
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:19,870
- Doesn't fit anymore?
- Cuts me across the bust.

105
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,809
A friend left her clothes at my place.
I won't see her anytime soon....

106
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,740
- Ex-girlfriend?
- God, no.

107
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,990
I mean, just "no."

108
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:36,450
We really appreciate this.
Every little bit helps, you know.

109
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,139
- I just wish I could do more.
- Well, if you're not in a hurry....

110
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,129
You up for a tour?

111
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,009
Here's the vibrant nerve center
of our huge corporation.

112
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:51,710
Well....

113
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,429
- It's....
- Small.

114
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,639
I know. But I'm hardly ever in here.

115
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,429
You just come in for naps?

116
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,309
Oh, the bed.

117
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,570
Sometimes I'm here so late,
it's just easier than going home.

118
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,950
So, what do you think?

119
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,700
Amazing.

120
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,230
- You say it runs on donations?
- Every last penny.

121
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:23,259
Gotta be tough.
I mean, trying to stay ahead.

122
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,990
- Thankfully, we have a guardian angel.
- Guardian angel?

123
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,190
Wolfram & Hart, a law firm.
They've been a godsend.

124
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,070
Bailed us out of an eviction.
Defended some of our kids.

125
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,919
- They sound like saints.
- As far as I'm concerned.

126
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,120
- They came up with the Big Holdup.
- Holdup?

127
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,799
It's a fundraiser for the center.

128
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:51,210
Big TV celebrities pretend to rob
the guests of their donations.

129
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,360
- Wild West theme. It's gonna be big.
- Wolfram & Hart's picking up the tab?

130
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,250
They're donating everything.
Music, food....

131
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,669
- And they know all the TV stars.
- That's not surprising.

132
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,919
It's good for their image, I guess.
And it's a pretty dorky theme.

133
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,659
- But, hey, whatever it takes, right?
- Right.

134
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,899
- Does anybody knock?
- You Merl?

135
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:28,669
Merl? Merl who?

136
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:31,320
No, the name's Ed...Silverman.

137
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,340
- You're Angel's lackey.
- No. No, I'm not.

138
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,799
- Independent contractor.
- And what do you do for him?

139
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:47,019
- Pictures. Ow! I take--
- Pictures.

140
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,740
Surveillance, you know. Dig up dirt,
check people out for him.

141
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,610
Not that he appreciates it.
Who the hell are you, anyway? IRS?

142
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:03,320
Angel and I have a history.

143
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,669
An unfinished history.

144
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,009
That's nice. What, did you guys
go to college together?

145
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:15,169
These people you check out,
who are they?

146
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:18,490
Friends? Enemies?

147
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,740
What does Angel care about?

148
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,669
Last thing he had me do was follow
some chick who did charity work.

149
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:29,580
Why?

150
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,980
Well, between you and me,
it ain't about the girl.

151
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,460
- It's Wolfram & Hart.
- What's a Wolfram & Hart?

152
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:41,370
A law firm, technically.

153
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,539
More like Evil, Incorporated.

154
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:48,980
Lately, he's been gunning for them.
Especially these two lawyers.

155
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,320
Tell me about the lawyers.

156
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,220
Lilah. I just had to drop by and
congratulate you on your promotion.

157
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,710
Co-vice president of Special Projects.

158
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:30,820
That's super.

159
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:36,320
You deserve it.
Yeah. That, and so much more.

160
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,779
- Angel--
- You know what the special part is?

161
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,539
To think that maybe, in my small way,
I helped make it happen for you.

162
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,370
Makes me feel all good inside.

163
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,659
Angel, I can assure you...

164
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:56,679
...now that Lindsey and I are in
a position to affect policy...

165
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,629
...things will change.

166
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:03,600
Change? Well, yeah,
because I get it now.

167
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,480
"It"?

168
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:09,029
The game. It's actually fun
when you know the rules.

169
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,519
I mean, when you know
that there aren't any.

170
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,250
You screw with me
and you screw with me...

171
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,289
...and you screw with me.

172
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,500
Now I get to screw with you.

173
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,899
- That's gonna be great.
- Please--

174
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,450
No, no.

175
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,490
The begging, that comes later.

176
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:41,429
- He was in my car.
- Yet here you are, still alive.

177
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:44,259
- He was trying to spook you.
- It worked.

178
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,500
Relax. He doesn't kill
humans personally.

179
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:52,580
- He's not playing by the old rules.
- Mr, McDonald, your 10 is here,

180
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:57,059
- I don't have a 10:00.
- I'm not gonna tell him that,

181
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,830
- Sorry, but I'm afraid I'm--
- Shut the door.

182
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:14,789
- Won't you come in, Mr...?
- Call me Boone.

183
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,690
- Are you the better half of this team?
- I like to think so.

184
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,429
We run Special Projects.
Do you have a special project?

185
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,159
More like a grudge.
With a fella named Angel.

186
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:39,000
I haven't seen Angel
since Juarez in the '20s.

187
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:44,019
We had a little disagreement
over a señorita,

188
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,169
I called him out.
We fought for 3½ hours.

189
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,610
Obviously, both of you survived.

190
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:56,440
I'd been working on a three-day drunk
at the time. I wasn't at my peak.

191
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,490
- How did it end?
- The sun came up. I let him go.

192
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,570
- You let him go? Why?
- The sun came up.

193
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,029
It would have been too easy.
You people know anything about honor?

194
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,990
Anyway, life is long
when you're eternal.

195
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,600
Always knew I'd cross his path again.

196
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,139
And behold,
I'm in a karaoke bar downtown...

197
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:28,669
...when I get wind
of this lizard demon, Merl...

198
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,080
...who sometimes does favors
for the vampire with a soul.

199
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,220
I find Merl, and he tells me...

200
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:39,860
...that Angel's planning
on bringing you two down.

201
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,409
- Did he mention how?
- Don't know, don't care.

202
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,940
All I do know is,
when Angel comes for you...

203
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,259
...he's gonna find me instead.

204
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:57,220
I like the "finding you instead" part.
How much do you charge?

205
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:01,389
This isn't about money.
It's about knowing.

206
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:05,720
- Knowing what?
- Who's better. Him or me.

207
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,599
If you're talking about murder,
we can't help you.

208
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,809
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

209
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,859
- Of course.
- Thank you.

210
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,910
Bring him onboard.

211
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,500
Don't forget the senior partners
want him alive.

212
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:28,920
So?

213
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,250
What if this guy's as good
as he says and actually kills Angel?

214
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,339
Boo-hoo. Let me wipe away the tears
with my plastic hand.

215
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,400
Napoleon, we're partners.
Your plan explodes...

216
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:47,230
- ...we both end up in tiny pieces.
- Want Angel in your back seat again?

217
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,359
If he won't play by the
old rules, why should we?

218
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,589
- It's huge.
- We were getting stomped.

219
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,750
I'm thrown into the sewer--

220
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,339
You come back stinking, cursing.
The mouth on this boy.

221
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,680
Gunn hits from behind, yelling,
"Look at us when we kill you!"

222
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:10,299
- Both its heads turn!
- Wes sinks his ax into head number one.

223
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,789
Gunn stabs him, pulls out
intestines the size of your leg!

224
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:19,509
- We turned him inside out.
- You weren't scared?

225
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,420
Mother in heaven.

226
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,799
Pants-wetting, ask-God-to-save-you
kind of scared.

227
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:31,299
- But you did it.
- No. We did it. All of us.

228
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,420
- All of us together.
- To us.

229
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,890
- To us.
- To us.

230
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,380
I did something.
I hope you guys don't mind.

231
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:50,009
I started looking for an office
for our new agency.

232
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:53,859
- Our new agency?
- Our new agency.

233
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:57,599
There's this little place nearby.
It's not much, but--

234
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:00,670
- Why are we still here?
- Let's go.

235
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,740
- Our new agency.
- "The Wyndam-Pryce Agency."

236
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:07,619
- The what?
- You don't like it? It's classy.

237
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:12,140
It's stuffy. "The Chase Agency."
That has the right ring.

238
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,970
- Why?
- Because it's my name.

239
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:17,900
There's only one player here
with the name...

240
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:20,650
...that strikes dread
in the demon heart.

241
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,809
Gunn? Oh, yeah, that's so original.

242
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:27,960
I've got a gun, and my name is Gunn!

243
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,460
- "Wyndam-Pryce" says it all.
- Shut up!

244
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,380
You gotta be kidding me.
I swear I didn't rat on you, Angel.

245
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,579
- I didn't say nothing to the guy.
- Shut up, Merl.

246
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:11,059
Jeez, does everybody know
where I live?

247
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:14,789
- Gotta get myself a new lair.
- Merl, Lilah.

248
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,410
Now that we're past the pleasantries...
You do favors for Angel?

249
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,579
- What are those favors?
- I don't go selling out my pals.

250
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,109
- How much you gonna pay?
- I think you'll find our offer...

251
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:32,839
- ...competitive.
- I would have taken a credit card.

252
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:36,380
Down, Fluffy. Jeez!

253
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:44,839
- Lately, I've been following a girl.
- What girl?

254
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:11,009
Hello?

255
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,160
Is anybody out here?

256
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,430
Anne.

257
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,279
You startled me.
What are you doing here?

258
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,470
I have to talk to you.

259
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:29,460
Oh, boy. You're not
stalking me, are you?

260
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,130
Actually, I am.

261
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,650
Excuse me?

262
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,220
These are pictures I've taken of you.
Surveillance photos.

263
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:46,640
I took your wallet when we
accidentally ran into each other.

264
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,369
- It wasn't an accident.
- I'm calling the police.

265
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,500
I won't hurt you.
I couldn't lie to you anymore.

266
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:59,099
- About being a psycho?
- I've been following you...

267
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,349
- ...but it's not why you think.
- You have a reason?

268
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,579
Wolfram & Hart aren't saints.
They don't care about your shelter.

269
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,589
- You're following me--
- I've checked.

270
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,710
They'll use you for good PR,
offer to host a fundraiser.

271
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,700
Money starts rolling in,
but you're not the one counting it...

272
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:21,549
...so who knows how much
they're keeping?

273
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:25,009
Next, they'll give you
a list of necessary expenses.

274
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,490
But what do you know,
after a number of untraceable fees...

275
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,529
...you're left with 5 percent, tops.

276
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,930
You follow me, take my picture,
steal my wallet....

277
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,410
- Why should I believe you?
- Wolfram & Hart aren't what they seem.

278
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:46,039
They show the world one face,
but it's not the truth.

279
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:49,859
I can prove it.
Everything they say is a lie.

280
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,900
I guess you have something in common.

281
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,230
- Lindsey.
- Are you all right?

282
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:58,259
- Fine. I--
- He didn't hurt you, did he?

283
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,000
Had I known he was contacting you,
I'd have come sooner.

284
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,180
I'm just thankful
that I got here in time.

285
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,369
A little over the top.
Work on that look of concern.

286
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:12,309
- He's dangerous.
- You haven't seen anything yet.

287
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,109
Neither have you.

288
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,950
- It's been a long time.
- I brought some protection.

289
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:24,759
Boone. Working for Wolfram & Hart.

290
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,470
- I thought you had integrity.
- I do.

291
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,730
Here's fair warning.

292
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,529
- Wait.
- He's getting away.

293
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,359
As long as he's not threatening
my client. Soon, but not here.

294
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:20,769
Go to the car. I'll meet you there.
He won't be back tonight.

295
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,819
It's okay. Angel's gone.
You're safe.

296
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,109
That guy who beat up Angel,
he wasn't human.

297
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,180
See, there's a different world that--

298
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,569
- I'm not naive.
- Angel's not human. He's a vampire.

299
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,119
He's a sick, deranged--

300
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,640
He says you're gonna steal
most of the funds.

301
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:53,630
Well, he's lying.
I mean, there are expenses.

302
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,950
You know how it works
with any charity event.

303
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:00,339
- But we don't steal.
- He says he has proof.

304
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:05,910
He's lying about that too.
Who are you gonna trust?

305
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:08,809
A mentally unstable vampire...

306
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,250
...or the people that put the
fundraiser together for your kids?

307
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:17,910
I'd hate to see them lose out
because you made the wrong choice.

308
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,690
So he doesn't have proof?

309
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,160
He can't have proof.

310
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,609
- He's got proof?
- Maybe.

311
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:28,359
- She said he had proof.
- It'll be okay.

312
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:32,730
Sure, we only schemed to steal
$2 million from a teen shelter.

313
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:37,069
- How did this happen?
- If he's got proof, it's from you.

314
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,319
- Me?
- You talked and it's on tape, probably.

315
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:43,180
You have the professional death wish.

316
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,250
How do I know you're not
on a kamikaze mission?

317
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:50,519
I only talk to you in my office,
which is swept for bugs.

318
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,119
- I never discussed stealing in public.
- Until now.

319
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,599
The bastard got us on tape.
What'll he do with it?

320
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:01,890
He's gonna use it to humiliate us.

321
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:04,990
He's gonna send it to the news.
National coverage--

322
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:07,930
- It's not personal enough.
- What, then?

323
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,500
- He's gotta be there.
- What? Why?

324
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:12,900
To see us swing, that's why.

325
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,740
With the bosses there, watching.

326
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,569
It's me. I want security
at the charity ball doubled...

327
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:28,009
...and put a vampire detector there.

328
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,079
- I thought you'd show up again.
- You all right?

329
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:46,369
A monster didn't pound my face,
so I figure I'm better than you.

330
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:51,349
- What did Lindsey say about me?
- That you were a bad man.

331
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,759
A bad man?

332
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:58,059
A psychotic vampire who cut off
his hand, harassed his firm...

333
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:01,759
...and is schizophrenic.
I gave you the short version.

334
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:04,799
Do you believe that?

335
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:09,529
You're a vampire for sure.
A human would be in the hospital.

336
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:12,890
And that doesn't frighten you?

337
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,069
Before, it'd have been a turn-on.

338
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:21,069
- I thought vampires were the coolest.
- What happened?

339
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,589
- I met one.
- You're not afraid of me.

340
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,990
I've seen worse things since.

341
00:27:28,569 --> 00:27:33,140
Saw a 14-year-old sit in blood after
a rough trick, people just walking by.

342
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,589
Vampires, demons, even lawyers
don't impress me.

343
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:41,430
Maybe you had good reason
to cut off Lindsey's hand.

344
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:46,549
I care about the shelter. If an evil
law firm will raise $2 million--

345
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,049
- You'll see only 5 percent.
- I did the math.

346
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:55,160
Five percent is $100,000. That's more
than we could raise in two years.

347
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,960
And the other 95%? You don't care
where it goes or who it hurts?

348
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:05,650
- I can't.
- There's blood on that money.

349
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:09,769
Are you a person who can ignore that?
Have you become that yet?

350
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:11,970
I don't think you have.

351
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:16,170
- You don't know what it takes--
- Help me.

352
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,880
Get me into the party. This'll show
a whole new side of Wolfram & Hart.

353
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,670
- Why should I?
- Because in the long run, it's right.

354
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:30,990
Most of my kids don't have a long run.

355
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,470
No.

356
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,549
I'm saying no.

357
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:56,859
The world can be dangerous, Especially
for our most vulnerable citizens;

358
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,920
Our children,

359
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:03,849
Far from home,
with little money or hope...

360
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:07,549
... too many runaways
find themselves on the streets...

361
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,119
...over their heads
and under society's radar,

362
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:15,849
But there's a place in L.A.
that can help these troubled kids;

363
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,099
The East Hills Teen Center,

364
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:27,170
It's a terrific refuge that
we at Wolfram & Hart support 100%,

365
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,650
- Lilah.
- Good evening, sir.

366
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:34,160
- Things progressing nicely?
- Well, it's a pretty simple formula.

367
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:39,990
The rich pay to touch the famous.
We film the not-quite-prostitutional act.

368
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:44,539
It goes into public consciousness as
a good deed, courtesy Wolfram & Hart.

369
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:50,609
It's really true. Charity gives
you this warm glow, you know?

370
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,230
Anne?

371
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,210
Meet one of my bosses, Nathan Reed.
Mr. Reed, this is Anne.

372
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:02,819
So this is the young woman whose
dedication brings us together tonight.

373
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:07,059
I try to help where I can.
Thank you for everything.

374
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,859
I think my job underlines
the "heart" in Wolfram & Hart.

375
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,829
Save some time for interviews.

376
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:18,740
- You're the public face of the charity.
- What a face it is.

377
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,609
Never underestimate
the power of positive publicity.

378
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,720
- He stays here. We forget anything?
- No, sir.

379
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,920
Every entry point's covered.
We're in radio contact.

380
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:34,980
If this vampire gets within 100 feet,
Zorn will let us know.

381
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,910
If he senses anything, alert Boone.

382
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,490
Can we really change the world?

383
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,109
At Wolfram & Hart,
we're counting on it,

384
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,539
Holland Manners is gone,
but he's looking down on us tonight.

385
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:55,599
Don't you feel it?

386
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,650
Holland had a vision of the future
most of us can't imagine.

387
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,250
Let's make it come true together.

388
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,940
Let's get started.
But not with a plea for money.

389
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:13,130
We're not gonna ask you for money.
We're gonna take it at gunpoint.

390
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,400
Welcome our celebrity bandits
from the show life lessons;

391
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:22,410
Serena Tate, Holden Raynes,
C.J. McCard and Jordan Johns!

392
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,019
Those are some nice duds there, fella.

393
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,089
Let's see that cash you got stowed.

394
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,589
Hey, cowboy, don't hurt me now.

395
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:43,769
My daughter from my first marriage
is a huge fan.

396
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,849
All posts report in, Over,

397
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:50,410
West gate clear,

398
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,789
Serena, I have to know.
Your character being gay...

399
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,990
...is that like all about ratings?
Because I don't get it.

400
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,099
No sign of your friend yet.

401
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,430
Angel.

402
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,839
I feared you wouldn't show.
Ready to finish this?

403
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,190
Thank you, wonderful stars
from life lessons...

404
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,769
...for giving so generously
of your time.

405
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:38,700
- I'm gonna kill my agent.
- And to all of you, our benefactors...

406
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,230
...let me just say that
we can change the world.

407
00:32:42,849 --> 00:32:47,269
With your support, we can make it
a safer place for all our children.

408
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,640
Stunts? This will take forever.

409
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,750
The makeup's fake.

410
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,799
You think we wouldn't
be ready for you?

411
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:18,589
Where's the tape?

412
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:23,069
- Where is it? Where's the tape?
- He doesn't have it.

413
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,160
- You okay? I tried to break the fall.
- I'll be fine.

414
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,599
- What the hell?
- Thanks for getting me in.

415
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,250
This place is like a fortress.

416
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,279
- What's going on?
- They're in it together.

417
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,730
- Me, I'm just here for the show.
- She's got the tape.

418
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:54,559
Watch it!

419
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,500
Be careful!

420
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,509
Excuse me!

421
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,339
- How do you turn it on?
- Give me!

422
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:06,660
It's not a toy,
It's for gathering evidence,

423
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:10,119
- Let go,
- You'll just play with it,

424
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,639
I give you two children, Bill,
and you leave me for a man?

425
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,849
No, don't speak, Don't say anything,

426
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,280
What is there to say?

427
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:26,699
- Interesting choice.
- I believe the coat rack more.

428
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,300
Mmm, Milk,

429
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,849
Mmm, Milk,

430
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:41,360
Mmm! Milk!

431
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,650
I don't get it, How am I not working?

432
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,730
What's happening?

433
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:55,780
Looks to me like you two
were acting like crazy people.

434
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,099
On camera too.

435
00:34:59,050 --> 00:34:59,920
Ouch.

436
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:06,130
Pryce, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce,

437
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:09,059
Isn't he dating Virginia Bryce?

438
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,309
- You don't have us on tape, do you?
- I got nothing.

439
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:24,719
You know how hard it is to record
someone as paranoid as you two?

440
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,909
- This whole thing was a setup.
- You hired Boone.

441
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:34,150
No, you did.
For a whole lot of money too.

442
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,239
The money!

443
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:40,010
Look out! Move!

444
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:41,460
- Look out!
- Move!

445
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,280
Come on!

446
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,159
- Damn!
- What happened?

447
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:50,960
- He stole the money.
- Who?

448
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,579
The cowboy.

449
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,760
How dare you? I risked everything.
I risked my kids.

450
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:04,610
- There was no exposé.
- They'd have covered it up.

451
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:07,510
I wanted to shake them up.
It's a start.

452
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,690
- And the money?
- The money was tainted.

453
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,329
- I don't care about--
- Yes, you do.

454
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:17,699
That's the difference between us.
You still care.

455
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:30,260
You embarrassed us all. You lost
$2 million earmarked for this firm.

456
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:35,019
Worst of all, you violated
company policy by hiring an assassin.

457
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:39,090
One who was, in fact,
in league with Angel.

458
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,329
- I'm very sorry, sir.
- Sorry isn't acceptable.

459
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,389
Holland Manners
was a brilliant lawyer.

460
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:49,289
Had a tremendous mind.

461
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,500
But he had a soft spot
for the two of you...

462
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:55,570
...which I believe
clouded his judgment.

463
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,429
- I won't make that mistake.
- Understood.

464
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:00,449
My advice to you:

465
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,300
- Start piling up wins. Fast.
- Yes, sir.

466
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:06,119
How do you expect us to succeed...

467
00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:10,630
...when you handcuff us with these
idiotic rules protecting Angel?

468
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:19,989
I'm sorry, did you say something?

469
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,300
He's an obstacle to all that we do.

470
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,760
Give me a good reason why
we can't kill him.

471
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:35,769
Because Angel is a major player.

472
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:40,289
- In business?
- In the Apocalypse.

473
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:42,800
Oh, that.

474
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,639
The prophesies say
when the final battle is waged...

475
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:48,829
- ...he is key.
- Good for him.

476
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:53,659
Which side he's on is the gray area.
We'll continue making it gray.

477
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:55,429
Works for me.

478
00:37:56,289 --> 00:37:59,480
Until then, his growing obsession
with the two of you...

479
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:02,730
...the increasing possibility that,
to scratch that itch...

480
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,449
...he'll go as far as to kill you...

481
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,340
...that could play
in the firm's favor.

482
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:14,440
It would be a sign that Angel
is on the path to joining our team.

483
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:18,050
As hard as it is
to lose good attorneys...

484
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:21,929
...well, the truth is,
you're both expendable.

485
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:26,309
Angel isn't.

486
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,960
I thought you'd be halfway
to Brazil by now.

487
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,199
No, you didn't.

488
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:57,639
No, I didn't.

489
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,469
How much it come to?

490
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:12,559
With jewelry, north of
2.5 million, I'd say.

491
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:17,849
- That's a lot to lay on the line.
- Yeah.

492
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,400
But I gotta know.

493
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,150
All of it. A little bit more
than 5 percent.

494
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,489
- If Wolfram & Hart find out--
- I can hide it.

495
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,380
What's this?

496
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:00,880
Blood.

497
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,829
It'll wash.

498
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,099
Thank you, thank you very much,
