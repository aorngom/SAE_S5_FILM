1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,609
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,540
You're never going to be alone again.

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,679
How'd you think it would end?

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,730
For God's sake, help us.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,039
- People are going to die.
- I just don't care.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,879
There's only us three
between you and real darkness.

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,690
You're all fired.

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,060
Who was that?

9
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,939
They closed down
and left these here?

10
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:02,880
Yep. Also the desk.
We'll share.

11
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:06,890
And when we close down,
we'll leave it too.

12
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:08,560
Hey, negative energy!

13
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:12,010
With our money pooled,
we can stay a long time.

14
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,409
- Twenty minutes.
- At least.

15
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,590
Angel Investigations without the Angel.

16
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,739
Think we can do it?

17
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,530
Well, we better.
What else can we do?

18
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,349
I still have visions to keep us busy.

19
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,840
We'll need more.
A steady outside clientele.

20
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,579
It'll happen. This is our future.
And personally...

21
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,269
...I think it's pretty bright.

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,159
Dead plant not symbolizing
our future, really.

23
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:48,750
Okay, every local parked car has
a flyer on the windshield.

24
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:52,170
We just irritated almost
a hundred people.

25
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,159
- It's funky in here.
- It'll air out. And good job!

26
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,590
Now we just wait
for the calls to roll in.

27
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:02,549
Through a bullhorn?
We got no dial tone.

28
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:04,180
What?

29
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,209
Perhaps it's the wires.

30
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:09,009
It should be on by now.

31
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,550
One desk?
We sharing?

32
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,650
Things are looking up.
I think I found the right wire. Ow!

33
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,909
I'm so glad I met you guys.
It's entertaining, really.

34
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,360
Oh, say does that
Star-spangled banner...

35
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,090
...yet wave?

36
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:15,800
For the land of the free

37
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:18,340
And the home of the brave

38
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:21,520
Hey! You must sing in here
all the time.

39
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:23,710
Come on, with these acoustics?

40
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,110
And the rockets' red glare

41
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,560
- Hear the resonance?
- If I'm not dreaming, I hear...

42
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,229
...is the national anthem from
a loud green demon.

43
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:35,849
We're all brothers under the skin.

44
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:41,240
Although the color and the horns have
kept me out of public performances.

45
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,039
I'd love to sing at a Lakers game.

46
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,900
- Is that too much?
- Why are you here?

47
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,039
What's today, Thursday?
Tomorrow night the world's going to end.

48
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,469
Thought you might want to know.

49
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,680
The world's gonna end?

50
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,620
Brings you down, right?

51
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,560
Don't feel the need to offer me
coffee or a cinnamon roll.

52
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,620
- I don't.
- Man, you just get darker and darker.

53
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,050
The weird thing is your aura--
Beige.

54
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,399
I don't have coffee.

55
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,160
Or a duster. I don't know why
you fired those plucky kids.

56
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:11,779
They were good company.
And Cordelia--

57
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:16,540
Hot-o-rama!
In the "Oh, my sizzling loins" sense.

58
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,339
And the British boy,
he's going to be playing a huge--

59
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,379
Will you get to the world ending?

60
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:28,470
All right. Although my good will
falling on your deaf ears...

61
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,699
...needs some work.

62
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,870
The world ending?
Kind of a funny story.

63
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,980
At the club last night,
a typical Wednesday...

64
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:41,319
...a Torto demon and his parasite
were murdering this song.

65
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,930
Bye-bye, sweet caress

66
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,829
Hello, emptiness

67
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:51,839
Bye-bye, my love
Goodbye

68
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,560
Nothing compared to what Elian
had done to my Seabreeze,

69
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:00,699
Is this a difficult concept?

70
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,220
Were we absent when they taught
Seabreeze in class?

71
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:07,370
Vodka, cranberry,
fresh grapefruit juice.

72
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,769
A real, live grapefruit.

73
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,889
One you must cut and squeeze,
not pour from a can.

74
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,060
The man is such a moron.
You have no idea how I'm suffering.

75
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,519
Can you get to the point, already?

76
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,220
If you let me get a word in,
Mr. Get-to-the-Pointy-Pants.

77
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,000
This guy gets up to sing.

78
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,810
They sing, I read their futures,
their auras.

79
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,149
- I see into their souls--
- So this guy?

80
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,319
The thing that was remarkable about
him was there was nothing remarkable,

81
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:42,730
This is a song I like.

82
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,310
- Because....
- Just a guy about to mangle a tune...

83
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:51,899
...and bore me with a bland vision
of his bland future,

84
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,379
I never needed anyone

85
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:00,339
And making love was just for fun

86
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:16,959
All by myself

87
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't wanna be

88
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:24,550
But when he started singing--
Man, he knocked me out.

89
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,329
He was good?

90
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,930
No, he knocked me out!

91
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,370
Then he was gone.

92
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:37,439
- He didn't wait to hear what you saw?
- Nope.

93
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:40,870
What knocked you out?

94
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,410
I saw he has no future
after 10:00 tomorrow night.

95
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,170
And neither does anybody else.

96
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,639
- Say I believe you--
- Let's say more than that.

97
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:57,480
We gotta find this guy.
This is the big blackout.

98
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,199
He's going to do something...

99
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:02,889
...that will cancel everybody's plans.

100
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:04,939
We gotta stop him.

101
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,350
- Why did you come to me?
- You're a champion.

102
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,110
A force for good in a troubled world.

103
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,550
Also, all the other champions
are out of town or dead.

104
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,889
Why, you won't work with me?

105
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:20,779
I gave you some missions that were--

106
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,250
- Pointless and deadly?
- As for example....

107
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,620
But I did it in good faith.

108
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,560
And let me interrupt
to inform you: world ending!

109
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,620
Kind of an emergency,
you might want to get on board.

110
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,210
Why'd this guy leave
before you could tell him?

111
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,450
People get scared.
They might not want to know.

112
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,129
Especially when I faint...

113
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,519
...a teeny bit of vomit.
Let's not dwell.

114
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:51,909
Maybe he's just there to sing karaoke.

115
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:55,889
That makes more sense.
We'll start with local karaoke bars...

116
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,019
...to get a lead.

117
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:02,240
If you're not busy getting lawyers
killed and setting girls on fire.

118
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,480
Somebody forgot to wind Time Boy.

119
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,690
He's thinking.
Something you ought to try.

120
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,659
Very funny. He's really not
that much smarter than the rest of us.

121
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,509
His work on time paradox earned
the professor a Nobel...

122
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,399
...nomination while your work
on mold was forgotten.

123
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,980
- Know what you are?
- Yes, Mike.

124
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,710
If you say it, I'll put your face
in liquid nitrogen.

125
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,639
What's the good word?

126
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,389
- Entanglement.
- How's that?

127
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,039
For Newton, space and time are
separate. For Einstein, entwined.

128
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,549
"Einstein entwined," say it fast.

129
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,659
How can altering one particle of an
entangled pair affect the other...

130
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,009
- ...without any link between them?
- Because space and time are one.

131
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,519
How do you separate the pair?

132
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,700
You don't.
You probably shouldn't try.

133
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,360
- I never do.
- What you do...

134
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:32,220
...is carve out one instant at a time.

135
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:36,559
I like the theory
of freezing time as much as--

136
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:38,899
It's not freezing time.
I mean...

137
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:44,149
...cutting an infinitesimal space-time
aggregate from all that surrounds it.

138
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:46,659
A tiny event horizon.

139
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,919
Sort of. Then growing that event
into something measurable.

140
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,899
Your dog and his favorite bone,
preserved forever in his own bubble.

141
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,190
And who will clean up that bubble?

142
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,220
If I can get the math right,
I can prove it.

143
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:07,299
By generating a focal point
with the accelerator's beams here...

144
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,750
...and passing liquid mercury
through that point....

145
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,750
Suspending the mercury, snatching it
out of our time-space continuum...

146
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,330
...and freezing the moment.

147
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:22,909
Forever.

148
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,330
Denise. Your boyfriend
was hitting on me with...

149
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:29,750
...the old Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
correlation.

150
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:33,139
That's what got me out of physics
and into theater.

151
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,450
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

152
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,240
- How are you?
- Good. You?

153
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,240
Good. So what's new?

154
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,500
- I guess we're on for tomorrow night.
- We are.

155
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:49,789
- Big night.
- Yeah. One-year anniversary and all.

156
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,850
Well, we should....

157
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,970
- You guys are leaving?
- Yeah.

158
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,049
I'll see you tomorrow night.

159
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:02,750
- Don't work all night.
- You know he will.

160
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,809
Nice.

161
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,889
It's not that bad.
Nothing lots of Lysol can't cure.

162
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:22,690
To cast me off discourteously

163
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:28,759
An interesting choice.
Too bad about the Cuisinart tomorrow.

164
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,929
If we stop the world ending,
the scar won't be noticeable.

165
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:36,629
Sorry. Occupational hazard.

166
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,649
Is he here?

167
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:40,190
Nope.

168
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:45,230
Seventeen karaoke bars. I need to
scrub out the inside of my head.

169
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,610
Maybe we're wrong.
Sniffing a cold trail.

170
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:51,559
Don't get your kind much.

171
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,250
- Excuse me?
- Demons.

172
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:56,740
Usually, we get vampires
passing for human.

173
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,779
I never pass on anything with
a little umbrella in the glass.

174
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,399
- Worked here long?
- Eleven years.

175
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:07,370
Since they put
in that karaoke machine...

176
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,769
...it drove most of the customers away.

177
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,450
- We get a few steadies.
- Steadies?

178
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,340
Lot of students.
Grad students.

179
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,049
Fits the description.

180
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:20,240
We're looking for a guy:
early 20s, medium build.

181
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,990
- Sings sad songs.
- Sounds like The Kid.

182
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,990
- Name?
- I don't know. He's here now and then.

183
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,830
Always sings sad songs.
I thought somebody died.

184
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,149
Later, I figured he
was a manic-depressant.

185
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,929
You got a good picture of this
grad student in your head?

186
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,870
How about singing
"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow"?

187
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,590
He's a demon.
Do what he says, or he might...

188
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,779
...talk your ears off.

189
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,090
For he's a jolly good fellow

190
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:57,980
For he's a jolly good fellow

191
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,190
It's him. It's our boy.
Fabulous tone.

192
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,820
Nice vibrato. And you keep writing
that novel, F. Scott.

193
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,879
Art is its own reward.
Got to give the people hope.

194
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,500
This student, which university is that?

195
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,940
Momentum and mass energy...

196
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,730
...within the conservation of PX...

197
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,169
...PY and PZ.

198
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:43,190
Here goes nothing.

199
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:09,980
There went nothing.

200
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,789
This is never gonna work.

201
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,659
There, see?

202
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,590
We don't need
the harsh fluorescents...

203
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:10,429
- ...or useless computer information.
- Cordelia...

204
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,269
...stop trying.

205
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:15,899
- Really?
- Join us.

206
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,649
Sometimes you need to wallow.

207
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,700
Just let the depression
settle in silently.

208
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:29,820
Hey.

209
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,889
Wow, this place is great!

210
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,059
I brought champagne.
You guys must be so excited.

211
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,929
In that really dry, suicidal way.

212
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,909
Sorry, sweetheart.

213
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,830
You just caught us in a moment of....

214
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,259
- Well--
- Reality.

215
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:50,639
Oh, that.

216
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,529
- I avoid that.
- How do you avoid reality?

217
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,590
Money. It cures all but boredom,
and food cures boredom so...

218
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:01,470
- ...here's imported chips and cheese.
- Thanks.

219
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,420
We'll eat them huddled
around our pathetic candles.

220
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,259
- And make pathetic nachos.
- You guys are really down.

221
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:13,369
And don't tell us it can only go up.
Because...

222
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:15,589
...there's always more down.

223
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,119
That was very well said,
by the way...

224
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:22,299
...but I found a client for you.
A rich one.

225
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:25,470
- Really?
- Why didn't you say this first?

226
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:28,190
I got distracted by your desperation.

227
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:30,769
But my friend Patricia's family...

228
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,859
...they've got this big guy
that's been harassing them at home.

229
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,950
- They'd be grateful if you help them.
- Sounds easy.

230
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:41,960
- Wait. By "big guy," you mean demon?
- Yes.

231
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,319
They own a palatial estate...

232
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:46,690
...and they'll give you big tubs of cash.

233
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:50,880
Really rich family.
They invented chairs or something.

234
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:52,690
We'll do it! Anything!

235
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:55,160
That's so sad.
He's a Wainakay demon...

236
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:58,299
...and he got the eldest son already.

237
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,980
So there's been a death?

238
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,420
You just let these facts dribble out?

239
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,980
- I'll call Patty to say you'll help.
- No phone.

240
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:10,089
- No lights.
- And there's a funky smell.

241
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:15,730
I wasn't gonna say anything.

242
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,299
Nine to the 17th?

243
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,779
Where C-squared and E-squared are
obtained by differentiating...

244
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:40,859
...the four velocity--

245
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:43,960
Four velocity termination?

246
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,440
I did it.

247
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:13,220
This is a yee-ha moment.

248
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,920
I definitely think this
is a yee-ha moment.

249
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:19,680
Yee-ha!

250
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:39,789
- Where did you learn how to drive?
- Just now, in your car. Not bad?

251
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,619
- Nearly killed us four times.
- I drove...

252
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,819
...because you were under the blanket,
hiding from the sun.

253
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:50,380
I better hide and think of
something to say if I'm seen.

254
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,930
Tell them you're the new
school mascot. Wait here.

255
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:35,269
Yearbook and publications
going back five years.

256
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,680
Let's find your little madman.

257
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:42,789
I think of him as "our" little madman.
I'm a team player, you know?

258
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:52,079
- You all right, girl?
- Huh?

259
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:54,869
Yeah, fine.

260
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,779
I'm good. You know, I'm not perfect.

261
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:00,799
Oh, God.

262
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:04,880
- Spit it out. You're among friends.
- This has to stay among friends.

263
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,230
- You can't repeat this to anybody.
- I won't.

264
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,849
I don't think it's gonna
work out with me and Gene.

265
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:17,099
And tonight's your anniversary.

266
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,029
- You think I don't know that?
- Oh, honey.

267
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,769
- Gene's a wonderful guy.
- Yeah?

268
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,140
But he's just sort of...

269
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:28,609
...hollow, or something.

270
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:31,609
When I'm with him, I feel....

271
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:35,799
- I feel lonely.
- Maybe that's because he is.

272
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,559
I love him, but he's an energy-sucker.

273
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,509
I have to break up with him.

274
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:46,809
Not to be a bitch, but couldn't
you have figured that out before?

275
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:49,150
He has it all planned.

276
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,890
- He's making me dinner.
- What are you gonna do?

277
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:59,130
You're gonna give him
the sympathy bone, aren't you?

278
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,140
It'll be dinner, sympathy bone,
and adiós Gene, right?

279
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:08,630
We've been together for a year.
I can't walk out on him.

280
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,400
It just wouldn't be right.
Not after all we've--

281
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,170
The post-sympathy-bone walkout
is your only escape hatch.

282
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:23,380
It was really sweet there for a while.
Really sweet.

283
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,789
But it's just not the kind
of love that lasts.

284
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,539
- This him?
- It is not.

285
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,440
Got him.

286
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:51,980
He's a physicist.
A pretty good one, according to this.

287
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:54,740
I'll find out where the lab is.

288
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,289
Hi. I'm just trying to get
ahold of Gene Rainy.

289
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,170
- He's a physics grad student.
- Our own Stephen Hawking.

290
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,559
- What do you want?
- Leonard Taubman.

291
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:10,269
My foundation has
grant money for Gene.

292
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:15,099
Wish I was a genius. He's got
his own lab in the physics department.

293
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,670
It's not far from here.

294
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:22,619
You stay on this path.
Go past Kelton Hall and--

295
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,569
- What is that?
- Don't worry. School mascot.

296
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,680
So I'll give her the kind
of love that lasts.

297
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:15,650
Sorry.

298
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:37,279
- What did you tell it?
- I said, "We come in peace."

299
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,769
- What did he say?
- "You won't stop the one we've...

300
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:42,579
...waited for."

301
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,500
- Lubber demons are articulate.
- Lubber demon?

302
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:50,089
Fanatical sect, awaiting a messiah
who will end all human life.

303
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:52,809
Most demons don't yak about it, but...

304
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:55,559
...it's a popular demon theology.

305
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,500
This madman has demons protecting him
while he blows up the planet or--

306
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,130
What's he gonna do?

307
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,750
Let's go to his lab to find out.
He's a criminal mastermind.

308
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,740
All by myself

309
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:14,410
Anymore

310
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:19,490
All by myself

311
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,339
Don't wanna live

312
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,660
All by myself

313
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,369
We're looking for Gene.

314
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,049
- Me too. Someone took his stuff.
- Stuff?

315
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,690
Particle accelerators, propulsion--

316
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,519
- What's that?
- It's the new school mascot.

317
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,200
- We're Buccaneers.
- Not your school.

318
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,619
- What was Gene working on?
- Time paradox...

319
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,269
...accelerating particles out of our
continuum into their own universe.

320
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,509
- Come again?
- Stopping time.

321
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,049
Which is impossible.
No one can do it.

322
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,059
Do they listen? No.
He gets the grants, I get the mold.

323
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,410
Let's say he could do it,
let's say you could stop time,

324
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,269
- How would it work?
- According to his speculations...

325
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,210
...you focus the accelerators on a
point, Create the correct velocity...

326
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:20,299
- ... whatever's there would be removed,
- Removed?

327
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,640
From our reality,

328
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,410
- What happens to it?
- Nothing, in the absolute sense,

329
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,700
Whatever's in the field would stand
still forever, in its own universe,

330
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:36,819
Say someone cranked this
into overdrive.

331
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:41,509
If the field weren't contained,
it would spill out. Stop everything.

332
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:45,470
Kind of wiggy.

333
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,619
- Who can get in here?
- Only Gene.

334
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,039
- Even maintenance has no access.
- No forced entry.

335
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,309
- Why would Gene take his own stuff?
- Where would he take it?

336
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,750
So there's another gear
after that number two?

337
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:14,150
Relax, I'll pay for a tune-up.

338
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,660
Unless the world ends.

339
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,480
If it saves you some money, it's good.

340
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,970
Your sourpussy mode is starting to grate.

341
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,890
Your problem is--

342
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,960
- You listening?
- Do I have a choice?

343
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:30,279
- Your heart isn't in it.
- Technically, I have no heart.

344
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:35,500
Someone puts a stake in it, you won't
have anything. So your heart counts.

345
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:39,450
- What are you babbling about?
- Tell the truth.

346
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:44,640
If the world ends tonight, would it
really, in your heart of hearts...

347
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:47,579
...be such a terrible thing?

348
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:53,460
- Now is that a fun place to be?
- I think you should shut up now.

349
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,690
I'm the Host.
I never shut up.

350
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,710
You distanced your friends.
You went from helping the helpless...

351
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,789
...to hunting down the guilty.
Vengeance is for the lesser being.

352
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,740
You're a champion, Angel.

353
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:11,460
- I mean, you were, at least.
- What do you want me to tell you?

354
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,779
Everything. Why your heart
stopped caring.

355
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,460
The whole story so I can help you.

356
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,789
No need to rush. We got time.

357
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:24,630
You know, not a lot.

358
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,890
You want to know what my problem is?
I'm screwed.

359
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,559
I'm atoning for 100 years
of unthinkable evil.

360
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,390
News flash! I can't.
Never gonna be enough.

361
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,099
Now I got Wolfram & Hart dogging me.

362
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:58,119
200 law school graduates working
full-time, driving me crazy.

363
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,160
You're surprised it's working?

364
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:03,670
"Angel, why are you so cranky?"

365
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:07,200
"You should smile and wear a nice plaid."

366
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:08,579
Not this season.

367
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:12,140
Redemption. Darla had a shot
but they took it from her.

368
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,740
Now I have to kill her.
I'm gonna do it.

369
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:19,299
I'll kill her, then I'll burn that law firm.

370
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,059
My crew couldn't handle that.

371
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:26,319
Good. It means they're still human.
They're better off fired.

372
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:30,589
- You left them in the cold.
- It's a lot colder in here.

373
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,039
It's not always gonna be this way.
Things change.

374
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,799
Unless we don't get there on time.

375
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:45,519
In which case you'll be frozen
in this crappy mood forever.

376
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:48,319
- We'll get there.
- Look out!

377
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,670
- Hi.
- Hi.

378
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,000
You look, uh....

379
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,559
Well, happy anniversary.

380
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:49,400
Good job, man.
We're very grateful.

381
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:52,789
Yes, we found the killer.

382
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:56,329
- But not the murderer.
- What's he saying?

383
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,349
This demon was...

384
00:30:57,609 --> 00:30:59,470
...under someone else's control.

385
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,500
Someone in this room.

386
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:06,880
- Can we eat these?
- What do we know?

387
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,859
When we arrived, there was a scent
of foxglove and hellebore.

388
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,569
Not to keep this demon out,
but to keep him in...

389
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:17,470
...so he could execute
the murderer's plan.

390
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,829
Such a plan would require the skill
of a master wizard.

391
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:26,819
I don't do that stuff anymore.

392
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:32,180
Then we have the footprints in the
soft soil under the window outside.

393
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:35,220
Too small to belong to this demon.

394
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:37,970
Kevin told you.
Those were his.

395
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,660
- He snuck in late last night.
- Loudly...

396
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,599
...so all could hear.

397
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:47,180
Supposedly from seeing that girl in town.
We all know Kevin is impotent...

398
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:49,309
...why put on the show?

399
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:52,089
Perhaps to cover for the real killer.

400
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:56,000
Unless Kevin, in fact, is the real killer.

401
00:31:57,009 --> 00:31:59,640
With Derek gone, the inheritance is his...

402
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:03,700
...the younger brother
and black sheep of the family.

403
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,250
Unfortunately, you had neither
the opportunity...

404
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:10,809
...nor the intelligence to do this.

405
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:14,390
Sorry about the "impotent" remark.

406
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:18,170
If Kevin was to have control
of the money...

407
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:21,240
...who would have control of Kevin?

408
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,890
Are there more of these--?

409
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:28,799
Sorry.

410
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,920
His sister?

411
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:33,039
His mother?

412
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:36,349
Both influence his life.
Both with agendas.

413
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,779
But only one person knew the secret
that could blackmail Kevin for life.

414
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:45,700
Only one person took pains
to hide their muddy shoes.

415
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,740
Only one reeked
of foxglove and hellebore.

416
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:53,210
Only one person was responsible
for the death of Derek Bointon.

417
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:56,329
His own sweet, doting Aunt Helen!

418
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,799
Helen?

419
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:01,720
Not so fast, sister.

420
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:05,259
That was cool.

421
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,779
It wasn't difficult.

422
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:10,619
You keep sifting the evidence
till the truth hits you.

423
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:41,299
So how was scene class?

424
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:43,980
Oh, you know.

425
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:49,019
Jack thinks he can't play it
without a goatee.

426
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:52,450
The footstool would have a goatee?

427
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,869
Well, you know Jack.

428
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:04,099
Thank you for the....

429
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:06,109
It's really pretty.

430
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,860
It made me think of you.

431
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,690
Are you all done?

432
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,239
Yeah. I'm not that hungry.

433
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,429
It was good. It was really good.

434
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:26,829
Hurry!

435
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,139
That's sweet.

436
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:43,769
I'm sorry about the clutter.

437
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:47,019
It wouldn't be you without it.

438
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,070
I love you.

439
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:44,900
Where would I put a machine
to stop time?

440
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:48,360
Probably where the demons
can guard it.

441
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:27,389
Gene, we have to talk.

442
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:32,300
I can't believe this,

443
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:35,929
Listen, I am really, really sorry.

444
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:38,860
I had no idea I was
endangering the world...

445
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:41,900
...or that there were
all these demons.

446
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:47,539
But aliens among us is consistent with
Murdoch's multiverse. I just....

447
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,250
I didn't want her to leave.

448
00:37:57,969 --> 00:37:59,690
Well, you know....

449
00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:02,090
Love.

450
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,170
It's a fire.

451
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:06,929
You've been there.

452
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:08,440
It burns you...

453
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:09,679
...alive.

454
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,590
Down to the bone.
Then it turns the bone to ash--

455
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,380
What my chipper friend means is...

456
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,449
...the wheel keeps turning.
It can't stop.

457
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,849
Things may get worse or better.

458
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,460
I want the wheel to stop.

459
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:30,139
Which explains this time-in-a-box
disaster. I'm so sorry about that.

460
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:33,320
It don't work, Gene.
It's like a song.

461
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:37,730
I can hold a note a long time.
Actually, I can hold it forever.

462
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,679
Eventually, that's noise.

463
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,780
It's the change we're listening for.

464
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:45,110
The note coming after and after that.

465
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:47,159
That's what makes it music.

466
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:49,809
I guess.

467
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:55,949
You guys like beer?

468
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,420
Beer sounds great.

469
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,239
I'm glad you guys....

470
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:11,760
You're connecting to a human.
It's a start.

471
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:14,719
Go easy on the
bone-and-ash metaphors.

472
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,820
He's a love disaster
and nearly destroyed the world.

473
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:20,690
I can relate.

474
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:27,489
- I did kind of leave them in the cold.
- Your buddies, by firing them?

475
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:30,929
Yeah.

476
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:35,860
I guess I made it pretty hard for them.

477
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:42,679
Yeah!

478
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:02,269
- Hi.
- How are you?

479
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,690
You all right?

480
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:07,179
I just....

481
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,619
I need help.

482
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:11,829
- This is Angel Investigations?
- That's right.

483
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:14,659
Sorry about the confusion.

484
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:18,500
We're having a celebration,
a new beginning.

485
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:22,489
- Maybe I should--
- No. You need help, we can help.

486
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,760
- We can talk in back. Come in.
- Which one of you is Angel?

487
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,679
It's just a name.

488
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:13,320
Thank you,
