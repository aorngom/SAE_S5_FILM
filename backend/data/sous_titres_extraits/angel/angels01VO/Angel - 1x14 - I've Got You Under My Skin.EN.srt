1
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,119
Mark of Kekfadlorem.

2
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:15,369
Heard of it, never seen it.

3
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:20,859
This is the only knife that can
kill a Kek demon. Could be useful.

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,309
Only if Kek demons weren't extinct.

5
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:26,829
They are? Oh, dear.

6
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,929
Well, perhaps there's one hibernating.

7
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:34,810
Ready to awaken and
embark on a grisly rampage.

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,609
I'll keep my fingers crossed.

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,710
They're done! Nobody touch!

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,810
- She's making brownies.
- Is that what I smell?

11
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:48,859
I thought I'd tracked something in.

12
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,219
This was handed down by my mother...

13
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:55,060
...from her housekeeper.
I improvised. You're gonna love them.

14
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:56,700
Me?

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,009
Doesn't Angel have to--?
Get to try any?

16
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:03,079
They're brownies,
not red blood cells.

17
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:05,840
Oh, I wasn't thinking.

18
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,480
More a drinker
than an eater, I suppose.

19
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,379
Maybe if he branched into solids,
he'd keep a decent knife around.

20
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,409
That is not appropriate!
It's for killing extinct demons.

21
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:25,810
- Angel, make her stop.
- Cordelia--

22
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,939
That blade is old. Who knows what
effect her cooking may have on it?

23
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,920
"Effect"?

24
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,530
Cordelia, put down
the very sharp knife.

25
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,510
Well, they don't smell right.

26
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,170
I think Mr. Too Much Cologne is the
pot calling the kettle stinky.

27
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,859
Cordelia! Doyle!

28
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,900
I mean, um, Wesley.

29
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,560
Wesley.

30
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,120
Let's just, um....

31
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:00,049
No more fighting, all right?

32
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,780
- Where is it, Stephanie?
- What?

33
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,889
I didn't take it!
Give me that. Stop it!

34
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,400
- You took my card!
- I didn't touch it!

35
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,750
- What'd you do with it?
- Stop it! Mom!

36
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,770
Okay. That's it.

37
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,569
- She took my card.
- I did not!

38
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,960
You did! I had five
and now I have four.

39
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,210
There are children
in India who have three.

40
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,210
- It's time for bed, anyway.
- Mom! No!

41
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,539
You heard your mother.

42
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,979
It's time for bed.

43
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,379
Do we have to?

44
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,930
Pretend to read any good books lately?

45
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,509
I thought you went home.

46
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,529
You called him Doyle.

47
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,449
It just happened.
I hope Wesley's okay with it.

48
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,500
Who cares about him? This is about
Doyle. You never say his name.

49
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:43,939
- I say it.
- No, you don't.

50
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:49,860
Look, you don't have to
be Joe Stoic about his dying.

51
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,850
I mean, I know you have this
unflappable vibe working for you.

52
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,430
But you don't have
to do that for me.

53
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,319
- I'm not unflappable.
- Great. So flap.

54
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,220
I miss him.

55
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,759
Me too.

56
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:24,170
I've been around death before. A lot.

57
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:27,800
I've lost people, I've killed people.

58
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,540
And you are dead.

59
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:32,639
Sorry.

60
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,529
I shouldn't have let it happen.

61
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,410
Angel, it wasn't your fault.

62
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:42,730
- It hurts.
- Yeah.

63
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,290
No, it, it really, really, really--

64
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,350
Easy.

65
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:02,959
What'd you see?

66
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,970
1256. That's the house.

67
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,490
Angel?

68
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,439
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

69
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:30,000
You're bleeding.

70
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:31,579
Are you gonna cry?

71
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:34,620
I don't think so.

72
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,329
I don't know.

73
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,040
Let me think....

74
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,129
Uh, no.

75
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,420
No, not gonna cry.

76
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:48,100
- What's your name?
- Ryan.

77
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:51,060
Ryan, you want to tell me
what you were doing outside?

78
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,250
Ryan!

79
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,639
You know better than this.

80
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,079
Now say thank you
to the nice man and come inside.

81
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,290
Ryan!

82
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,850
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. What happened?

83
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:09,759
He was in the street. He almost
got hit. Paige, he's fine.

84
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,220
Oh, God, my baby.

85
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,550
It's cold. Let's get him inside.

86
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:15,870
You saved him.
Thank God you were here.

87
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:22,120
- Yeah, uh, thank you.
- It's okay.

88
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,240
Scamp, isn't he?

89
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:30,209
Oh, you're hurt. Your shoulder.

90
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:36,209
You come inside.

91
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:41,959
You scared me.

92
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:47,490
Sure you don't want to
go to the emergency room?

93
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:49,649
You may need some stitches.

94
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,100
It'll be fine, really.
I'm not a big bleeder.

95
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,730
We just moved in.
We're still a bit jumbled.

96
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:02,339
It doesn't get any easier. Every new
place, you have to start over...

97
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,680
...finding friends...

98
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,930
...people to talk to.

99
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:16,220
Ryan's asleep. He's out like a light.

100
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,370
He seems like a nice boy.

101
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:25,500
He is. Thank you so much.

102
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,310
That must be the millionth time
I've said that.

103
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,110
Really, thank you.

104
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,700
If there's anything we can do
for you.... Money?

105
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,120
Seth's an investment adviser.
Do you need some advice?

106
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,269
No, nothing. Thank you.

107
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:45,690
He probably just wants to
go home and get cleaned up.

108
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,820
How did Ryan get in the street?

109
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:51,169
Climbed out the window.

110
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:58,220
We have burglar bars. But he
must be able to fit between.

111
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:00,940
We didn't even bother checking that.

112
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:02,570
Where was he going?

113
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,190
Going?
He wasn't going anywhere.

114
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:06,870
Think he was trying
to get away from something?

115
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:10,149
Why would he want to get away from
his own house?

116
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:43,860
Oh, dear.

117
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,940
- This bother you?
- No.

118
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:53,879
Lot of health nuts these days.

119
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:57,299
Like anyone needs to live forever.

120
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:59,039
No one needs that.

121
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,029
She'll be right back with
the bandages, then you can go.

122
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,659
Right.

123
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,029
Paige was telling me
you're new in town.

124
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,049
- Where did you--?
- What?

125
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:21,409
This was much worse.

126
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:23,320
Oh, it's just a scratch.

127
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,960
Seth was telling me
about where you lived before.

128
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,860
Akron. One winter there was enough.

129
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,980
You know what? Strikes me
you never told us your name.

130
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,190
Angel.

131
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:41,950
Jones. Angel Jones.

132
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,350
Angel.

133
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,620
Honey?

134
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:50,879
See?

135
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:54,059
Angels.

136
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:58,179
I collect them. I think they're
around all the time, don't you?

137
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,799
I think...

138
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:03,730
...there are beings.

139
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:06,370
It's a nice thought.
Like someone's looking out for us.

140
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:09,789
Keeping us out of danger.
Tonight you were our angel.

141
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:12,659
I was just in the right place.

142
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,059
It's getting late.

143
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,940
- Come to dinner.
- Paige.

144
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:26,269
Tomorrow night. Say yes. Let us
pay you back for looking after us.

145
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,679
We've taken up too much
of Angel's time already.

146
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:32,320
Can I bring something?

147
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,009
Something's wrong in that house.

148
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:43,679
The wife wants to talk,
but the husband doesn't.

149
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,590
I'll be back tomorrow.

150
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:46,929
- Be careful.
- I am.

151
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:48,970
Be especially careful.

152
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,210
Plakticine.

153
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,539
- I found it all around the house.
- So now we know.

154
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:57,370
Someone in there
is possessed by a demon.

155
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,019
Thanks for your help.

156
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,259
Mom told the truth about Akron.

157
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,960
Before that, Miami and Baton Rouge.
All within the last three years.

158
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,899
Let me guess. Couldn't
lose the black cloud.

159
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,549
Like it was fitted with chinstraps.

160
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:27,750
Everywhere they go, there's been
reports of disturbances, and...

161
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,309
...yuck, animal deaths.

162
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,000
In Akron, a friend of the family
went missing. He's still missing.

163
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,840
What is this stuff anyway?
It's kind of pretty.

164
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:42,470
It's the bodily
excretion of an Ethros demon.

165
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,590
No one could've said "demon poo"
before I touched it?

166
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,480
It can't hurt you. Only
the demon itself is dangerous.

167
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,460
How dangerous?

168
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:54,929
Tends to go in for mass murder.

169
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,110
Remember Lizzie Borden?
Killed her parents with an ax?

170
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:01,669
I remember the children's rhyme.
Why are they full of death...

171
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,919
...and cradles falling
and mice getting tails cut off?

172
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,450
The whole thing needs
a rating system. Don't you think?

173
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,679
Yes, well....

174
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,059
What the rhyme doesn't say is,
she was possessed by an Ethros.

175
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,379
An adolescent Ethros.
This amount of plakticine...

176
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,490
...we've got a grown-up demon.

177
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,970
Someone's got a squatter in their
head. What do we do about it?

178
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,529
Evict him.

179
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,620
Exorcism.

180
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,639
I'll find someone
who can perform one.

181
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,500
Not too many priests
go in for it these days.

182
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,580
Who do we exorcize?
Which one's the demon?

183
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,450
They were afraid of the father.

184
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,799
A father doesn't have to be possessed
to terrorize his children.

185
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,850
He just has to--

186
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:47,730
We'll find out soon enough.

187
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,639
The first step is getting
him to show himself.

188
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:55,559
A little Psylis Eucalipsis powder
ingested by the host--

189
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,759
And what? Dad goes
"Rrrr," head spins around?

190
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,360
Essentially.

191
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,740
Okay, so how do I get
someone to eat Eucalipsis powder?

192
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,279
I made brownies.

193
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,009
More Brussels sprouts?

194
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,169
No, thank you. I'm full.

195
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,809
Everything was...very good.

196
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,740
Roast was a little dry.

197
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:28,149
No. It was full of roasty goodness.

198
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,080
I think we're ready
to try your brownies.

199
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,470
I'll get the coffee.

200
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,220
I didn't like the Brussels sprouts.
They were gross.

201
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:52,480
You seemed to like yours.

202
00:14:57,889 --> 00:14:59,639
I hid one in my mashed potatoes too.

203
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,049
- What are you laughing at?
- Angel's funny.

204
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,740
He hides it well.

205
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,429
Look, kids. See what Angel
made for us?

206
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:31,610
- What's your secret, Angel?
- I use chocolate.

207
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,419
That's why they're brown.

208
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,029
Which gives them their name:

209
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,250
Brownies!

210
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,950
No hot chocolate tonight.
This is your treat.

211
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,860
- Dad!
- It's not fair.

212
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:47,539
Kids, shh. Company.

213
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,059
Ryan! What's wrong?

214
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,960
Your son's possessed by a demon.

215
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:21,789
Ryan's bad.

216
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,679
- Ryan's always been bad.
- Stephanie!

217
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:27,970
Baby....

218
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,549
Do you hear me?

219
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:33,080
- Paige, listen. He's okay.
- What do you mean, he's okay?

220
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,110
- The demon had to show itself first.
- You did this to him?

221
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:38,379
I just used the brownies to--

222
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:41,090
You put something in
our food, you poisoned him?

223
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:43,389
What were you thinking?

224
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:47,759
I thought you were here
to help us. You're not an angel.

225
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:49,990
Paige, it's okay.

226
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,610
Seth, he did this to Ryan.

227
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,330
We both know that is not true.

228
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,570
What's wrong with Ryan
has been wrong for a long time.

229
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:01,389
You say you can help my son?

230
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:03,679
All right.

231
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,369
What do you need?

232
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,490
A phone.

233
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,009
I found our demon in the boy.

234
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,819
We're not ready. I have a priest,
but we can't find him.

235
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:19,170
I need a binding powder.
Everything is in the pantry.

236
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,740
We can hold him for a while.
We're coming to you.

237
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:27,970
How is she?

238
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:31,069
She's just....
It's been so long.

239
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:32,839
This isn't gonna be easy.

240
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,849
For the last three years...

241
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,910
...it's been all I could do
to hold this family together.

242
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,890
Now you come here and give us
a reason for all the terror...

243
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:44,690
...and a way to end it?

244
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:47,869
Maybe you are an angel.

245
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:50,619
Can someone watch your daughter?

246
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:52,910
- Yes. Why?
- The rest of you are coming with me.

247
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,329
My assistants.

248
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,970
I'm Cordelia.
Sorry about the possession.

249
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,990
Uh.... Hello.

250
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:27,630
Should I put plastic down?

251
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,660
Are we expecting any vomiting?
I saw the movie.

252
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,259
The powder will control
him while we find the priest.

253
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:42,140
He doesn't need a priest.

254
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,349
Paige.

255
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:48,420
Listen to me.

256
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,170
The only way through this
is to let us help.

257
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,930
Your son is possessed.

258
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,730
Deep down, you know
this is true. You know it.

259
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,309
Cordelia will stay with you
until we return.

260
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,890
Don't break the circle.
He'll ask you to come to him.

261
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:09,619
Don't do it, don't touch him.
He's been exposed and he's angry.

262
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,170
He'll kill you. You got that?

263
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:15,910
Jeez, we got it! Circle, angry, kill.
Go to church already.

264
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:44,250
Hail Mary, full of grace....

265
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:46,480
Sister?

266
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:49,859
Sorry to disturb you.
I hope you didn't lose your place.

267
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,960
Not at all. How can I--?

268
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,109
You would come in to
a place of worship?

269
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,210
- I'm not what you think.
- No?

270
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,950
Okay. Yeah, I am.

271
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,500
But I'm trying to help a child
possessed by an Ethros demon.

272
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:18,940
Which is why we need to find
Father Fredricks. It's rather urgent.

273
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:21,420
He's behind the church.

274
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,430
Thank you. Progress, at last.

275
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,660
The last grave on the left.

276
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,579
He's.... The father's dead?

277
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:37,259
Six months ago, a family
came to Father Fredricks.

278
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,970
Their daughter was
possessed with a demon.

279
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:44,039
A very powerful demon.

280
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,309
Father Fredricks
saved the young woman.

281
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,609
But he couldn't save himself.

282
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,990
It was an Ethros demon?

283
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,059
If the child you are trying to save...

284
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:05,069
...really is possessed with an Ethros,
my prayers are with you.

285
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:07,160
Both of you.

286
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,769
Because what you're dealing with...

287
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,819
...is very, very smart
and very dangerous.

288
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:17,150
Even more dangerous than you.

289
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,369
Mommy? Where are you?

290
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,569
Mommy, I'm scared.

291
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,980
I need you. Are you there?

292
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,640
Couldn't I just
take him his toys? Please?

293
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,279
You heard what Angel said.
We have to wait.

294
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:42,869
But why do we have to wait?

295
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,049
Things were going
really well this time.

296
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,920
Can't we just keep on like it was?

297
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:51,339
Paige, no. Not after Ohio.

298
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:54,490
Ohio?

299
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:58,400
A friend of ours...

300
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,089
...the kids called him Uncle Frank,
died in a fire.

301
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,259
That was an accident. It wasn't Ryan.

302
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,130
I'm scared, and it's so cold in here.

303
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:13,609
Mommy?

304
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,019
And that isn't Ryan, either. Paige?

305
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:22,039
I'm not going to him, okay?
I'm playing by the stupid rules.

306
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,420
Good, we can stay busy.
You'll get caught up...

307
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,819
...won't even hear your son's pain.

308
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,420
Mommy, I need you.
I'm so scared. Come here!

309
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,440
This is just too cruel.

310
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,740
It's almost over. Angel's good
at this kind of thing.

311
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:40,650
And Wesley....

312
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,539
They'll be right back with the priest.

313
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,910
You can't do it.

314
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,980
I know the ritual.
We have the supplies.

315
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,990
You aren't ready.
It takes tremendous strength.

316
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:00,789
- Mental strength.
- Resistance. I understand that.

317
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,670
I possess a certain--

318
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:08,920
You don't even have sales resistance.

319
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:11,329
How many Thighmasters do you own?

320
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:13,119
The second was free,
with Buns of Steel,

321
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,329
The priest was an expert.
An Ethros killed him.

322
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,400
- You're saying I can't do it.
- That's right.

323
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,759
So our only option is,
you do it.

324
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,869
- That was vulgar.
- But I made my point.

325
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,799
All right. You'll do it.

326
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,519
But I'll be right there with you.

327
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,119
See, honey? Mommy's right here.

328
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,240
I'm not going anywhere.

329
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,180
Nobody's gonna hurt you,
sweetie. It's gonna be okay.

330
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:03,589
Paige, come away.

331
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:07,259
You wanted to see him. There he is.

332
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,890
And he's gonna be fine.

333
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:11,319
He's not fine. Look at him, Seth.

334
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:15,089
Look at him. He needs me.

335
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,569
Mama?

336
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,119
Mom, I can't see.

337
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,829
Something's wrong with
my eyes and it hurts.

338
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,259
Why won't you help me?

339
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:28,329
I'm here, baby. I'm right here.

340
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:34,650
No, Paige!

341
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,589
Latin is the ritual
of choice for an Ethros.

342
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,250
Good. Come on.

343
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,980
- What?
- I know how the priest was killed.

344
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,859
When an Ethros is cast out, it
seeks another body to inhabit.

345
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,609
The demon leaves so rapidly,
the inhabited rarely survives.

346
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,279
- That's a problem.
- I dare say.

347
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,539
Ryan!

348
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:08,460
- They're here. They're coming.
- Mommy?

349
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:13,900
No!

350
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,779
Paige!

351
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:19,579
Angel!

352
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:25,079
Mommy, I'm so glad you're here.

353
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,809
Paige, open the door.

354
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:29,460
So glad....

355
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,500
Ryan, no! Ryan, stop it!

356
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,529
Angel!

357
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:48,059
- Let go of your mother. Let go!
- Hurry!

358
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:51,900
Listen to me, Ryan.
I said, stop it! Let her go!

359
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,569
It's retreated.

360
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,210
- It's gone deeper.
- That's likely.

361
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,089
From now on, do exactly
as I tell you. Understood?

362
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,710
Anything?

363
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,450
Ethros demon, Ethros box.

364
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:04,220
This is what's used to trap it.

365
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,589
The demon goes dingy
when it's forced out.

366
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,779
Bad sense of direction.

367
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,069
With one of these,
it'll go right into it.

368
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,369
"Confined for a thousand years."

369
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,549
It should work,
but without one of these....

370
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,400
It'll try to make the jump
to the nearest warm body.

371
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:22,079
Right. So you're safe, anyway.

372
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:25,079
Maybe we can build one of these.

373
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,289
"An authentic Ethros box is made of
600 species of virgin woods...

374
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:34,470
...and handcrafted
by blind Tibetan monks."

375
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:38,529
Nope. Don't know any.

376
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:49,440
Melrose and Robertson,
next to the yogurt shop.

377
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:50,920
Blind virgin monks?

378
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,130
No, Rick's Majick 'n Stuff.
He should have one.

379
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,089
- Better hurry.
- Okay.

380
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:01,619
What's happening?

381
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,599
Your Latin sucks.

382
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:20,869
I know your tricks.

383
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:24,400
You can't deter me from
doing what must be done.

384
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:26,380
You? Do something?

385
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:29,450
You can't do anything.

386
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:42,220
You couldn't even watch.

387
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:44,660
Everybody knows you got fired.

388
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,099
Nothing you do is right.
Nothing's gonna make him proud of you.

389
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,440
Skimming the surface
of my mind. Very good.

390
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:57,150
But a mere parlor trick.
Here's one for you.

391
00:28:58,009 --> 00:28:59,519
How many crosses am I holding?

392
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,460
Mistreated for years
and still not good enough.

393
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,460
Not good enough
for Daddy, or the Council.

394
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:14,869
That is to say....

395
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:18,920
Lose your place?
You think these people want you around?

396
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:21,190
I invited him here.

397
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:24,049
You're stupider than he is.

398
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,309
Tell him why he's a fool to trust you.

399
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:36,289
Tell him how you plan to kill him.

400
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,369
- That's not true.
- He's afraid of you.

401
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:44,730
I'll show you fear!

402
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:11,099
Blessed be.

403
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:12,930
Uh-huh.

404
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:14,450
I need an Ethros box.

405
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:16,500
A lady who knows what she wants.

406
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,130
Yes. Just pop it in a bag
and I'm out of here.

407
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:23,099
- I don't have one.
- You don't have one?

408
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:26,480
Well, what's that?

409
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:32,019
- That's a Shorshack box.
- What's the diff?

410
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:35,549
About $20. It's not
available in a mahogany finish.

411
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,680
Looks the same.

412
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,650
Made by blind Tibetan monks?

413
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:42,609
Made by mute Chinese nuns.
That's craftsmanship.

414
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,109
I have an Ethros demon
and I need a box. Will this work?

415
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,700
Probably. Shorshacks are
smaller than an Ethros.

416
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,480
Might be a tight fit.

417
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,019
How big could the demon be?
I mean, it's in a little-bitty boy.

418
00:30:56,849 --> 00:30:57,759
I'll take it.

419
00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:02,299
I think you'll enjoy this quality
item. Shall I have it gift-wrapped?

420
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,500
That was too close.

421
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,039
I let my guard down.
It won't happen again.

422
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,950
You're not going back in there.
It could've killed you, Wesley.

423
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:13,430
And my son? What about him?

424
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:33,009
- Angel, we don't have a choice.
- The good fight, yeah?

425
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:41,240
Guess who's here, Angel.

426
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:43,289
He's talking to me right now.

427
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,349
Doyle wants to ask
why you couldn't protect him.

428
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,309
- What are you doing?
- Ending this.

429
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,269
- So all they had was--
- Get it ready.

430
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,119
You let him die. Just like
he's gonna let me die.

431
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:04,779
Aren't you, Daddy?

432
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,829
Two great protectors.

433
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,910
Get back.

434
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:17,700
Do you renounce Satan?

435
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:22,150
And all his works?

436
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,750
And all his pomps?

437
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,930
Now get the hell out!

438
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:46,990
Ryan?

439
00:32:58,049 --> 00:32:59,240
Uh-oh.

440
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,200
Plakticine!

441
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,150
Clearly, it came up the
elevator shaft.

442
00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:14,349
- So it's up here somewhere?
- No, it's long gone by now.

443
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,119
And good riddance to it.

444
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,809
No, it'll possess again.

445
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,059
We shouldn't have
sent the Andersons home.

446
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,359
It may repossess Ryan.

447
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,609
I don't think so. Not right away.

448
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,599
What are you thinking?

449
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,559
It had to expel a lot of energy
to escape like this.

450
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,460
It'll need time to recharge.

451
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:37,539
You think it's
taken on corporeal form.

452
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:41,349
It absorbs the elements it needs
by manifesting itself physically.

453
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,839
Which means if we find it in time,
we can kill it.

454
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:47,779
He needs a hostile
environment that's damp...

455
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,480
...returning to primordial
volcanic basalt for regeneration.

456
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,710
- Huh?
- Sea caves.

457
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,500
Why didn't he just say that?

458
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:21,909
We're close. Come on.

459
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,610
Angel?

460
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:30,269
Before we go any further,
I want to assure you...

461
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,389
...since we'll
be fighting side by side....

462
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:36,530
What the demon said before--

463
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,949
I know you're not planning to kill me.

464
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,659
But you're willing to.
And that's good.

465
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,389
Now come on.

466
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,250
- You.
- Did you think this was over?

467
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:17,489
You are a fool.
You think to destroy me?

468
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,559
These forces are
beyond your comprehension.

469
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:22,650
Yeah, well, it's a hobby of mine.

470
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,099
You great putrescent bully!

471
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:29,559
Pick on a child?
You think you're impressive?

472
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:33,829
I am Ethros! I corrupted men
before they had speech to name me.

473
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,269
The child was but the last
among thousands.

474
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,130
One more heart to corrupt.
One more soul to suck dry.

475
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,409
Well, chalk up one exciting failure.
You didn't get that boy's soul.

476
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:48,800
What soul?

477
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,670
She has more marshmallows than I do.

478
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,230
We'll have to write
the Nestlé Bunny about that.

479
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,230
Drink up. It's way past bedtime.

480
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:10,250
Do you know what the most
frightening thing in the world is?

481
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:12,309
Nothing.

482
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:16,119
That's what I found.

483
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:20,449
No conscience, no fear, no humanity,
Just a void, I couldn't control him,

484
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,969
I didn't manifest
until you brought me forth.

485
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:29,519
I just sat and watched him
destroy everything around him.

486
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:31,679
Not from evil or any other reason.

487
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:35,239
- He doesn't seem to remember any of it.
- Good.

488
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,260
That boy's mind
was the worst hell I've known.

489
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,800
The marbles, that was you.

490
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:49,079
When he slept, I could whisper in him.

491
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:52,429
I tried to get him to end his life.

492
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,480
You put him in front of the car.

493
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:59,099
I had given up hope.

494
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,309
I'm not afraid of death.

495
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,090
The only thing I fear
is in that house.

496
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,630
He's with his family.
We have to hurry.

497
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,440
Yes, you do.

498
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:14,030
Good night, sweetheart.

499
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,699
Ryan?

500
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:46,710
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

501
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,449
- Open the door!
- Ryan!

502
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:53,550
- Ryan, open the door!
- Ryan, sweetie!

503
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,440
Ryan, open the door!

504
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,309
Stephanie!

505
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:01,599
Listen! Open the door!

506
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:06,010
- Ryan, open this door!
- Ryan!

507
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:12,780
Open this door! Open the door now!

508
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,510
Open this door, now!

509
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:22,710
- What are you doing out there?
- Stephanie!

510
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,369
Ryan, open this door!
Do you hear me?!

511
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,690
Stephanie!

512
00:38:57,449 --> 00:38:59,730
Ryan, open this door now!

513
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:04,429
Mom, Dad, help!

514
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,699
- Stephanie!
- Mom, Dad!

515
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:15,929
- Stephanie!
- Stephanie! Stephanie!

516
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,889
Everybody out! Go! Go! Go!

517
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:57,469
Social Services will take over now.
They'll want to speak to your son.

518
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,130
Can we see him?

519
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:00,969
Not until tomorrow.

520
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,159
- What'll happen to him?
- We'll know after the evaluation.

521
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,829
Thanks for coming by, Kate.

522
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,440
I won't be able to
cover for him anymore.

523
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:32,659
They're gonna want to
know about Ohio...

524
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:34,570
...and everything.

525
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:40,250
I wanted to protect him.

526
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,409
I know.

527
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,179
I was just trying
to hold my family together.

528
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,659
I think you did.
