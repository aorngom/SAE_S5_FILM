1
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:18,087
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:20,812
My teenage daughter is missing.

3
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:24,283
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:30,963
I'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer. Today
is going to be the longest day ofmy life.

5
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:37,642
- I've rewritten the speech.
- What are you gonna say about our son?

6
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:42,648
That seven years ago he was involved in an
accidental death. I want you to stand by me.

7
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:47,009
- Nina, what is goin' on?
- Jack said CTU had been infiltrated.

8
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:50,130
- We can't trust Jamey.
- Are you saying Jamey's a spy?

9
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:52,966
Talk to us, Jamey.
Who's got Jack's wife and daughter?

10
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,806
I didn't know any of this was gonna happen.

11
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:58,202
There is no time, Jamey. Palmer is exposed.

12
00:00:58,293 --> 00:01:01,763
Jack's family is in danger.
You have to start talking to us now!

13
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,089
Jack Bauer, CTU.

14
00:01:04,173 --> 00:01:07,324
You'll be tempted to intervene,
but believe me, Jack,

15
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:10,928
ifyou do, your family dies
and we'll get Palmer anyway.

16
00:01:11,013 --> 00:01:14,289
After he shoots Palmer,
he will handyou his weapon.

17
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:16,490
You gotta be kidding me.

18
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:18,884
Gun! Gun!

19
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:23,686
- Bauer, what's happening?
- I didn't do this.

20
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:28,130
Do you understand?
Please, don't hurt my family. Please!

21
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:32,082
That's it, we're done. Kill the wife and kid!

22
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:38,729
- Eli.
- Yeah?

23
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:41,244
I still need 'em alive.

24
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:57,407
Senator, stay here
until I secure the area.

25
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,404
- Fine.
- Let's get him out.

26
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:01,961
All right, we're on the move.

27
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:28,048
Berkin, stay with the senator.

28
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,928
Hey, hold on, there.

29
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:38,887
Senator, we're clear. Let's go.

30
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:50,408
Let's go!

31
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,884
Let's go. Inside.

32
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:06,011
- Frank Simes?
- This is Bauer?

33
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:07,685
- Yes.
- You gotta help me out.

34
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:11,448
I understand you're obliged to follow
procedure, but please hear me out.

35
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:14,206
- I did this intentionally.
- That I believe.

36
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:17,410
- I didn't mean it like that.
- You called me at 6.30 this morning

37
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:20,053
to get clearance to bring
a weapon to the breakfast.

38
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:25,207
Exactly. If I wanted to shoot someone, I
would've used my own gun. I didn't need his.

39
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:29,722
- What happened?
- I saw him, walked over, identified myself.

40
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:32,043
When I said I had to take him in,
he went for my gun.

41
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:34,931
I had to create a scene
to get Palmer out of the room.

42
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:39,211
If you wanted to get him out of the room,
why didn't you tell us there was a problem?

43
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:42,683
- I'm working under a restricted mandate.
- Cut the crap, Bauer.

44
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:46,083
- Your own people called you in as a suspect.
- What?

45
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:50,451
Tony Almeida from your office called one of
my men and told us you presented a threat.

46
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:54,685
Almeida doesn't have the same information
that I've got. You're running out of time.

47
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:58,561
You had a shooter disguised
as a photographer in here. He's escaped.

48
00:03:58,653 --> 00:04:01,042
Palmer's life is still in danger.

49
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:08,723
Frank, don't go.
I've gotta get outta here! Come on!

50
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:15,241
Get me Palmer's security. And a list of
photographers who checked in this morning.

51
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,244
Yeah, I'll wait.

52
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:27,490
You sold classified information.
People are dead cos of you.

53
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:31,691
The only chance you got of
helpin' yourself is by talkin' to us now.

54
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:35,845
Jamey! The guy you work for,
what's his name?

55
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:40,922
I call him Gaines.
I don't know if that's his real name.

56
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:45,401
Do you have any idea where
he might be holding Teri and Kim?

57
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:50,403
Jamey, stay with us, here.

58
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:54,161
I needed the money. That's all.

59
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:59,282
- I didn't think anyone would die.
- Yeah, well, they did.

60
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:02,126
You better get it together
if you wanna help yourself.

61
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:05,808
Is Gaines the one watching us
through our surveillance?

62
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:08,043
And you set that up?

63
00:05:10,213 --> 00:05:12,807
I can't do anything in here.
I have to get on the floor.

64
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:17,842
We can't cut their video, cos Gaines'll get
suspicious when he sees you walkin' around.

65
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:20,003
I know what to say to him.

66
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:25,727
Did Jonathan get a shot off?
He hasn't checked in.

67
00:05:25,813 --> 00:05:30,011
Find him and tell him to get over here.
I need to know what happened.

68
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:34,768
What the hell is goin' on?

69
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:40,805
- Gaines.
- It's Jamey.

70
00:05:41,693 --> 00:05:44,127
- Why are you using a phone?
- It's OK, we're clear.

71
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:47,046
- I had to remove our tap.
- What the hell is happening?

72
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:50,409
You know that new engineer
they brought in - Milo Pressman?

73
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:53,405
He was getting close to my entry
to the surveillance system.

74
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:55,961
You said you could take care
of this for me, Jamey!

75
00:05:56,053 --> 00:06:00,888
And I did. I removed the tap. You don't need it
any more. I'm just trying to protect you.

76
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:03,648
You wanna protect me? Get me Bauer!

77
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:08,443
- They're taking him to Division.
- Division? Division? I gotta get him back.

78
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,330
- And you will.
- When?

79
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:13,689
I need him now, and if that's not
gonna happen, I will move on.

80
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:18,722
Look, don't do anything until I call over there
and find out what's happening.

81
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,124
All right. Get back to me.

82
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:28,842
- He's not waiting around much longer.
- I'm going to work up the name Gaines.

83
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:39,725
- Where have you been?
- I had to go out.

84
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:42,327
There was some incident
this morning with Palmer.

85
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:45,007
We know. We're working on it.
What are you doing?

86
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:47,368
Nothing. I'm waiting for
the key card from Tony.

87
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:50,729
Forget about that.
You're taking over all of Jamey's projects.

88
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:53,566
- Why?
- Doesn't matter. She's no longer on the team.

89
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:57,362
Fine, but if I'm gonna take over
an entire department, I want a bump in pay.

90
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:00,013
Just do it, Milo. You'll be taken care of.

91
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:06,924
It appears that someone may have had
a gun. Right now, Senator David Palmer...

92
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:07,490
Bam!

93
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:11,164
- That's all we have.
- Mark, call me the minute you find out.

94
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:13,562
- I will.
- What did he say?

95
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:18,481
Just that they have someone in custody.
They don't know who.

96
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:23,169
I don't know why you just didn't listen to
Secret Service the first time they told you.

97
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:25,448
Sherry, don't overreact.

98
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,046
- Remember Annapolis?
- Yeah.

99
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:31,490
When they pulled me out of the auditorium?
But it turned out to be nothing.

100
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:34,246
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean this is nothing.

101
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:38,531
Oh, David, I really don't think
we should be takin' chances today.

102
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:43,010
I've been trackin' this assassin
since midnight! He was here.

103
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:47,052
I know what he looks like. I can help you,
but you've gotta let me contact my people!

104
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,885
- Sit down, Bauer!
- Back off!

105
00:07:48,973 --> 00:07:51,328
Alan, it's OK. I got it.

106
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:56,326
You're not helpin' yourself here, Jack.

107
00:07:56,413 --> 00:07:59,610
- I need to get back in this case.
- That's not going to happen.

108
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,765
I have no choice
but to turn you over to the FBl.

109
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,206
- Can I speak to you off the record?
- No.

110
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:12,488
We can talk on the record.

111
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:24,206
I know you're a good agent, Bauer. You want
to tell me what's really going on here?

112
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:27,888
If you ever repeat what
I'm about to tell you, I will deny it.

113
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:30,771
You'll understand as soon as I explain.

114
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:37,444
My wife and daughter are being held hostage.
If I do not get out of this, they will be killed.

115
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:40,331
- Who's holding them?
- The people that want Palmer dead.

116
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:44,565
They used me to smuggle a weapon
through security and give it to the assassin.

117
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:46,245
Did you?

118
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,131
- Yes.
- I'm not sure you want me to believe that.

119
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:53,923
I had to. They were gonna kill my family. But
I got Palmer out of the room. I saved his life.

120
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:58,245
This sounds crazy, but you've gotta believe
me. Phone my house, send a cruiser over.

121
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,962
My family is gone, they have been taken.
You have to let me go.

122
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:05,932
If I can get out there, I can be the conduit
to these people. I can bring them down.

123
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:11,133
I don't have the authority to release you. I'm
gonna turn you over to District for a debrief.

124
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:16,287
You tell 'em what you told me, maybe
they can help you out of your situation.

125
00:09:18,573 --> 00:09:22,043
- They won't.
- Alan, you and Mitchell take him down.

126
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:32,885
- Sorry, Jack.
- You will be if Palmer dies.

127
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:40,244
I'll take him.

128
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:45,604
Keep movin'.

129
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:52,368
Don't move! Don't move!

130
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,044
All right. Go ahead.

131
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:27,844
- Hold it right there!
- Get down now!

132
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:32,168
Stay down!

133
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,130
- Don't shoot! It'll explode!
- Do not fire.

134
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:40,683
We don't need an explosion in here.
Take it outside!

135
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,725
Bauer!

136
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:51,084
Get outta the way!

137
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:59,845
Bauer's heading south. Do you copy?

138
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,925
Bauer!

139
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,325
Bauer!

140
00:11:16,013 --> 00:11:17,605
Bauer!

141
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:32,244
- Open the passenger door!
- Don't shoot!

142
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,803
Open the door! Don't panic.
I don't wanna hurt you.

143
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,652
- There he is!
- Drive the car!

144
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:44,851
Drive! Drive!

145
00:11:57,293 --> 00:11:59,284
Drive the car!

146
00:12:05,653 --> 00:12:08,451
- Turn left into this driveway now.
- OK.

147
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:21,848
Make a right at the end of the parking lot.

148
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:24,242
- Turn right! Turn right!
- OK! OK!

149
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:28,045
Dammit!

150
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,324
Back it up.

151
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:35,410
- No, no, no. Back up the other way.
- All right!

152
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:38,166
Go forward. Go into the construction site.

153
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:40,244
- Go, go, go!
- OK.

154
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:45,563
Slow down. Let this truck pass.

155
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:53,322
Turn in there. Through the gates.

156
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:57,762
Parking spot on the left. Take it.

157
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:06,288
Calm down. I just need to make
one phone call and then I'll let you go.

158
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:08,682
Put the car in park.

159
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:12,448
Now get out of the car.

160
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,769
Please get out of the car. Get out of the car.

161
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:25,844
Come on.

162
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:28,812
OK.

163
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:30,851
OK.

164
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:33,128
Get under the scaffolding.

165
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:44,529
Up the stairs. Quick. Go.

166
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:46,205
Go.

167
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:52,242
- Open the door.
- It's locked.

168
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,283
How could you do this?

169
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:03,648
Betray your country. Be responsible
for the death of people you work with.

170
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:06,682
I didn't know any of that
was going to happen.

171
00:14:06,773 --> 00:14:10,766
Oh, that's right. You just
tapped on the keyboard, right?

172
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,202
So, how much they payin' you, huh?

173
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:20,852
A million? Two million?

174
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,808
300,000.

175
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:32,683
I could use 300,000 bucks. Everybody
around here could use some extra cash.

176
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:37,563
I had a husband who left me and my son
with nothing. I had to do something.

177
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:40,727
- And this is what you did?
- Yeah, that's right.

178
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,692
I work twice as hard as anyone here,
and I make half as much.

179
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:48,368
- Do you think that's fair?
- You didn't have to take the job.

180
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:52,330
You don't know
what kind of pressure I'm under.

181
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:54,802
Oye, eres una vergüenza.

182
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:04,046
Got Milo working on the name Gaines.
What else has she given you?

183
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,931
- Excuses.
- Well, we gotta keep Gaines calm.

184
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:10,531
Call him and say Jack's on his way
back to CTU from Division.

185
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:15,641
- Keep him on the phone as long as you...
- I'm not saying anything until I get immunity.

186
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:18,201
In writing, signed by Chapelle.

187
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:27,286
- Hello?
- Jack!

188
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,328
Thank God you're OK.
They wanted me to kill you.

189
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:33,644
That's why I put the flak jacket on -
I couldn't think of anything else.

190
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:37,282
- Why did they want you to kill me?
- You started piecing it together.

191
00:15:37,373 --> 00:15:40,570
- Nina, I am so sorry.
- No, it's OK. I'm fine.

192
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,565
What's happening with Teri and Kim?

193
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:48,488
They're being held hostage. They said they'd
kill them if I didn't help them take out Palmer.

194
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,767
Where are you now?

195
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:52,492
Secret Service had me in custody,
but I just got away.

196
00:15:52,573 --> 00:15:55,167
- Where are you?
- I'm back at CTU.

197
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:57,323
They've tapped into our surveillance.

198
00:15:57,413 --> 00:16:00,803
Don't worry about it.
We found their inside person. It's Jamey.

199
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,851
No, no, no, that's not possible.
Walsh cleared her.

200
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:07,130
We've got her right here.
She's already confessed.

201
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:10,804
Oh, my God.

202
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:17,203
Oh, my God. She had access to everything.

203
00:16:20,453 --> 00:16:21,932
Did she mention Teri or Kim?

204
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:24,971
She just knows there was
someone named Gaines.

205
00:16:25,053 --> 00:16:26,691
- What else?
- She's not cooperating.

206
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:28,206
What do you mean?

207
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:31,808
She wants a letter of immunity
from Chapelle before she says anything.

208
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:33,246
- Is she there?
- Yeah.

209
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,324
Put her on the phone.

210
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:37,805
- Talk to him.
- No.

211
00:16:37,893 --> 00:16:39,611
Jamey.

212
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:42,684
- She's listenin'.
- Jamey?

213
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:45,763
Yeah?

214
00:16:45,853 --> 00:16:51,291
I know that Nina and Tony don't understand
what you're going through, but you know me.

215
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:54,171
I don't care about protocol
and I am true to my word.

216
00:16:54,253 --> 00:16:58,246
If you help me bring down Gaines and
help get my wife and daughter back safely,

217
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,086
I promise you I will get you out of this.

218
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:03,926
- You don't have the power to do that.
- Of course I do.

219
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:07,972
Right now only four of us know about this.
I can take care of Nina and Tony.

220
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:10,408
I can get this done. Jamey, please.

221
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:14,122
No. You'll say anything.
I want the immunity first.

222
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:22,202
What do you want me to do, Jack?

223
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:27,728
She has a son named Kyle.

224
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,926
- Bring him in.
- Wait a minute, Jack. You can't do that.

225
00:17:32,013 --> 00:17:34,925
- You gotta be careful.
- I also need a car.

226
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:39,643
Put a CTU com unit in it, box of 9mm ammo,
a locksmith kit, the whole package.

227
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:42,611
- And then?
- I'll try and get out of this situation.

228
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:46,288
- I'm gonna go find Teri and Kim.
- Where do you want the car?

229
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:49,802
Corner of Temple and Mercer.

230
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:51,372
OK.

231
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:54,088
- Thank you.
- Bye.

232
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:02,842
Who are you? What's goin' on?

233
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:07,608
A few hours ago someone
kidnapped my wife and daughter.

234
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:12,132
I don't get it. Then why are you
runnin' from the police?

235
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:14,363
What's your name? Lauren?

236
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:22,162
I'm Jack. I work for
a special branch of the government.

237
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:25,690
Last night I was given
a very important assignment.

238
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:29,163
Right now someone is trying
to stop me from doing it.

239
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,722
You don't believe me, do you?

240
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,609
If I were you, I wouldn't believe me either.

241
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:47,608
What I wanna know is, why do you have me
here? You got a car, you got a place to hide.

242
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,253
I can't afford to be taken back into custody.

243
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:55,726
If they get close enough, I have to make them
believe I'm willing to do something crazy.

244
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:58,284
Like shoot me?

245
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:03,848
I'm not gonna shoot you.

246
00:19:09,053 --> 00:19:11,044
You know somethin'?

247
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,888
I think I believe you.

248
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:18,530
- What are you doing?
- You're not the only one who has problems.

249
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:21,047
I just came off of a hellacious night shift,

250
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:26,207
I'm due in court in 45 minutes
on a DUl charge, of which I'm guilty,

251
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:29,490
so, you know,
good luck with your crisis, OK?

252
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,766
Don't!

253
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:36,492
Lauren, I have killed
two people since midnight.

254
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:38,723
I have not slept for over 24 hours.

255
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:44,126
So maybe... maybe you should be a little
more afraid of me than you are right now.

256
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:48,530
Sit.

257
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:08,045
- Are you OK?
- Oh, no need to worry.

258
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:13,002
- We heard there was someone with a gun.
- Um, it's not clear what happened.

259
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:18,121
And I'm afraid I'm intact and as grouchy
as ever. So let's all get back to work.

260
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:22,247
- Where's Keith?
- He left about a half-hour ago.

261
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,244
- Did he say where?
- No.

262
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,245
- Look, I'm a little worried about him.
- Why?

263
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,803
He wasn't being himself.
He stormed out of here like he was angry.

264
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:33,885
- I'm sure he'll be all right, Anna. Thanks.
- OK.

265
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:39,006
Should we... send someone after him?

266
00:20:39,093 --> 00:20:43,086
No. No, he's OK.
He just needs some time alone.

267
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:50,763
I'll call Secret Service.

268
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,568
David.

269
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:59,125
I know how you feel about telling our side
of the story first, but there is no time for that.

270
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:04,731
Maureen is gonna go on air at nine o'clock.
That's 40 minutes from right now.

271
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:07,805
Isn't there anything we can do to stop her?

272
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:10,009
She won't budge.

273
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,444
And why would she?

274
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:17,891
"Candidate's son faces murder charges.
Cover-up suspected. " It's a huge story.

275
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:22,444
I cannot believe that you are just going to
accept this without puttin' up a fight.

276
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:26,970
There's nothing to fight. It doesn't matter
who breaks the story, me or Maureen.

277
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:31,171
- We have to deal with it and get past it.
- You've done the impossible for your career.

278
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:34,325
- I'm just asking you to do it for your son.
- No.

279
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:37,771
You're asking me to rewrite history.

280
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:41,607
And if you wanted my help, you would've
asked me for it seven years ago.

281
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:44,161
Oh, for crying out loud, David!

282
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:50,528
- I need today's schedule in my office.
- Yes, sir, right away.

283
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:57,964
- Almeida.
- It's Jack. Where's Nina?

284
00:21:58,053 --> 00:22:01,045
She's workin' up some information
we got from Jamey.

285
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:03,010
- Is Kyle there yet?
- No, not yet.

286
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:06,802
- What about the car?
- Nina sent it. Should be there... ten minutes.

287
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:10,442
- Good. Anything else from Jamey?
- Nothing useful, no.

288
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:15,607
Tony, Secret Service told me that you were
the one who told 'em to take me outta play.

289
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:18,207
Yeah. I felt I had to, Jack.

290
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:21,603
Given the information you had,
I think you made the right choice.

291
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:26,813
I didn't realise what you were goin' through.
You didn't need me givin' you attitude.

292
00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:31,205
Yeah, well, I appreciate that. Look,
I wish I knew earlier who I could trust.

293
00:22:31,293 --> 00:22:34,490
I'm just glad you were there
when Nina came back to CTU.

294
00:22:34,573 --> 00:22:36,086
Yeah.

295
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:39,971
- I'll call you as soon as I get to the car.
- All right.

296
00:22:40,053 --> 00:22:41,247
Bye.

297
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,972
Hey, Lauren. Come here, to the window.

298
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,972
See that tool there,
looks like a hedge trimmer?

299
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:52,964
What, the bolt cutters?

300
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:56,523
Yes, the bolt cutters.
Could you get them for me, please?

301
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:01,452
Hey. Hey. I'll be watching you.

302
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,491
Good.

303
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:46,041
Do it with a burst. Give it everything you got.

304
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,328
I know how to use bolt cutters.

305
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:54,085
Good.

306
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:05,406
That was Frank Simes from
the Secret Service. What are you doin'?

307
00:24:05,493 --> 00:24:10,044
- Pouring myself a drink, Mike.
- It's not even nine in the morning.

308
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:13,728
- What did Simes say?
- The CTU agent who created the disturbance

309
00:24:13,813 --> 00:24:16,452
at the power plant was named Jack Bauer.

310
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:20,370
He tried to take the gun off
one of the Secret Service agents,

311
00:24:20,453 --> 00:24:23,604
but claimed the gesture was misinterpreted.

312
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:25,888
- Maybe it was.
- Yeah, well...

313
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:29,727
As Bauer was being taken
into custody, he escaped.

314
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:32,646
- How the hell did he do that?
- I don't know.

315
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:35,850
But they haven't found him yet.
He's still out there.

316
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:38,529
Jack Bauer. Jack Bauer.

317
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:40,964
You know him?

318
00:24:41,053 --> 00:24:42,850
I've heard the name.

319
00:24:58,253 --> 00:24:59,925
Get up.

320
00:25:00,573 --> 00:25:04,407
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt her.

321
00:25:05,973 --> 00:25:09,568
- Get up and go in the other room.
- Don't even think about touching her.

322
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:11,450
Move it!

323
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:13,410
- No.
- Don't touch her!

324
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:16,371
You stay outta this or I will hurt her.
Come on.

325
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,201
No! Get away! No! Get away!

326
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,612
Shut up!

327
00:25:30,173 --> 00:25:32,164
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

328
00:25:33,213 --> 00:25:35,204
I won't fight you.

329
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:45,327
- Mom?
- It's gonna be all right, honey.

330
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:52,049
Come on.

331
00:25:53,573 --> 00:25:55,564
- Come on.
- All right.

332
00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:58,763
- Fine.
- OK.

333
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:18,565
Mom!

334
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,722
- Maureen Kingsley.
- Thanks.

335
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:13,726
- Maureen, hi. Thanks for getting back to me.
- I'm about to go on air, Sherry. What's up?

336
00:27:13,813 --> 00:27:16,281
- Don't go with the story.
- Excuse me?

337
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:19,410
The story about Keith.
Just leave it alone for right now.

338
00:27:19,493 --> 00:27:21,882
The s... Hold on, please.

339
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,362
Can you give me one minute? Thanks.

340
00:27:29,253 --> 00:27:33,087
The story about Keith is exclusive
and it's documented.

341
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:35,482
I'm not making false allegations about him.

342
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:40,203
There was an assassination attempt
this morning on my husband,

343
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:42,443
but it's being covered up.

344
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:45,406
Go on.

345
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:48,326
The man they arrested
works for the government,

346
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:51,007
and he may not have been acting alone.

347
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:56,964
Are you telling me that there's a conspiracy
inside the government to kill your husband?

348
00:27:57,053 --> 00:28:00,204
I am telling you something's going on
that hasn't been reported.

349
00:28:00,293 --> 00:28:02,853
And if you give me a couple of hours...

350
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:05,928
I'll milk some of my sources.

351
00:28:07,213 --> 00:28:10,046
OK, look, I won't kill the story about Keith.

352
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:14,843
I'm not asking you to.
Just... hold off on it for a couple of days.

353
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,772
Mom.

354
00:28:26,853 --> 00:28:30,926
- I'm sorry. This is all my fault.
- No, no, no. It's OK, honey. It's OK. Shh.

355
00:28:31,013 --> 00:28:33,766
If I hadn't snuck out,
this wouldn't have happened.

356
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:35,206
Listen to me.

357
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:40,206
We are going to get through this.
We're gonna be a family again.

358
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:43,605
You and me and Dad
are gonna have our lives back.

359
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:52,449
This is not gonna be a part of that life.
You understand what I'm saying?

360
00:28:53,253 --> 00:28:55,448
You're not gonna tell Dad?

361
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:02,612
Where did you get that?

362
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:08,008
- CTU. Myers.
- Nina, listen, it's Teri.

363
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:10,288
Teri, where are you?

364
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:14,323
Hello? Hello? Teri?

365
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:17,844
Hello? Teri?

366
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:21,206
The number's blocked.

367
00:29:22,613 --> 00:29:24,763
Stand in that corner.

368
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:14,128
No, I don't wanna go on with the governor.

369
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:17,171
Put him on first. If he's got a problem,
have him talk to Mike.

370
00:30:17,253 --> 00:30:20,848
- It'll look like he's introducing you.
- Good. I want it to look that way.

371
00:30:20,933 --> 00:30:23,322
- OK.
- Dave, I'll talk to you later.

372
00:30:27,853 --> 00:30:30,413
- Where'd you go?
- Oh, I just went out.

373
00:30:30,493 --> 00:30:33,053
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

374
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,605
Um... you didn't tell the press about me.

375
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:41,003
It's gonna come out soon, anyway.

376
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:45,564
Look, I've talked to my lawyer,
and he's got his best people workin' on it.

377
00:30:45,653 --> 00:30:48,963
- His best people. Right.
- Look, Keith, don't be this way.

378
00:30:49,053 --> 00:30:54,081
You're gonna be cleared. You're gonna get on
with your life without it hangin' over you.

379
00:30:55,373 --> 00:30:57,091
Sure.

380
00:30:57,173 --> 00:30:59,403
You ready to go?

381
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:02,610
Kingsley's gonna break the story.
Have we prepared something?

382
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:04,604
No longer necessary.

383
00:31:04,693 --> 00:31:06,809
- What?
- I just got off the phone with her.

384
00:31:06,893 --> 00:31:09,487
She's gonna sit on the story for now.

385
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:15,126
- Why would she do that?
- I don't know. Maybe you got through to her.

386
00:31:15,213 --> 00:31:17,807
No, I didn't. It's something else.

387
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:22,132
Ready?

388
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,808
Maureen Kingsley decided to
hold off on the story for some reason.

389
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:29,522
- Thank God, David.
- You have any idea why she'd do that?

390
00:31:29,613 --> 00:31:34,323
No. Maybe her sources weren't
as solid as she said they were.

391
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:39,522
What? Aren't you relieved?

392
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:43,808
- I wanna talk to her.
- After she gets off the air, we'll call her.

393
00:31:43,893 --> 00:31:46,282
Don't you think it's smarter to let things be?

394
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:50,651
- It's smarter to know everybody's motives.
- Come on, let's go.

395
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:52,724
Come on.

396
00:32:06,253 --> 00:32:09,962
- Where do you work?
- Cable's coffee shop on Ventura.

397
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,443
Home of the 3.99 all-day breakfast.

398
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:17,130
You married?

399
00:32:17,213 --> 00:32:23,209
I used to be. But my sister moved in with us
after she got into a really bad car accident.

400
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:28,321
She couldn't take care of herself, and my...
my husband Henry told me I had to choose.

401
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:31,450
- You chose your sister?
- Yep.

402
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:35,850
- Is this your first DUl?
- First in a couple of years.

403
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,610
- You got a problem?
- What, a drinking problem?

404
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:45,971
I wish it were that simple.
At least then I'd have a support group.

405
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:51,009
Nope, what I'm afraid I have is bad luck.

406
00:32:54,413 --> 00:32:57,211
Sorry I had to get you involved in all this.

407
00:32:57,773 --> 00:33:00,048
Just let me go.

408
00:33:00,893 --> 00:33:03,088
As soon as I get my car.

409
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:08,168
As soon as I get my car.

410
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:13,333
I used to be in the military.

411
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:15,643
Used to do field work for the CIA.

412
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:19,931
I've been to some horrible places.

413
00:33:20,773 --> 00:33:23,367
I've seen some pretty terrible things.

414
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:29,241
I don't think I've ever been
this scared in my whole life.

415
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:35,446
No, I told you I'm not saying
any more until I get counsel.

416
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:38,172
- I think you will.
- Why do you think that?

417
00:34:39,053 --> 00:34:41,362
Cos we're bringing Kyle here.

418
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:43,161
What?

419
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:50,083
- I'll kill you if you touch my son.
- We're not gonna lay a finger on him.

420
00:34:50,853 --> 00:34:55,051
But if you don't help us find Gaines, we don't
have a choice but to bring him in here.

421
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,124
No, you won't.

422
00:34:58,373 --> 00:35:00,364
- No.
- We will, Jamey.

423
00:35:01,973 --> 00:35:06,364
Imagine the effect it'll have on him,
seeing his mother in restraints.

424
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:10,882
- Arrested for being a traitor.
- No. This is not fair.

425
00:35:11,493 --> 00:35:15,725
That's a picture he's gonna
carry with him the rest of his life.

426
00:35:18,693 --> 00:35:20,285
Nina...

427
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:22,885
Please.

428
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:27,011
Don't do this.
Kyle can't see me like this. Please, Nina.

429
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:30,529
He doesn't have to.
You just have to start talking to us.

430
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:33,252
The bottom line is, Jamey,

431
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:37,292
the best thing you can do for your son
is to help us get Gaines now.

432
00:35:37,373 --> 00:35:39,011
Why?

433
00:35:39,093 --> 00:35:44,929
Once we have you in custody, Gaines will do
anything he can to keep you from testifying.

434
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:48,642
And if he can't get to you directly,
where's he going next?

435
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:50,724
Your son, right?

436
00:35:53,893 --> 00:35:55,485
Kyle...

437
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:17,724
I'm just...

438
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,324
confused.

439
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:24,043
I need time to think.

440
00:36:26,413 --> 00:36:28,802
Take a couple of minutes.

441
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,451
Lauren, I'm in big trouble.
I need your help, please.

442
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:55,208
I've gotta get to a car, but if I step outside,
they'll take me into custody.

443
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:57,568
- And you want me to pick it up?
- Yes.

444
00:36:57,653 --> 00:37:02,204
- Bring it back here. Park it round the side.
- Why didn't your friend drop it off here?

445
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:06,809
The person dropping it off was just following
orders. He couldn't know it was for me.

446
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:09,532
Aw! Do you realise how insane this sounds?

447
00:37:09,613 --> 00:37:11,604
Yes, I do.

448
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:24,286
OK, let's just say for the sake
of argument I believe half of it.

449
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:29,128
Just tell me one thing. Is your wife
and daughter really in trouble?

450
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,204
Yes, they are.

451
00:37:33,973 --> 00:37:39,605
- All right. Where's the car?
- Over on the corner of Temple and Mercer.

452
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:43,686
It's a silver sedan, government plates.
The keys'll be in it.

453
00:38:12,693 --> 00:38:15,571
Keep going, Lauren. Keep going. Come on.

454
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,732
No.

455
00:38:23,253 --> 00:38:24,845
No.

456
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:29,206
- Hey! Hey! Excuse me!
- No!

457
00:38:29,293 --> 00:38:30,885
Dammit!

458
00:38:45,253 --> 00:38:47,972
Jack! He's out the window! I see him!

459
00:38:48,813 --> 00:38:51,611
All right, this is Hayes. I got a 20 on Bauer.

460
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:25,162
- So, what have you got?
- I tried "Gaines" under various spellings.

461
00:39:25,253 --> 00:39:29,849
I came up with a long list of those with
records and those with criminal associations.

462
00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:35,291
Crosscheck it with everything else we got
tonight. Plane crash, Alan York, Penticoff.

463
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,409
Got it.

464
00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:40,690
- She's had enough time to think about it.
- Yeah.

465
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:48,532
Jamey's son Kyle's gonna be brought in.
Call me in ITS when he gets here.

466
00:39:48,613 --> 00:39:52,891
- Wait. What kinda trouble is she in?
- No trouble.

467
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:56,329
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
You tell me to take over her stuff,

468
00:39:56,413 --> 00:39:59,564
you and Tony are gone for an hour,
now you're bringing her son in?

469
00:39:59,653 --> 00:40:03,805
- She's in trouble. I wanna know what's...
- You're not an internal affairs agent.

470
00:40:03,893 --> 00:40:06,805
Keep quiet. Call us when Kyle gets here, OK?

471
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:11,808
- He's gonna figure it out.
- It won't be a secret much longer anyway.

472
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:16,569
But we need to bring Milo in. Whatever
Jamey gives us, he'll be the one to work it up.

473
00:40:16,653 --> 00:40:19,645
- I hope it's somethin' substantial.
- Yeah.

474
00:40:21,013 --> 00:40:22,924
Oh, my God.

475
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:25,004
- Get her out of those!
- Jamey?

476
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:27,084
What's the number?

477
00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:34,053
- Hang in there. Come on. Come on, now.
- We need medical help. We're in ITS.

478
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:36,169
Hurry!

479
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:38,244
Grab her legs.

480
00:40:39,493 --> 00:40:42,485
Watch her head. Jamey, what have you done?

481
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:50,564
- What?
- It's Milo. Should I bring Jamey's son in?

482
00:40:50,653 --> 00:40:52,848
No! Keep him out of here.

483
00:41:25,213 --> 00:41:27,204
It's Gaines.

484
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:04,405
