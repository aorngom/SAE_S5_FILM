1
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,836
Mr President?

2
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,759
We need medical assistance! Help!

3
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,951
This is security. I need help at the ramp.

4
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,797
Clear, sir.

5
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,558
Clear.

6
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,278
Step over there, please.
Give 'em lD.

7
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,197
There you go.

8
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,911
Open one.

9
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,358
You OK, Jack?

10
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,920
I won't be OK until we get this thing signed.

11
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,480
That's not what I meant.

12
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,920
OK. We're all here.

13
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,549
- What kind of changes are we talking about?
- They're not deal breakers.

14
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,315
He's still gonna give up the terrorist cells.

15
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,120
He just wants to go to a class 2 detention.
Not maximum security.

16
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,678
- You're giving him it?
- Yeah.

17
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,718
My client's not happy that
you won't hold him in Florida.

18
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,920
- He's getting Minnesota.
- Give him Florida. There's no difference.

19
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,990
I let you do your jobs.
Why don't you let me do mine?

20
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,959
We don't want this thing
going south over some detail.

21
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,075
Salazar is unstable. We can't predict what'll
push his buttons. There's too much at stake.

22
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,590
I know you two spent the last year
getting Salazar and I respect that.

23
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,238
- But there's a protocol that I have to follow...
- Luis, come here for a second.

24
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,520
Putting him away is not the point. If he
doesn't talk, we've accomplished nothing.

25
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,751
I didn't lose a year of my life
to arrest some drug dealer.

26
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,591
Salazar deals with terrorist cells around the
world. Bringing them down is our objective.

27
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,120
I understand. But if you give Salazar
everything he asks for, he's gonna want more.

28
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,271
This is the deal. And he's going to take it.

29
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,992
Here.

30
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,711
You better be right.

31
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,790
Douglas. Is that my life
you're holding in your hand?

32
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,195
It's ready to be signed.

33
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,190
Are you in there, Jack?

34
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,920
(Douglas) Forget about Bauer.

35
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,753
How can I forget about
the man who put me here?

36
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,593
Pretended to be my friend.

37
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,032
I'm concerned about you, Jack.

38
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,920
The things you did to get me here,
I wouldn't wish on anyone.

39
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,115
Let's face it, you'll never be the same.

40
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,309
Hey. Neither will l.

41
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,957
So I guess we are in the same boat.

42
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,069
I'm about to name names, Jack.
This is a big moment for both of us.

43
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,997
That makes me happy.

44
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,876
Because, you see, we are connected now.

45
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,190
I don't know. Maybe we always have been.

46
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,920
I marked the changes.

47
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,920
I don't need to see the changes.
But I do need the pen.

48
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,708
Unless you want me
to sign it with my own blood.

49
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,918
That's kind of funny - "my own blood".

50
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,312
Where do I sign this, Douglas?

51
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,992
Right here.

52
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,469
You have done a good job as my counsel.

53
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,920
Been a go-to guy, as they like to say here
in the States. But I think they're on to you.

54
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,879
And I don't think you have
what it takes to keep your mouth shut.

55
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,918
(Douglas) What do you mean?

56
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,838
Son of a bitch.

57
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,909
Open the door. Open the door!

58
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,678
Do it now!

59
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,793
- Get a medic in here. Now!
- This is your fault, Jack.

60
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,118
- And what happens next is on you, too.
- What does that mean, huh? Is that a threat?

61
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,920
- Chase!
- Son of a bitch.

62
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,514
- Back off!
- Take a walk!

63
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,880
Did you hear me?

64
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,197
Did you hear me?

65
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,320
What happens next is on you, Jack.

66
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,311
It's on you!

67
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,640
- Dr Macer. We isolated the body.
- You said my name was on it?

68
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,279
Yes. It's on his chest.

69
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,116
Run a full panel of tests to be sure, but I think
we're dealing with a pneumonic virus, type lll.

70
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,279
Type lll? Isn't that the virus group
your team's been doing simulations on?

71
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,476
I think that's why this was addressed to me.

72
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,840
- Has CTU been contacted yet?
- No. We've been waiting for you.

73
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,310
Go ahead and start the pulmonary tests.
I'll call Director Almeida.

74
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,235
Hey. The President arrive at SC yet?

75
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,040
Just about. We're swapping our people
now Secret Service is in place.

76
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,076
They're waiting for
your resource assessment.

77
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,840
All right, I'll call 'em.

78
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,840
- I've had it, Tony, I swear to God.
- What's the problem, Adam?

79
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,240
Chloe O'Brian does not touch my data.

80
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,949
If Field Ops wants something, she asks Jack
or talks to you, then you tell me.

81
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,440
- Did she damage anything?
- That's not the point.

82
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,040
My department has zero downtime
because of the procedures I put in place.

83
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,759
- Did she damage anything? Then let it go.
- No...

84
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,194
Jack's got his department and I got mine. But
we're all under the same roof, understood?

85
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,310
Good. Now, lighten up. You're gonna
drive yourself and the rest of us crazy.

86
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,078
All right. Hold on.

87
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,159
Sunny Macer from Health Services
is on the line.

88
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,319
- By the way, have you heard from Hertzog?
- No, not yet.

89
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,392
- Relax, Michelle, you're gonna get the job.
- You're not going to Langley without me.

90
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,916
Hey. What's up?

91
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,710
- This is one I'm sorry to be right about.
- What are you talking about?

92
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,115
Cordilla virus.
It's a type lll pneumonic virus.

93
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,840
Remember I raised the possibility
a strain could be out there?

94
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,875
- Yeah.
- It is.

95
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Someone just dropped off a dead body
infected with the virus.

96
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,477
These guys are serious. They blew up the
door to get our attention. This is a message.

97
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,071
That somebody's got the virus
and they're willing to release it?

98
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,240
Yeah, exactly.

99
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,040
Do we need to issue a quarantine advisory?

100
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,918
No. Once the host is dead it's not contagious.

101
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,240
Call the other county facilities,
see if there are any more cases.

102
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,028
- What about the lD on the John Doe?
- Send everything over. We'll work it up.

103
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,040
- It's on its way.
- All right. Thanks, Sunny.

104
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,440
What is it?

105
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,432
Initiate a level one setting protocol.

106
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,440
(Salazar) And I don't think you have
what it takes to keep your mouth shut.

107
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,749
(Douglas) What do you mean?

108
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,040
Salazar could have killed Shaye any time
over the last three months. Why today?

109
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,953
- He was cutting his deal.
- Maybe, but I don't think so.

110
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,791
This is your fault, Jack.
And what happens next is on you, too.

111
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,429
"What happens next."

112
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,238
- CTU.
- This is Bauer. Patch me through to Almeida.

113
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,040
Hold on.

114
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,076
- (Tony) Hey.
- Is anything going on there?

115
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,399
We just had a major protocol come in.
Possible biothreat to the city.

116
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,840
Tell me about it.

117
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,469
A dead body infected with the Cordilla virus
was left at Health Services.

118
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,398
We figure it's the first shoe dropping. We're
waiting for somebody to take responsibility.

119
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,032
- Jack?
- Yeah.

120
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,240
You thinking this is connected to Salazar?

121
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,232
I don't know. I don't know, maybe.

122
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,993
- I'll get back to you.
- All right.

123
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,189
- I need copies of all four images.
- Right away.

124
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,590
(cheering)

125
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,358
- Mr President.
- Wayne. Are we ready for the run-through?

126
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,360
Almost. The advance team dropped a ball
so we can't get in there for a few minutes.

127
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,560
- That's fine.
- No, it's not fine. I fired Judy. It was her fault.

128
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,960
She's done some good work for us,
hasn't she?

129
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:42,229
Tonight's debate is critical. She should have
had every single base covered but she didn't.

130
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,160
Mr President. How do you feel about
the debate with Senator Keeler?

131
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,354
Confident. Ready to go.

132
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,591
Sir, this is your first time back to LA
since the attempt on your life.

133
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,838
- Were you uneasy about coming back?
- Not at all.

134
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,750
Los Angeles is a great city. Would've been
back here sooner if events had allowed it.

135
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,436
What is important is that we're here now,
looking to the future.

136
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,714
Thank you. That's all for now. We'll have a
formal Q&A this afternoon. You'll be briefed.

137
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,988
David, we gotta talk about those GAO
members. Keeler's gonna bring it up tonight...

138
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,111
David? David, are you all right?

139
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,834
I'm fine.

140
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,395
- Let me call one of the resident doctors.
- No, it's all right. I'll wait for Anne.

141
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,560
- Where you going, Jack? We have to talk.
- Not now.

142
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,358
- Then when?
- Call me. Right now we gotta get to CTU.

143
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,629
Why?

144
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,912
Salazar killed Shaye for a reason. He picked
today to do it. We gotta find out why.

145
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,793
Fine. Let's go back in there
and put the screws on Salazar.

146
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,999
You think he's gonna talk to us after
what we just watched him do? Not a chance.

147
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,832
Come on. Let's go.

148
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,152
Jack.

149
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,794
Just call me.

150
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,472
All right, so what else did Almeida say
about this dead body?

151
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,232
- Jack.
- What?

152
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,954
I asked you about Tony.
What else did he say?

153
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,876
He said the body was dumped
at Health Services. They're trying to lD it.

154
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,550
You know, you never answered me before.
About how you're doing.

155
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,154
- What are you talking about?
- You know what.

156
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,437
(phone rings)

157
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,357
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Chloe.

158
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,760
I have Kate Warner for you.
Should I put her through?

159
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,239
Uh...

160
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,960
Yeah. Put her through.

161
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,188
- Jack?
- Hi, Kate.

162
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,470
I just wanted to let you know I found
that leather jacket you thought you'd lost.

163
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,760
Oh. Uh...

164
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,070
- OK. Great.
- So, uh, what do you want to do?

165
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,669
I could bring it over. Or send it.

166
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,230
You don't have to do that.
I'll just send someone over to pick it up.

167
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,873
- You sure?
- Yeah.

168
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,396
- OK, then.
- Kate. How are you?

169
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,951
You know, it's hard.

170
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,757
I miss you.

171
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,716
I'm really, really sorry.

172
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,673
Don't be.

173
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,838
- Take care of yourself, Kate.
- Bye.

174
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,115
- How's Kate?
- She's all right.

175
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,549
- So you guys are still talking?
- No, not really.

176
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,154
All right. None of my business. Sorry.

177
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,271
I didn't mean it like that. She's just trying
to return a couple of things of mine, that's all.

178
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,396
Got any water?

179
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,158
Talk to Sunny. She was checking with
the other facilities for any more cases.

180
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,071
If there are, find out where.

181
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,950
Take all the regional cells
that have bioterrorist capabilities

182
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,960
and put 'em in a high-speed cache.

183
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,473
- OK.
- (phone rings)

184
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,877
Tony, it's Larry Hertzog from Langley
on line two.

185
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,559
Hey, Larry.

186
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,069
Yeah, we are.

187
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,078
Uh-huh.

188
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,078
Uh-huh.

189
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,549
Yeah, I will. Thanks.

190
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,360
- Was that about me?
- Yeah.

191
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,593
He doesn't have a job for you right now.
There's no new funding till after the election.

192
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,637
I see.

193
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,117
Also, Larry told me that he needs
an answer from me by the end of the day.

194
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,915
They're in a hurry to fill the post.

195
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,433
We both know you can't pass this up.
It's a major career move.

196
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,069
Call him and tell him it's yes.

197
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,469
And you'll come along as the wife?
Without a job?

198
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,676
I'll go anywhere with you.

199
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,115
As long as I don't have to cook.

200
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,560
Sweetheart, if you promise not to cook,
I will take you with me anywhere.

201
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,269
But if they don't have a job for you,
I'm not interested.

202
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,954
(phone rings)

203
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,360
Tony. Homeland Security on line one.

204
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,635
We'll talk about it later.

205
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,470
Almeida.

206
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,550
Pretty much. Just have to refresh
the data on my panel. Thanks.

207
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,198
- Hey, Kim.
- Yes, Michelle?

208
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,716
- You ever done a capability search?
- Couple of weeks ago, for Tony.

209
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,760
- The East European cells?
- Yes.

210
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,548
Good. This one's different.
It's gonna be global.

211
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,110
- Here's my access code.
- I'll get right on it.

212
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,873
Thanks.

213
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Hey, Adam.
Does the link file have DES encryptions?

214
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,720
No, it's two key.

215
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,039
- What volume is the filter on?
- Etude seven.

216
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,954
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

217
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,392
Are you saying you had to break me?

218
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,677
No, mi angel.

219
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,430
It was you who break me.

220
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,596

221
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,037
 ïQu Á mas?

222
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,554
 ïSeguro?

223
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,036
Si, se Íor.

224
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,680
OK, it's coming up now.

225
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,671
Thanks, Chris.

226
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,072
- Adam, I'm piping this over to your system.
- What is it?

227
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,880
Frags on the body that was dropped off at
Health Services. We're doing an lD analysis.

228
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,714
- Where are you in the capability search?
- It's gonna be another 15 minutes.

229
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,880
- So you're open?
- What do you need?

230
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,758
Adam'll break off part of an lD.
We need a name. Give her the file.

231
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,996
- I don't need her help.
- Yes, you do.

232
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,032
This is urgent.

233
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,794
I'm ready, Adam. Send the file.

234
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,038
- I'm open, Adam. Send me the file.
- No.

235
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,197
- Michelle told you...
- I don't need anyone doing my work for me.

236
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,280
- What is your problem?
- Everyone in this place earned their job.

237
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,919
You got it cos of your dad.

238
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,598
What the hell is this?

239
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,632
(dials phone)

240
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,875
- Tracy, is your system locked?
- No.

241
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,957
OK, thanks.

242
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,680
It could be you forgot
to set the group permission.

243
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,558
Someone who knows
the tree structure changed the ownership.

244
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,629
That wouldn't be me because I'm incompetent
and only got this job because of my dad.

245
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,592
- Change the ownership back, Kim.
- Send the data fork.

246
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,669
It's your ass. Michelle's waiting.

247
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,834
Fine. I'll send it. Just unlock my system.

248
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,157
No problem.

249
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,069
- Hey, Jack, I'll be up in a minute.
- OK.

250
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,110
Chloe. Give me what you got.

251
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,798
Are we in sync with the systems?

252
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,075
Everything Health Services sent
is in volume one.

253
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,080
- I've reprised all the Salazar information.
- Where are the date keys?

254
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,880
- I couldn't get those for you.
- Why not?

255
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,509
You'll have to talk to Tony, so he can tell
Adam and Adam can give them to me.

256
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,915
- You're kidding me, right?
- No. Adam's anal and he hates women.

257
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,880
Chloe.

258
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,838
Just get it for me, OK, please?

259
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,472
Close my door.

260
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,757
(grunts)

261
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,471
(phone rings)

262
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,279
- Yeah?
- It's Michelle.

263
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,280
The teleconference with Health Services
is about to start. Come down.

264
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,680
No, I'm gonna stay up here.
Patch them through.

265
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,079
- OK.
- Thanks.

266
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,355
You scared me.

267
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,993
- What are you doing in here?
- I am refreshing a drive.

268
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,911
What's going on with Salazar?
Were you there when it happened?

269
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,480
Yeah.

270
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,436
Yeah, it was pretty crazy.

271
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,275
How's my dad taking it?

272
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,436
- He's OK.
- Good.

273
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,190
I was thinking about talking to him today.

274
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,680
Uh-huh.

275
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,880
- Today might not be the best day.
- Chase, no day is a good day.

276
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,280
We said that we would tell him if we were still
together after two months. It's almost three.

277
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,829
Why don't we just tell him
and get it over with?

278
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,911
All right.

279
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,036
But I'll do it. OK?

280
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,880
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

281
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,598
- Really?
- Really.

282
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,031
You can't put the drives there.
What I need you to do is look under...

283
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,233
- F6, right?
- Yeah. OK, thanks.

284
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,120
We received results of more tests.

285
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,120
The news isn't good.
This is a weaponised strain.

286
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,680
It has been engineered to kill more rapidly.

287
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,917
How rapidly?

288
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:01,320
It's a bit of a guess but, based on the autopsy,
if infection starts at T equals zero hours,

289
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,320
there 's a noncontagious latency period
of 14 hours.

290
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,429
After 14 it presents. After 20 the host
is incapacitated. By 24 the host is dead.

291
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,911
What are the epidemiological consequences?

292
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,993
If the virus initiates at a single location,

293
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,675
there will be a couple hundred cases
by the end of day one.

294
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,120
By the end of day two
it could be in the thousands,

295
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,720
but from there it's easier to talk about
in percentage of population.

296
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,920
By the end of the first week, nine per cent
of Los Angeles county will be infected.

297
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,708
Nine per cent?
That's over a million people.

298
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,320
And those people will die
within 24 hours of infection.

299
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,633
So tell me, if someone were gonna try to
release this virus into the general population,

300
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,199
how would they do it?

301
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,274
That's the million-dollar question.
It could come from anywhere.

302
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,320
We don't know who has it.
We don't know where they plan to release it.

303
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,720
We don 't even know what form it's in.

304
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,915

- (woman) Kyle?

306
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,397
What, Ma?

307
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,920
- Tim wants you to know he's at the pool.
- Thanks, Ma.

308
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,629
Can you take me to the doctor
later on this afternoon?

309
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,193
- What's Dad doing?
- On a job interview. Fingers crossed.

310
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,629
Fingers crossed.

311
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,120
Can Aunt Norma take you?

312
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,918
Why? What's so important
that you can't take me?

313
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,109
I mean...

314
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,552
It's just I got a bunch of stuff
to do today, Ma. I'm sorry.

315
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,753
- Fine. I'll call Norma.
- Thanks.

316
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,838
Love you, Ma.

317
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,276
Mr President. The country was in shock
after the attempt on your life.

318
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,512
But its prayers were answered
when you survived.

319
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,320
That said, many Americans have expressed
concern that you are not fully recovered,

320
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,039
and are not strong enough
to serve for four more years.

321
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,312
How would you respond
to those who make such claims?

322
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,320
I wake up every morning at 5am.

323
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,120
I spend the first hour in the weight room.

324
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,120
While I'm exercising,
I'm prepping for my meetings.

325
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,396
- And then I put in a 16-hour day...
- Hold on!

326
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,676
Could we pause the video, please?
Get ready to play it back.

327
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,835
Sorry, Chuck. Hold on. Don't dignify
that question with a defensive response.

328
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,320
I didn't realise that stating
the facts was being defensive.

329
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,030
They bring up the assassination attempt, fine.
You remind them it was your administration

330
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,509
that arrested the man
behind the attempt on your life

331
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,476
and exposed his organisation
and put his top-tier people away.

332
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,917
All this while you were in
this so-called "weakened state".

333
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,520
Keeler would be lucky to have a fraction
of your energy. That's what you tell 'em.

334
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,920
Mr President. Go ahead, Chuck.

335
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,798
And Mom called him the timid brother.

336
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Ah, there's my doctor. How are you?

337
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,312
- Mr President.
- (Wayne) All right. Let's break for a minute.

338
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,120
I'm fine. How's he been?

339
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,557
- Seems a little tired.
- I am not tired. I'm just a little jet-lagged.

340
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,433
How's this going?

341
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,553
I'm definitely winning the run-through.

342
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,273
(phone rings)

343
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,598
- 130 over 80.
- Good. This is Wayne Palmer.

344
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,475
- How tired?
- I'm fine.

345
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,230
- We haven't done a workup in a while...
- No. No, no, no. No tests.

346
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,920
You start looking for something
and you don't stop until you find it.

347
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,956
I'm fine, Anne.

348
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,520
OK.

349
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,920
But when you get back to DC, I want you to
have a complete physical. Doctor's orders.

350
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,320
Yes, ma'am.

351
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,676
Anne. I need him alone for a minute.

352
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,878
- He's all yours.
- What is it?

353
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,920
I just received a disturbing call
from Health Services.

354
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:33,320
They found a body in Los Angeles that's been
infected with a contagious and deadly virus.

355
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,993
There's concerns
it's not just a random occurrence.

356
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,198
- Meaning what?
- CTU is looking to the possibility

357
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,515
that this could be a criminal action.

358
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,439
Criminal action? Based on this one death?

359
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,520
I don't know the details,

360
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,798
but it has to do with the circumstances
under which the body was found.

361
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,959
- Keep your eye on this one.
- OK.

362
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,037
Chuck, can we go down to question seven,
about homeland security?

363
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,516
- Chloe.
- Yes?

364
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,918
- Where are the transcripts of Salazar?
- I sent them to your system, in your directory.

365
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,600
Dammit, I wanted it stored
with the rest of the files from Salazar.

366
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,114
OK. I'll do it.

367
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,400
Chloe, if you can't get things right
the first time, I can get someone who can.

368
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,358
If you wanted it with the other files
you should have said so.

369
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,600
- That isn't standard, so I wouldn't do it.
- Do it that way from now on, OK?

370
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,354
I can't read minds. You'll just
have to spell it out for me, otherwise...

371
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,200
Dammit, Chloe! Just do it now!

372
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,395
Fine.

373
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,874
Hey, Jack.

374
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,600
What?

375
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,229
- What was that all about?
- I need you to replace Chloe for me.

376
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,200
Replace her? She's the best analyst we got.

377
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,111
- She's not. She's slow.
- She's not slow.

378
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,831
She may be a little weird
but she knows her stuff.

379
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,595
You look like hell.

380
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,231
What did you just say to me?

381
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:32,118
We're on an active protocol, OK?
I need to know if you're up for it or not.

382
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,555
I like working with you, Chase.
You're a nice kid.

383
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,197
But don't you ever come into my office
and talk to me like that again. Understand?

384
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,830
I'm just saying you're on edge. OK?

385
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,357
I mean, come on, man,
you're about to fire Chloe for no reason.

386
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,955
- Chloe.
- Yes?

387
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,993
I'm sorry I took your head off.
We're just having a bad morning, OK?

388
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,589
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

389
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,439
You're happy?

390
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Look, Jack. There's one more thing
I gotta talk to you about.

391
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,831
(phone rings)

392
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,356
- This is Bauer.
- (Tony) We've got something new on Salazar.

393
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,591
OK, we'll be right down.

394
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,833
They got something on Salazar.

395
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,512
What do you wanna tell me?

396
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,000
Nothing. It'll hold.

397
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,718
Good.

398
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,952
In order to plug any possible security
breaches, we'll do date checks from now on.

399
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,309
Break your logs into eight-hour intervals.

400
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,598
Put different encryptions on each interval. If
one is breached, one won't bleed to the other.

401
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,310
- Did you tell him?
- No. There's a lot going on. It'll happen.

402
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,240
An anonymous call came in to the FBl ten
minutes ago. They're gonna stream it to us.

403
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,708
- Did you hear it?
- Yeah.

404
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,073
- OK. It's ready.
- Bring it up.

405
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,040
(distorted) You've received our package
and realised we're in possession of a type lll

406
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,600
pulmonary immuno virus.

407
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,440
Listen very carefully to these instructions.

408
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,795
Our demand is very simple.

409
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,358
We want the release
of Ram Ãn Salazar in the next six hours.

410
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,240
If you refuse to comply, the virus
will be unleashed to the general population.

411
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,677
As your experts will tell you,
you will not have time to stop its spread.

412
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,237
Details of how Ram Ãn
is to be delivered will follow.

413
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,040
- That's it.
- Do we know where the call originated?

414
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,640
It came out of a scrambled satellite signal.
We're trying to narrow it down.

415
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,349
You know Salazar better than anybody else
here. Who are we dealing with?

416
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,240
His brother. Hector was next in command.

417
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,993
He went underground
when Ram Ãn was taken into custody.

418
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,440
Look. I know that the Salazars own multiple
properties in South America and Mexico,

419
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,317
registered under dummy corporations.

420
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,440
Unfortunately, the Mexican government
is saying they can't locate them.

421
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,399
We're gonna have to throw out a pretty large
net to trace the origin of that call.

422
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,040
- We'll work on it.
- How are we doing with the lD on the body?

423
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,271
- Michelle's running the DNA.
- What about prints and dental?

424
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:18,350
- No teeth, no fingertips.
- We need this lD. It's the only hook we've got.

425
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,158
What about questioning Salazar?

426
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,630
Complete waste of time.
This is a man without vulnerability.

427
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,040
He doesn't respond to interrogation or care
about a living soul, including his children.

428
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,395
Tony! We've a match on John Doe.

429
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,993
- Show us what you got.
- The dead body is a David Goss.

430
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,198
He's a street dealer in East LA,
also an informant.

431
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,240
He flipped sides so many times
DEA stopped working with him.

432
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,151
- Last known address?
- We're working on it.

433
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,191
We need to know who infected Goss. Work up
a list of people involved in his life this week.

434
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,830
- We'll pull together everything we can.
- Work it from the other side too.

435
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,040
Go through Salazar's network.
Find the supplier who sold to Goss.

436
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,318
Good work. Chase, come with me.
Let's see if anything's come in on Hector.

437
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,910
Entonces, asegurate. Que no se note nada.

438
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,315
Si, se Íor.

439
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,840
Ponle el petrol. Ponle fuego.

440
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,035
Sigue, ponle el petrol.

441
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,752
Why do you have my father
doing this kind of work for you?

442
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,638
It's not his job.

443
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,876
It is today.

444
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,314
Why did you kill Shaye?

445
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:07,953
Take a look around. You're in a US prison
where your ass will rot until you're executed.

446
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,880
You want to improve your conditions here,
you better start talking to me.

447
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,032
- What do you want to talk about?
- Why did you kill your attorney?

448
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,992
- I didn't want him talking to you.
- About what?

449
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,832
About anything.

450
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,399
It's eating at you, isn't it?

451
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,880
What am I up to? Come on, Luis.

452
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,317
You have me in chains. Two tough guys
waiting for a chance to beat me to a pulp.

453
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,636
Do it, Luis!

454
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,753
See if you can beat it out of me.

455
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,271
You are no fun.

456
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,832
Where are you going?

457
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,279
Claudia.

458
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,429
Claudia.

459
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,913
Claudia!

460
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,880
What's wrong?

461
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,678
My father is the ranch foreman.

462
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,838
You promised he wouldn't be involved
in your other activities.

463
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,792
I pay him three times over.
He can perform an extra task or two.

464
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,713
No, no, no. No.
I told you when we came to live here

465
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,159
that I didn't want him or my little brother
to be exposed to your illegal business.

466
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,072
You broke your word, Hector.

467
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,830
And that hurts me.

468
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,308
It hurts.

469
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,193
I'm sorry, Claudia.

470
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,597
- Please, I make it up to you.
- How?

471
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,470
I give your father some time off.
An extra month's pay.

472
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,431
That's your solution
to every problem, isn't it?

473
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,393
Money.

474
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,280
Claudia.

475
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,077
Claudia.

476
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,677
Claudia!

477
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,071
(phone rings)

478
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,719
- Yeah?
- Have you made the call to the FBl?

479
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,957
Yes, I did.

480
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,358
- What about our boy?
- I'm watching him now.

481
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,869
- Keep him close.
- I will.

482
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,070
So what was it like to get knee-deep
in some fine Tijuana dell?

483
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,880
Huh?

484
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,680
- I didn't do that.
- What do you mean?

485
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,956
I mean I didn't go down there to get laid.

486
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,511
- But you said...
- No, I know. I know what I said.

487
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,232
I just didn't wanna tell you
in case something happened.

488
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,275
So, what's the big secret?

489
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,719
Remember Zach Parker from high school?

490
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,469
Sure. Didn't he get busted last year
for dealing coke?

491
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,674
Yeah, yeah.

492
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,080
Whatever. He set me up
with this guy down there.

493
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,312
- "Set you up"? How do you even know him?
- I know him, OK?

494
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,838
What are you into here, man?
Are you selling dope?

495
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,080
No.

496
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:49,518
- I'm not exactly selling anything...
- Then exactly what are you doing?

497
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,880
This guy... he paid me five grand
to bring some coke over the border.

498
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,793
I did that last night.
Today I drop it off, I get another five.

499
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,196
- You're outta your mind.
- It's just one time.

500
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,950
Getting over the border's the hard part.
That's already done.

501
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,880
Why are you doing this?

502
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,556
Cos my mom's on dialysis.
My dad's out of a job.

503
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,117
We're about to get evicted from this crappy
apartment. Is that good enough for you?

504
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,756
Dude, you are seriously insane.

505
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,672
Look, Tim.

506
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:27,280
I'm about to make this drop later today.
I was thinking, maybe we could go together.

507
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,080
- Forget it!
- You just wait in the car.

508
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,392
I go in, I make the drop, I come back out.
That's it. There's no big deal.

509
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,438
I'm not interested.

510
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,472
Think about it.

511
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,071
(girl squeals)

512
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,230
- Mr President, sir.
- Mr President, sir.

513
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,280
Carry on.

514
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,034
- When did FBl get this call?
- About 20 minutes ago.

515
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,080
- We don't know who we're dealing with?
- It was a scrambled voice on an open line.

516
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,756
All we know is what he said. They want
Salazar or they're gonna release the virus.

517
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,919
What's your take on this, Wayne?
Do we cancel the debate?

518
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,198
So far, DOD, the Pentagon and CTU
haven't recommended raising the alert level,

519
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,080
but they are discussing whether or not
we should stay in Los Angeles.

520
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,880
- Sir.
- Yes, Aaron?

521
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,950
Dr Packard's here. She's asked to see you.

522
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,829
- Tell her I'm busy, please.
- Yes, Mr President.

523
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,871
Aaron, wait.

524
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,280
- Tell her I'll speak with her.
- Yes, sir.

525
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,113
You really wanna do that right now?

526
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,999
Yes, Wayne, I do.

527
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,469
- Yes, Anne?
- I want you to start taking these.

528
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,519
One in the morning and one before
you go to bed. It'll help your energy.

529
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,036
- I told you I was fine.
- I know what you told me.

530
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,556
Are you gonna trust your doctor or not?

531
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,036
Course I am.

532
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,555
So, what's going on? You seem upset.

533
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,916
Nothing.

534
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,280
It's just gonna be another one of those days.

535
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,238
What does that mean?

536
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,953
I've got to get back.

537
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,633
OK.

538
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,158
We'll talk later.

539
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,200
- What is wrong with this system?
- What?

540
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,953
The grid won't come up.

541
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,915
That's because you need
to "control S" out of it.

542
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,639
You're still in Navigation.

543
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,672
Thank you.

544
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,315
Look, can you just patch it
through to my office?

545
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,110
(coughs)

546
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,279
- What's his problem today?
- Nothing.

547
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,439
This time line goes straight
from December to February.

548
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,400
- What are you trying to do, Jack?
- Same as you. Solve this problem.

549
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,517
That's not what I'm talking about.

550
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,555
Listen, Jack.

551
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,000
I'm gonna be honest with you.

552
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,956
I look up to you.

553
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,520
I'd take a bullet for you if I had to,
but right now I'm gonna hold the mirror up.

554
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,597
You were under with Salazar for six months.

555
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,000
I know what they did to you.

556
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,594
And I know what you did to yourself.

557
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,994
You can't make that go away overnight.

558
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,916
You think I didn't know?

559
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,633
You should mind your own business, Chase.

560
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,988
All I'm trying to say
is that I'm here for you.

561
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,000
But today is not the day to try
to prove to everybody that you're all better.

562
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,039
It's about to hit the fan.
You know that and I know that.

563
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,198
So do what you gotta do, man.

564
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,078
Get your head straight so we can do our work.

565
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,000
(phone rings)

566
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,309
Dad, you up there?

567
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,113
Dad?

568
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,274
Yeah.

569
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,200
Can I come up?
I need to talk to you about something.

570
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,474
Uh...

571
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,958
Not right now, sweetheart.
I'm in the middle of something.

572
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,992
OK. Call me when you have a few minutes.

573
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,399
OK.

574
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,429
