<i>Put the gun down Team</i>

2
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,350
We have your husband,

3
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,709
<i>but he sustained
a gunshot wound to the chest.</i>

4
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:22,019
<i>Is my husband going to be okay?</i>

5
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:24,190
We're not going to know it
until the doctors see him.

6
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,317
He was the only leverage
that Dubaku had left,

7
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,569
<i>he must be trying
to leave the country now.</i>

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,821
We have to find him fast.

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,908
Whatever it takes,
I want that son of a bitch found!

10
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:37,995
Have someone find my daughter,
Olivia, and bring her to me.

11
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,825
What is it that's so important
for my mother to steal me away

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,375
- while I'm trying to do business?
- It's your father.

13
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,671
- He's been shot.
- My, God, I...

14
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:48,880
Do you think I'm a fool,
Mr. Burnett?

15
00:00:49,923 --> 00:00:52,551
If anything should happen to me
on my way out of the country,

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,242
a data file with all the names
and transactions of all those involved

17
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:57,139
will be sent
to the Justice Department.

18
00:00:57,804 --> 00:01:01,631
You told me that once Dubaku
served his purpose, you'd take him out.

19
00:01:01,756 --> 00:01:04,342
- Why are we still helping him?
- He's threatening to expose us

20
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:07,108
using a database he's kept with names
and accounts of everyone involved.

21
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:08,693
Including mine?

22
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,237
We don't know where it is,
you better pray that he gets away.

23
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,114
I'm begging you, Marika...

24
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:15,825
- FBI! Don't move!
- Get on your knees! Now!

25
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:18,155
- Where is Dubaku?
- Who?

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,246
Don't play games with me!
Ike Dubaku!

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,165
- You know this man?
- She was going to meet him.

28
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,109
When the car arrives,
we would like you to go with the driver,

29
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:28,002
so that we could follow you
back to Dubaku.

30
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:30,089
You want her to go to him
and face him?

31
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,591
It's our only chance of finding him
before he disappears

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,135
- forever.
- I'll do it.

33
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,096
- You keep her safe, you hear me?
- We will.

34
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,473
You're less than a mile
behind the car.

35
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,352
I got Metro PDs
trying to build a roadblock around us.

36
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:48,774
We can't afford to lose them, Jack!
I gave her my word we'd protect her.

37
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,775
Get out of the vehicle slowly.

38
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,738
- She's a federal agent!
- On your knees.

39
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,448
She's a federal agent!

40
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,285
<i>She's been turned by the FBI.</i>

41
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,037
If you let her come to you,
you're risking your chances of escape.

42
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:04,686
<i>I'll call my driver,
have him take care of her.</i>

43
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,876
I'll take care of her.

44
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,265
<i>Yes. It's under my authority.</i>

45
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:30,858
- Sean, I need to talk to you.
- Is it important?

46
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,735
You tell me. Did you issue

47
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,737
- a federal warrant on this vehicle?
- What?

48
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,246
I found a digital footprint
on server four's backup partition.

49
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:38,800
It originated from your station.

50
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,264
- What the hell is going on?
- Keep your voice down.

51
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:43,098
You want to get us caught?

52
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:46,594
I sent out the warrant
to sideline Bauer and Renee.

53
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:48,880
They were closing in on Dubaku.

54
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:51,006
You said Dubaku's on his way
out of the country.

55
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:53,261
He is, but his girlfriend's
talking to FBI.

56
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:55,142
They used her to track him.

57
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,188
- Oh, my God.
- Don't worry, I took care of it.

58
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:01,023
Bauer and Renee are in police custody.
By the time they're released,

59
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,779
Dubaku will be long gone.

60
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:05,075
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

61
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,269
Why didn't you just tell me
what was happening?

62
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,797
'Cause I knew you'd react like this.

63
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:15,504
The last thing I need right now
is one of your meltdowns.

64
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,406
Now, listen, I got you into this,

65
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,697
and I'm going to get you out of it,
but not if you start panicking.

66
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:23,490
- You've got to keep it together.
- I'm just really scared, you know?

67
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:26,872
I know. I am, too. I'm just
better at hiding it than you are.

68
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:28,642
I've got everything covered.

69
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:31,160
I ran a bounce-tap
into the conference room speaker phone

70
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:34,151
that they'll never find,
I can hear everything they're saying.

71
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:37,252
Now, sit at your station.
Try and act normal.

72
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:40,790
Let me worry about Bauer and Renee.

73
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,281
Okay?

74
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,856
The man we were tracking is responsible
for today's terrorist attack.

75
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,750
Let us go,
or he's going to get away.

76
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,096
Look, my Captain's on the phone
with your superior.

77
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:59,013
You're making a mistake!
You've got to let us go!

78
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,584
That warrant had to be sent out
by one of Dubaku's operatives.

79
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,172
- I know.
- Dubaku knows Marika's working with us.

80
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:08,496
He will kill her, Jack.

81
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,458
- We should not have used her like this.
- She was our only asset.

82
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:13,836
She's not an asset, Jack.
She's a human being.

83
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:29,294
Colonel.

84
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:35,856
The FBI is still looking
for us, sir.

85
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:38,280
I'll do this quickly.
Wait there for me.

86
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:43,949
Samuel.

87
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:48,787
- What is it? Sweetheart, what's wrong?
- Give me your cell phone.

88
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,707
- My cell phone?
- I know you've been talking to the FBI.

89
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:54,136
You've been working
for them, Marika.

90
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:57,379
I don't know
what you're talking about.

91
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:01,830
What are you doing?

92
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,439
I trusted you!
How could you do this to me?

93
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:18,859
The FBI told me who you really are.

94
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,461
About the terrible things
you've done.

95
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,489
- And you believed them?
- They showed me proof!

96
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,346
They showed you lies
created by my enemies!

97
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,162
You don't know me.
And you don't know my country.

98
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,450
I brought peace to Sangala.

99
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,961
Don't be afraid, huh?

100
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:41,840
It's just...

101
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,578
When I heard what you had done,

102
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:47,069
it was like you had driven
a dagger through my heart.

103
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:51,411
I'm a forgiving man, Marika.

104
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:54,311
I still want you to come with me.

105
00:05:54,857 --> 00:05:57,066
I want to give you
the life that I promised.

106
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,792
I can't go with you.

107
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,278
I don't know who you are.

108
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:04,646
You do.

109
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,741
You do.
If you look past your fear,

110
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:11,233
you'll see that I am still
the man that you fell in love with.

111
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:16,912
I won't leave without you, Marika.

112
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:28,355
All right.

113
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,736
You won't be disappointed.
Come.

114
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:46,900
The FBI may be close.

115
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:53,805
Your story was verified by FBI.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.

116
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,109
- Did FBI find Marika Donoso?
- I don't know.

117
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:59,525
You can ask them yourself.
Agent Moss wants to talk to you.

118
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:02,633
- Larry, where are they? Where's Marika?
- We lost her cell phone signal.

119
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:05,781
- What do you mean? What happened?
- Just went dead about 3 min ago.

120
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:07,108
- Where?
- In an alley

121
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:09,993
on the corner of N and 10th Street.
I'm looking through traffic cams now.

122
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:12,407
All right, we're going to comm.
Standby.

123
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,710
They lost Marika's signal.

124
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:26,901
- That's it.
- Jack? We got a make on the car.

125
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:29,658
It's a dark gray Jeep Grand Cherokee,
turned south on 11th Street

126
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,493
<i>- about two minutes ago.</i>
- Copy that. Moving to intercept.

127
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,539
- Did you see Marika?
- Yes. She got in the car with Dubaku.

128
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,082
- Chloe, stay on those traffic cams.
- I'm on it.

129
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,212
We're ten minutes from the airfield.
Is my plane ready?

130
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,764
Fueled and waiting.

131
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,013
Did you take care of the problem?

132
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,426
She's had a change of heart.
She's coming with me.

133
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:54,720
Colonel, she was working with the FBI.
You were almost arrested because of her.

134
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:56,058
She's not your concern.

135
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,144
You just worry about getting me
out of the country.

136
00:08:02,797 --> 00:08:03,902
Who was that?

137
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:07,444
It was a government official.

138
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:10,806
He's been working for me.
A very corrupt man.

139
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,501
I look forward to no longer
dealing with people like him.

140
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:20,999
I want to spend time
with people I really care about.

141
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:34,926
They're still on 11th. They just
crossed over to New York Avenue.

142
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:36,051
Copy that.

143
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:37,891
Come on!

144
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,810
- Jack, they're turning left.
- Hold on.

145
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,503
FBI. Go! Go!

146
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,174
Hold on!

147
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,002
Get on top of the car!
Try to maintain a visual.

148
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,059
Jack, they crashed!

149
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,478
Go!

150
00:10:07,052 --> 00:10:08,529
Get back in your car!

151
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,617
Larry, Dubaku's vehicle's
been involved in an accident.

152
00:10:11,742 --> 00:10:13,823
- We need an ambulance, now!
- Copy.

153
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:15,121
Back away!

154
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:23,229
Stay on your knees!

155
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:25,082
Get on the ground, now!

156
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,002
Now!

157
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,905
I got Dubaku.

158
00:10:52,704 --> 00:10:55,279
Agent Walker, the car is on fire.
Get out of there!

159
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:58,832
Get out of there!

160
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:08,818
I gave her my word,
so back off or help me.

161
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,172
It's her leg, it's pinned.

162
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:26,091
Hold on.

163
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:30,383
Pull... pull!

164
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:33,867
Go!

165
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:38,904
Jack.

166
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:40,989
Go! Go!

167
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,692
You all right?

168
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:56,378
Larry, where is my ambulance?

169
00:11:56,962 --> 00:11:59,176
Dubaku's badly injured.
He's unconscious.

170
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:02,031
- I need that ambulance now.
- They're on their way, Jack.

171
00:12:34,716 --> 00:12:37,087
Admiral Smith estimates
we'll have the capitol of Sangala

172
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:38,799
secured within the hour.

173
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,562
He's surprised how little resistance
our troops have encountered.

174
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,263
And you'll be happy to know
we have liberated

175
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,724
the refugee camp
in Kasanga Province.

176
00:12:48,803 --> 00:12:51,272
2,000 civilians
are safe from Juma's forces.

177
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:55,730
Madam President?

178
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:58,445
I'm sorry, Ethan.

179
00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:00,940
Oh, my God, Kasanga Province.

180
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:03,163
That's... That's very good news.

181
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:07,834
Maybe we should
finish this another time.

182
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:10,789
Can I get you anything,
Madam President?

183
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:13,434
No, thank you.

184
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,461
Would you like to talk about it?

185
00:13:20,802 --> 00:13:23,510
What happened to Henry
was my fault, Ethan.

186
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,024
He never believed
our son committed suicide.

187
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,093
He was right.

188
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,691
And I didn't listen to him.
And if I had,

189
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:37,524
we wouldn't be here right now.
Henry wouldn't be fighting for his life,

190
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,261
and we might have exposed
this conspiracy.

191
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:43,566
Our government
wouldn't be paralyzed.

192
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,658
I didn't believe Henry, either.
No one did.

193
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,515
But I'm his wife.

194
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:52,429
He deserved my trust.

195
00:13:56,026 --> 00:13:57,270
Madam President?

196
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,964
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- It's all right, Bill. Go ahead.

197
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,634
I just spoke to Larry Moss at FBI.
We captured Dubaku.

198
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,945
He was seriously injured
in a car crash during the pursuit.

199
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,598
- How bad?
- Critical, non responsive.

200
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:12,300
Bauer and Walker are with him.

201
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:14,857
They'll be there to question him
should he regain consciousness.

202
00:14:14,982 --> 00:14:16,722
So, you're saying
that if Dubaku dies,

203
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:19,463
our chances of uncovering
this conspiracy die with him.

204
00:14:19,588 --> 00:14:23,280
He could be the only one who knows
the names of everyone he's corrupted.

205
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:27,574
Madam President, given this latest news,
it's not safe for you to remain here.

206
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,723
I strongly urge you
to return to the White House.

207
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:31,578
I'd prefer to stay with my husband.

208
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,097
You're too exposed.
I can't effectively protect you.

209
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:36,124
Am I any safer at the White House?

210
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:39,365
My administration
has been corrupted, Bill,

211
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,464
and now you're telling me
we're about to lose our only lead.

212
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:46,343
I assure you I've taken every precaution
to secure the White House.

213
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,693
It's the safest place
for you to be right now.

214
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:51,598
Henry will be in surgery
for several hours,

215
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,109
Madam President.

216
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:55,289
There's nothing more we can do here.

217
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:58,748
You are needed in the Oval Office.

218
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:07,781
All right.

219
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,441
I'll have the cars brought around,

220
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:11,871
and redirect your daughter's escorts
to the White House.

221
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:13,240
Thank you, Bill.

222
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:20,558
What are we going to do, Ethan?

223
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,502
How can we possibly run this government
when we don't know who we can trust?

224
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:29,290
We'll just have to pray Jack Bauer
can get those names from Dubaku.

225
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,238
- You got him stabilized?
- Yes. We're transporting him right now.

226
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:40,708
- I need to talk to him.
- He's in no condition to speak.

227
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,525
He has information vital to national
security. Bring him around now.

228
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:45,081
Now!

229
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:47,195
One milligram epinephrine.

230
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,580
I know you can hear me.
You're in federal custody.

231
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,498
They're trying to save your life.

232
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,071
You want them to continue,
tell me what I want to know.

233
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:04,425
I want the names of everyone
that you've been working with.

234
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:08,529
Come on. You and I both know the game.
It's over for you now.

235
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:11,154
There's no sense
in trying to protect them.

236
00:16:12,812 --> 00:16:14,754
You and I, we're both soldiers.

237
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,205
I know you don't care about your life,
but you got a family.

238
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:21,238
I know where your son is in Sangala.
I know where he lives,

239
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:24,274
and I swear to you, I will track him,
and I will make him suffer,

240
00:16:24,913 --> 00:16:27,857
and I will make sure that he knows
his father was responsible.

241
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:31,520
All you got to do to make me stop
is give me the names.

242
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:33,302
Just give me the names.

243
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,203
Don't hurt my family.

244
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,112
I have a list...

245
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:40,043
list.

246
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:43,126
- Where is the list?
- His BP's spiking.

247
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:45,503
- Where is the list?!
- He's going into cardiac arrest.

248
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,392
- Bring him back!
- Get the paddles. Start at 200 joules.

249
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:50,081
Clear.

250
00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:52,384
No response, there's a glitch.
Once more.

251
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:54,136
Clear.

252
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:56,940
There it is again.
Electronic interference.

253
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,977
This could be it,
feels like a metal plate or something.

254
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,312
All right.
Amping up to 300.

255
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,865
- Clear.
- Where's the plate?

256
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,774
He's stabilized,
let's get him boarded.

257
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,326
- Where's the plate?
- It's below his rib cage.

258
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,311
- Open him up.
- We don't have time.

259
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:13,187
- I have to ask you to step aside.
- You open him up now.

260
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:15,374
Do it.

261
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:33,990
Sir, this man will die
if we don't get him to the hospital.

262
00:17:34,115 --> 00:17:35,533
Get him out of here.

263
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:47,565
<i>- FBI.</i>
- Pass me through to Agent Moss.

264
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:50,151
<i>- This is Moss.</i>
- Larry, it's Jack.

265
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,383
Go ahead, Jack.

266
00:17:51,508 --> 00:17:54,888
I found some kind of storage device
implanted under Dubaku's skin.

267
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:57,325
<i>- What is it?</i>
- To protect his family, he said

268
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,686
he would provide me with a list
of all of his contacts.

269
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:01,833
He said it was on him,
he meant, in him.

270
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,179
Larry, this is his insurance policy.
I'm sure of it.

271
00:18:04,304 --> 00:18:07,546
We need that data as soon as possible.
Can you upload the files to FBI?

272
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,546
I've never seen anything like it.

273
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,643
Hold on one second.

274
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:14,709
Officer. Officer.

275
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:17,220
I'm Jack Bauer.
I'm working with the FBI.

276
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,863
Get this device to regional headquarter.
Give it to an Agent Larry Moss.

277
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:23,123
Put this in his hands, his hands only.
You understand?

278
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:24,470
- Yes, sir.
- Do it.

279
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:26,104
A chopper's coming your way.

280
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,057
You should have the drive in 5 minutes.
We're gonna stay with Dubaku.

281
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:31,526
- Get back to us when you got anything.
- Copy that.

282
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:43,997
Sean. What is it?

283
00:18:45,148 --> 00:18:46,224
What's wrong?

284
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:48,087
Listen to me,
and try not to overreact.

285
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,745
We have a situation,
but I think I have a way to handle it.

286
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,003
What situation? You told me
you had everything under control.

287
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,216
I do...

288
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:58,219
- but they have Dubaku's database.
- What?

289
00:18:59,283 --> 00:19:01,738
Our names are on that list.
You were taking care of this,

290
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:03,391
and now they have our names?

291
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:05,674
No, they don't have our names yet,
so here's the plan.

292
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:08,237
Sean,
we have to get out of here right now!

293
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:11,883
- I'm not going to jail. Do you hear me?
- Nobody's going to jail. I promise.

294
00:19:12,008 --> 00:19:13,818
I'm sick of your promises.
You promised me

295
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,448
that this is all taken care of,
that you're leaving your wife.

296
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:20,416
- You make promises, but you never...
- Stop talking, and just listen to me.

297
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,703
I told you I have a way out of this,
but I need your help, do you understand?

298
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,997
Now, listen... okay?

299
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,043
As soon as O'Brian
downloads those files,

300
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:33,046
we're gonna crash the entire system,
every single server on this floor.

301
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:36,595
- That's crazy.
- No, it's not crazy.

302
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,846
We're gonna go up
to the mainframe room,

303
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:41,597
initiate a system-wide reformat.

304
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:44,812
We'll wipe everything clean,
and they won't be able to stop it.

305
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,228
We're gonna have to bypass
a lot of safety protocols, okay?

306
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:51,650
But nobody's better at dealing
with those servers than you are.

307
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,287
Isn't that true?

308
00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:58,078
I need your help.

309
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:00,713
I can't do this without you.

310
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:08,051
Erika?

311
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:10,321
Yeah.

312
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:12,604
Okay.

313
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:21,413
We're gonna have to tie
the main servers together.

314
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,495
I need an AVI motherboard,

315
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,837
but you're gonna have
to reconfigure it for a macro uplink.

316
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:30,508
Okay, and we have to hurry.
The drive is gonna be here any minute.

317
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,250
Go up to the mainframe room
and get started.

318
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,699
I'm gonna prep the motherboard.
I'll meet you up there.

319
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:36,824
Okay.

320
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:42,639
We're gonna be fine.

321
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:45,786
I love you.

322
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:51,601
- I love you, too.
- Okay, let's go.

323
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:21,186
These are Marika Donoso's
personal effects.

324
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:23,469
Thank you.

325
00:21:23,594 --> 00:21:25,408
Copy that. Get back to me.

326
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,886
That was Larry. They got the drive.
Chloe's gonna be working on them.

327
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:33,198
They should have something
in the next few minutes.

328
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:35,281
That's all that matters,
right, Jack?

329
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:38,488
I don't like
what happened to Marika either.

330
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:41,208
We did what was necessary.
You should find a way to live with it.

331
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,071
How, Jack?
Pretend that it never happened?

332
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:44,594
Is it that easy for you?

333
00:21:47,303 --> 00:21:49,818
I'll let you know
when Chloe's got something.

334
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:00,303
Here it is.

335
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:08,649
This is a PX-1-7 drive.
It's got an auto-erase function.

336
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:11,162
We've only got one download.

337
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:34,761
Where have you been?

338
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,522
Just took a little longer
than I thought.

339
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:44,305
- What are you doing?
- Checking surveillance.

340
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,036
Got to keep an eye
on Larry and O'Brian.

341
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:50,118
Once we do this, they're gonna realize
someone's up here in a few seconds.

342
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,375
We'll have to make a clean exit.

343
00:22:55,772 --> 00:22:59,739
- How much longer is this going to take?
- I have to bypass safety protocols.

344
00:22:59,864 --> 00:23:02,281
Once they're down,
I'll start the reformat.

345
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,286
Go ahead.

346
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:10,263
Dubaku hasn't arrived at the airfield,
and he's not answering his cell phone.

347
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:12,140
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- FBI got him.

348
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:13,408
What?

349
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:16,846
- How long have you known about this?
- They won't get anything out of him.

350
00:23:16,971 --> 00:23:19,731
He's unconscious in the hospital.
There was a crash during a chase.

351
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:24,264
Listen, the FBI recovered that database
you told me about, the list of names.

352
00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:26,750
I'm in the process of deleting it.
I'll erase every trace of it.

353
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,240
I don't have to tell you
what will happen if they get that list.

354
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,742
They won't.
I'm gonna take care of the database.

355
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:34,256
- You need to take care of Dubaku.
- Don't worry about him.

356
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:35,288
Damn it!

357
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,873
I got to go.

358
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,166
What's wrong?

359
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,978
- It isn't working.
- What do you mean?

360
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:42,094
All the inputs are active,
the servers are aligned,

361
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:44,691
but the reformat won't start.
It doesn't make any sense.

362
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:46,591
OK, well, just think it through.

363
00:23:47,235 --> 00:23:49,552
- Right? You can do this.
- Would you just shut up, OK?

364
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:54,000
Has to be server three.

365
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,717
Server three was upgraded last week.

366
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,147
Which means they restored the partitions
to the system default settings.

367
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,921
How could I be so stupid?

368
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,735
I just have to configure

369
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:08,074
the parameters.

370
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,573
Okay.

371
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,255
Okay?

372
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,129
Is that it?

373
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:21,665
I think so.

374
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:26,561
Program's running.

375
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,834
- What's happening? What's going on?
- The hard drive's reformatting.

376
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,640
- What?
- The files are being erased.

377
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,774
- We're losing everything.
- Well, make it stop.

378
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:39,802
- I don't have the access.
- Get the PX-1-7 out.

379
00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:41,644
It's too late. It's erased.

380
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:48,569
This is deliberate. It's not a glitch.
Someone's trying to crash the system.

381
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:51,322
- Where's your mainframe room?
- Come on.

382
00:24:56,983 --> 00:24:58,966
Here they come.
We got to get out of here.

383
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:00,540
- Almost there.
- Erika...

384
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,217
- It's done.
- Are you sure?

385
00:25:02,342 --> 00:25:05,482
Yeah. It'll take a few minutes
for the reformat to be complete, but...

386
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:06,906
there's no stopping it.

387
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:08,031
Baby.

388
00:25:08,795 --> 00:25:11,808
- I knew you could do it.
- Yeah. We gonna be OK?

389
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:14,604
We're gonna be fine.

390
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:47,131
Sorry.

391
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:11,748
Get on the floor!

392
00:26:11,873 --> 00:26:14,322
- It wasn't me!
- Get on the floor!

393
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,166
Larry, it wasn't me.

394
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,754
I followed her up here.

395
00:26:30,064 --> 00:26:32,084
She was trying to crash the system.

396
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:33,299
She shot me!

397
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,939
I went for the weapon,
and it went off.

398
00:26:36,064 --> 00:26:38,888
Security, Agent Moss. I need a team
to lock down the mainframe room.

399
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,242
And get a medic up here!

400
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:42,391
- Chloe, can you recover the files?
- I don't know.

401
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,276
What files?
What the hell is happening?

402
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:46,076
You tell me what the hell
is happening!

403
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:48,606
You were shutting me out, Larry,
so I looked around on my own.

404
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:51,369
I found out that Erika
was rerouting the sub-cam channel.

405
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:52,568
What was she doing?

406
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:55,803
She sent out a warrant
on a vehicle with two suspects.

407
00:26:55,928 --> 00:26:58,032
I knew something was wrong.
That's not part of her job.

408
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,255
I asked her about it,
and she tried to deny it.

409
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,828
- She was acting very strangely.
- Why didn't you say anything?

410
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,957
I don't know what the hell it meant,
so I hacked into her hard drive,

411
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,331
and I found schematics
for the main server.

412
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:10,701
Bypass codes
for the safety protocols.

413
00:27:10,826 --> 00:27:13,521
I followed her up here
to see what she was up to.

414
00:27:13,781 --> 00:27:16,566
The second I realized she was trying
to crash the system,

415
00:27:16,691 --> 00:27:18,130
I confronted her.

416
00:27:18,255 --> 00:27:19,541
She shot me.

417
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:23,057
I went for the gun.

418
00:27:23,645 --> 00:27:24,892
I didn't mean to kill her.

419
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:28,980
Hold, hold.

420
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,259
It's too late. The system's fried.
Dubaku's files are gone.

421
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,443
Can you recover anything?

422
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,719
The server's wiped clean.
She got everything.

423
00:27:53,994 --> 00:27:55,580
Is this everything you got?

424
00:27:55,705 --> 00:27:58,377
No, it's not. I didn't have time
to print out every single message

425
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,428
that came through Erika's workstation.
That's...

426
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,180
everything she was doing
for the past three days.

427
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:06,684
Look, Larry,
I told you what happened.

428
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:09,520
I feel like you owe me an explanation.
What the hell is going on here?

429
00:28:15,932 --> 00:28:17,778
The government's been
compromised by Dubaku.

430
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:20,948
FBI, Secret Service.
God knows who else.

431
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:23,911
That's why I shut you out,
brought in Chloe O'Brian.

432
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,996
We were decrypting a file with the names
of everyone on Dubaku's payroll.

433
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,430
Erika erased it
when she wiped the server.

434
00:28:29,555 --> 00:28:31,125
That was our only lead.

435
00:28:32,474 --> 00:28:35,223
You should have told me about this.
You should have trusted me.

436
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:37,214
Sean, I didn't know who to trust.

437
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,465
- You all right? How's your arm?
- It hurts like hell. It's fine.

438
00:28:44,062 --> 00:28:46,673
When you're up for it,
I'm gonna need you to write a statement.

439
00:28:47,631 --> 00:28:49,381
And keep your mouth shut.

440
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,987
We don't know who else in this building
might be working for Dubaku.

441
00:28:53,112 --> 00:28:55,511
- Yeah.
- Larry, don't ask me how, but I did it.

442
00:28:55,636 --> 00:28:57,985
- You did what?
- I recovered Dubaku's files.

443
00:28:59,936 --> 00:29:00,653
What?

444
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:02,731
I was running a mirror file
on an outside server.

445
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:05,271
I always do that when I'm dealing
with sensitive materials.

446
00:29:05,396 --> 00:29:08,071
Erika's parameters
were too narrow to catch it.

447
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,026
- How soon can you have it decrypted?
- It is.

448
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:12,741
It's been decrypting
his entire time.

449
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:14,736
Dubaku kept detailed
evidence on everyone.

450
00:29:14,861 --> 00:29:17,644
Phone logs, financial records.
It's all here.

451
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:20,383
Listen, I'm gonna need you
to cross-check with FBI personnel.

452
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,536
Sean said Erika was working by herself,
but I got to be 100% sure.

453
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,304
Okay. Hold on.

454
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:30,926
Chloe recovered the files.

455
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:33,339
That's great.

456
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:38,109
- I should get to that statement.
- Yeah.

457
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,449
When you're done there, I want you
to go downstairs and see Dr. Weber.

458
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,743
You shot a fellow agent.
You're gonna want to talk to somebody.

459
00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:49,868
Yes, sir.

460
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:08,135
Hey, do you have any idea
what's going on with the servers?

461
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,255
- Not a clue.
- The whole system's down.

462
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,490
I tried to get into the mainframe room,
and security has got it locked off.

463
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:15,382
Ask Larry about it, Janis.

464
00:30:15,507 --> 00:30:17,093
Where are you going?

465
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:19,794
- I got to run an errand.
- Now?

466
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:55,558
All right.

467
00:30:56,594 --> 00:30:57,594
Hold off.

468
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,375
You better start
talking to me right now!

469
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:08,672
I'd like to speak with my attorney.

470
00:31:12,823 --> 00:31:14,273
Put him in holding.

471
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:26,675
Get me Bill Buchanan
at the White House.

472
00:31:40,017 --> 00:31:41,065
Where is my sister?

473
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,190
Where's Marika?

474
00:31:45,168 --> 00:31:46,484
There was an accident.

475
00:31:46,835 --> 00:31:47,738
What happened?

476
00:31:49,466 --> 00:31:50,783
Marika didn't make it.

477
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:52,826
What do you mean?

478
00:31:54,423 --> 00:31:56,914
There was a crash.
It happened during the pursuit.

479
00:31:57,604 --> 00:31:59,124
Marika was killed.

480
00:32:00,642 --> 00:32:02,092
I don't understand.

481
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:05,758
You said that you'd protect her.
You said she'd be OK.

482
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,691
We wouldn't have caught Dubaku
without Marika's help.

483
00:32:08,816 --> 00:32:10,866
She was very, very brave, Rosa.

484
00:32:13,422 --> 00:32:14,572
What is this?

485
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:17,268
This is supposed
to make everything OK?

486
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:20,459
Marika was all I had!

487
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:23,802
I trusted you with her life,

488
00:32:23,927 --> 00:32:25,693
- and you let her die?
- I'm so sorry.

489
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:27,903
Don't touch me!

490
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,550
You killed my sister!

491
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,246
You didn't care how you did it
or who got hurt!

492
00:32:42,036 --> 00:32:43,186
Agent Walker?

493
00:32:49,658 --> 00:32:50,658
Excuse me.

494
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:01,020
I just got off the phone with Larry.
Dubaku wasn't lying.

495
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,591
On the drive was a list of everyone
he was working with in the government.

496
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,138
They're getting ready
to make arrests.

497
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:08,263
It's over.

498
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,574
It's not over for Rosa.

499
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:20,928
What happened to Marika was a tragedy.
But I'm not going to stand here

500
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:23,725
and tell you what we did was wrong,
because we weren't.

501
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,371
She made a choice, a brave one,
to get involved,

502
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:29,089
- but she made it.
- God, listen to yourself, Jack.

503
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:31,308
You don't even sound human.
Don't you feel anything?

504
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:33,087
We had a job to do!

505
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:35,525
To protect the hundreds
if not thousands of innocent lives

506
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:39,273
that would not have had a choice
if we let a terrorist attack take place.

507
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:42,397
What we did wasn't wrong.

508
00:33:42,886 --> 00:33:44,236
It was necessary.

509
00:33:46,617 --> 00:33:47,775
I read your file.

510
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:51,182
When your wife was killed, did you feel
that or did you just tell yourself

511
00:33:51,307 --> 00:33:53,660
- that that was necessary?
- What do you want from me?

512
00:33:53,785 --> 00:33:55,032
What do you want from me?

513
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,986
I just want to know
that you feel something!

514
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:59,953
I want to know that you feel
the same kind of pain that I do!

515
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,705
Do you feel that?

516
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,207
Do you feel that?

517
00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:12,819
It's all right.

518
00:34:16,476 --> 00:34:18,426
You're going to be all right.

519
00:34:20,345 --> 00:34:22,195
It's going to take a while.

520
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,145
But you will learn to live with it.

521
00:34:25,386 --> 00:34:27,690
What if I don't want
to learn to live with it?

522
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,568
Then quit.

523
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:34,717
And by the way,

524
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,699
that stunt you pulled by the car,

525
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:41,145
you ever pull your weapon
on me again,

526
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,170
you better intend to use it.

527
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,998
I did.

528
00:35:14,855 --> 00:35:16,488
- Olivia.
- What's going on?

529
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,323
How's Dad?

530
00:35:20,288 --> 00:35:21,888
He's still in surgery.

531
00:35:22,173 --> 00:35:23,454
We're waiting for word.

532
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:25,956
Is he going to be all right?

533
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:28,318
He was seriously injured.

534
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,197
The bullet went through his lung.

535
00:35:33,828 --> 00:35:34,828
Livy.

536
00:35:36,627 --> 00:35:39,277
The doctors are doing
everything they can.

537
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,972
Who did this?

538
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:45,476
It's complicated.

539
00:35:47,138 --> 00:35:48,979
I want to know who shot my father!

540
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:53,256
Your father found out
about a conspiracy

541
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:54,815
inside the government.

542
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,112
The people behind it
tried to kill him.

543
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,489
- Who are these people?
- We're trying to find out right now.

544
00:36:01,103 --> 00:36:02,736
That's all I can tell you.

545
00:36:03,736 --> 00:36:05,558
I want to go to the hospital.

546
00:36:05,683 --> 00:36:08,186
- I want to be there when he wakes up.
- I can't let you do that.

547
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:10,542
The people who shot your father
are still out there.

548
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,128
- It's not safe.
- I don't care, I want to see Dad!

549
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,615
This is not a debate.

550
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,643
I'm not going to risk anything
happening to you.

551
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,548
You're staying in the White House,
and that's the end of it.

552
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:22,981
<i>Madam President,
Bill Buchanan is here to see you.</i>

553
00:36:23,106 --> 00:36:24,348
I'll be right out.

554
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,729
There's a lot we need
to talk about, Olivia.

555
00:36:32,745 --> 00:36:35,067
We've been ignoring things
for far too long.

556
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,279
It took Dad getting shot
for you to finally want to talk?

557
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:41,406
Let's not go down this path.

558
00:36:43,582 --> 00:36:46,221
Not again.
Not today.

559
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:50,956
We'll talk later.

560
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:53,919
One of the guards will take you up
to the residence.

561
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:07,406
- All right, Bill. What is it?
- I have very good news.

562
00:37:08,246 --> 00:37:11,097
Jack Bauer just recovered
a database hidden on Dubaku.

563
00:37:11,222 --> 00:37:14,153
It contains the names of everyone in
the government who was working with him.

564
00:37:14,278 --> 00:37:16,134
- How many?
- Close to a hundred people,

565
00:37:16,259 --> 00:37:17,692
across all agencies.

566
00:37:17,817 --> 00:37:19,917
- Some at very high levels.
- My God.

567
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:22,489
Dubaku kept detailed files
on every person.

568
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:25,350
This is exactly what we've been
working toward, Madam President.

569
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:27,758
We can finally put an end
to this conspiracy.

570
00:37:29,437 --> 00:37:31,811
I assume you've already
begun acting on this information.

571
00:37:31,936 --> 00:37:34,938
Yes. As a matter of fact, Larry Moss
just identified two more individuals

572
00:37:35,063 --> 00:37:37,577
working within FBI
who were on the list.

573
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:40,039
He's confident the Bureau is secure.

574
00:37:40,164 --> 00:37:41,425
What's the next step?

575
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,140
I'm working with FBI to coordinate
an interagency sweep.

576
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:46,455
We should start making arrests
within the hour.

577
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,330
Bill, I don't know what to say
to thank you.

578
00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:52,891
What you have done here today
puts all of us in your debt.

579
00:37:53,016 --> 00:37:55,476
I appreciate that,
Madam President, but...

580
00:37:55,601 --> 00:37:57,851
there are a lot of people to thank,

581
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,234
including Jack Bauer.

582
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:05,205
He's scheduled to resume his testimony
before the Senate Committee

583
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,408
- tomorrow morning.
- I'm aware of that.

584
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:10,641
Madam President, forgive me
if I'm out of line, but I feel...

585
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:13,585
Senator Mayer is
on a personal crusade against Jack.

586
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,533
He's already taken
his pound of flesh.

587
00:38:16,658 --> 00:38:18,055
He dismantled CTU,

588
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,797
attacked the reputations of people
who've served this country with honor.

589
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:23,947
Now he wants to make
an example of Jack.

590
00:38:24,072 --> 00:38:26,344
It isn't right, Madam President,

591
00:38:26,669 --> 00:38:28,138
especially after today.

592
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:30,390
What are you asking me to do, Bill?

593
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,643
I'm asking you to speak
to Senator Mayer.

594
00:38:34,557 --> 00:38:36,703
Jack Bauer helped save this country.

595
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:39,316
He doesn't deserve to spend
the rest of his life in prison.

596
00:38:41,984 --> 00:38:43,731
I appreciate your sentiments, Bill,

597
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:45,864
but I'm going to have
to think about this.

598
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,326
That's all I'm asking, Madam President.
Thank you.

599
00:39:21,914 --> 00:39:23,360
What the hell are you doing here?

600
00:39:23,922 --> 00:39:25,696
- I need to talk with you.
- About what?

601
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:28,576
I told you I was going
to follow up on a lead.

602
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:31,552
No, you said you were going to turn
yourself in as soon as this was over.

603
00:39:31,677 --> 00:39:32,577
And I will.

604
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:34,473
But this ain't over yet.

605
00:39:35,777 --> 00:39:38,483
There's going to be another attack.
Here in D.C.

606
00:39:38,608 --> 00:39:40,460
Dubaku is in custody.
He's already provided us

607
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,586
with a list of everyone
that was working with him.

608
00:39:42,711 --> 00:39:43,955
It's not Dubaku.

609
00:39:44,871 --> 00:39:46,386
It's his boss, Juma.

610
00:39:48,016 --> 00:39:50,370
He knows he's about
to lose control of his country.

611
00:39:50,495 --> 00:39:52,457
He's going to try and rally
his people behind him

612
00:39:52,582 --> 00:39:54,516
- by striking back at the U.S.
- How do you know?

613
00:39:55,677 --> 00:39:58,088
- I tracked down a source.
- What source?

614
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:02,326
He was one of the men
I worked with on Emerson's crew.

615
00:40:02,451 --> 00:40:06,053
He had a direct line of communication
with the Juma regime in Sangala.

616
00:40:07,632 --> 00:40:09,698
It wasn't easy getting
the information out of him,

617
00:40:10,486 --> 00:40:12,019
but I'm convinced it's accurate.

618
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:14,256
Then you should hand it over to FBI.

619
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:18,385
My source tells me
that the window opens at 1900 hours.

620
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,457
By the time the FBI wades
through their procedures and red tape,

621
00:40:21,582 --> 00:40:23,066
it's going to be too late.

622
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:26,134
What's the target?

623
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:29,644
He doesn't know the exact target,

624
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:32,596
but it's definitely gonna be
of high value

625
00:40:32,858 --> 00:40:34,158
and high impact.

626
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:39,322
He gave me the name of somebody
who's been involved in the planning.

627
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:40,447
Who?

628
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,855
Ryan Burnett.

629
00:40:44,724 --> 00:40:46,234
Senator Mayer's Chief of Staff.

630
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
That's right.

631
00:40:49,188 --> 00:40:50,953
He's been involved
from the very beginning.

632
00:40:51,078 --> 00:40:52,472
What about Mayer?

633
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:54,656
No.
He's not involved.

634
00:40:54,781 --> 00:40:56,417
You're sure about that?

635
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:57,542
Yeah.

636
00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:02,501
You better not be lying to me, Tony.

637
00:41:05,243 --> 00:41:06,546
This is real, Jack.

638
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:12,539
Burnett will be on Dubaku's list.

639
00:41:12,664 --> 00:41:14,659
As soon as he finds out
that Dubaku's in custody,

640
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:16,786
he'll start running.
You don't have a lot of time.

641
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:18,961
I've already got a tail on him.

642
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:21,985
Listen, Jack,

643
00:41:22,922 --> 00:41:24,322
if you're with me,

644
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,327
meet me at the corner
of First and Constitution.

645
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:38,739
I need your help.

646
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,565
Thank you for your patience.

647
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:56,052
As I'm sure some of you already know,
our government

648
00:41:56,177 --> 00:41:58,004
and its ancillary agencies,

649
00:41:58,129 --> 00:41:59,729
including this office,

650
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,812
have been infiltrated by operatives
in league with Iké Dubaku.

651
00:42:06,427 --> 00:42:07,577
Yes, Senator?

652
00:42:08,063 --> 00:42:09,854
<i>Ryan, can you step in here?</i>

653
00:42:09,979 --> 00:42:10,979
Yes, sir.

654
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,164
- I'm going to the White House.
- Sir?

655
00:42:23,493 --> 00:42:26,626
President Taylor wants to speak to me
regarding Jack Bauer.

656
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:28,795
Bauer?
What about him?

657
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:30,259
I don't know,

658
00:42:30,725 --> 00:42:32,299
but we'll find out soon enough.

659
00:42:33,526 --> 00:42:35,552
- It's odd, though.
- What is, sir?

660
00:42:36,269 --> 00:42:38,491
Bauer was pulled away
from the Senate hearings this morning

661
00:42:38,616 --> 00:42:40,470
to help the FBI
with an investigation.

662
00:42:40,595 --> 00:42:43,601
And now the president
wants to talk to me about him.

663
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,216
I don't like the timing of this.

664
00:42:47,296 --> 00:42:50,296
Grab your laptop, Ryan.
I want you there with me.

665
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:52,351
Yes, sir.
