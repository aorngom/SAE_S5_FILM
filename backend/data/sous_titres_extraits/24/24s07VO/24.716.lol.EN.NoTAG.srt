3
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,651
Sir, it's Senator Mayer.

4
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,773
- He's dead.
- Are you telling me that Jack Bauer

5
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,775
<i>just killed a United States senator?</i>

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:29,111
- How could you have let this happen?
- You wont lay this one at my feet.

7
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,436
What is it, Ethan, what's wrong?

8
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:35,826
I'm afraid I have no choice
but to resign as your chief of staff.

9
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,662
You're taking this too far.

10
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,700
- Where's Jack?
<i>- We don't have him.</i>

11
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:44,627
The man who framed Jack
for Burnett's murder was John Quinn,

12
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,837
<i>a Starkwood contractor.
Jack went to Mayer</i>

13
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:47,963
to prove it.

14
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,488
Starkwood was involved
with what's happened today.

15
00:00:50,613 --> 00:00:53,978
They helped Juma bring down those planes
and attack the White House.

16
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:56,415
In exchange, they were allowed
to develop and manufacture

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,038
a WMD in Sangala.

18
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:01,320
The text message I got
off their agent's cell phone said

19
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:03,813
"Port of Alexandria,
lot C, 10:15 p.m."

20
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,179
Go red, go red!

21
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:06,487
Engage, engage.

22
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,534
Get that truck out of here now!

23
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,912
Tony! The truck, I'm going after it!
Cover me now!

24
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,019
I'm in possession of a biological weapon
interdicted at the Port of Alexandria.

25
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,133
- What's your status?
- Package is secure, we're inbound.

26
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:55,322
- What about Bauer?
<i>- He's at the scene, sir,</i>

27
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,657
he sought cover nearby.

28
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,118
We have to assume
that he contacted the authorities,

29
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,495
<i>so we'd better be
on an accelerated timetable.</i>

30
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,663
Get over here.

31
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,749
Starkwood reacquired the bioweapon.

32
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,459
<i>They airlifted it right out of here.</i>

33
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,419
They're headed due west
from my position.

34
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:12,140
I can't assault a private compound
without a proof that a weapon exists.

35
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,894
- Okay, where is the CDC?
<i>- They're scrambling a team right now.</i>

36
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:17,602
Send them to me.
You'll have all the proof you need.

37
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:19,898
- Jack, what happened?
- I was exposed.

38
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:43,043
We're ready for you, sir,
come with me.

39
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,801
Mr. Bauer. Dr. Macer, CDC.

40
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,511
We need you to get undressed.

41
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,141
You're the one that talked to Moss?

42
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,228
He brought me up to speed, said you had
some information about the bioweapon.

43
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:09,772
All I know
is that it was developed in Sangala,

44
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,942
According to rumors
from the village it was tested on,

45
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,451
all the victims suffered
from dementia and paralysis.

46
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:17,776
Check neurological vectors
and pathogens.

47
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:19,031
How much was released?

48
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:21,270
I'm not exactly sure.

49
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,838
The weapon was stored
in a pressurized canister.

50
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:26,664
It was breached for maybe two minutes
before I could seal it off.

51
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,923
This is not a reaction.
I've had these scars.

52
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,253
This is a full spectrum antibiotic.

53
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:41,512
It should counteract
a wide range of known pathogens.

54
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,279
Step inside, sir.

55
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:57,685
Raise your arms and close your eyes.

56
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,001
- Janis, where are we?
- Metro closed down Highway 236.

57
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,764
The CDC first responders are on-site.
What the hell's going on?

58
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,482
One of the bioweapon canisters
was breached.

59
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,800
- Jack may have been exposed.
- Oh, my God.

60
00:04:20,931 --> 00:04:22,374
Starkwood took the canisters.

61
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:24,797
They probably fly it back
to their compound in Virginia,

62
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:26,515
- along with Tony Almeida.
- Almeida?

63
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,642
We think he might
have been taken captive.

64
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,930
Hang on one second.

65
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:31,847
Put together a briefing packet
on Starkwood.

66
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,899
I want every division caught up to speed
on what we might be dealing with.

67
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,193
You move on Starkwood?
That place is enormous.

68
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,153
- It's a military base.
- We'll do nothing

69
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,821
till we have concrete evidence
on the bioweapon from CDC.

70
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:44,450
Then I'll inform the president.
She'll decide how to proceed.

71
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:27,627
Almeida's not going to talk.

72
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:30,204
He's not the type,
he's the brave type.

73
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:32,998
Know the psychology of your subject.

74
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,257
That's in our manual.

75
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:37,451
Here we go.

76
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,177
Mr. Hodges,

77
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,265
we isolated the damaged canister.
We got lucky.

78
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:52,017
They know we have the weapons.
That's not so lucky.

79
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,120
How fast can you have them ready?

80
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:56,264
- It'll take me at least two hours.
- Too long, Tom.

81
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,148
We don't know
what the government knows.

82
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,714
They're coming, and they'll be coming
with everything they've got.

83
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,810
The only thing that's going to stop them
is getting this weapon ready to deploy.

84
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:08,075
Yes, sir, I'll do my best.

85
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,569
I know you will.

86
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,543
Okay, let's go!

87
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:35,686
What does the FBI know?

88
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,229
I'm not gonna ask you again.

89
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:45,722
Okay.

90
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:51,452
You're a good man, Tony.

91
00:06:53,236 --> 00:06:54,621
I know your profile.

92
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:56,498
You've had some hard breaks.

93
00:06:58,005 --> 00:06:59,854
I don't want to see you hurt,

94
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,192
so you just tell me
what the FBI knows

95
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:05,799
about what we're doing here,

96
00:07:06,318 --> 00:07:08,218
and I can't say
you'll walk away smiling,

97
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,345
that would be unrealistic,

98
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,640
but you'll be alive.

99
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,297
You hear me?

100
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:26,346
I don't know anything,

101
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,010
Mr. Hodges.

102
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,363
I'm giving you a way out, Tony.

103
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:45,828
Sir,

104
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,507
may I speak to you for a moment?

105
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:53,691
- Not now, Greg.
- Please, sir, just for a moment.

106
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,525
What is it?

107
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:08,070
This was supposed to be
a covert operation.

108
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,802
That is not the case anymore.

109
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:11,817
The government knows
we have these weapons.

110
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:13,784
They're not going to sit
on that information.

111
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:17,206
What are you suggesting, Greg?

112
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:18,998
Maybe

113
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,960
we should destroy the evidence
while we still have some time.

114
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:27,551
I can't believe
that I'm hearing this from you.

115
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,177
I'm just trying to help, sir. I care
about this company as much as you do.

116
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:34,587
Oh, I doubt that.

117
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:37,349
We've invested
a lot of blood and treasure

118
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,768
to get these weapons.
I'm not going to give them up.

119
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:44,064
Think about
what you're risking, sir,

120
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,673
everything, everything you've built.

121
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:49,062
You say you're trying to help.

122
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:52,322
You know what I think? I think
you're worried about your own ass.

123
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:55,378
Get him out of here
and do what you have to do.

124
00:08:56,331 --> 00:08:58,459
Think about what I said, young man.

125
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:01,081
You're a little nervous, Greg.
Well, I've got a news flash:

126
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,543
we're all nervous.

127
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:04,376
Keep your doubts to yourself.

128
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,419
I'm not going to tell you again.

129
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,689
We need to take more blood
and saliva samples,

130
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:14,678
and to collect
a spinal fluid specimen.

131
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,306
Until we know what it is,
we need to keep you under quarantine.

132
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,725
How long is it gonna be
till you know if I've been infected?

133
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,764
We should have the preliminary results
in the next 15 minutes.

134
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:24,938
- Dr. Macer.
- Yeah.

135
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,942
We've detected a trace amount
of pathogen concentrated near the truck.

136
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,992
We're picking it up in the surrounding
environments at lower concentrations.

137
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:34,490
- Can you identify it?
- No, but we're analyzing a sample now.

138
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:37,669
These levels shouldn't present
any danger to the nearby population,

139
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,322
but I still want
atmospheric monitors set up.

140
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:44,678
It's a good thing you sealed off
the canister. You saved a lot of lives.

141
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:46,752
You're going to have
to transport me back to FBI.

142
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:49,546
I'm still material evidence
in an ongoing terrorist threat.

143
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,216
Those were our orders.
We can run our tests from there.

144
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:01,791
Bob Justman's been associate counsel
for the past three years.

145
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,085
He and Ethan
worked very closely together.

146
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,813
He is certainly qualified
to be chief of staff.

147
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:08,451
But...

148
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:11,455
After what's happened today,

149
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,941
I think you should be looking
outside your administration.

150
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:15,767
An insider has a leg up.

151
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,365
Chief of staff has
a steep learning curve.

152
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:24,105
I think you're underestimating
the value of a fresh perspective.

153
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:26,333
You have someone in mind.

154
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,294
I do.

155
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,628
Rick Berman.

156
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:36,083
Would Rick even consider
leaving the private sector?

157
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,667
He's made his fortune. I think he'd jump
at the chance to serve his country.

158
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,974
- Let's sit down with him.
- Great.

159
00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:45,827
But keep Bob on the list.
I still have a good feeling about him.

160
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:48,633
I'll start to set up meetings
tomorrow.

161
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:53,516
Livy, it could take weeks
to find Ethan's replacement.

162
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,157
In the meantime,

163
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:59,128
I'm going to need
a provisional chief of staff.

164
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,993
I'd like that to be you.

165
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,916
<i>Madam President?
Tim Woods is here to see you.</i>

166
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,877
Just give me a minute, please,
and then send him in.

167
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,101
<i>Yes, Ma'am.</i>

168
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:15,048
Livy, I need someone I can trust.

169
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,051
Especially after everything
that's happened today.

170
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:22,058
You're not going to say "no"
to your mother, are you?

171
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,845
Of course not.

172
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,990
Good.

173
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:33,150
Madam President, I have Larry Moss
at FBI calling for you.

174
00:11:33,813 --> 00:11:36,069
- What's this about?
- I don't know the specifics,

175
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,202
but he says it involves
an imminent homeland threat.

176
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:40,574
Put him through.

177
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:45,853
It's all right, Tim.
I've made Olivia Acting Chief of Staff.

178
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,623
Agent Moss, you're on
with the president.

179
00:11:50,748 --> 00:11:52,878
Madam President,
we have a situation developing.

180
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:56,122
First of all, you need to know
that Jack Bauer did not kill

181
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:59,259
Ryan Burnett nor Senator Blaine Mayer.
He was framed for their murders.

182
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,556
I knew it. Who framed him?

183
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:04,765
Our operational theory
is that he was set up by Starkwood.

184
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,267
I don't understand.
Why would Starkwood frame Jack?

185
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:11,722
<i>To cover up the fact that they helped
Juma stage the terrorist attacks today.</i>

186
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,209
What?

187
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:15,817
<i>Ma'am, we have evidence
that Starkwood provided Juma</i>

188
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,653
with technological support
and intelligence. And in return,

189
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,199
Juma allowed Starkwood to use Sangala
as a base to operate without having

190
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,077
<i>- to worry about any oversight.</i>
- A base for what?

191
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,412
To manufacture
weapons of mass destruction.

192
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:28,955
<i>Specifically,</i>

193
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,666
<i>biological weapons.</i>

194
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,595
What kind of bioweapons
are you talking about?

195
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:47,189
We're not sure, but it could be
some kind of neurological pathogen.

196
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:49,694
CDC has obtained a sample
and they're analyzing it now.

197
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:51,853
Agent Moss, you said
there was an imminent threat.

198
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,080
Yes, a large shipment of bioweapons
was delivered to Starkwood.

199
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:56,918
We believe
they're in possession of them.

200
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,610
These weapons are on U.S. soil?

201
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:01,363
We suspect they're at the Starkwood
headquarters in Virginia.

202
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,514
You're not suggesting
that Starkwood intends

203
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,867
to use those weapons
to attack this country?

204
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,935
We don't know, but,
given their actions today,

205
00:13:09,196 --> 00:13:11,796
we need to move on Starkwood
immediately.

206
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:16,324
Madam President?

207
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:20,424
Assemble the Cabinet
and the Joint Chiefs.

208
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:21,919
Yes, ma'am.

209
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,615
Jack was right about Starkwood.

210
00:13:46,903 --> 00:13:49,251
You found evidence
that they've been supporting Juma.

211
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:53,915
Did you find out why? What could
Starkwood possibly get from Juma?

212
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,752
The infrastructure to develop and test
biological weapons.

213
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,796
We think they're holding them
somewhere on the Starkwood compound.

214
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,256
Where's Jack?

215
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,674
He's on his way over here.

216
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,154
What, Larry?

217
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:14,273
He managed to secure the weapons,
but then...

218
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:16,646
Starkwood got them back.

219
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:19,377
And when that happened...

220
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,600
Jack was exposed.

221
00:14:25,186 --> 00:14:28,214
He may have been infected.
He's being placed under quarantine.

222
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:30,315
He's on his way here
and we need to find out

223
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,328
everything that he learned
about these weapons.

224
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:35,553
And I think you should be
the one who debriefs him.

225
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,308
And I owe you an apology.

226
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:42,982
I was wrong not to trust you,

227
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:46,357
and I let my prejudice about Bauer
get in the way.

228
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:49,504
But...

229
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:53,183
Renee,
you should've kept me in the loop.

230
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:57,616
You should've trusted me.

231
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:02,773
I know.

232
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:06,906
I should have.

233
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:16,196
When are we moving on Starkwood?

234
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:19,444
Aaron?

235
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:23,486
I'll check in with you guys later, okay?
Thank you.

236
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:28,571
- May I speak with you for a moment?
- Of course.

237
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:30,929
I heard you finished your debrief
and were on your way out.

238
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:32,264
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,432
Well, I need you to stay.

240
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:36,305
Ma'am?

241
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,766
I've been appointed
Acting Chief of Staff.

242
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:42,598
Secret Service is going to assign
an agent to handle my security detail.

243
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,484
I'd like that to be you.

244
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:51,269
Well, I'm truly flattered, ma'am,
but as you know, I'm retired.

245
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,076
I can have you reinstated.

246
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:56,600
There are plenty of fine agents
on the roster.

247
00:15:56,725 --> 00:15:58,540
But I don't want them.
I want you.

248
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,697
I can't go into the details now,

249
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:05,139
but the threat to this country
isn't over.

250
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:09,092
We're in the middle of a crisis,
and I need people around me I can trust.

251
00:16:11,662 --> 00:16:13,112
I trust you, Aaron.

252
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:15,750
I can't say that
about a lot of people.

253
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:18,143
I'm running
into a meeting with the president.

254
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:21,688
I'll assume your answer is "yes."

255
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:34,231
Gentlemen, ladies,
please take your seats.

256
00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:41,082
Those of you who haven't had a chance
to finish your briefing packets,

257
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:43,393
please keep reading.

258
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:50,216
As we've all just learned,
this day is not over.

259
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:53,657
Our national security
is still being threatened,

260
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:56,264
and we are here
to consider our options.

261
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:57,637
Mr. Woods.

262
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,826
Your briefing materials include
FBI intelligence

263
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,986
about a cache of biological weapons
on Starkwood's main compound

264
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,661
in Northern Virginia.

265
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,705
This is a recent satellite view
of the compound.

266
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,314
Over 3 square miles,
259 structures...

267
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,698
the weapons could be hidden
anywhere on the facility.

268
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:16,034
What kind of bioweapons
are we talking about?

269
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,768
This is Ben Landry,
he's director of CDC.

270
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:23,599
He's here to answer any questions
you may have in regards to the pathogen.

271
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:26,544
I've just received a preliminary report
from our agents in the field.

272
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:29,290
They've identified the pathogen
as a prion variant

273
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,374
indigenous to the East Congo.

274
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,020
It's a form
of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

275
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:36,170
It attacks the brain
and the nervous system,

276
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:38,181
causes dementia,
physical deterioration,

277
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:39,797
ultimately death.

278
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:42,124
Standard CJD kills
within several months,

279
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:44,145
but this strain kills more quickly.

280
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:46,815
- How long?
- A day, maybe two.

281
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:49,245
There's no treatment.
There's no cure.

282
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:53,002
If dispersed over a populated area,
the results would be catastrophic.

283
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:57,313
But it goes without saying we cannot
allow a private military force,

284
00:17:57,438 --> 00:18:00,537
these killers, to possess
weapons of mass destruction.

285
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,871
We need to find these weapons,

286
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:05,251
and arrest
those bastards in Starkwood

287
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:08,076
who are responsible
for bringing them here.

288
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:09,921
Madam President.

289
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:14,437
Given the size of the compound,

290
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,554
it would take a considerable force
to locate these weapons.

291
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:19,409
Not to mention the fact

292
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:22,914
that there are 1,500 highly-trained
mercenaries on that base.

293
00:18:23,564 --> 00:18:25,395
God forbid they decide to resist.

294
00:18:25,987 --> 00:18:28,314
We could have a small war
in our own backyard.

295
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:31,484
I share those concerns,
Madam President.

296
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:33,645
We also have to consider
the possibility

297
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,851
that Starkwood might use
these biological weapons

298
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:37,240
against our own forces.

299
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,825
What about an air strike?

300
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:43,204
A facility that large would require
multiple bombing runs.

301
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:45,975
We'd be looking at massive casualties
on the Starkwood base,

302
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,733
with no guarantee
of destroying the bioweapons.

303
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:51,713
For all we know, they've been buried
underground or in fortified facilities.

304
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:54,832
There's also a risk that hitting
these weapons with insufficient force

305
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:56,917
could release the bio-agent
into the atmosphere.

306
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:58,887
We can't just ignore the law here.

307
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:03,271
All these scenarios would be
in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act.

308
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:08,075
We can't deploy military personnel
in a law enforcement capacity.

309
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:11,771
Not without congressional approval.

310
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,276
What I'm hearing

311
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:16,274
is that there are no good options.

312
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:19,074
I don't accept that.

313
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:23,170
Until we find a way
to contain this threat,

314
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,331
we are risking another attack
on this country.

315
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:29,427
And that is an option
I won't consider.

316
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:38,176
Mr. Hodges wants to know if you've given
any thought to his offer.

317
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:44,724
Why this loyalty
to a government that screwed you over?

318
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,580
I don't get it.

319
00:19:48,496 --> 00:19:51,147
Just tell us what the FBI knows
and you can walk.

320
00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:56,957
For the record,

321
00:19:57,683 --> 00:20:01,333
I bet Mr. Hodges a pair
of Redskins tickets you wouldn't talk.

322
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:09,332
Looks like I'm going to be sitting
on the 50 yard line.

323
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,330
Hey, what the hell's going on?

324
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,209
I need your help.

325
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:24,917
My help?

326
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:28,224
We need to stop this.
It's gone too far.

327
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:32,703
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me why you're doing this.

328
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,798
I'm not spending
the rest of my life in prison

329
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:42,824
because Jonas Hodges
has lost his mind.

330
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:45,827
- You know where the weapons are?
- Yes.

331
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:47,662
Then you better tell me right now.

332
00:20:48,722 --> 00:20:51,749
- I want immunity.
- Look, I can't promise you anything.

333
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,043
We can call the FBI
and negotiate a deal,

334
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:58,013
immunity in exchange for your help,
that's the best I can do.

335
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:02,645
I can set up
a secure landline in my office.

336
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,020
Good, let's go.

337
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:16,872
<i>We're pulling up to FBI.</i>

338
00:21:16,997 --> 00:21:20,653
We have to put you in an isolation suit
to transfer you to the quarantine area.

339
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:21,883
<i>I understand.</i>

340
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,333
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

341
00:21:25,878 --> 00:21:27,028
<i>No different.</i>

342
00:21:29,261 --> 00:21:31,748
<i>- We have the results of the blood work.
- Thank you.</i>

343
00:21:40,762 --> 00:21:41,762
<i>Open it.</i>

344
00:21:59,151 --> 00:21:59,943
Thank you.

345
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:21,965
Excuse me. Larry wanted me to tell you
that CDC arrived with Jack Bauer.

346
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,675
- I'll meet them down in quarantine.
- He's not in quarantine.

347
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,370
- I don't understand.
- That's all I know.

348
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:29,389
They just cleared security.
He's on his way up.

349
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,192
Are you okay?

350
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:44,529
My blood work came back positive.
I'm infected.

351
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:46,769
Mr. Bauer, there's a room
for you to change in.

352
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:47,894
Thank you.

353
00:22:49,773 --> 00:22:50,773
It's fine.

354
00:22:55,055 --> 00:22:58,457
- But he's not in quarantine.
- The disease isn't contagious.

355
00:22:58,582 --> 00:23:01,345
It was engineered that way to prevent
blowback on the people deploying it.

356
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,264
OK, but there has to be something
that you can do to help him.

357
00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:05,689
There's no cure.

358
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:07,427
But he's patient zero.

359
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,221
Whatever we learn from the pathogen
will come from the tests we'll run.

360
00:23:14,024 --> 00:23:14,851
Excuse me.

361
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:17,615
This is Macer.

362
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,991
He's stable for the moment.

363
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:30,845
Jack,

364
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:33,909
I don't know what to say.

365
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,831
Then tell me that Agent Moss
followed up on Starkwood.

366
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:42,329
Sorry.

367
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,199
Larry debriefed the White House

368
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:47,884
and we're waiting on the President
to decide on a course of action.

369
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,428
Good.
Any word on Tony?

370
00:23:51,136 --> 00:23:53,126
Sorry, we don't know anything yet.

371
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,812
I need to debrief you
on the canisters that you saw.

372
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:03,524
- You okay with that?
- Yeah.

373
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:10,508
I read the statement
from the Port Authority cop.

374
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:14,527
He said that you risked the mission
to save his life.

375
00:24:17,699 --> 00:24:19,134
You did the right thing.

376
00:24:21,283 --> 00:24:22,283
Thanks.

377
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,066
It's the lab.

378
00:25:09,232 --> 00:25:11,676
It's probably Hodges.
We should talk to him.

379
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,278
Put it on speaker.

380
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:19,654
- Seaton.
- Where the hell have you been?

381
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:21,304
I've been trying to reach you.

382
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:23,890
I was checking on Almeida.

383
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:27,817
<i>- Did Stokes get him to talk?</i>
- He's still working on that, sir.

384
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:31,070
I told him to put Almeida down
if he didn't start talking.

385
00:25:31,623 --> 00:25:33,656
I think we should give him
a few more minutes, sir.

386
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,969
We're busting our asses
to get these weapons ready

387
00:25:36,094 --> 00:25:37,827
before the government
makes their move,

388
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:40,788
I want all hands on deck.

389
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,165
We'll be there soon.

390
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,083
<i>See that you are, Greg.</i>

391
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,587
Call FBI.

392
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:51,549
I need to set up the secure landline.
Make sure nobody's listening.

393
00:25:51,942 --> 00:25:53,372
All right, well, do it.

394
00:25:55,043 --> 00:25:57,597
I never thought Jonas
would take it this far.

395
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,491
I mean, the man's a patriot.

396
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,931
He founded Starkwood
to protect this country.

397
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,063
- Yeah, well, why is he attacking it?
- It's complicated.

398
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:09,301
I don't understand it myself.

399
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:12,987
I should've done more to stop this.

400
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,949
I should've called FBI months ago.

401
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:19,410
You're doing the right thing now.

402
00:26:19,806 --> 00:26:21,855
I've pulled together
everything we have on Starkwood.

403
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,248
Structural specs, aerial maps,

404
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,833
topography, company roster,

405
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,001
the whole works.

406
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,886
Upload it onto the interagency servers.
Let's get everybody on the same page.

407
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:34,342
That's good work.

408
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,934
I heard about Jack.

409
00:26:40,855 --> 00:26:41,641
I'm sorry.

410
00:26:42,388 --> 00:26:45,269
I'm still debriefing him but I brought
a full description of the canisters.

411
00:26:45,602 --> 00:26:46,602
All right.

412
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,234
Get this out to the field agents.
How's he doing?

413
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,028
Hard to tell.

414
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:57,771
So many people have died today.

415
00:26:57,896 --> 00:26:59,713
We cannot let their deaths
be for nothing.

416
00:26:59,838 --> 00:27:00,739
We won't.

417
00:27:01,848 --> 00:27:03,496
I've got Tony Almeida on the phone.

418
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:04,538
Almeida?

419
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,415
He says he's calling from Starkwood.

420
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,737
Put him through.

421
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,328
Go ahead, Tony.

422
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,495
- Who am I talking to?
<i>- It's Larry Moss. What's going on?</i>

423
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,091
I'm on the Starkwood compound.

424
00:27:15,315 --> 00:27:17,426
I was being held by a man
named Jonas Hodges,

425
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,221
but I was released by one
of his executives. A man named...

426
00:27:20,512 --> 00:27:22,875
Greg Seaton.
Now he wants to cut a deal.

427
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,203
He wants immunity.

428
00:27:24,328 --> 00:27:26,060
What's he offering in return?

429
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,937
He knows where the weapons are.

430
00:27:30,312 --> 00:27:32,108
Tony, I got to run this
by the President.

431
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:35,319
Wait, Larry.
Do you know what happened to Jack?

432
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:38,030
He's here.

433
00:27:38,465 --> 00:27:39,765
He's in medical.

434
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:41,617
- Was he hit?
- No.

435
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:43,494
One of the canisters was breached.

436
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,915
<i>He's been infected.</i>

437
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,000
<i>Tony, I got to call the White House.
Stand by.</i>

438
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,336
Set up a secure connection with Almeida
and the White House for this signature.

439
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,088
And get the President on the phone.

440
00:28:17,624 --> 00:28:18,720
What is this?

441
00:28:18,845 --> 00:28:21,068
Footage recovered from Sangala.

442
00:28:21,472 --> 00:28:24,895
It was smuggled out of the remains
of a biological weapons lab

443
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,579
about 45 minutes ago.

444
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:30,200
It's a confirmation
that Juma was experimenting

445
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:32,133
with biological weapons

446
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,703
on the local population.

447
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:37,958
These poor people were suffering

448
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,427
from the effects
of the weaponized prion variant.

449
00:28:43,184 --> 00:28:46,935
And that's what we allowed Starkwood
to bring into this country.

450
00:28:47,448 --> 00:28:48,642
We didn't allow this.

451
00:28:48,969 --> 00:28:51,537
Starkwood is a monster
we created, Olivia.

452
00:28:51,662 --> 00:28:53,826
We have been feeding it for years.

453
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:55,900
We gave them military contracts.

454
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:59,403
We relied on their paid mercenaries
instead of our own soldiers,

455
00:28:59,762 --> 00:29:02,031
outsourced intelligence
gathering operations.

456
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,766
My God, we even passed a law

457
00:29:03,891 --> 00:29:07,495
so that they could build a military base
13 miles from the nation's capitol.

458
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:09,611
You fought against all that.

459
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,458
You've been trying to limit Starkwood's
power ever since you took office.

460
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,778
I didn't do enough...

461
00:29:16,152 --> 00:29:17,252
fast enough.

462
00:29:19,227 --> 00:29:20,905
And now it may be too late.

463
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:24,400
<i>Madam President, Tim Woods
and Admiral Smith are here to see you.</i>

464
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:26,283
- Send them in.
<i>- Yes, madam.</i>

465
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:32,567
Madam President, Larry Moss at FBI
is calling in. He says it's urgent.

466
00:29:32,692 --> 00:29:33,992
Put him through.

467
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,107
Agent Moss, the president's here.
Go ahead.

468
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,610
Madam President, we've been contacted
by someone inside Starkwood.

469
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,278
- <i>Ma'am, it's Tony Almeida.</i>
- Almeida?

470
00:29:43,403 --> 00:29:45,408
<i>He was working with Bauer
to recover these weapons.</i>

471
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,821
He was taken captive

472
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:49,622
but then released
by someone on the inside.

473
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:53,040
His name is Greg Seaton.
He's part of Jonas Hodges' inner circle.

474
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:55,527
Ma'am, he says he's willing
to tell us where the weapons are

475
00:29:55,652 --> 00:29:57,086
in exchange for immunity.

476
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,756
<i>I've already started mobilizing
for a targeted raid.</i>

477
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:03,047
We can catch 'em by surprise
and lock down these weapons.

478
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:05,678
But I'm going to need you to sign
an immunity agreement for this man.

479
00:30:06,052 --> 00:30:08,246
How confident are you
of Seaton's intel?

480
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:09,807
We believe it's genuine, ma'am.

481
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:13,227
Madam, we may not
get a chance like this again.

482
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:16,480
- Admiral Smith?
- I concur,

483
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,465
but I would suggest we supplement
the FBI with a SEAL squad.

484
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,068
They're ready to move on my order.

485
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,920
The attorney general will raise hell
about us involving the military

486
00:30:24,045 --> 00:30:26,233
- in this operation.
- We'll deal with him later.

487
00:30:27,235 --> 00:30:29,543
Agent Moss, you have
my direct authorization

488
00:30:29,668 --> 00:30:31,236
to move on Starkwood.

489
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:33,295
How soon can you be ready?

490
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,792
We've already drafted an executive
pardon, and set it up via WebEx.

491
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,837
You'll be able to give a secure
digital signature and we're good to go.

492
00:30:40,137 --> 00:30:42,298
We have the document set up
at your assistant's computer.

493
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,061
- The President is prepared to sign.
<i>- Go ahead, ma'am.</i>

494
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:03,611
<i>Alright, it's done.</i>

495
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:06,071
<i>- You get the signature?</i>
- Yeah, we're good.

496
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,157
<i>When can you be at Starkwood?</i>

497
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:09,992
<i>We can be there in 10 minutes.</i>

498
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,786
Agent Moss, thank you.

499
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:14,121
<i>- And good luck.</i>
- Thank you.

500
00:31:14,385 --> 00:31:15,437
Let's go.

501
00:31:16,963 --> 00:31:19,589
Madam President,
we may have just caught a lucky break.

502
00:31:19,714 --> 00:31:23,297
Until this plays out, I want everyone
to keep looking for other options.

503
00:31:32,463 --> 00:31:34,527
<i>All right, Mr. Seaton. Go ahead.</i>

504
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,520
<i>The weapons are in a warehouse</i>

505
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,026
<i>on the northeast quadrant
of the compound.</i>

506
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,151
<i>32° 44.23' north...</i>

507
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,362
<i>117° 10,42' west.</i>

508
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:51,277
<i>It would help to have someone
on the ground doing recon.</i>

509
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:53,461
<i>Can you get Tony to that warehouse?</i>

510
00:31:53,586 --> 00:31:54,586
I think so.

511
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:57,211
<i>See if you can find a hand radio.
We'll be on 480 kilohertz.</i>

512
00:31:57,336 --> 00:31:58,457
We'll be there.

513
00:31:58,713 --> 00:32:01,210
If we land here, we'll be
within 50 yards of the warehouse.

514
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:05,711
Yeah, support teams here and here.
Shore us up. Coordinate with the Navy.

515
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:07,883
- Get moving. I'll meet you upstairs.
- Let's move!

516
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:14,777
- You're mobilizing. What's going on?
- We got a call from Tony.

517
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:16,892
He's working with an informant
inside Starkwood.

518
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:20,547
We got a location on the weapon,
we're staging a raid on the compound.

519
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,691
- I want to go.
- I can understand why, but I'm sorry.

520
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,262
- No.
- I can help you.

521
00:32:25,387 --> 00:32:28,279
I've seen the canisters,
I know exactly what we're looking for.

522
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,656
I read your debrief.
You gave us all the details we need.

523
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:34,034
Larry, please, I've earned this.

524
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,707
I know what you've done today,

525
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,675
the sacrifice you've made.

526
00:32:42,511 --> 00:32:45,169
Under any other circumstances,
I'd want you out there with us,

527
00:32:45,294 --> 00:32:46,573
but you're sick,

528
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,261
and we have no idea when you're
going to start showing symptoms.

529
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:52,186
I cannot risk that
happening out in the field.

530
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:53,971
I need my best men
for this operation.

531
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,058
I hope you can understand that.

532
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,850
You're right.

533
00:33:06,196 --> 00:33:07,346
You're right.

534
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:16,271
I always knew eventually
we'd agree on something.

535
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:20,039
I'm so sorry, Jack.

536
00:33:57,448 --> 00:34:00,496
- Mr. Seaton?
- I need to check the personnel that...

537
00:34:31,172 --> 00:34:32,172
That's it.

538
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:35,273
The weapons are inside there.

539
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:38,072
How many men inside?

540
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,994
Hodges, munitions team, security.

541
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,270
I'm guessing a dozen or more.

542
00:34:47,322 --> 00:34:49,322
Wolves are at the door, Tommy.

543
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:51,186
How much longer?

544
00:34:51,614 --> 00:34:53,507
We're still an hour away
from being armed.

545
00:34:53,821 --> 00:34:56,122
We just intercepted
a government transmission.

546
00:34:56,247 --> 00:34:57,647
FBI is on the way.

547
00:34:58,448 --> 00:35:01,398
Sir, we haven't even run
the sequence checks yet.

548
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:03,108
Let's do it!

549
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:05,173
Damn it.

550
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:12,739
What's our ETA?

551
00:35:13,884 --> 00:35:15,234
Two minutes, sir.

552
00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:18,448
Tony, it's Larry Moss.
Are you in position?

553
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:19,445
<i>Affirmative.</i>

554
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,398
We're about 50 yards north
of the warehouse.

555
00:35:22,695 --> 00:35:26,198
- <i>What can you tell me?</i>
- Got two entrances, north and south.

556
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:27,785
Heavy steel doors.

557
00:35:28,135 --> 00:35:30,635
Two guards
armed with automatic weapons.

558
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:34,526
There's probably about a dozen inside.
We have to assume they're armed as well.

559
00:35:34,694 --> 00:35:36,008
We're almost there.

560
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:39,120
I'm gonna need your eyes on the ground
in case there's any resistance.

561
00:35:39,245 --> 00:35:40,285
<i>Copy that.</i>

562
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,597
Aerial One to home base.

563
00:35:42,135 --> 00:35:45,217
<i>Target has been confirmed.
We are go for Tac plan Alpha.</i>

564
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:48,437
Copy that, A-1. All feeds are live.
We're monitoring your approach.

565
00:35:53,574 --> 00:35:55,636
Sir, we're being signaled
by Starkwood's air tower.

566
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:57,261
Let me talk to them.

567
00:35:58,821 --> 00:36:01,825
- You're on.
- This is Special Agent Larry Moss, FBI.

568
00:36:02,386 --> 00:36:05,184
We have an executive order
from the president of the United States

569
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:06,955
to search one of your buildings.

570
00:36:07,447 --> 00:36:10,597
FBI? I'll need to get authorization
from my superior.

571
00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:13,384
We have sent you a digital copy
of the executive order.

572
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:15,198
Check your wireless frequency.

573
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:17,841
That is all the authorization
you will need.

574
00:36:18,196 --> 00:36:20,697
Make no attempt to interfere,
or you will be arrested.

575
00:36:20,822 --> 00:36:21,845
Do you understand?

576
00:36:23,821 --> 00:36:25,015
<i>Do you understand?</i>

577
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,391
Understood, FBI.

578
00:36:27,572 --> 00:36:28,572
Take us in.

579
00:36:30,446 --> 00:36:32,106
Aerial One to home base.

580
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,357
We're good to go.

581
00:36:33,696 --> 00:36:36,985
Copy that, Aerial One. Looks like you've
a clean approach. No hostiles in sight.

582
00:37:42,568 --> 00:37:44,668
You all right?
We have a medic.

583
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:45,943
I'm fine.

584
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,472
I need you to stay behind us.

585
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,068
Let's go.

586
00:38:13,816 --> 00:38:14,816
Stand down!

587
00:38:15,692 --> 00:38:17,252
You were told to stand down!

588
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:20,339
Lower your weapons
and get on the ground now!

589
00:38:22,506 --> 00:38:23,756
Lock them down!

590
00:38:32,382 --> 00:38:34,144
- It's locked, sir.
- Blow it.

591
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,612
Blasting! Three. Two. One!

592
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,158
Go. Go!

593
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:05,191
Where are the weapons?

594
00:39:05,316 --> 00:39:08,053
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

595
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:11,556
Almeida was threatening to kill me.
I told him what he wanted to hear.

596
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,627
You lying son of a bitch!
You came to me!

597
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,566
Now, where are the weapons?!

598
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:18,313
- Where are they?
- Tell him to take his hands off of me.

599
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:22,230
I need you to stand down now!

600
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:25,549
- You're not getting away with this.
- Secure him!

601
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,530
He's lying, Larry.

602
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:30,976
He played me.

603
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:33,370
Yeah, I know. It looks that way.

604
00:39:46,378 --> 00:39:48,028
Well, what do you know?

605
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:50,846
Little old Seaton
bought us some time.

606
00:39:52,128 --> 00:39:54,728
They're on the other side
of the compound.

607
00:39:56,503 --> 00:39:58,603
We just have to keep them there.

608
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:27,367
There's nothing here, sir.

609
00:40:30,254 --> 00:40:33,814
The warehouse is empty. Tony's informant
sent us to the wrong location.

610
00:40:33,939 --> 00:40:36,089
<i>This whole thing was a diversion.</i>

611
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:40,190
They couldn't have gotten them out that
fast. The weapons are there somewhere.

612
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:43,607
The weapons have to be inside
of Starkwood. Tell them to keep looking.

613
00:40:44,254 --> 00:40:45,254
Stand by.

614
00:40:48,243 --> 00:40:50,343
All right, everyone outside now.

615
00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:07,989
All right, listen up.

616
00:41:08,503 --> 00:41:11,697
We're going to do a point-by-point
search of this entire compound.

617
00:41:11,822 --> 00:41:12,822
Good.

618
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:17,627
I want four teams sweeping
every structure on this property.

619
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:29,877
Hold your fire!

620
00:41:30,815 --> 00:41:31,947
Hold your fire.

621
00:41:36,691 --> 00:41:38,791
Hold your fire.
Stay in position.

622
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:43,378
Tell Larry to have his men
stand down.

623
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:45,127
They just drew on federal forces.

624
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:48,505
If you don't want to lose your men,
you'll get them to stand down now. Now!

625
00:41:49,877 --> 00:41:51,127
Hold your fire!

626
00:41:58,065 --> 00:41:59,465
That's far enough.

627
00:42:05,813 --> 00:42:08,650
We cooperated with your demand
to search this building.

628
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:10,188
We're asking you to leave.

629
00:42:10,313 --> 00:42:12,376
There are biological weapons
on this facility.

630
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:15,628
We're not going anywhere without them.
Now, tell your men to stand down.

631
00:42:15,753 --> 00:42:19,703
Those charges are absurd, and we're not
going to let you keep searching.

632
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,925
You're on private property,

633
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,999
and we're prepared
to defend it if necessary.

634
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,418
You are threatening federal agents.

635
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:28,170
Stand down! Now!

636
00:42:28,607 --> 00:42:31,006
We're protecting our rights
against a hostile government

637
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:33,800
that's using false charges
to try to shut us down.

638
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:35,677
We don't want any bloodshed.

639
00:42:39,129 --> 00:42:41,529
But if you try to advance
any farther,

640
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,277
you will be fired upon.
