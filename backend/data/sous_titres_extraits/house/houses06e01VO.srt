1
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:31,327
Help!

2
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:35,181
Help me!

3
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:39,657
Dry heaves are gone, so am I.

4
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,443
I'll check with the doctor.

5
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,883
I'm here voluntarily,
just got to check with me.

6
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:47,940
I'm sorry.
Dr. Nolan left specific instructions.

7
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,570
She's not sick. She's scared.
So tell her to tell...

8
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:58,167
And he's black.

9
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:02,807
I thought you'd be a little more
sensitive on the slavery issue.

10
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:17,038
- Can't keep me.
- You look a lot better.

11
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,114
I am a lot better... No painkillers,

12
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,909
no hallucinations.
Leg hurts, but it's manageable.

13
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,536
Great job.

14
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,664
Gonna miss you. Want to start
missing you as soon as possible.

15
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,834
Legally, you're free to go
whenever you want. I suggest you stay.

16
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:31,885
I'll take it under advisement.

17
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,963
If the hallucinations
were from your vicodin,

18
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,487
why didn't you just check yourself
into a rehab facility?

19
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:38,914
I was deluded into thinking
I might be crazy.

20
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:41,303
But you had been abusing vicodin
for years.

21
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,653
Never had delusions,
never had trouble sleeping,

22
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:46,053
never had any problems,
other than narcissism

23
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:48,963
and antisocial behavior,
until two colleagues died.

24
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:50,896
Your father died.

25
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:54,149
Your issues run deeper than vicodin.

26
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,277
That's not gonna cheer me up, is it?

27
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:59,487
You need to be transferred
to our long-term ward,

28
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,609
started on medication,
talk therapy...

29
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:02,736
Yeah, I get it.

30
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:05,425
Just one thing
I'm getting hung up on.

31
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,330
I can leave whenever I want.

32
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,194
How about I start with that?

33
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:12,614
You can't go back
to practicing medicine.

34
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:18,766
I don't want to practice medicine.

35
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,426
I want to be an astronaut.

36
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:23,392
Well, if you want
your state astronaut's license,

37
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:25,054
you're gonna need my recommendation.

38
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,765
Is that a popular, new treatment...

39
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,220
Blackmail?

40
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:32,515
You need to get better.

41
00:04:38,369 --> 00:04:39,869
Welcome to ward six.

42
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:55,186
So brass tacks...
What do I have to do,

43
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:56,794
and how long do I have to be here?

44
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:00,061
Depends on you.
Process is pretty basic.

45
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:03,187
If you follow the schedule,
agree to take meds,

46
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:05,428
participate in group
and individual therapy,

47
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:07,431
- we can work on goals.
- I set a goal.

48
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:10,315
- Excellent. What is it?
- My goal is to get your boss

49
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,677
to write the letter
that I want him to write.

50
00:05:12,802 --> 00:05:13,967
Now let's talk process.

51
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:16,760
I can smile through
gritted teeth and play nice,

52
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:19,253
but there are serious risks of violence
involved in that choice,

53
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:21,711
so I'm going with turning
this ward upside down,

54
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:24,999
making you and your boss' job and life
so unmanageable

55
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,672
that he'll write whatever
he has to write to get rid of me.

56
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:29,435
He's all set.

57
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:30,819
Thanks.

58
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:44,093
I've never been
in the end unit before.

59
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:47,322
Yo, I don't need an escort.
Get off me.

60
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,297
Who are you?
You believe these guys?

61
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,121
Lecturing me on manic depression,
like I couldn't write a book or two.

62
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:55,675
I stop taking my meds,
because I want to stop taking my meds,

63
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,411
because nothing is wrong with me.

64
00:05:57,536 --> 00:05:59,578
No reason to keep
dragging me back here.

65
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:01,578
When I'm on them,
everything slows down.

66
00:06:01,703 --> 00:06:03,147
That's when the problem is.

67
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:05,739
Nice to see you. My roommate last time
couldn't stand me.

68
00:06:06,452 --> 00:06:08,993
- Really?
- Juan Alvarez. J.A.'s my stage name.

69
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:11,247
But Alvie's what everybody
around here calls me,

70
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:13,566
like the Woody Allen character
in <i>Annie Hall</i>,

71
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:15,874
but the Puerto Rican version
and not as neurotic.

72
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:18,545
So what do I call you?

73
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:21,340
You're actually waiting
for an answer this time.

74
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,464
Call me House.

75
00:06:23,605 --> 00:06:24,893
<i>He's a brick</i>

76
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:30,206
Wait up.

77
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,099
I've already got
the whole place wired,

78
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,643
so I'll give you the rundown.
Yo, everybody!

79
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:37,285
This is my new roommate,
House, y'all.

80
00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:39,649
- Main thing you got to know...
- Is this the line?

81
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,148
Hey, Gabby,
meet my new roommate, House.

82
00:06:42,273 --> 00:06:44,589
- You can call him "Heezy."
- No, you can't.

83
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:46,419
Don't worry.
She won't call you anything.

84
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:48,838
She hasn't talked in, like,
ten years or something.

85
00:06:48,963 --> 00:06:51,402
Good you came here.
You need to know the lay of the land.

86
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:53,954
I need to request a new room.

87
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,300
You're funny. You're also gonna
come here to get your meds.

88
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:59,834
- I'm not on any meds.
- You either? Good for you.

89
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:01,594
Tell me my mind works too fast.

90
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:04,217
Probably tell Usain Bolt
he runs too fast.

91
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:05,527
Excuse me.

92
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:08,260
I know you're busy ignoring me,
but my minibar is empty.

93
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,367
You think bolt could do the long jump?
That sport needs to evolve.

94
00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:13,678
Had the same world record for,
like, 20 years.

95
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:16,280
I think if one guy
launched himself headfirst

96
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:17,917
and right before he hits the ground

97
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:20,773
does a front flip instead,
get three extra feet out of that, easy.

98
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,191
Go be that man.

99
00:07:27,172 --> 00:07:28,030
My head!

100
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:31,324
My head!

101
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:34,078
You're not getting any haldol.

102
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:35,784
Sorry.

103
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:38,874
That's Hal.
His real name is Connor,

104
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:40,667
- but we call him Hal...
- I got it.

105
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,765
We can't play that.
They keep it locked up.

106
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:48,664
I wish we could, but at the same time,
imagine how annoying that could be.

107
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:51,696
Crazy people playing on it all the time.
We'd never get any peace.

108
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:53,555
I want to introduce you
to everybody.

109
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,603
Do you think he's serious?
He's a doctor.

110
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,312
He knows that acting out
will only reinforce our diagnosis.

111
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,680
Or it'll work.

112
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:05,109
You think this is something
we should be concerned about?

113
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:07,819
A patient makes a threat,
you should always be concerned.

114
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:17,538
There are two new additions
to our ward.

115
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:18,997
You all know Alvie.

116
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:20,833
Thank you. Hold your applause.

117
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:23,961
It's great to be back here in Mayfield,
not just for the food,

118
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:25,671
not just for the ladies...

119
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,040
well, okay,
maybe just for the ladies.

120
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,440
And you should also welcome Greg
to the floor.

121
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:33,538
Don't worry about the name.
I'm just passing through.

122
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:35,173
Don't want to break any hearts.

123
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:36,640
Can we go outside now?

124
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,051
Not now, Jay.

125
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,894
So he's claustrophobic, right?
You're claustrophobic?

126
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,313
Can I get a pen
to write this stuff down?

127
00:08:44,884 --> 00:08:46,384
Where are you going?

128
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:47,985
- Where's he going?
- It's okay.

129
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:49,569
Paranoid... check.

130
00:08:50,554 --> 00:08:51,780
Dr. Beasley...

131
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,782
I am having an issue with the food.

132
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:56,577
- What's the problem?
- I swear I'm eating less and less,

133
00:08:57,365 --> 00:08:59,663
and I just keep getting
bigger and bigger.

134
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:02,624
- A crayon? Anybody?
- We'll talk about it another time.

135
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:04,334
I understand you all

136
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,996
had art therapy yesterday.

137
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:08,672
Maybe we can hang some
of the new pieces on the wall.

138
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,391
Cut your wrists, huh?

139
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:13,763
- Greg, there are certain topics...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

140
00:09:14,057 --> 00:09:15,304
Is suicide taboo?

141
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:17,514
Gosh, if I've broken a rule
on my first day,

142
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,307
I will kill myself.

143
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,294
Group's over.

144
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,688
That flew by.

145
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,469
You realize you're not
the first uncooperative patient

146
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:28,525
on this floor?

147
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,393
Really? Is there a club?

148
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:34,031
Come with me to the clubhouse.

149
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:39,426
That didn't take long.

150
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:40,751
I'm that good.

151
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:50,255
Come on.

152
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,880
Come on, Alvie!
Let's see some action!

153
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:55,219
You got nothing!

154
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:58,764
- Me, me.
- Pass, pass!

155
00:09:59,404 --> 00:10:00,404
Good.

156
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,020
Come on, guys!

157
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,727
Ready to play nice?

158
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:08,357
Would you believe me if I said yes?

159
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,318
Then, yes.

160
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:14,321
You do know I'm trying to help you.

161
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:19,463
I also know you're trying
to be sweet, caring, and effective.

162
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:21,133
You're just not.

163
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,608
You want out.

164
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,666
Just talk.
Be honest.

165
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:30,652
Try to work with people.
Try to deal with people.

166
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:42,848
- He's on my team!
- Shut up. Nobody likes you.

167
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,729
Am I crowding you?
Can't see the sun?

168
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:50,816
No, everything is closing in.

169
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,613
He's the claustrophobic one, right?
'Cause I'm doing this from memory.

170
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,283
- You have to dribble.
- Why?

171
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:03,328
The CIA satellites aren't watching me.
They're watching you,

172
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:05,415
'cause you're wearing green.

173
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:09,984
That one was just too easy.

174
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:12,170
Seriously, anorexia?

175
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:16,633
What, are you supposed to be a girl?
And in answer to your implicit question,

176
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,885
yes, those pants
do make you look fat.

177
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:28,590
How upset were you
when you woke up in the E.R.

178
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:31,189
and you were still alive
and a failure?

179
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:40,610
2-0, good guys!

180
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:47,538
You're right. It is rewarding
when you reach out.

181
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:52,157
You can't go up there.
It's yard time right now.

182
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,895
Put it on my tab.

183
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:20,226
I think you'll find
music therapy's more effective

184
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,577
if the patients are inside
to hear it.

185
00:12:26,242 --> 00:12:27,942
Where'd you get the key?

186
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,560
They gave it to me.

187
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:34,572
So if she ever talks,

188
00:12:35,123 --> 00:12:36,837
are we gonna get a German accent?

189
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:42,344
She's my husband's sister.

190
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:45,597
So let him come play the piano.

191
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,099
He doesn't know how to play.

192
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,110
Nice.

193
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,732
You're a little heavy
on the right foot, though.

194
00:12:58,735 --> 00:12:59,736
See her head?

195
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,070
It bobs to the music.

196
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:04,533
It's the only real reaction
I'm getting from her.

197
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,578
It feels like we're talking.

198
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:12,416
You're not talking.

199
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,961
Her head is bobbing to her pulse.

200
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,088
Are you a new doctor on the ward?

201
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:19,965
Technically, yes.

202
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:25,220
Can I lead this time?

203
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:29,975
Leave the lid unlocked
when you're done.

204
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:01,587
Can you close the door?

205
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:03,549
You're letting all the cool air out.

206
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:10,348
If you keep up
this scorched-earth policy,

207
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,391
you're gonna end up
living in this room.

208
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,646
Are you ready to try another strategy,
or do you want me to leave you in here?

209
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:34,580
21. 2-1, that's game.
Hey, House is back.

210
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,149
I'll get the ball.

211
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,919
I need some meat.
I got no one left to play.

212
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:41,046
- I'll play you.
- Girl. Come on, House.

213
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:42,415
You can serve.

214
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,929
I've had some time
to think about the approach

215
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,222
I've been taking.

216
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,934
I know I'm unhappy here, and I...

217
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,768
I've been taking it out
on you guys...

218
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:58,763
unfairly.

219
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:01,693
It was...

220
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:04,164
misdirected anger.

221
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,265
'cause when you think about it,
the real jerks here...

222
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,034
Are the doctors.

223
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:16,622
See how they give you
a ping-pong table,

224
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,863
but no paddles, no net?

225
00:15:18,988 --> 00:15:20,460
It's like they're mocking you.

226
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,767
Preach!

227
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,673
The game is called table tennis,
not table volleyball.

228
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:26,831
Greg, you know where this
is gonna end.

229
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:29,469
Who ever saw
a tennis court without a net?

230
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:32,710
Little run-down park across
from my apartment growing up...

231
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:35,976
Three courts, no nets.
No one ever used it.

232
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:38,852
No one's gonna try to hang
themselves with a ping-pong net.

233
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,355
- No!
- Ridiculous.

234
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,147
You treat us like little kids.

235
00:15:42,272 --> 00:15:44,392
Little kids are allowed
to play ping-pong,

236
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:47,595
- and they can play the piano.
- Yeah, worse than little kids.

237
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,965
All right, why don't we just go
and sit down

238
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,515
and discuss it?

239
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,223
No, I want to discuss it right here.

240
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:55,909
Guys.

241
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,250
Guys!

242
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:29,455
House is right.

243
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:31,864
I think everyone here
can handle these.

244
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:39,914
Seriously?

245
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:44,252
Is that your strategy... Give everybody
what they want except me?

246
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:46,425
You're a natural leader.

247
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:49,347
You could do something
useful down here, for them,

248
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:50,716
definitely for you.

249
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,282
Or we could keep fighting...

250
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:55,472
If you think you can break me,

251
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:59,684
if you think I'm not every bit
as stubborn as you.

252
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:11,044
<i>Came to fight the man
and he had the master plan</i>

253
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:14,232
<i>But it started to unravel
Nolan smashed him with his gavel</i>

254
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,057
- <i>Like blah!</i>
- Shut up.

255
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:18,931
So you gonna keep trying
to make them miserable?

256
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:21,081
New plan?

257
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:23,478
What is it?

258
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:25,502
I don't know yet.

259
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:28,111
<i>His mind is burning</i>

260
00:17:28,236 --> 00:17:29,422
<i>The wheels are turning</i>

261
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:30,818
<i>The butter is churning</i>

262
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:33,391
<i>You think Nolan can keep
House from strolling?</i>

263
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,346
It's easier to come up
with a new plan in silence.

264
00:17:36,862 --> 00:17:37,962
Right. Cool.

265
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:44,296
Can I hump?

266
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,936
I'd like you all to welcome
another new addition to our ward...

267
00:17:54,262 --> 00:17:55,073
Steve.

268
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,408
Freedom master.

269
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:59,452
Steve Elkerton is just a cover.

270
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,788
It's like Clark Kent
or Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker.

271
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,776
Cool.
We got more jesuses than superheroes.

272
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:06,839
I try to blend in
in the outside world,

273
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:08,394
but I figure in here,

274
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,171
everybody gets it.

275
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:12,716
We're living in the ward of justice.

276
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:17,303
Can you explain a little more
about what you think everybody gets?

277
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,223
There's good and evil in the world.

278
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,372
And some people are... special,

279
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,007
and they're chosen to help keep
evil forces at bay.

280
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:26,645
You don't think
you can stop bullets, do you?

281
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,544
I move out of their way.

282
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:29,983
Can you read minds?

283
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,779
It's group time, Greg.

284
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:38,907
Why isn't she talking?

285
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:43,512
She needs help.

286
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,022
She needs somebody to save her.

287
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,408
That's what we're all trying to do.

288
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,464
Let's take five minutes.
Everybody get to know Steve.

289
00:18:58,735 --> 00:18:59,735
I can fly.

290
00:19:02,272 --> 00:19:03,801
I know you're scheming,

291
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,238
working on your next elaborate
plan to get out of here.

292
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,825
Why don't you put the plan
on hold for a few days?

293
00:19:10,956 --> 00:19:12,306
See what happens.

294
00:19:12,894 --> 00:19:14,494
Just let me do my job.

295
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:17,643
If you prefer private to group,
we can do that,

296
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:19,582
maybe try some SSRIs.

297
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:22,160
If you think nothing's working,
you can always go

298
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,760
back to your schemes.

299
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,538
God, if only you'd said that
two minutes ago,

300
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:28,523
before I came up with my new scheme.

301
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:30,048
Now I'm committed.

302
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:31,991
Get it?

303
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:35,900
<i>Shaq up in my area</i>

304
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:37,884
<i>I'm a better baller
and a better rapper</i>

305
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:40,449
<i>And I'm good at basketball too</i>

306
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:44,339
Do you have third-floor privileges?

307
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:47,230
Ever since I shared in group
about my uncle fondling me.

308
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:50,171
Is that true?

309
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:53,298
And now I can use the
third-floor vending machines.

310
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,592
You eat sour cream and onion chips?
The whole point is the dipping.

311
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:59,034
Sure, we save time by not adding
the mix and sour cream,

312
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:01,699
- but you're missing out on...
- Break into Nolan's office.

313
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:04,494
- Commando style.
- I want you to focus.

314
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:07,288
- You want me to mess him up?
- Go into Nolan's office.

315
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,458
Look at his calendar. I need the name
of the woman he met with at 11:00 today.

316
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:13,545
No problem. And I'll get you
some chips. If they have them,

317
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,250
I'll get you some dip, but I've never
seen dip in the vending machine.

318
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,740
Get me chips and dip.

319
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:20,426
- What else?
- I get it, I get it. Plan "B".

320
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,804
"B" is for blackmail.
I got you covered.

321
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:24,477
Commando style.

322
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,800
Let me go!

323
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:09,222
I just wanted a little snack.
That ain't right!

324
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,769
Yo, I didn't know
the machine was moved!

325
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,396
I want some ritz bits!

326
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,762
I might be pregnant!
I get these cravings!

327
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:22,947
You get the name?

328
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,909
Nolan's schedule book has a big "x"
marking out the whole middle of the day.

329
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:29,078
Then we can assume the girl
he's with is called "nooner".

330
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,240
<i>Nooner, nooner
Nolan's gonna spoon her</i>

331
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:34,876
- He's gonna "fork" her.
- <i>And then he's gonna knife her</i>

332
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,585
I didn't check the phone
or anything else.

333
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,810
That's okay.

334
00:21:39,935 --> 00:21:42,235
I got her license plate.
I call my friend. He gets the name.

335
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,093
I get the letter
that gets me out of here.

336
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:46,034
You got phone privileges?

337
00:21:46,303 --> 00:21:49,223
I'm on level minus four.
I'm still writing with a crayon.

338
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,100
You? You got to be at level five.

339
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,019
That's like the top
of the space needle.

340
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,189
Hal's the only one
that's up that high.

341
00:21:55,996 --> 00:21:57,231
Hal's at level five?

342
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,566
They give him a point
every time he clears his plate.

343
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:01,361
I've been eating his potatoes.

344
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:04,871
- Will he sell you some minutes?
- I pay two cigarettes for the potatoes.

345
00:22:04,996 --> 00:22:06,588
Phone's worth a lot more.

346
00:22:08,987 --> 00:22:10,494
Can you cheek a pill?

347
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:15,773
That's too bad for you.

348
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:25,217
You sure you're good with this?

349
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,804
Got to be done.

350
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:30,534
So how do we start?

351
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:33,069
I think we just start.

352
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,261
Make it good. Make it real.

353
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,265
Just do it already.

354
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:50,743
Code gray!

355
00:22:51,123 --> 00:22:53,329
Give me five milligrams of haldol!

356
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,292
Help! Get him off me!

357
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:05,267
Give it to him!

358
00:23:27,954 --> 00:23:29,490
Dude, that was awesome.

359
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:37,757
Think Hal will mind if they're wet?

360
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,718
No, it's your other friend
at the asylum.

361
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,019
How's it going?

362
00:23:51,144 --> 00:23:53,514
Hallucinations are gone,
so is the vicodin.

363
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,459
How's the leg?
How's the pain?

364
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,561
<i>They got me on some nonnarcotic.</i>

365
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,230
I'm dealing.
I need you to run a license plate.

366
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,733
Was there a hit-and-run
on your floor?

367
00:24:04,462 --> 00:24:06,444
<i>House, just do
what you're supposed to do.</i>

368
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,487
Listen to the doctors,

369
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:10,047
<i>and I'll be able</i> <i>to visit soon.</i>

370
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:12,950
Track down the owner of this car,
and I'll be able to visit you

371
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:15,953
<i>in your office tomorrow.
My doctor is too smart,</i>

372
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,706
too old, and too well-dressed
to only be running one ward.

373
00:24:19,154 --> 00:24:21,959
<i>He screwed up something in his life,
and I think he's doing it again.</i>

374
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,212
I need her name so I can
blackmail the blackmailer.

375
00:24:25,753 --> 00:24:26,903
He called me.

376
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:30,259
Why?

377
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,888
He wanted to know about you.

378
00:24:34,345 --> 00:24:37,030
<i>He wanted to warn me
that you'd be calling for something.</i>

379
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:39,844
And he told me if I wanted
to help you get better,

380
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:41,604
I had to let him do his job.

381
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,570
Now I'm calling you to
tell you that if he calls you...

382
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,467
I'm so sorry.

383
00:24:47,012 --> 00:24:48,361
I wish I could help you.

384
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:49,612
You can.

385
00:25:00,262 --> 00:25:01,456
It turns out...

386
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:05,711
You're my only friend.

387
00:25:08,054 --> 00:25:11,170
<i>House ain't a newbie,
now he living on this floor</i>

388
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:13,511
And I hate you.

389
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:17,876
I'm gonna cooperate.

390
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:21,918
That's not much of a plan.
That's actually their plan.

391
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:25,676
No, I'm pretty sure their plan is for me
to actually swallow the pills,

392
00:25:25,801 --> 00:25:27,717
to actually cooperate.

393
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,715
I'm so proud of my little roomie.

394
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,092
I only taught him
everything he knows.

395
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:37,953
One, two, three.

396
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:42,600
Stomp, you start the betting.

397
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:44,533
Highest card wins.

398
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:47,779
That's probably a fold.
Richter.

399
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:49,892
Two cigarettes.

400
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,195
He's not confident, Alvie.

401
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:53,332
Crush him,

402
00:26:53,753 --> 00:26:55,446
in the form of a rhyme if you want.

403
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,747
<i>No regrets, raise ten cigarettes</i>

404
00:26:59,657 --> 00:27:02,356
That's a lot of nerve
for someone with a two on their head.

405
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:03,772
You're messing with me.

406
00:27:03,897 --> 00:27:05,957
You can't raise ten.
I only have five.

407
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,334
- Throw in your phone card.
- I'm not gonna throw in it.

408
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:10,447
Can I play?

409
00:27:11,652 --> 00:27:12,880
- Come here.
- Why?

410
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:17,134
I wanna see if you've got what it takes.
Give me your best poker face.

411
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,307
Too rich for my blood.
You can take my seat.

412
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:25,249
Med time!

413
00:27:27,248 --> 00:27:28,632
How are you feeling today?

414
00:27:28,757 --> 00:27:31,023
Better than yesterday,
not as good as tomorrow.

415
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:53,212
I've been humming to her.

416
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,216
She sways.
It might be significant.

417
00:28:00,285 --> 00:28:03,014
Are you ignoring me, or are you letting
my charm wash over you?

418
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:07,657
Kind of tough to play and chat.

419
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,924
A couple of weeks ago, you told me

420
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:13,514
playing to her
was a complete waste of time.

421
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:17,959
You're right. Your playing
does get worse when you talk.

422
00:28:19,704 --> 00:28:21,198
I assume she loved music.

423
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:24,091
She played
for the Philadelphia philharmonic...

424
00:28:24,515 --> 00:28:25,328
Cello.

425
00:28:25,697 --> 00:28:28,622
If she responded to the piano, she might
respond even better to the cello.

426
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,280
I play a little.

427
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:36,692
Maybe I'll bring one in tuesday.

428
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:38,607
Thank you.

429
00:28:43,982 --> 00:28:45,805
Different desk, different doctor.

430
00:28:46,173 --> 00:28:47,720
You've been on meds for a while now.

431
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:51,109
I'll be checking in with you
to see if we need to adjust your dose.

432
00:28:51,234 --> 00:28:53,564
Any dry mouth, trouble sleeping?

433
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:56,650
Can I go now?

434
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,111
There's a manic out there
with a fresh carton of cigarettes,

435
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,174
and he's a terrible bluffer.

436
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:04,619
It's nice to see that you
and Alvie are friends again.

437
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:07,701
- Tell me about your fight.
- He hit me. I hit him back.

438
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:09,788
Repeat until pulpy.

439
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,040
Alvie told me
you instigated the thing.

440
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:14,251
That tends to be
the way fights work...

441
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,864
Different interpretations
of the same circumstances.

442
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,490
Very understanding attitude.

443
00:29:18,615 --> 00:29:20,508
- There's that tone again.
- You're smart.

444
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:24,678
How come every time you compliment me,
it sounds like an accusation?

445
00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:27,431
You're not having any side effects
from your meds, which is unusual.

446
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:30,309
- It's not that unusual.
- The fight isn't adding up.

447
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,223
Why don't you stop pretending
that you haven't reached a conclusion?

448
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:35,167
You don't trust me.

449
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:37,566
Actually, it's more fundamental
than that. You don't like me.

450
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:40,694
- I didn't say that.
- You think I'm not taking my meds.

451
00:29:41,135 --> 00:29:42,113
Are you?

452
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,746
So what do you want me to do?
Want me to take a urine test?

453
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:48,671
Will that earn your trust?

454
00:29:49,576 --> 00:29:50,788
Actually, yeah.

455
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:03,927
Have at it.

456
00:30:04,835 --> 00:30:06,318
A little dignity, please.

457
00:30:06,443 --> 00:30:08,583
You know the rules.
I have to watch.

458
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,516
But you don't have
to have courtside seats.

459
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,491
Can I at least use a stall?

460
00:30:37,777 --> 00:30:41,338
<i>For he himself has said it</i>

461
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:46,093
<i>And it's greatly to his credit</i>

462
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,389
<i>That he is an Englishman</i>

463
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:52,680
<i>He is...</i>

464
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:58,990
<i>an Englishman</i>

465
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,670
Get it while it's hot.

466
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:32,526
I'm sorry I doubted you.

467
00:31:36,387 --> 00:31:38,570
Freedom Master,
think you could help me out?

468
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:40,752
You need help?

469
00:31:40,903 --> 00:31:41,857
Of course...

470
00:31:42,143 --> 00:31:43,722
- That's what I do.
- Great.

471
00:31:44,306 --> 00:31:45,741
Could you move the piano?

472
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:49,191
500 pounds.
That's not too much, is it?

473
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:52,299
Is there something
trapped underneath or...?

474
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,745
No. I just want to move it
away from the window.

475
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,956
- My powers aren't for frivolous...
- Just one lift.

476
00:31:58,224 --> 00:32:01,078
- Why are you doing that?
- House, it's none of your business.

477
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:06,173
I'm curious.
As a doctor, what are you doing?

478
00:32:06,445 --> 00:32:08,724
Either he is Freedom Master,
and he shouldn't be here,

479
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:11,618
or else he's suffering
from a serious and dangerous delusion

480
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:13,259
that he needs to deal with.

481
00:32:13,384 --> 00:32:14,184
So...

482
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,152
Legit medical reasons.

483
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,186
You're not trying to break him
because he's a little different.

484
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,748
He's not different.
He's delusional.

485
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,094
- Can you help me out?
- What is she looking at?

486
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:26,510
You're not a superhero, Steven.

487
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,729
- You're a regular person.
- I can save her.

488
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:30,322
We're all just regular people.

489
00:32:30,676 --> 00:32:32,957
- It's what we do.
- They stole her voice box.

490
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:36,370
They have it in there.
That's what she's staring at.

491
00:32:37,503 --> 00:32:39,081
That's what she's staring at.

492
00:32:39,322 --> 00:32:40,639
Your wife is dead.

493
00:32:47,911 --> 00:32:49,972
- Good can defeat evil.
- Not every time.

494
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:52,223
Evil people killed a lot
of good people that day.

495
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:54,221
You couldn't save her.
No one could.

496
00:32:55,824 --> 00:32:57,024
It's in there.

497
00:32:57,515 --> 00:32:58,907
Her voice is in there.

498
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:00,673
Her voice is in there.

499
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:01,869
Code gray.

500
00:33:02,528 --> 00:33:03,828
Her voice is in...

501
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:15,701
Don't do it.

502
00:33:16,016 --> 00:33:17,552
I'm not doing anything.

503
00:33:17,677 --> 00:33:18,898
You're thinking.

504
00:33:19,023 --> 00:33:21,790
Things go from thinking to doing
way too fast in this place.

505
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:24,709
Keep thinking, you're gonna
wind up with no mo in your mojo.

506
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:28,034
- I'm thinking of hitting you again.
- You hate Medina. You hate all of them.

507
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,175
You want to hurt them. Keep pretending.
Step away from the hate.

508
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:34,385
What's the difference
between pretending to cooperate

509
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,752
and cooperating?

510
00:33:35,877 --> 00:33:37,640
Pretending is pretending.
It's not real.

511
00:33:37,877 --> 00:33:38,972
You don't mean it.

512
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:42,006
I sat and watched while he did
something stupid and pointless.

513
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:44,819
- I cooperated.
- Soon, you won't have to watch,

514
00:33:44,944 --> 00:33:46,413
because you're going home.

515
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:48,233
You'll be getting your job back.

516
00:33:48,672 --> 00:33:50,085
Everybody inside!

517
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,695
Closing ceremonies.

518
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,993
Everyone attends.
One of you is going home.

519
00:33:57,982 --> 00:34:00,051
It's been a great week.

520
00:34:00,764 --> 00:34:03,290
A number of you
have made tremendous strides.

521
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:06,251
But today we're here to congratulate

522
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,262
Susan.

523
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,251
We're proud of her!

524
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,260
We wish her well, and we hope...

525
00:34:15,577 --> 00:34:18,268
to never see her again!

526
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:42,079
- Where's Freedom Master?
- He isn't able to take part.

527
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:56,385
Get out there.
They said everybody has to get out.

528
00:34:57,494 --> 00:34:59,175
Talk!
Say something!

529
00:35:01,078 --> 00:35:03,036
- Leave him alone.
- Did you drug him?

530
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:05,269
Of course I didn't drug him.

531
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,743
He's in flat affect.
He's practically catatonic.

532
00:35:07,868 --> 00:35:08,939
Hey, we got cake.

533
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,816
- He's fine.
- Double chocolate.

534
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,610
Don't tell me that he's fine!
You did this!

535
00:35:14,143 --> 00:35:15,279
He was functioning.

536
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,862
- He was happy.
- He was delusional.

537
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:19,666
He's way better off now.

538
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:22,703
Let's talk.

539
00:35:29,514 --> 00:35:30,764
Thinking sucks.

540
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,146
I'm not allowed to get angry?

541
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:37,420
They screwed him up.

542
00:35:38,143 --> 00:35:39,445
And for the record...

543
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,713
I am two privilege levels above Susan,
and I got the same depression-scale.

544
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:45,768
Every patient is different.
It's not about scores

545
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,938
- and levels and...
- Happiness is happiness.

546
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,640
Test is test.
Coping is coping.

547
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:51,899
- And you think you're...
- Absolutely!

548
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:55,058
I need to address
some deeper issues,

549
00:35:55,183 --> 00:35:57,404
which I can do
on an outpatient basis.

550
00:35:57,797 --> 00:35:58,864
3 hours a week?

551
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:01,366
That's my opening offer.
If you want to counter, I'll fold.

552
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,770
"No" is not an argument.

553
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,206
- Are you trying to frustrate me?
- No.

554
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,797
"No" again?

555
00:36:09,407 --> 00:36:10,457
I can cope!

556
00:36:10,863 --> 00:36:12,426
I'm coping.
In fact...

557
00:36:13,014 --> 00:36:14,749
I'm coping better than you think.

558
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,883
I've not been taking my meds,

559
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:19,243
not one.

560
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,513
And, I still scored a "high functioning"
on your depression test.

561
00:36:23,165 --> 00:36:25,724
So your proof of your well-being
is that you lied?

562
00:36:25,997 --> 00:36:27,097
Manipulated.

563
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:28,644
My proof is

564
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,877
that I can fool the test and you,
which means I am high functioning.

565
00:36:32,002 --> 00:36:34,942
I am sane, rational, capable.
I should not be here.

566
00:36:35,146 --> 00:36:36,837
These are your pills from today?

567
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:40,197
I'm not gonna take it.
I'll just cheek it again.

568
00:36:43,717 --> 00:36:44,584
Lick it.

569
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:48,539
- You want me to lick your hand?
- I washed.

570
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,461
It's sugar.

571
00:36:57,172 --> 00:36:59,216
Your test results
were improving too regularly

572
00:36:59,906 --> 00:37:00,968
and too quickly.

573
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:04,173
I was concerned that you weren't
taking your pills, that it was an act,

574
00:37:04,298 --> 00:37:06,453
so I switched you to a placebo...

575
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:10,435
to see if your...

576
00:37:10,993 --> 00:37:12,535
Improvements would continue.

577
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,353
Your psych tests told me nothing,

578
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,776
but your urine tests

579
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:19,278
told me you were faking.

580
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,198
You need to stop
fighting the system.

581
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,430
You need to let me do my job.

582
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,872
So...
What's the next plan?

583
00:37:37,316 --> 00:37:38,772
There is no new plan.

584
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,104
I'm out of plans.

585
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:43,775
So what do we do?

586
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:45,462
We stop talking.

587
00:38:21,323 --> 00:38:23,539
I see you've got some cello
in your trunk.

588
00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:27,573
And, no, that's not a euphemism.

589
00:38:28,524 --> 00:38:29,723
Are you spying on me?

590
00:38:30,256 --> 00:38:31,997
I'm living
in a psychiatric hospital.

591
00:38:32,122 --> 00:38:34,413
Staring out of the window
is what we do.

592
00:38:34,955 --> 00:38:37,108
I assume you'll need help
carrying it up.

593
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:39,353
I still got grounds privileges.

594
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:43,111
And who's going to carry you
when you're carrying the cello?

595
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:45,931
Yes, cast aside
the useless cripple...

596
00:38:46,056 --> 00:38:47,572
How very German of you.

597
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,198
Seriously, the thing
weighs a ton with that case.

598
00:38:51,323 --> 00:38:54,748
- I think i'll need a dolly.
- Or we could ask Clark Kent

599
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:55,885
to pitch in.

600
00:38:56,495 --> 00:38:59,340
- The dolly's probably easier.
- The dolly...

601
00:38:59,465 --> 00:39:01,191
already feels good about itself.

602
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,674
He was a happy-go-lucky superhero

603
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,592
until they told him
he has no powers.

604
00:39:05,922 --> 00:39:08,302
We let him help out,
he feels good about himself.

605
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:10,047
Might be less depressed.

606
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:15,697
Why do you put your life on hold

607
00:39:15,822 --> 00:39:17,980
to visit your sister-in-law
five times a week?

608
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:21,358
Am I somehow a bad person
for showing compassion?

609
00:39:22,656 --> 00:39:25,626
You're not even a bad person
for lying about why you're doing it.

610
00:39:28,246 --> 00:39:29,661
That is impressive.

611
00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:32,995
That is a superhuman feat.

612
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:39,146
Why don't you take a rest
before flying that thing up to the ward?

613
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,193
He's still depressed.

614
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:47,676
Give me your keys.

615
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,604
You gonna dangle them in front
of him to entertain him?

616
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:52,591
I'm gonna make him feel
like he's flying.

617
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:54,558
I'll drive him around the grounds,
top down,

618
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:55,917
wind in his hair.

619
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,912
Seriously...

620
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:00,874
you're gonna say no to that?

621
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,400
Why are you so nice to me?

622
00:40:18,475 --> 00:40:20,413
I think you have a good heart.

623
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:23,462
Would you still be nice to me
if I told you that I lied?

624
00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:26,890
I'm not just driving
around the grounds.

625
00:40:27,015 --> 00:40:28,759
I'm kidnapping him
and stealing your car.

626
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:36,517
You sure?

627
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,298
I was starting to feel
a little heat between us.

628
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:41,438
Thought we had kind
of a "Bonnie and Clyde" thing.

629
00:40:41,888 --> 00:40:44,066
Bonnie and clyde get shot to pieces.

630
00:40:45,606 --> 00:40:46,606
See you.

631
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:10,008
You can do this.

632
00:41:10,224 --> 00:41:12,135
If you hold my hand,
I can do it too.

633
00:41:44,427 --> 00:41:45,577
Don't let go!

634
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:48,167
Going up!

635
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,076
Freedom Master's back!

636
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:07,671
Keep it down, freedom master.

637
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:09,885
You're scaring the good citizens.

638
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:13,286
- It was the coolest moment of my life.
- It was fun.

639
00:42:13,511 --> 00:42:16,204
You can repay me
by telling Nolan he's an idiot.

640
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,823
Smell that fresh air

641
00:42:18,222 --> 00:42:19,986
and the warmth of your yellow sun.

642
00:42:20,111 --> 00:42:21,361
We do enjoy it.

643
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,630
Careful of the traffic.

644
00:42:25,315 --> 00:42:27,371
Don't go damaging any fenders.

645
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,716
Come on, get down.

646
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:36,136
There's no cry for help.

647
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:37,800
There's no cat in a tree.

648
00:42:41,764 --> 00:42:42,899
Thank you, Greg.

649
00:42:55,568 --> 00:42:56,990
He's lucky to be alive.

650
00:42:58,373 --> 00:42:59,826
He's got a lacerated spleen,

651
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,494
rotational pelvic fracture,

652
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,933
compound break
of the femur and humerus.

653
00:43:05,462 --> 00:43:08,210
Everything in your life has been
about finding the truth.

654
00:43:08,523 --> 00:43:10,095
But suddenly, with this guy,

655
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,423
you decide to reinforce
a sick man's delusions.

656
00:43:16,271 --> 00:43:18,069
You just wanted to take
a swing at me.

657
00:43:20,186 --> 00:43:21,827
You don't care about getting out.

658
00:43:21,952 --> 00:43:23,387
You don't care about him.

659
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:25,699
You don't even care about the truth.

660
00:43:28,617 --> 00:43:30,232
You don't care about anything.

661
00:43:32,702 --> 00:43:34,661
I'm transferring you
to Winslow psychiatric.

662
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:37,544
You'll have better luck pulling
the wool over their eyes. I'm done.

663
00:43:39,691 --> 00:43:40,590
Don't.

664
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,320
I need help.

665
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,268
So how is this supposed to work?

666
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,645
You sit. I sit.
We talk.

667
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:10,772
- About what?
- About whatever you want.

668
00:44:11,136 --> 00:44:14,484
- You want me to whine about my mother?
- You want to whine about your mother?

669
00:44:15,311 --> 00:44:17,988
I can tell you about the time
I was five and my goldfish died.

670
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,511
If that's where you'd like to start.

671
00:44:21,496 --> 00:44:25,019
I've had a billion things happen to me.
How can I know which ones are relevant?

672
00:44:25,144 --> 00:44:27,963
- As far as I'm concerned, they're all.
- Well, we better get moving,

673
00:44:28,088 --> 00:44:30,233
'cause this session
could take 50 years.

674
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:33,143
Yes, you are the sum
of everything that's happened to you.

675
00:44:33,268 --> 00:44:36,256
And, yes, some events
are more relevant than others.

676
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:39,259
But the only way
we can figure out which ones are

677
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:40,477
is to talk.

678
00:44:41,424 --> 00:44:42,304
So tell me,

679
00:44:42,928 --> 00:44:44,298
what's on your mind?

680
00:44:45,037 --> 00:44:46,141
What do you want?

681
00:44:49,445 --> 00:44:50,987
I want to get better...

682
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:54,830
whatever the hell that means.

683
00:44:55,874 --> 00:44:58,611
- I'm sick of being miserable.
- So you'd like to be happy?

684
00:44:59,135 --> 00:45:01,510
Again with the reflecting...
Yes, I'd like to be happy.

685
00:45:01,635 --> 00:45:03,582
Being happy is an excellent goal.

686
00:45:03,707 --> 00:45:05,487
Not many patients can crystallize

687
00:45:05,612 --> 00:45:07,454
what they're hoping
to get out of this.

688
00:45:07,853 --> 00:45:10,803
- Well, bully for me.
- So now all we have to do

689
00:45:10,928 --> 00:45:13,343
is figure out how to get you
from here...

690
00:45:13,897 --> 00:45:14,897
to happy.

691
00:45:16,902 --> 00:45:17,964
SSRIS?

692
00:45:18,402 --> 00:45:19,966
That's your genius technique?

693
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:22,603
I don't think we should ignore
any tools that can help.

694
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:25,293
I know you don't have
a problem taking drugs.

695
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:27,270
For my leg, for pain.

696
00:45:27,395 --> 00:45:29,768
Think of this
as being for psychic pain.

697
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:34,606
I don't want to change who I am.

698
00:45:35,418 --> 00:45:36,418
Miserable?

699
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,049
Do you think that by taking meds

700
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:44,444
you'll lose your edge,

701
00:45:44,688 --> 00:45:47,494
stop making the unique connections
that make you a successful doctor?

702
00:45:48,564 --> 00:45:50,330
If Van Gogh was your patient,

703
00:45:50,566 --> 00:45:53,277
he'd be satisfied painting houses
instead of <i>The Starry night</i>.

704
00:45:53,402 --> 00:45:56,879
Van gogh would still be making inspired
paintings of the night sky,

705
00:45:57,486 --> 00:45:59,464
just maybe not
from the room of his asylum.

706
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:01,127
- You don't know that.
- I know

707
00:46:01,252 --> 00:46:03,493
both his ears would be intact.

708
00:46:05,084 --> 00:46:06,561
And I know his life...

709
00:46:07,246 --> 00:46:08,370
would be better.

710
00:46:19,301 --> 00:46:21,485
I know this doesn't come
naturally to you.

711
00:46:22,627 --> 00:46:24,114
But you want my help,

712
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:26,579
which means you need to trust me.

713
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,379
Delicious.

714
00:46:51,994 --> 00:46:53,344
Why are you here?

715
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,730
I'm waiting for my communion wafer.

716
00:47:04,362 --> 00:47:05,882
You're cheeking it, right?

717
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:07,257
Nope.

718
00:47:07,928 --> 00:47:09,448
Tell me you're cheeking it.

719
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,952
I swallowed it.

720
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,796
We don't take meds.

721
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:16,686
You don't take meds, Alvie.
I decided to get sane.

722
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,977
You're scamming again.
You can tell me.

723
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:20,647
I'm not scamming, Alvie.

724
00:47:21,795 --> 00:47:23,045
They broke you.

725
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:28,581
They didn't break me.

726
00:47:29,204 --> 00:47:30,304
I am broken.

727
00:47:33,087 --> 00:47:36,227
Now stop worshipping me and go and worry
about your own loser life.

728
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:41,499
I hate you.

729
00:47:53,101 --> 00:47:55,121
- Prom?
- Got an assignment for you.

730
00:47:55,535 --> 00:47:56,685
Role-playing?

731
00:47:58,411 --> 00:48:00,370
I'm not sure how pretending
to be a businessman

732
00:48:00,495 --> 00:48:03,091
with a foot fetish is gonna help,
but I'm game.

733
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:05,965
Have you connected
with any of the other patients?

734
00:48:07,064 --> 00:48:09,469
You've been here 4 weeks.
Tell me about your relationships

735
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,125
with the other patients.

736
00:48:11,927 --> 00:48:12,927
Diane...

737
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,850
is convinced
that silent girl hates her.

738
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:19,296
Richter's not as paranoid as you think.
He just likes that you think that.

739
00:48:20,003 --> 00:48:21,314
And my roommate hates me.

740
00:48:21,609 --> 00:48:24,943
Only one of the things indicated
how somebody else feels about you.

741
00:48:25,366 --> 00:48:26,169
So...

742
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,544
I'm sure that they've done

743
00:48:29,669 --> 00:48:32,367
some form of rudimentary analysis on me,
concluded that I'm a jerk.

744
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:35,541
You know, there is a way
for them to find out things about you

745
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:37,265
without deductive reasoning.

746
00:48:37,522 --> 00:48:38,957
I have had relationships.

747
00:48:39,238 --> 00:48:42,258
You've screwed up relationships,
every one of them...

748
00:48:42,383 --> 00:48:44,011
Almost like that was the goal.

749
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:45,588
I want you

750
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:46,977
to trust...

751
00:48:48,552 --> 00:48:49,323
people.

752
00:48:51,402 --> 00:48:52,178
Try.

753
00:48:55,823 --> 00:48:56,923
Get dressed.

754
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:17,569
Just open up?

755
00:49:19,716 --> 00:49:20,866
Just open up.

756
00:49:21,193 --> 00:49:22,041
Trust.

757
00:49:22,488 --> 00:49:23,488
Strangers?

758
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:26,820
We'll start with strangers,
then work our way up.

759
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:32,635
If it helps, I find "hello"
to be an excellent icebreaker.

760
00:49:46,002 --> 00:49:48,105
It's like "hello," only shorter.

761
00:49:52,011 --> 00:49:53,952
I'm glad we were able
to save that time.

762
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:56,743
Judging by the fancy suit,
I'd say you were a donor.

763
00:49:57,268 --> 00:50:00,204
The nervous demeanor
says maybe you've had issues,

764
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:03,291
probably is why this place
has personal meaning.

765
00:50:04,722 --> 00:50:06,606
But this is supposed to be about me.

766
00:50:08,456 --> 00:50:09,964
I take advantage of my friends.

767
00:50:12,566 --> 00:50:13,861
Friend, really...

768
00:50:14,313 --> 00:50:15,713
I've only got one.

769
00:50:16,689 --> 00:50:17,889
It can be tough.

770
00:50:18,787 --> 00:50:20,725
- I'm not gay.
- Oh, neither am i.

771
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,270
Actually, I am.

772
00:50:23,371 --> 00:50:24,646
See that guy over there?

773
00:50:26,229 --> 00:50:27,429
He's my lover.

774
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:31,194
He's also my psychiatrist, which some
would argue is a little inappropriate,

775
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:33,349
but they just don't know
what love is.

776
00:50:33,474 --> 00:50:34,405
Am I right?

777
00:50:40,643 --> 00:50:41,893
You're not gay.

778
00:50:42,131 --> 00:50:45,583
No, but I have to tell
intimate secrets to people.

779
00:50:47,104 --> 00:50:48,544
Maybe they should be true.

780
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:50,811
Hadn't thought of that.

781
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:52,972
To be on the safe side,
I should do both,

782
00:50:53,097 --> 00:50:54,477
starting with the fun ones.

783
00:50:54,602 --> 00:50:56,384
Come on, let's get me better.

784
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:14,802
I'm a philanderer.

785
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,826
Philanderer doesn't mean
that I give a lot to charity.

786
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,786
- It means...
- I know what it means.

787
00:51:24,011 --> 00:51:25,809
You were asking me

788
00:51:25,934 --> 00:51:27,964
if there were any nuts
in the <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>.

789
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:29,057
What?

790
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:30,878
Honey.

791
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:33,792
What did my husband just say to you?

792
00:51:37,076 --> 00:51:37,877
I...

793
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:41,832
was asking him if there were nuts...

794
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:43,362
in the <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>.

795
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,150
- Then where is your EpiPen?
- My what?

796
00:51:46,275 --> 00:51:49,021
No one with an allergy would
walk around without an EpiPen.

797
00:51:49,396 --> 00:51:51,232
- Give me your purse.
- Stop!

798
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,475
- Come...
- No.

799
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,193
What really happened

800
00:51:55,337 --> 00:51:56,140
is...

801
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:58,757
I thought he was cute.

802
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:00,658
I hit on him.

803
00:52:01,249 --> 00:52:02,349
We're going.

804
00:52:10,485 --> 00:52:11,735
You having fun?

805
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:15,131
I did connect with one guy.

806
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:19,505
But then my propensity
for screwing things up overtook me.

807
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:22,049
Then my desire to have fun

808
00:52:22,294 --> 00:52:23,933
overcame my propensity.

809
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:25,603
You didn't screw it up.

810
00:52:26,206 --> 00:52:29,145
The assignment wasn't to get you
to trust with a piece of your soul.

811
00:52:29,602 --> 00:52:32,356
The assignment was to teach you
that you can trust.

812
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:37,528
Did any of these people rat you out
as the obnoxious womanizer

813
00:52:37,862 --> 00:52:39,906
or the porn producer
that they think you are?

814
00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:43,075
Why do you think

815
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,540
that people would treat you
worse if they knew the truth?

816
00:52:51,478 --> 00:52:52,928
Good night, doctor.

817
00:52:57,006 --> 00:52:58,397
Are you in trouble?

818
00:53:01,002 --> 00:53:02,252
Apparently not.

819
00:53:02,732 --> 00:53:03,982
So what's next?

820
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,093
You want to be my pimp?

821
00:53:09,772 --> 00:53:11,020
Why don't we just talk?

822
00:53:16,477 --> 00:53:19,111
How come you weren't pissed
at me for stealing your car?

823
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:22,615
It was a nice thing to do.

824
00:53:24,279 --> 00:53:26,869
I'm not sure about the German-English
translation of nice.

825
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:28,746
The stealing was nice or...

826
00:53:30,546 --> 00:53:32,516
ruining Freedom Master's life?

827
00:53:33,635 --> 00:53:35,461
What you did was misguided

828
00:53:36,471 --> 00:53:37,871
and irresponsible,

829
00:53:38,858 --> 00:53:40,408
but it was also nice.

830
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:43,396
You gave him a moment
of pure happiness.

831
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:50,476
You asked me why I come here
so often to visit Annie.

832
00:53:52,504 --> 00:53:54,078
She was my best friend.

833
00:53:55,188 --> 00:53:57,168
Then she started pulling away...

834
00:53:58,388 --> 00:53:59,638
from everybody.

835
00:54:00,569 --> 00:54:02,135
The doctors don't know why.

836
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:04,441
I think

837
00:54:04,566 --> 00:54:07,068
I married her brother because...

838
00:54:08,155 --> 00:54:11,656
he was the only other one
who was going through the same thing.

839
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,072
But he stopped visiting
after a couple of years.

840
00:54:18,785 --> 00:54:19,785
I just...

841
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:21,719
couldn't stop.

842
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,510
I miss her.

843
00:54:34,882 --> 00:54:35,771
I should go.

844
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:39,726
Good night.

845
00:54:52,271 --> 00:54:53,321
Good night.

846
00:55:14,031 --> 00:55:15,381
So what happened?

847
00:55:16,868 --> 00:55:18,870
- You're talking to me now.
- No.

848
00:55:26,635 --> 00:55:27,685
Was it fun?

849
00:55:38,064 --> 00:55:39,186
She kissed me.

850
00:55:40,401 --> 00:55:42,224
Don't read into the phrasing.

851
00:55:42,553 --> 00:55:44,147
We kissed each other.

852
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:45,758
And how do you feel?

853
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,883
How do I feel?
It was a kiss.

854
00:55:48,008 --> 00:55:49,720
Kisses are good things.

855
00:55:53,711 --> 00:55:55,101
That was a loaded "okay."

856
00:55:55,421 --> 00:55:57,311
Not at all.
Why would you assume that?

857
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:59,215
'Cause you're being judgmental.

858
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:03,027
If I had said that I'd had a delicious
Chilean sea bass for dinner,

859
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:04,902
would you say,
"And how do you feel?"

860
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,696
If the sea bass was married,
I might.

861
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,164
See, you're being judgmental.

862
00:56:10,305 --> 00:56:12,487
Isn't that against your code
or something?

863
00:56:12,612 --> 00:56:14,036
I'm simply stating the obvious.

864
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,540
It's complicated,
not just because she's married

865
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:19,250
and not just because
you're institutionalized.

866
00:56:19,486 --> 00:56:21,104
I know you spent the last 12 hours

867
00:56:21,229 --> 00:56:23,265
trying to figure out
what that kiss means.

868
00:56:25,418 --> 00:56:27,371
Who's that woman you were with

869
00:56:27,496 --> 00:56:28,843
in the parking lot?

870
00:56:29,603 --> 00:56:30,742
When you deflect,

871
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:33,369
it's more effective
when you're not that transparent.

872
00:56:33,494 --> 00:56:35,641
Obviously you have no problem
with the infidelity.

873
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,841
You're trying to rationalize that,

874
00:56:37,966 --> 00:56:39,854
"if it's okay for your doctor,
it's okay."

875
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:41,439
But for the record,

876
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,691
- I am not having an affair.
- Then who is she?

877
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:46,609
Why are you working so hard
to figure out the details of my life?

878
00:56:46,734 --> 00:56:49,613
I might not have to work so hard
if there were personal items in here.

879
00:56:49,996 --> 00:56:51,657
You got one number on speed dial.

880
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,025
It says "Dad".

881
00:56:53,474 --> 00:56:54,994
Come on, how old are you?

882
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,755
- Why are you so afraid?
- I want to talk about you.

883
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,378
I want to know whogives me advice.

884
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,625
I'm not giving you advice.
I'm asking questions.

885
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,545
I think that kiss meant a lot.
I think that scares you.

886
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:06,846
I think there are
no personal items in here

887
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:08,549
because you have no personal life.

888
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,549
How do you think
you and Lydia will end?

889
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:12,359
You are a lonely man.

890
00:57:12,484 --> 00:57:14,680
You've screwed up every
opportunity you've had.

891
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,474
What's the ending to the story?

892
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:22,979
I don't know.

893
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:28,681
Visiting time!

894
00:57:48,687 --> 00:57:50,132
Why did you kiss me?

895
00:57:55,117 --> 00:57:56,889
How many reasons are there?

896
00:57:58,247 --> 00:57:59,297
I like you.

897
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,724
It felt like a nice way
of showing you that.

898
00:58:26,018 --> 00:58:28,420
Open it all the way.
Keep it open.

899
00:58:52,307 --> 00:58:53,763
How'd it go with Lydia?

900
00:58:53,888 --> 00:58:56,374
I found out
you can only be happy so long

901
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,825
before the catatonic guy
with two broken limbs

902
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:00,703
rolls off the elevator,

903
00:59:01,029 --> 00:59:02,705
philosophically speaking.

904
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:05,708
Why do you value your failures
more than your successes?

905
00:59:06,552 --> 00:59:09,837
My mother caught me masturbating...
to pictures of her mother.

906
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:11,881
Can we get past
these cute deflections?

907
00:59:13,652 --> 00:59:16,119
Successes only last
until someone screws them up.

908
00:59:16,244 --> 00:59:17,747
Failures are forever.

909
00:59:17,872 --> 00:59:19,572
So you accept that fact.

910
00:59:20,827 --> 00:59:22,898
You accept that
there's nothing you can do.

911
00:59:23,214 --> 00:59:25,596
Okay, I accept the fact
that there's nothing I can do.

912
00:59:25,721 --> 00:59:27,461
Now, what can I do?

913
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,725
You acknowledge failure,

914
00:59:30,587 --> 00:59:31,817
and you move past it.

915
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,520
You apologize.

916
00:59:35,982 --> 00:59:38,082
Powerful things these apologies.

917
00:59:39,064 --> 00:59:41,283
Get someone to jump off a building.

918
00:59:41,408 --> 00:59:43,579
You say two words,
and you move on with your life.

919
00:59:44,176 --> 00:59:45,576
Hardly seems fair.

920
00:59:46,295 --> 00:59:47,583
Is that the issue?

921
00:59:50,907 --> 00:59:52,725
You caused him pain.

922
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:56,592
If the world is just,

923
00:59:57,034 --> 00:59:58,969
you have to suffer equally?

924
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,700
You're not god, House.

925
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,704
You're just another...

926
01:00:06,829 --> 01:00:09,563
screwed-up human being
who needs to move on.

927
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:13,317
Apologize to him.

928
01:00:13,824 --> 01:00:15,574
Let yourself feel better.

929
01:00:16,034 --> 01:00:18,434
Then you can learn
to let yourself...

930
01:00:19,347 --> 01:00:21,442
keep feeling better.

931
01:01:02,023 --> 01:01:04,076
Dr. House, everything okay?

932
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:09,456
Time for group.

933
01:01:09,973 --> 01:01:11,573
Group time, everybody!

934
01:01:15,981 --> 01:01:17,506
I have a surprise.

935
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,843
2 weeks from today,

936
01:01:18,968 --> 01:01:21,768
we're going to have
the mayfield talent show.

937
01:01:22,382 --> 01:01:24,596
Talent show?
Who's in it?

938
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,224
I'd really love it if everybody here
could participate.

939
01:01:27,774 --> 01:01:30,769
- Then who's gonna watch?
- The staff will come,

940
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,062
friends and family.

941
01:01:32,733 --> 01:01:35,065
- You gonna tape this?
- No, it's just for us.

942
01:01:35,433 --> 01:01:37,484
If it's just for us,
I vote we don't do it.

943
01:01:38,289 --> 01:01:40,480
Think of it as a fun way
to work on...

944
01:01:40,605 --> 01:01:42,656
on our therapeutic issues.

945
01:01:42,998 --> 01:01:44,992
Avie, maybe you could sing
one of your songs.

946
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,328
I don't sing. I rap.

947
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:49,330
You can write something just for us.

948
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,708
I don't write.
I just do, freestyle style.

949
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,750
I think you're gonna want
to be prepared.

950
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:57,575
- Make something special.</i>
- Always special.

951
01:01:57,876 --> 01:02:00,299
How about you, Diane?
Is there something you'd like to do?

952
01:02:01,775 --> 01:02:03,177
I don't have any talents.

953
01:02:03,515 --> 01:02:06,263
Sure you do.
You all do.

954
01:02:07,012 --> 01:02:09,215
Steve, don't you think that Diane
has hidden talent

955
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,851
that we'd like to see come out?

956
01:02:13,514 --> 01:02:15,147
You really think he's gonna answer?

957
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:17,107
- Eventually.
- Why?

958
01:02:18,907 --> 01:02:20,235
Because things pass.

959
01:02:20,479 --> 01:02:23,233
Things change.
It doesn't mean they get better.

960
01:02:23,537 --> 01:02:25,820
You got to make things better.
You can't just keep talking

961
01:02:25,945 --> 01:02:27,159
and hope for the best.

962
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:33,290
Diane, maybe you and I can work together
and figure something out.

963
01:02:34,982 --> 01:02:36,232
I can save him.

964
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,339
"They stole her voice box",
that's what he said.

965
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,466
That's what she was staring at.

966
01:02:43,065 --> 01:02:45,344
- That's why he's staring.
- Dr. House, please.

967
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:48,180
- 'Cause there's a music box in there.
- Orderly.

968
01:02:50,978 --> 01:02:52,559
Just give it to me.
I can...

969
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,648
I am not having a psychotic break.

970
01:02:56,456 --> 01:02:57,981
I promise you this will work.

971
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,201
It's the blue box there
on the top shelf.

972
01:03:12,465 --> 01:03:14,234
This is what you wanted.

973
01:03:14,359 --> 01:03:16,930
This is what you needed...
a voice.

974
01:03:17,682 --> 01:03:19,942
You thought you could cure
silent girl with this.

975
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:22,339
So by your own rationale,
it should cure you.

976
01:03:24,506 --> 01:03:26,556
There's nothing wrong with you.

977
01:03:27,227 --> 01:03:29,176
You're healing.
All the parts work.

978
01:03:29,301 --> 01:03:30,222
Just speak.

979
01:03:31,864 --> 01:03:33,725
Come on, speak!
Say something!

980
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:36,228
I think maybe everyone
should take a break now.

981
01:03:45,107 --> 01:03:46,363
You're trying to fix

982
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:48,631
instead of moving on.

983
01:04:06,913 --> 01:04:08,363
I brought dvorak...

984
01:04:08,996 --> 01:04:10,014
four hands.

985
01:04:13,329 --> 01:04:14,329
What?

986
01:04:15,406 --> 01:04:17,306
I need to know what this is.

987
01:04:19,044 --> 01:04:20,394
It's sheet music.

988
01:04:25,135 --> 01:04:26,885
I told you.
It's just...

989
01:04:27,803 --> 01:04:29,403
two people having fun.

990
01:04:31,073 --> 01:04:32,833
There's two possible outcomes.

991
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:34,682
It ends.
Someone gets hurt.

992
01:04:34,807 --> 01:04:37,207
Or it doesn't end.
Someone gets hurt.

993
01:04:37,973 --> 01:04:39,685
So the end sucks.

994
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:41,721
It doesn't mean
the beginning has to.

995
01:04:43,135 --> 01:04:45,035
Everything ends.
Life ends.

996
01:04:45,876 --> 01:04:48,145
It doesn't mean
that we can't enjoy it.

997
01:04:49,347 --> 01:04:51,247
I can't...
I can't do this.

998
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:56,210
All I know is,
I was happy five minutes ago,

999
01:04:56,464 --> 01:04:57,764
and now I'm not.

1000
01:04:58,855 --> 01:05:00,255
How's that better?

1001
01:05:02,094 --> 01:05:03,394
Good-bye, Lydia.

1002
01:05:11,323 --> 01:05:13,423
I'm really worried about e. c. t.

1003
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:15,452
Apprehension's normal.

1004
01:05:15,798 --> 01:05:18,330
- Has anyone else had it?
- They shocked me, man.

1005
01:05:20,452 --> 01:05:22,543
Thanks.
That's very reassuring.

1006
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:26,964
- I don't know if I should do it.
- Just do the treatment or shut up.

1007
01:05:27,669 --> 01:05:30,293
- Greg, there's a process.
- Yes, a process.

1008
01:05:30,418 --> 01:05:32,817
Wouldn't want to disrupt
the process with results.

1009
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:34,591
Heezy had a rough night last night.

1010
01:05:34,716 --> 01:05:37,522
Guess he decided to go back to being
an ass instead of a hypocrite.

1011
01:05:37,647 --> 01:05:39,142
Let's move on.

1012
01:05:39,464 --> 01:05:42,333
Alvie, are you making
any progress writing your rap?

1013
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:46,817
But really, no. I just don't want
to write my songs down.

1014
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:49,550
It takes all the spontaneity
out of it. It's not...

1015
01:05:49,675 --> 01:05:50,904
of the moment.

1016
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,694
If you write things down...

1017
01:05:52,819 --> 01:05:54,408
When the time comes, my rhyme comes,

1018
01:05:54,773 --> 01:05:56,588
when my spotlight shines...

1019
01:05:58,175 --> 01:05:59,775
Yeah, you're a genius.

1020
01:06:00,193 --> 01:06:01,665
Rhymes with "penius."

1021
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,983
Sorry to interrupt, dr. Beasley.

1022
01:06:04,356 --> 01:06:06,336
Dr. Nolan asked me to give you this.

1023
01:06:11,173 --> 01:06:13,965
- Is this a day pass?
- He'd like to see you.

1024
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:35,391
Thanks for coming.

1025
01:06:35,865 --> 01:06:38,493
I was hoping you could,
take a look at my dad's chart.

1026
01:06:40,034 --> 01:06:41,294
A consult?

1027
01:06:41,859 --> 01:06:45,167
What happened? You went through
every sane doctor in town?

1028
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,419
I thought you wouldn't mind
getting off the ward.

1029
01:06:51,821 --> 01:06:53,842
Cleaning lady found him
on the kitchen floor.

1030
01:06:54,725 --> 01:06:56,820
Doctors here don't think
that he'll recover,

1031
01:06:56,945 --> 01:06:58,472
that I should pull the plug.

1032
01:06:58,985 --> 01:07:01,008
I want a second opinion, so I...

1033
01:07:01,133 --> 01:07:03,415
I thought I'd be a fool
not to call you.

1034
01:07:06,817 --> 01:07:07,898
Lacunar infarct,

1035
01:07:08,494 --> 01:07:10,594
converted to hemorrhagic stroke.

1036
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,920
It squashed his brain.

1037
01:07:13,731 --> 01:07:14,988
They didn't miss anything.

1038
01:07:16,785 --> 01:07:19,121
- That's what I thought.
- That's what you knew.

1039
01:07:21,027 --> 01:07:23,427
His brain
has been replaced by blood.

1040
01:07:23,861 --> 01:07:24,706
It's over.

1041
01:07:25,613 --> 01:07:28,543
And that's obvious to any doctor
who looks at that scan, even a shrink.

1042
01:07:29,575 --> 01:07:32,047
You want someone to tell you
that what you need to do is OK,

1043
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:34,425
to give you permission, absolution.

1044
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:36,176
Not now, House.

1045
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,763
You have no friends, no family.

1046
01:07:40,542 --> 01:07:42,099
At some point,

1047
01:07:42,388 --> 01:07:44,750
you made a mistake.
You lost everything.

1048
01:07:46,668 --> 01:07:48,855
And now I'm the closest thing
you got to a friend.

1049
01:07:49,781 --> 01:07:50,931
Just shut up.

1050
01:07:53,118 --> 01:07:54,818
I don't need you here...

1051
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:56,608
to play this game.

1052
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:50,562
I'm sorry I pushed you away.

1053
01:08:52,008 --> 01:08:53,545
It's what I do when I'm afraid.

1054
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:58,800
Again, german-english
translation may be a little off.

1055
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,838
I'm not... I'm not crying
because of you.

1056
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:09,920
I'm crying because I'm pathetic.

1057
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:12,743
I brought her cello,

1058
01:09:12,868 --> 01:09:15,825
in case she magically wakes up
for the show.

1059
01:09:17,455 --> 01:09:18,904
Then I take the apology back.

1060
01:09:21,107 --> 01:09:22,557
We're all pathetic.

1061
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:24,576
It's makes everything interesting.

1062
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:27,460
I'm sick of life being interesting.

1063
01:13:16,077 --> 01:13:17,559
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1064
01:13:17,828 --> 01:13:19,894
<i>the one, the only,</i>

1065
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:21,938
<i>Juan Alvarez!</i>

1066
01:13:28,932 --> 01:13:31,906
What's up? Ward six
is jumping off, y'all!

1067
01:13:32,163 --> 01:13:34,576
Give it up for DJ Richter
on the ones and twos.

1068
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,344
DJ Richter, spin that!

1069
01:13:42,471 --> 01:13:45,045
<i>Welcome to Mayfield
where the day feels long</i>

1070
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:47,922
<i>we act strong, but there's
got to be something wrong</i>

1071
01:13:48,161 --> 01:13:50,803
<i>see, we got hidden talents
you don't see hidden secrets</i>

1072
01:13:50,928 --> 01:13:52,218
<i>if we could show you those</i>

1073
01:13:58,905 --> 01:14:00,705
<i>If we could show you those</i>

1074
01:14:07,825 --> 01:14:09,925
<i>Then we wouldn't have no regrets</i>

1075
01:14:15,145 --> 01:14:17,660
<i>Wanna know my secrets?
Sit back and let me explain it</i>

1076
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:19,370
<i>My pops split, mama got sick</i>

1077
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:20,587
<i>Clich, ain't it?</i>

1078
01:14:20,712 --> 01:14:23,208
<i>Now I'm a manic hispanic
I'm trying to make it work</i>

1079
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,092
<i>But the doctors think I'm lazy</i>

1080
01:14:32,485 --> 01:14:34,035
<i>My roommate is a jerk</i>

1081
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:38,681
<i>Dr. House is in the house, y'all</i>

1082
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:41,726
<i>Give it up for Dr. House
to the stage, y'all</i>

1083
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,561
<i>Paging Dr. House to the stage,</i>

1084
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:44,529
<i>y'all</i>

1085
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:47,190
<i>Are you there, Dr. House?
It's on</i>

1086
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,955
<i>Bring it on</i>

1087
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,990
<i>He's coming to the stage, y'all</i>

1088
01:14:54,175 --> 01:14:56,699
<i>It's Dr. House on the remix</i>

1089
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,535
<i>Dr. House on the remix</i>

1090
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:04,415
<i>They say to take your pills
They say don't be a creep</i>

1091
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,015
<i>But how can I get better</i>

1092
01:15:08,125 --> 01:15:09,504
<i>If I can't get no sleep?</i>

1093
01:15:10,565 --> 01:15:13,633
<i>You gotta think before you act
In order to progress</i>

1094
01:15:16,495 --> 01:15:19,389
<i>If you don't make connections
Then your whole life is a mess</i>

1095
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:24,880
<i>Yeah, so tell me, doctor,
what I really got to know</i>

1096
01:15:25,005 --> 01:15:26,485
<i>How do I get better?</i>

1097
01:15:27,645 --> 01:15:28,898
<i>Just do a talent show</i>

1098
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,905
<i>Well, I guess I'm just a mess, yes</i>

1099
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:35,196
<i>Preach it to me, brother
A life of restlessness</i>

1100
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,906
<i>But at least we have each other</i>

1101
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:39,367
<i>We got each other, we got each other</i>

1102
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:43,505
<i>Like two brothers from another mother
Duck and run for cover, ward six</i>

1103
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:54,440
How are you doing?

1104
01:15:55,105 --> 01:15:56,301
You hanging in there?

1105
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:58,469
Usually, I open with that.

1106
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:02,790
Thanks for staying.

1107
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:06,740
So...

1108
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:08,813
What do you want to talk about?

1109
01:16:10,025 --> 01:16:11,625
Things are actually...

1110
01:16:13,405 --> 01:16:14,465
Actually good.

1111
01:16:15,215 --> 01:16:18,823
You don't want to complain
in front of the guy who lost his father?

1112
01:16:20,254 --> 01:16:21,367
I'm not that cured.

1113
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,170
I still got stuff to do, but...

1114
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:28,530
I'm good.

1115
01:16:36,985 --> 01:16:37,985
I'm sorry.

1116
01:16:53,445 --> 01:16:55,445
I was trying to prove a point.

1117
01:16:58,175 --> 01:16:59,614
I was trying to be right.

1118
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:04,118
I ended up putting you
in a dangerous situation,

1119
01:17:04,565 --> 01:17:06,375
and I was not equipped to handle it.

1120
01:17:07,365 --> 01:17:08,865
You got hurt, and...

1121
01:17:09,315 --> 01:17:10,515
it's my fault.

1122
01:17:13,635 --> 01:17:14,835
And I'm sorry.

1123
01:17:24,555 --> 01:17:25,655
Med time.

1124
01:17:31,335 --> 01:17:33,356
I'll try those pink ones today.
You?

1125
01:18:28,756 --> 01:18:29,579
Thank you.

1126
01:18:30,725 --> 01:18:31,885
You're welcome.

1127
01:18:41,445 --> 01:18:42,695
Got a surprise.

1128
01:19:55,985 --> 01:19:58,751
Today, we're here to congratulate.

1129
01:19:59,145 --> 01:20:00,145
Annie!

1130
01:20:02,935 --> 01:20:04,173
We're proud of her!

1131
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,109
We wish her well, and we hope to...

1132
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,469
Never see her again!

1133
01:20:21,845 --> 01:20:24,030
If you go silent for over a decade,

1134
01:20:24,155 --> 01:20:27,071
you don't just get to slide
right back into society.

1135
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:33,244
She's going to a rehab facility first,
in Arizona.

1136
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:38,166
Her family's moving there.

1137
01:20:41,105 --> 01:20:42,044
Sorry, House.

1138
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:44,690
I just found out myself.

1139
01:20:49,645 --> 01:20:51,679
I want an overnight pass.

1140
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,145
- I can help you.
- I've earned it.

1141
01:20:59,465 --> 01:21:01,205
- Yes, but...
- Isn't extending trust

1142
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:03,316
part of the whole
"getting me better" thing?

1143
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:06,486
If you insist on a pass, I'll give it
to you. But I know where you're going,

1144
01:21:06,775 --> 01:21:09,145
and I know you haven't
thought it through.

1145
01:21:10,435 --> 01:21:12,533
We need to sit down,
talk about this.

1146
01:21:14,905 --> 01:21:16,655
Please, give me the pass.

1147
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:45,325
Hi.

1148
01:21:45,475 --> 01:21:46,275
Hello.

1149
01:21:46,512 --> 01:21:47,401
Who are you?

1150
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:48,402
I'm...

1151
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:52,400
Ben, go inside, okay?

1152
01:21:58,795 --> 01:22:00,495
You didn't say anything.

1153
01:22:01,275 --> 01:22:04,975
And now Annie's leaving,
and I hear you're going to Arizona.

1154
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:10,841
My husband travels to Phoenix a lot.
His corporate headquarters are there.

1155
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,221
We've been wanting to move for years,
but we've been tethered here.

1156
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:17,465
And now, we're not.

1157
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,310
I don't want you to go.

1158
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,750
I don't want to go.

1159
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:30,460
But I can't break up my family.

1160
01:22:30,585 --> 01:22:32,385
I can't leave my children.

1161
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,701
I just don't want it to change.

1162
01:22:41,075 --> 01:22:43,875
I'm sorry
that I didn't come to say goodbye.

1163
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:49,480
I thought it ended kind of perfect.

1164
01:22:57,675 --> 01:22:58,825
I have to go.

1165
01:23:18,185 --> 01:23:21,370
Not the most exciting use
of the overnight pass I've ever seen.

1166
01:23:22,305 --> 01:23:23,305
She left.

1167
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:26,220
And...

1168
01:23:27,905 --> 01:23:28,905
I'm lost.

1169
01:23:42,335 --> 01:23:43,947
I'm gonna write your letter...

1170
01:23:45,215 --> 01:23:46,646
to the medical board,

1171
01:23:47,065 --> 01:23:48,731
so that they give your license back.

1172
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:51,575
You can't just console me

1173
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,653
by giving me a lollipop
when I skin my knee.

1174
01:23:53,967 --> 01:23:55,154
Two things happened.

1175
01:23:55,485 --> 01:23:56,405
You got hurt,

1176
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:59,950
that means you connected to someone else
strongly enough to miss them.

1177
01:24:00,225 --> 01:24:01,675
And more important,

1178
01:24:02,145 --> 01:24:04,288
you recognized the pain
and came to talk to me,

1179
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:07,520
instead of hiding from it
in a Vicodin bottle.

1180
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:11,185
The fact that you're hurting
and you came here,

1181
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,005
that you're taking your meds

1182
01:24:13,625 --> 01:24:15,805
and we're talking right now...

1183
01:24:17,895 --> 01:24:19,428
Come inside and get some sleep.

1184
01:24:20,205 --> 01:24:22,540
Tomorrow,
you can start saying your goodbyes.

1185
01:24:29,745 --> 01:24:32,521
Today,
we're here to congratulate Greg.

1186
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:35,370
We're proud of him.

1187
01:24:35,495 --> 01:24:37,290
We wish him well, and we hope...

1188
01:24:37,415 --> 01:24:40,075
To never see him again!

1189
01:24:41,055 --> 01:24:42,055
House!

1190
01:24:56,374 --> 01:24:57,174
Back off.

1191
01:24:57,565 --> 01:24:58,671
They think we're gay.

1192
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,300
What do you need, Alvie?

1193
01:26:20,605 --> 01:26:21,605
My meds.

1194
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:25,763
I want to get better.
