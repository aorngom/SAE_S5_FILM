 than I expected.

170
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,057
Oh, God, or more.

171
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,543
 What's interesting?

172
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:06,975
Mom?

173
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,149
Are you sure it was s yoga 
 what we did lose weight?

174
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:24,858
So-Is that all this time I thought

175
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:27,323
you were taking classes 
 yoga, have you been here?

176
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:31,576
I thought not let me do that, you know, 
 so feel the violence.

177
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:33,984
Not that you were 
 Cambodia bombing.

178
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:38,456
Do I love boxing? No. 
 But it is a sport.

179
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,546
S but no more lies,

180
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:42,491
or arm pairs.

181
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:44,985
All I did was show Ginny 
 Biography and a picture of Clint

182
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,988
Web site gym, 
  then leap like a cat

183
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:50,468
and said that if no sal√as 
 √ © l with, she will.

184
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:51,925
And degustaci√   wine?

185
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,807
That was in large part to Trevor.

186
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,620
Does not work at a station of radio.

187
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:58,921
It is my tutor. Besides working in s 
 bar that you like, Tres Equis.

188
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:02,188
As I can see that 
 make things work between You and Clint.

189
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:05,877
Dear, Clint is a man 
 great, really.

190
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:10,135
But we have fundamental disagreements.

191
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,771
Is a Republican, and what have you?

192
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:13,337
It's like someone says,

193
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:16,520
"Aha, you are the best portions of pizza ,

194
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,202
© but sneezes on her. "

195
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,235
No matter what is so perfect 
 if you are covered by a sneeze.

196
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,736
Marshall, Do you let a minute?

197
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:30,086
What happened ?

198
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:32,125
Abama supon√a we are a 
 found at degustaci√ up of wines.

199
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,501
Novato.

200
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:36,076
Look, you are Rocky, I'm Mickey.

201
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:38,363
- I want to catch the hen. 
 - What?

202
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:41,271
Con-a-more, NIA ± o. S√ © exactly 
 what I'm doing.

203
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:44,144
I suppose that if I used the 
 entrance me Marshall

204
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:47,525
for wine degustaci√ , 
 we hubi√ © ramos found.

205
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,512
Perde will by all this.

206
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:52,635
Apparently, my son is 
 Metiches a secret.

207
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:55,081
Sometimes it gets a bit ...

208
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:56,559
 Too excited?

209
00:10:57,103 --> 00:11:00,060
- It is one of his best qualities. 
 - True.

210
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:02,025
Marshall is a guy in-ble.

211
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:05,165
S√ © that whatever you do, 
 comes from a good place.

212
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:07,984
Wanted to say what 
 s the same for most people.

213
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:15,551
So, What are we going to do 
 n  degustaci√ with this wine?

214
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:25,017
So that, Clint, Marshall told me to 
 das classes Boxing Free

215
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,488
for children from poor areas.

216
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:29,502
I told you exactly that.

217
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:33,033
Think what will life 
 Clint without these guys:

218
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:36,658
Drogas, armas... pelea de perros?

219
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:37,375
Too.

220
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,445
Well, that was a good spectator! Ass.

221
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,959
- Although you do is admirable. 
 - No deal.

222
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:47,272
Sabes, producimos un pequeÒo segmento
de "HÈroes de la comunidad"

223
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,945
No station in the PSB for the job.

224
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,998
Your work in the gym would be 
 a very good piece.

225
00:11:51,098 --> 00:11:54,381
I'm very flattered, but the 
 I really do not have the rite methods.

226
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:56,667
 At least he'll think s?

227
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:01,600
Do not leave me n entrar.

228
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:04,140
Apparently, I am not enough 
 great wine to spit in a bucket.

229
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,720
Well, must go home-owners alike.

230
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:11,669
 And to prove the missing Chateau 2005 
 de Chinon Les Coulaine Picasso?

231
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:13,990
I will never forgive you.

232
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:16,238
Go to mob and drink.

233
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:17,370
Wait here with the © ny ± o.

234
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:22,371
I come from a long, distinguished line -

235
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:24,590
de entusiastas de cerveza de una lata.

236
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:27,496
You know, even I was interested in wine

237
00:12:27,531 --> 00:12:29,097
Pela-when I saw the film "Sideways"

238
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:32,651
and all that thinking was pruning 
 "God Mao, please! llense comfortable."

239
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,516
And then I had my first cup

240
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:37,606
the Russian River Valley Barbera

241
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:41,163
© and found myself using 
 the word "mellow."

242
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:43,397
CAA is a field-day.

243
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:48,643
Why the hell is still moving?

244
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,555
I will go on the other side.

245
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:57,445
Trevor, What you doing?

246
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,351
-  "Mirone is a word? 
 - No.

247
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:01,836
Well, then I'm not doing that.

248
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:04,286
Hello. I'm Liv. 
 I am the mother of Claire.

249
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:06,871
Is Claire's mother? 
  Really?

250
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,565
- You must have many stories. 
 - Trevor.

251
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,624
If you do not mind me say,

252
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,730
his daughter is beautiful increased substantially,

253
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:17,194
- But it really is a bother. 
 - I see you know very well.

254
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,209
As the palm of your smart 
 sexy and critical hand.

255
00:13:20,244 --> 00:13:22,062
I think you found a good, Claire.

256
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:23,748
Not Found ©. Not me-o.

257
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:25,802
Never me 
 none of their boyfriends.

258
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:26,807
Not my boyfriend.

259
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:28,485
Estamos distanciados.

260
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:31,442
- Are not alienated. 
 - En serio? What you gonna do then?

261
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,300
Well, I can always get 
 a room, my dear.

262
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:34,602
It's fine with us, Mom!.

263
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:38,085
- I know Trevor's work. 
 - Oh, I see.

264
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,988
- Your secrets are safe with me. 
 - Thanks.

265
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:43,452
No, no n ∫ ning secret. 
 It FICCI .

266
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:46,927
Es tan lindo ver que finalmente
tienes quÌmica con alguien.

267
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:51,314
- No what-mica. 
 - See you down, Claire,

268
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:53,974
and if they end up in the apartment,

269
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:56,317
just leave it a socks-n at the door.

270
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,418
It is not my fault that we have what-mica.

271
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:07,545
I'm surprised you've agreed to 
 go out with me first.

272
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,147
Not the kind of person who 
 is a blind date.

273
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:13,554
Well, I have a bit of the 
 effect of wine,

274
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:15,084
© so that will be honest.

275
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:17,457
I made this computer dating thing

276
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:19,092
makes a lot simo-time

277
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:21,461
 And when you saw full 
 questionnaire

278
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:23,057
ba naming physically 
 all qualities

279
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:25,330
the person s who are looking for?

280
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,568
Well, when you describe Ginny-a,

281
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:31,553
was like going ticking 
 all my answers.

282
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:34,943
Except for the part of Republican.

283
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:39,200
Surprisingly, the policy 
  I never pass through the mind.

284
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:40,276
That is surprising.

285
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:43,458
Insurance had ceased 
 to one of ours.

286
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:45,819
Definitely. A role, 
 all the right answers

287
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:49,462
was immediately terminated 
 with the word "Republican."

288
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:51,708
A√ ∫ n, here are s-,

289
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:56,987
and I am thinking of 
 all the right answers.

290
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:03,564
I can not believe that you 
 want to join, Trevor.

291
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:04,824
 She chose a time

292
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:07,044
in a folder full of donors.

293
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:10,077
Wait, Are you telling me that you are s 
 coupled to Hallie

294
00:15:10,111 --> 00:15:12,112
with the parent donor 
 sperm of her son?

295
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:13,864
Lo s√ ©. Is a breeze.

296
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:17,014
Sometimes I feel that I am the 
 ero dating companions of destiny.

297
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:19,204
Trevor, you gotta see this.

298
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,770
Hey, in case you wonder,

299
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,705
the sound beam going from one side 
 to the other by the last hours

300
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,723
- Is indeed disturbing. 
 - So, is as animal feed.

301
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:45,073
 Can you try to sit 
 into a block of more rmol

302
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:48,000
- And put your hand in mind  
 - Marshal said that his mother and Clint

303
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:50,230
have been watching every night 
 for two weeks.

304
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,686
- Everything is great. 
 - So skilled is the problem?

305
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:55,107
The account has not moved. 
 It has been well for weeks.

306
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:59,488
- No account Hallie-Clint. 
 - Wait.

307
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:03,163
Only ... I think I can solve it for you.

308
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:06,780
 How about just ...

309
00:16:10,823 --> 00:16:13,359
The account will not move until the 
 gods decide that it is true love.

310
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:15,975
 You know that I am not 
 answer for that?

311
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,367
Four l do not understand is the problem.

312
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:20,061
So, Marshall said that 
 the policy ever arose .

313
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:23,196
 You have to know 
 friends and family of the other?

314
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,115
I think not.

315
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:27,903
That may-be. 
 A√ ∫ n remain in the cocoon.

316
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:31,187
To be a partner 
 have to live in the real world.

317
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:44,390
<i> So if I were not in 
 the gym, d√ de shall?

318
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:47,887
Not <i> s√ ©. This gym 
 is a house for me.

319
00:16:49,464 --> 00:16:51,713
Okay, you are right. 
 We got it.

320
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:52,359
- Thanks. 
 - Thanks, James.

321
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:54,399
- Something you need more s, Damelo. 
 - Okay.

322
00:16:55,502 --> 00:16:58,163
- How do you feel loved? 
 - Por n whom, James?

323
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,771
I cut-throat 
 if you look at askance.

324
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:01,155
That is true, white.

325
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,276
He said that he let you stay

326
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:05,955
- When his father came out of imprisonment . 
 - S√  were a couple of weeks.

327
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:08,365
 Are you ready to go! S something for dinner?

328
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:10,743
Yes, we have to Tres Equis passes.

329
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:13,406
 Marshall sent me a message. 
 Leave  geometr√a Hence his book.

330
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:15,838
Is should be concerned if my son 
 passes the time in a bar?

331
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,054
Hello.

332
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:22,818
Hallie! Clint! 
 What can I serve you?

333
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:26,905
In fact we go to find the book 
 mathematical characteristics of my son at the bar,

334
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:30,112
but I guess it is pretty quiet 
 here to do homework, no?

335
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:32,334
They are pretty quiet tonight. 
 Fiesta private.

336
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:34,934
 Are you sure you do not want to drink?

337
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:36,056
No.

338
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,793
s take something for your cumplea√ ± os?

339
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:40,812
Not until my cumplea√ ± os 
 within six weeks.

340
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:42,824
 This is Inca way.

341
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:45,572
What is it?

342
00:17:51,377 --> 00:17:53,694
Sorpresa!

343
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:55,201
God-or more.

344
00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:57,580
These are all people I know,

345
00:17:57,615 --> 00:18:00,022
and some people who do not.

346
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:01,984
 So you do not know my neighbor Phil,

347
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:04,809
my companions ero bedroom 
 the university,

348
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:06,059
or my brothers?

349
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,338
 So what you think? 
 Surprised?

350
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:13,918
Yes, I think our 
 brother tena no reason

351
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:15,496
You are extremely great 
 to be liberal.

352
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:17,181
And if you start to drink coffee soy s

353
00:18:17,216 --> 00:18:20,263
and drive a car that works 
 C√ scara with eggs and garbage,

354
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:21,697
maybe have a problem.

355
00:18:23,943 --> 00:18:27,561
- You seem a very intelligent. 
 - Thanks.

356
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:31,188
- How can you be a Republican? 
 - I think what he means is that

357
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:34,535
people who are educated 
 about certain topics,

358
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,110
others end up being  crater.

359
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:38,859
Tra tion history, the 
 truth. Was  other crater.

360
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:42,189
Then in a car accident, 
 I had a head injury.

361
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:44,558
Since then I've been thinking 
 in a small government

362
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:45,878
and strong military.

363
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:49,510
I was kidding, sign pray. 
 ∫ lpenme Disc.

364
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:52,975
 Can I ask you borrowed for a minute?

365
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,197
Of course.

366
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,906
- This is a disaster. 
 - Okay.

367
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:59,640
Seriously, that is, were you raised  
 in a different home

368
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:01,657
your siblings? 
 How are you so different?

369
00:19:01,692 --> 00:19:04,955
- I am not so different. 
 - The downfall as a compliment.

370
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:07,055
Is Insulting my brothers is a compliment?

371
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,278
Mira, lo siento, s√-?

372
00:19:09,313 --> 00:19:12,343
- I was nervous. 
 - Well, it's part of its charm.

373
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:14,436
- Prego ∫ ntal to their former wives. 
 - But honestly

374
00:19:15,424 --> 00:19:17,324
Is Almost six years after s 
 de "No Mission Accomplished"?

375
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:20,932
How can we continue to believe that 
 Iraq war was good idea?

376
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:21,622
Not s√ ©.

377
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:24,994
Why was a good idea?

378
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:27,305
You know, yes, mistakes were made --

379
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,166
 Really believe that?

380
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,738
I think there are bad people out

381
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:33,226
and have to handle that.

382
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:37,802
 So we need to bombard all 
 those who do things we do not like?

383
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:39,613
Well, you can not reason with a madman.

384
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,866
- You have to take the fight. 
 - True, I forgot ©.

385
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:46,086
Diplomacy, the bulwark of 
 the Western civilization ,

386
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:47,235
nia ± as is.

387
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:53,193
Yes, I'm not sure 
 what is a good idea.

388
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:54,710
Tena-by that was done.

389
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:56,622
We need to remove them from the cocoon.

390
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,064
We're taking 
 the real world to them.

391
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,898
Yes, well, maybe it is 
 too real world.

392
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:11,558
Hallie <i> ? Marshall College 
 l√-nea in 2.

393
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:15,257
Hallie Butler.

394
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,026
What was what?

395
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:22,313
What possessed you to  
 hitting another kid?

396
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:24,669
I get tired of that goal © 
 me all day.

397
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:28,161
- One guy can not get much. 
 - We went through this.

398
00:20:28,196 --> 00:20:30,244
Try to speak to the teacher or flames.

399
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,257
 Talking does not work, and I have to say

400
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:34,517
how Clint was 
 s much more rewarding.

401
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:35,091
Is Clint?

402
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,577
He said that if that kid 
 bothering to safety,

403
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,757
put your ass on the floor. 
 That's what I did.

404
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,834
 Did you tell my son that 
 hit another kid?

405
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:56,077
 Chico? The guy who got  
 Marshal to have beards.

406
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:58,161
Was willing to accept the boxing

407
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:00,929
but attacking another 
 kid is not acceptable.

408
00:21:00,964 --> 00:21:02,747
It was getting into with Marshal.

409
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:04,531
Tena-to learn to defend themselves.

410
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:08,208
- It's not your decision n. I am the mother. 
 - Perhaps you are the mother

411
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:10,114
but never were a boy 15 years.

412
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:14,321
Sorry, but "calling the teacher" no 
 solves this particular problem.

413
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,453
 So you know better than me what is 
 better for Marshall that his mother?

414
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,874
In this case, yes.

415
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:21,120
Violence as a solution n.

416
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:23,864
Qu√ © republican of you.

417
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,309
Perhaps we should act as  other crater

418
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,167
to kill will give milk and cookies,

419
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:30,881
talk about their feelings.

420
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,560
- We have finished. 
 -  You think?

421
00:21:32,594 --> 00:21:34,094
Come on. Ended up here.

422
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:43,777
- Come on, Marshall. 
 - You have to consider another option n.

423
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:45,915
Do Tell Mom that Clint es mi papa?

424
00:21:46,195 --> 00:21:48,196
T√ ∫ I want to be 
 clean breast of the pond!

425
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:50,197
- In the middle of the floor? 
 - Do not you understand?

426
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:55,093
That thing they care 
 s most passionately

427
00:21:55,128 --> 00:21:59,326
that the Polish policy is not the wine, my friend.

428
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,684
Eres t√ ∫.

429
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,260
Marshall! Come on.

430
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,680
Hey.

431
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:17,622
Hi, Marshall.

432
00:22:19,768 --> 00:22:20,458
How was your day-to?

433
00:22:21,935 --> 00:22:23,964
 A little recreation 
 task with popcorn?

434
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:31,488
 The guy has it already?

435
00:22:32,315 --> 00:22:33,587
Only a couple of hours to complete

436
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:35,497
Marat will the war 
 24 hours of silence.

437
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:36,281
 Can you do it?

438
00:22:36,316 --> 00:22:40,532
 Ladies and gentlemen, is a record 
 the boy in the kitchen from hell!

439
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,436
 Two cups?

440
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:53,463
Okay, I understand.

441
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,733
Are you mad at me because s 
 no te dejo box.

442
00:22:57,684 --> 00:23:00,712
You know, maybe you should consider 
 be passive aggressive

443
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,235
instead of hitting a 
 that kid at school.

444
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:05,727
You are very good at it too n.

445
00:23:07,698 --> 00:23:08,487
Marshall, go.

446
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:10,605
Let's talk about this,-s√?

447
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,825
Only you say something.

448
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:18,557
 Anything?

449
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,030
I think Dick Cheney is a bad blow.

450
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:30,224
Mr. Roberts, we have already exceeded that.

451
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:32,748
You're broke. It is not invisible.

452
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:35,023
Now he feels s√ © 
 that people ignore

453
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:36,863

454

Dr. McCrae, his mother are here.

Apparently, owners of bars os 
 giving good advice, it is not true.

Felix told me to pull tena 
 Hallie to Clint and his cocoon.

460
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:01,032
A total disaster. I need your help.

Liv, What happens?

462
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:06,873
- What did Claire 
 - I went to the apartment of my lover.

463
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:09,766
Your apartment is, mamma!, 
 And it's your ex-love --

464
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:11,979
Do not hab√amos agreed 
 to use the term "boyfriend"?

but our love was not dark,

469
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:26,230
- We must move forward. 
 - Why? The guy sounds perfect.

470
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:29,252
- Trevor. 
 - It's a drug addict, Trevor.

471
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:31,523
- Well, OK, that's different. 
 - It's a drug addict,

I am drugs.

473

because you can not take 
 the hands of his muse.

477
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:46,426
That is not going to say,

478
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:48,020
Not at all.

479
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:51,990

Clint <i> is the white knight

689
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,629
I think it hastened a little production,

690
00:36:40,629 --> 00:36:44,360
but I think that is what you can 
 call a "Tribute to Love."

691
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,022
I will look for Hallie.

692
00:36:47,787 --> 00:36:49,151
Your account are paid.

693
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:01,623
Sorry, but where I come from,

694
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:03,734
men do not let the 
 women buy them drinks.

695
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:06,619
 Come the years 50? 
 You look good.

696
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:10,683
Thank you. All my Bible about 
 fighting and carrying weapons

698
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,477
While at my age working long hours

699
00:37:14,477 --> 00:37:16,594
I pay less than a man 
 who does the same job.

700
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:23,033
You're all I ever 
 wanted in a man,

701
00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:25,005

Lo s√ ©, but was in the neighborhood

734

735

Well, How was I?

736
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:21,102
He feels things very deeply.

And it is obvious that n still loves you.

739

But I had not said anything that 
 I would like more t√ ∫ s that you are happy.

740

 You see, Claire?

741
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:38,955
That is love.

742
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,681
Claire is slow, but

743
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:43,114
understands it.

744
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:46,386

745
00:39:47,235 --> 00:39:49,391

Derek wants to be 
 me to drink.

753
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,477
No matter, verdad? 
 We know it today in Whole Foods.

754
00:40:20,106 --> 00:40:22,509
It's like a young Julia Raa ∫ l.

755
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:25,376
In this darkness, 
 you have to feel those eyes

as if you had seen in another life.

757
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,737

this is the truth for her.

762
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,107
In other words, is as well.
