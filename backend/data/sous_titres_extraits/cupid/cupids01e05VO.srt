1
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:14,448
Peaches!

2
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:25,722
And then you wake up.

3
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,758
Yes

4
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,096
I mean ...

5
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,667
At least one was less violent.

6
00:00:34,504 --> 00:00:37,570
I am a coward, Dr. McCrae.

7
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:39,408
You had two tours of service in Iraq

8
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:41,377
and anything that passes,

9
00:00:41,387 --> 00:00:43,912
survivor guilt, pain,
loss, nightmares ...

10
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:45,947
- ... Make you less brave ..
- Valiente.

11
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:48,217
A brave man would have
sent these letters.

12
00:00:48,227 --> 00:00:51,120
I write these letters
was more important than upload.

13
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:55,691
Remember that life had
out of the war.

14
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,530
And now you are free to live that life.

15
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,661
You have to try to move forward.

16
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:06,842
Yes

17
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:18,445
- What are you doing?
- I proceed.

18
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:20,933
You can not fire
symbolic here ..

19
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:42,836
Trevor, you've seen in dogs --

20
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:47,242
What are you doing?

21
00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:49,044
Nothing. Reading.

22
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:52,114
I found these letters
written by ...

23
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,612
this soldier.

24
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,019
You crying?

25
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:59,284
No. I could have ... yawn.

26
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:00,588
In some tissue.

27
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:02,189
You know, some people
sneeze, Felix.

28
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,127
Yes, some people read letters
and cry about dogs

29
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:06,692
his apartment
and listen to soft rock 87.

30
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:09,664
Why a soldier you write letters?

31
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:10,900
Not for me.

32
00:02:11,603 --> 00:02:14,236
Are for this girl he loves,

33
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:16,138
but do not know that love,

34
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:19,774
because they did not realize until
was in the midst of this war.

35
00:02:21,144 --> 00:02:23,444
And the only thing that did remain

36
00:02:24,214 --> 00:02:26,147
are your memories of your loved Peaches.

37
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,019
Do not worry, Joe.

38
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:33,022
Peaches bring you, my friend.

39
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:35,624
We bring you Peaches!

Cupid - S01E05
Shipping Out

44
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,163
So this girl you are
trying to meet the soldier ...

45
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:49,571
"Peaches" is his name
of stripper?

46
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:53,075
It gives him the nickname Joe.
His name is Robin Peachtree.

47
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:55,177
Neighbors were in high school.

48
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:56,912
Playing basketball
in the way of entry.

49
00:02:56,922 --> 00:02:59,647
Because I was crazy about her.
Joe donned value

50
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:01,480
asked Peaches
go to the dance of welcome.

51
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,851
And she said "yes"
and then he discovered

52
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:05,856
it was only a bet
made it popular with kids.

53
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,223
No. She said "yes"

54
00:03:08,793 --> 00:03:11,693
and then the army's father Joe
was sent to New Jersey.

55
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:13,428
They left Baton Rouge two days later.

56
00:03:13,738 --> 00:03:15,963
- Never been to the dance.
- No video image change.

57
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:20,168
No. They lost contact.
Later, Joe was sent to Iraq.

58
00:03:20,203 --> 00:03:21,870
Suddenly, in the midst of war,

59
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,201
bullets pass at full speed.
Guess who they think.

60
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:25,036
Jane Russell.

61
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,544
Betty Grable.

62
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:29,712
- Robin Peachtree.
- Right.

63
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:32,648
This girl has not seen
not spoken in years.

64
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:35,718
When their lives hung by a thread,
That is what you thought.

65
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:38,320
He writes these letters never sent.

66
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,322
Instead ...
you gave yourself.

67
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:44,525
Yeah, well, something.

68
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:47,762
He was pulling
and I recycle.

69
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,095
I do 100 pairs.

70
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:52,367
This, my friend, it will be easy.

71
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:57,272
It is a federal offense to read
mail from another person ...

72
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:58,771
Friend.

73
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,372
As if that applied to me.

74
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,276
"If you drive through Baton Rouge,"

75
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,247
"Be sure to stop at Robin's Nest."

76
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:10,618
"Owner Robin Peachtree, 26 -"
Is the correct age.

77
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:12,986
Why need Cupid arrows
magical when you Google?

78
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:15,557
"Do not miss the donuts
crab stuffing. "

79
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:19,558
Robin's Nest - Cajun Cooking
and catering company.

80
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:22,532
Responsible for the meal.

81
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:29,769
All you need to
draw your attention ...

82
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,038
Lying ...

83
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:34,343
You have to be smart
romance your searches.

84
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,141
If you feel the need to conspire
to the attention of someone,

85
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:38,714
you are exceeding.

86
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:41,982
Exactly. Then there is this dance
where we of chaperones.

87
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:45,418
And I was thinking that my
bet

88
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:50,686
appointment was to take a sexy,
convince her that I demand.

89
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,226
I hear something?

90
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,129
I heard you.
I could not agree less.

91
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:59,231
You, however, Mr --
Like, friendly, countryman.

92
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,670
Trevor, you have a question?

93
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,737
Suggestion? Yes, I,
thanks for asking.

94
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:07,442
Perhaps more group celebrations
singles,

95
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,940
less charlitas self.

96
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,342
This he calls "charlita"
is what this group is, Trevor.

97
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:15,416
Currently, yes.
You listen to talk while

98
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:17,187
browsing room looking
someone to sleep.

99
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,086
People come here for advice,
console,

100
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:23,592
share stories.

101
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:26,692
In bed with someone who knew
in the group of singles.

102
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:27,696
That is not true.

103
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:30,763
People come here because
've gathered conveniently

104
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:34,035
a collection of available
premises within a group.

105
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:36,102
That is why they are here, right?

106
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:40,839
Correct. So I propose a party.

107
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:42,276
- I care?
- No. Go ahead.

108
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:45,046
All in favor of one party,
contribute some cash.

109
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:48,681
So if I'm reading
this correctly,

110
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:50,618
this is something that the group would enjoy?

111
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:54,622
You know what?
Maybe it's time

112
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:56,991
to bring our new
skills to the field.

113
00:05:58,294 --> 00:05:59,561
Bring biscuits.

114
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:02,065
You are not allowed to plan.
You just have to go.

115
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,340
A little problem with the party.

116
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,878
- A little problem with my assistant. Josie?
- You may be in the bathroom.

117
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:19,981
So expect to be taken
a break to go to the bathroom

118
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:20,749
could enter and shoving here?

119
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,950
E interrupt your important
salad to go? Yes

120
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,254
Now about the party --

121
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:27,355
I thought you were supposed to not
I worry for the party.

122
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,053
You do not have to worry about.
You just have to donate ... a little

123
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:31,989
- To the supplier. We are short.
- How short?

124
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,458
- A plane ticket.
- What?

125
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:36,296
The provider lives in Baton Rouge,
but I found a cheap flight.

126
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,500
I think we ended up here.

127
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,599
What? No, come on. Mira, mira,
just listen to me, okay?

128
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:42,938
Look, even with the airfare,

129
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:45,674
it is still cheaper to use
a provider of Baton Rouge

130
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:48,277
- ... One of New York.
- I wanted to serve the cakes.

131
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:50,847
- The biscuits are not the issue.
- There is an issue now?

132
00:06:50,857 --> 00:06:51,417
Of course there is an issue.

133
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:54,518
Josie, the next time Trevor is
here, there's no rest for the bathroom.

134
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:58,386
- Mardi Gras!
- Excuse me?

135
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:01,356
That is the issue. So clearly,
Cajun need a supplier,

136
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:04,323
and I know a great --
great girl, great smile

137
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:06,225
great donuts
crab stuffing.

138
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:07,929
You know this woman?

139
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:09,865
I know, and
great demand.

140
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:12,600
Look, it would be a feast of
Mardi Gras properly without it.

141
00:07:14,304 --> 00:07:17,271
Okay. Cover the cost
to bring the supplier.

142
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,471
Excellent. This is unbelievable.
You will not regret.

143
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:24,311
- There are suppliers in New York.
- I know, but I believe this provider

144
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,182
may be the key to
actual identity of Trevor.

145
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:28,998
It is the first person
mention of her past

146
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:30,354
which is not a Greek deity.

147
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:37,509
<i> - In two nights.
- That's right. </ I></i>

148
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:39,679
And I read about your buñuelos
crab stuffing

149
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:41,312
in the Dining Guide Map ".

150
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:45,515
I would love to help you with your party
Mardi Gras in New York, Mr. Pierce,

151
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:51,588
but I hired Brad Pitt
pelarle for a grape

152
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:54,123
on a rocket to
Mars that day.

153
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,190
<i> J.T., I know you. </ i></i>

154
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,390
One question,

155
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:01,296
when one type of service
deliveries appear in your business

156
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:03,466
<i> with a passenger ...
you will rise to that plane </ i></i>

157
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:16,846
I have been in the
City 20 minutes,

158
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:19,352
and you saw two types
holding hands

159
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:20,853
and the restaurant of "Seinfeld."

160
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:24,556
Well ... Yes, go to the matinee of
"My I", and have

161
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:26,289
your bingo board of
City of New York full.

162
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:27,160
What is this place?

163
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:30,662
This is where the party is.

164
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:36,364
I was hired to cook for a
party at a house in pornography.

165
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:38,836
What happens to you
those in blue states?

166
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:42,439
No, no, no. It was a pornographic film,
but it became a bar.

167
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,119
Here.

168
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:51,514
I took the liberty of
Sign in to your room.

169
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:54,147
I live in Louisiana ...

170
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:55,909
not in a cave.

171
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:58,021
I can see it
is an apartment.

172
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:00,826
For the rest of the world ...

173
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:04,709
but for you, this is a hotel
with all services.

174
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:06,998
See? Have your mentitas,

175
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:09,659
clean towels,
fresh flowers.

176
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,854
- This is Felix, the concierge.
- I'm not a janitor.

177
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:17,973
- Try to get your sex slave?
- Let's see where the day takes us.

178
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:19,448
Because all of my dress
Good kitchen knives,

179
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:23,006
- ... And my key ring is a whistle.
- I promise I'll be safe here.

180
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:24,351
Ago in New York
always so cold?

181
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:26,364
We have hot and muggy
if you stay a while.

182
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:27,830
Okay, who is
ready to cook?

183
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,788
I need a bowl
of jambalaya ...

184
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:31,603
- To carry.
- Sale in moments.

185
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:42,586
I do not know if that is okay
come here for lunch.

186
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:45,870
A person should eat
in an atmosphere of calm and familiar,

187
00:09:45,974 --> 00:09:47,290
surrounded by beauty.

188
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,947
Is that ...

189
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:01,790
jambalaya?

190
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,500
Well, yes it is.
Like the jambalaya?

191
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,286
I lived in Louisiana
for a couple of years,

192
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,100
so, well ... yes.

193
00:10:10,497 --> 00:10:12,450
God. That smells like
if true.

194
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:16,370
You have to try. In fact,
I think I have an extra spoon.

195
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:24,380
Man.

196
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,105
Damn.
That's good.

197
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,100
Have any idea how hard it is ...

198
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,780
find good food
Cajun in this city?

199
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:35,544
Sorry,
but today is the day

200
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:37,489
to steal a guy
a bowl of jambalaya.

201
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:40,599
You do not have to steal.
I know where you can get more.

202
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,369
You know what this is?

203
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,669
It is a hurricane with
your name on it.

204
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:10,179
- How much money was in that hat?
- Enough.

205
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:12,331
Cajun crab sandwiches?
Are excellent.

206
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:17,762
I am anxious to know
the cook, for which I paid.

207
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:20,066
- Where is the kitchen?
- Going through those doors.

208
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:24,192
So ... can cover
my turn on Friday?

209
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:25,402
I have tickets for Madonna.

210
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:29,340
- Perhaps, rabbit, maybe.
- I really want to see it, Trevor,

211
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:30,836
and I have already asked
all others.

212
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:34,579
Or you cover me, or an invention
Health code violation

213
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:35,412
and I closed the place.

214
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:37,815
I think perhaps we can
negotiate a deal.

215
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:39,116
Yes!

216
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:43,918
I am so happy that you have
snacks like crab.

217
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,222
That is, it's fun
cooking for people

218
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,106
who do not eat this kind of
food every day.

219
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:50,339
I am so happy that
Trevor has contacted me.

220
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:53,332
Yeah, about that --
When they met, and you Trevor?

221
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,671
This morning at the airport.

222
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:58,097
- No, no, I mean originally.
- This was the first time I saw him,

223
00:11:58,157 --> 00:12:00,051
but it looks really nice.

224
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,752
You mean you do not know before?

225
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:06,276
Perhaps your family know
his family y. ..

226
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,346
Not that I know.
No, but it has been incredible.

227
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:12,348
Now, I'm sorry. I just --
I have to concentrate.

228
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,376
This shrimp etouffee
does not beat himself.

229
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,623
Trevor.

230
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:22,693
Why choose Robin
to cook --

231
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:25,051
Watch this.

232
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:27,066
What am I looking at?

233
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,587
The human condition.

234
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:31,888
Yes, of course,
the human condition --

235
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,484
There is, in all its glory.

236
00:12:33,644 --> 00:12:36,107
Sabes? It is a fact

237
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:39,303
that the way you dance
is the way that you love.

238
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,737
Is that true?

239
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:42,915
Maybe you're a Jerry Lewis, you know?

240
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,784
As one of those guys who
move around.

241
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:47,851
Or maybe you're the dealer, you know?

242
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:49,488
Like when you're dealing,
spreading.

243
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:51,256
Sabes? Or maybe you're
Space Ghost.

244
00:12:51,757 --> 00:12:53,691
And then there's the punishment.

245
00:12:55,394 --> 00:12:58,494
- I do not dance, so ...
- My theory is confirmed.

246
00:12:58,564 --> 00:13:02,264
- Quick Jump ... only.
- Why?

247
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,967
Because I am part of
percentage unfortunate

248
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,969
of the population seems
an idiot when dancing fast.

249
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,205
What makes you think
you can not dance?

250
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,443
I thought it was a
adequate dancer

251
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:15,043
until I saw the video
my first year dancing.

252
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:17,155
My first and last high school dance.

253
00:13:17,156 --> 00:13:20,356
Wait a minute. Do not go
to a dance after that?

254
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:25,118
Girls are so sensitive to the fact
of being teased and ridiculed.

255
00:13:25,126 --> 00:13:28,093
The key to dancing is getting caught.

256
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,094
Sabes? Out of your head.

257
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:31,128
That is what I have.

258
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:35,064
So tell me why
Robin knew that?

259
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:37,131
Dr. McCrae.

260
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:39,103
Joe ...

261
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,006
What are you doing here?

262
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:44,573
Trevor invited me.

263
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,678
Of course he did.

264
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,879
It turns out that we are both large
Fans of Cajun food.

265
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:51,713
Sorry. I knew it was not a party
group for singles.

266
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,981
Although I met Trevor
in his office,

267
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:55,919
so I guess that
That makes sense.

268
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:58,889
What is it?
Because I'm still confused.

269
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:01,326
Things should be clarified
at any time.

270
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:03,692
Someone wants lobster pie?

271
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:08,803
Peaches!

272
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:14,538
Joe.

273
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,425
This ... Peaches is.

274
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:22,063
Our cook is Peaches.

275
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:23,431
No, not anymore.

276
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:28,501
Joe was the only person
I called so.

277
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:31,036
We went to high school together.

278
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:32,505
We have not
seen in years.

279
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:34,006
It's like a strange coincidence.

280
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:35,909
Is that ... coincidence?

281
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:38,845
Well, I might be somewhat responsible.

282
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:43,051
I heard that Robin is a
great chef of Cajun food,

283
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:45,053
and I learned that Joe loves
Cajun food, you know what?

284
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:47,353
Who cares how it happened?
Is the destination.

285
00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:50,357
Maybe I should use
discuss this in the alley.

286
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:54,894
If you and I are going to be fighting
you better remove the earrings.

287
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:59,419
I do not know how to fix this,

288
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:02,622
- But you're playing with fire.
- Love is fire, love is passion.

289
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:05,224
It's so game.
It's in the description of my work.

290
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:07,628
Well, the description of my work
is trying to help my patients,

291
00:15:08,397 --> 00:15:10,199
and prevent it from hurting
themselves or others.

292
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:12,968
And you're bringing together Robin and Joe
to have a world of pain.

293
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:14,878
This relationship is doomed.

294
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,470
Are you sure you're not Greek?
Because you are too dramatic.

295
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:20,641
You are not a god.
You are not omniscient.

296
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:24,708
Joe stole the record or
spy my sessions with him.

297
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:26,913
Or something, and whatever you
did was something terrible,

298
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:29,082
because he is unable --

299
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:33,519
Not in a position to start
anything now.

300
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:37,957
And he and Robin and I will pay
to pick up the pieces.

301
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:53,143
Yes I did something terrible.

302
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:02,064
I can not do this.

303
00:16:04,054 --> 00:16:04,887
I can not do this.

304
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:10,284
I think now you get regodearte

305
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:14,348
You know what?
Robin, do not worry.

306
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:15,444
I will fix this.

307
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:16,947
- No.
- Let him go.

308
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:19,786
It is the opposite of a superhero.

309
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:22,222
Is rare.

310
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:23,624
In all my ...

311
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,326
fantasies of "See Joe Adams again."

312
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,605
The kiss was exactly true.

313
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:34,442
You really should go
to change my shirt.

314
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:35,902
I do not want to walk around the festival

315
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:38,051
appears that a baby
vomited on me.

316
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:44,443
Joe!
Where are you going?

317
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:46,947
Hey, come on!
This is your golden opportunity!

318
00:16:47,116 --> 00:16:48,949
The girl for which he sighs,
the girl to write to him

319
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,053
when you were in Iraq.

320
00:16:52,785 --> 00:16:54,418
Dr. McCrae spoke to you about that?

321
00:16:56,326 --> 00:17:00,137
Because that is unprofessional.

322
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,528
Look, the truth is ...

323
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:05,832
was in the waiting room
dropped when the cards

324
00:17:05,968 --> 00:17:07,834
and then, you know,
I took the loan.

325
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:12,469
Find Peaches
and organized this meeting,

326
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:14,141
so the two could be again.

327
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:15,788
I did.

328
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,470
Are you crazy?

329
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:21,913
Not at all.
I am colorful.

330
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:24,214
Get letters from the trash

331
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:27,352
half wet, half-burnt,
and read it.

332
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:29,021
That is not crazy?

333
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:30,255
Of eccentric, maybe.

334
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,392
Look, I loved those letters,

335
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:33,926
and I really think that Peaches
Also you will love.

336
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:35,125
Stop calling it "Peaches."

337
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:39,499
Not have given him the cards, or not?

338
00:17:39,535 --> 00:17:41,268
No. Never ...

339
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,466
But ...

340
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:45,272
But what?
Did your other personality?

341
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:47,040
It could have been left in her bed.

342
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,142
Thinking that you and Peach --

343
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:52,512
I mean Robin could be on that
bed tonight.

344
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:55,115
And that might be the perfect ending,
perfect for a night.

345
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:58,280
Robin can not see those letters.

346
00:17:58,715 --> 00:18:00,615
I think that a harasser crazy.

347
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:02,088
It is bad enough
The Hague kissed it!

348
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:03,957
Hey, no, look, I saw the kiss.

349
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:06,325
There was nothing wrong with him.

350
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:08,325
The problem was to go out shooting.

351
00:18:09,072 --> 00:18:10,672
I wanted to stay.

352
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:12,608
Let's go back, okay?

353
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,511
We can tell Robin
to go out running

354
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:15,585
to put money in the parking meter.

355
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:17,172
I could sell it.

356
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:21,006
- What I say, your seat.
- I can go back to Peaches.

357
00:18:21,277 --> 00:18:23,177
- Why not?
- It's complicated, okay?

358
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:26,261
Life is complicated.
Love is simple.

359
00:18:26,598 --> 00:18:30,464
He had a plan, okay?
And this was not in the plan.

360
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:38,818
I want those cards!

361
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:42,395
Come on.

362
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:47,100
That's what crazy love.

363
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:51,387
Even where it is impractical,
even when it's drawbacks --

364
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,507
Not be assumed that saw these.

365
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,208
I am very happy to have.

366
00:19:18,814 --> 00:19:20,681
Yes, yes, yes.
Coming.

367
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:24,947
Hello?

368
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:26,653
Trevor, you know where is Joe?

369
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:29,587
Claire Bear!
Good morning.

370
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,892
- Joe Adams. What are you?
- Happy to report that ...

371
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,257
Joe and Robin are
currently closed.

372
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:39,765
- Joe missed his meeting today.
- Anything that afflicts Joe,

373
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:42,070
I predict that the moment my plan
is fully implemented,

374
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:43,395
he will be cured.

375
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:45,601
You are greatly out of your element.

376
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:47,473
<i> I can say that I
talk, please </ i></i>

377
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:51,277
I will. In fact, I'm desperate
by a change of underwear.

378
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:52,960
<i> So anyway, I
venture there. </ i></i>

379
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:55,462
Promise me that this is the last time
I get a report

380
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:56,582
about your underwear.

381
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,664
Again.

382
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:02,932
Show me what you got, buddy.

383
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:06,355
Come to the left ...

384
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:08,260
Right y. .. No! Come on.
I did it again!

385
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,597
God! How was the whole day.
Come on.

386
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:12,484
Do it again, I want to see
you do it again.

387
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:12,489
<i> want it? I want </ i></i>

388
00:20:12,524 --> 00:20:13,775
<i> Tell me what you want.
Tell me what you want </ i></i>

389
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:17,272
- Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Come on.
- Down here. Below.

390
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:19,517
<i> What? Why not come
and try to do </ i></i>

391
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540
<i>Give me  Vamos! Give it to me </ i></i>

392
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,180
<i> No, I will give you, if you want it
have to ganártelo. </ i></i>

393
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:24,210
- I want you to win it.
- Okay, cúbranse, guys.

394
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:25,886
I gotta go.
I need supplies.

395
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:30,550
Well, here I come.
Three, two, one.

396
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:34,668
I am opening the door.
I do not pay attention.

397
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:35,636
Remain in their field.

398
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:39,972
Trevor?
You can open your eyes.

399
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,647
They are dressed ...

400
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:49,836
And out of bed.

401
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:52,171
And slept on the floor.

402
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:56,606
You know, it was agreed that
I use my bed, maybe I was not clear.

403
00:20:56,684 --> 00:20:58,710
- I slept in bed.
- Me on the floor.

404
00:20:58,927 --> 00:20:59,760
You do not ...

405
00:21:01,214 --> 00:21:03,481
We must refamiliarizarnos,

406
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:06,415
I mean, we have not had
yet a real quote.

407
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,220
Southerners.

408
00:21:08,322 --> 00:21:10,655
Well, OK,
refamiliarícense you.

409
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:14,227
I have something in mind for the real event.

410
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:29,256
<i>Do not forget  # # </ i></i>

411
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:34,778
<i> 'Cause you left a great impression # </ i></i>

412
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:36,548
<i>In my heart  # # </ i></i>

413
00:21:36,926 --> 00:21:40,660
<i>I equivocaré  # # </ i></i>

414
00:21:40,664 --> 00:21:42,332
I used to go here all the time.

415
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:44,440
This is my cousin
and this is my aunt,

416
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:46,527
- And this is, remember?
- Right, yes.

417
00:21:48,343 --> 00:21:50,209
<i>Singing this  # # </ i></i>

418
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:53,291
<i>This  # # song for you now </ i></i>

419
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,693
<i> # # You can not be close </ i></i>

420
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,332
<i>Never forget  # # </ i></i>

421
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:04,096
<i> # # I will never forget </ i></i>

422
00:22:05,097 --> 00:22:06,597
Joe, what happens?

423
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:19,786
Peaches!

424
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:22,019
Yes, Joe?

425
00:22:22,986 --> 00:22:25,886
Please can you check in my bag,
and see if I have an extra shirt?

426
00:22:47,683 --> 00:22:49,783
Robin! Wait, I can explain.

427
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:51,085
No need to explain.

428
00:22:51,695 --> 00:22:54,353
Book a flight
to Winnipeg tomorrow,

429
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:56,856
and had no thought
some reason ..

430
00:22:56,858 --> 00:22:58,458
by which might be
mention it?

431
00:22:58,603 --> 00:23:00,870
I thought this could be something.

432
00:23:00,937 --> 00:23:04,604
I realized that not only
was your weekend. Taxi!

433
00:23:04,614 --> 00:23:05,898
I could not tell, okay?

434
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,400
I did not want to think
he was a coward.

435
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:11,432
- Only ... I can not return.
- Go where?

436
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:14,540
Iraq.

437
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:18,340
Called me.

438
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:21,649
I was supposed to report tomorrow.

439
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:24,951
You are deserting?

440
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:29,653
This moment, now ...

441
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:33,223
That's why I could not tell you.

442
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:36,798
Could not bear to see your reaction.

443
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:40,904
You gonna cold.

444
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:52,782
This war has ruined me.

445
00:23:57,385 --> 00:23:58,385
I close my eyes ...

446
00:24:00,053 --> 00:24:00,686
And I'm back there.

447
00:24:01,122 --> 00:24:03,455
Driving after a suicide bomb.

448
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,459
It blew itself to
a crowded market.

449
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:09,395
I am looking without aid

450
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:13,734
while a wounded colleague
calling his wife.

451
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,432
I can not do it again.
I can not go back --

452
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:18,635
Do not you owe me an explanation.

453
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:21,408
I read your letters.

454
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,246
Children?

455
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:29,248
I do not know how they do in Cajun country,

456
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:32,251
but here in the big city, we require
shoes and shirt.

457
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:37,260
What?

458
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,228
<i> - is having lunch now.
- She does not care. </ I></i>

459
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:45,463
Why not tell me that Joe
was fleeing the country?

460
00:24:45,498 --> 00:24:47,998
Because there is this thing called
Doctor-patient privilege.

461
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,903
- Sorry, Dr. McCrae.
- There was not much you could do.

462
00:24:49,913 --> 00:24:51,306
Just give me a minute
with Trevor, please.

463
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:54,672
While we
the issue of disclosure.

464
00:24:54,777 --> 00:24:57,177
Why does not mention that
I was flying ...

465
00:24:57,187 --> 00:25:00,346
the high school girlfriend of Joe
well you could play God?

466
00:25:00,347 --> 00:25:01,747
I am a God, okay?

467
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:04,516
If I ever know
I'm doing something divine,

468
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:05,982
never finish anything.

469
00:25:05,992 --> 00:25:07,918
"Hi Claire, yes, I'm brushing
teeth. "

470
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:09,787
"Hi Claire, yes, I
making toast. "

471
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:11,588
"Claire: Yes, I am arranging a flight."

472
00:25:11,598 --> 00:25:11,827
See what I mean?

473
00:25:11,828 --> 00:25:14,628
I tried to make it perfectly clear
that the relationship was doomed.

474
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,465
You had to open the Pandora's box.

475
00:25:17,797 --> 00:25:20,831
And please, do not tell me that
Pandora had a great rack.

476
00:25:21,035 --> 00:25:23,402
I still have.
God! I was so close.

477
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:26,606
I was going to close the deal in
the couple tonight.

478
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:29,842
- I had planned this great event.
- I see.

479
00:25:30,511 --> 00:25:33,711
You are the victim here.
No Joe, no Robin ... You.

480
00:25:33,882 --> 00:25:35,115
I quit my room.

481
00:25:36,382 --> 00:25:37,415
What was the big date?

482
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:40,882
Would welcome them with dancing
never had.

483
00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:42,389
Look at you.

484
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,893
Mercenary, but sweet.

485
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,562
I think they need this appointment.

486
00:25:50,072 --> 00:25:52,304
And frankly, it could
provide some closure

487
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:53,800
so they do not have to
spend another ten years

488
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,202
wondering, "what if?"

489
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:58,606
I do not get credit for closing.
Get it for love.

490
00:25:58,675 --> 00:26:01,442
Well, maybe you just this once,
are not in your account.

491
00:26:02,652 --> 00:26:04,609
Perhaps this is something nice

492
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,309
for two people whose relationship
never had a chance.

493
00:26:08,214 --> 00:26:09,647
Think this is a good idea?

494
00:26:09,914 --> 00:26:12,747
Yes, I think it will be very beneficial.

495
00:26:12,757 --> 00:26:15,220
- This makes it easier.
- What's easier?

496
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:16,387
We need to borrow your car.

497
00:26:20,861 --> 00:26:23,694
Yes, the flight tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

498
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:25,832
to Baton Rouge,
leaving from Newark.

499
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:28,233
Thank you very much.

500
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,736
Well, at least I will see you soon
before I go to Canada.

501
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:34,705
Yes

502
00:26:36,777 --> 00:26:39,144
I would like you to come with me.

503
00:26:39,982 --> 00:26:43,082
You know, the party's annual sloshball
of Peachtree

504
00:26:43,182 --> 00:26:44,316
is the next weekend.

505
00:26:44,412 --> 00:26:45,645
We could use a bell.

506
00:26:45,753 --> 00:26:46,986
Sloshball?

507
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:50,723
Softball, but ...
Uncle Ronnie puts barrels

508
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:54,026
at first base and third as well.

509
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:56,596
For the fourth entry,
Dad is a three layer

510
00:26:56,665 --> 00:27:00,198
and cry about how the South
will rise again.

511
00:27:01,535 --> 00:27:05,102
And Mom and Aunt Sue despise
the cake from the other.

512
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,170
Es .. only anarchy.

513
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:09,141
Okay.

514
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:11,110
Get hats, kids.

515
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,813
Let's experiment
a rite of passage.

516
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:16,283
Here is your bouquet.

517
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:29,683
Okay, Mommy, when we pick,
no pair in front, we are ashamed,

518
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:31,989
- Recógenos behind.
- I saw the dress?

519
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:35,324
I can not believe they finally come
Welcome to our dance.

520
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:48,366
Hi, I'm Tracy, I am with
welcoming committee.

521
00:27:48,438 --> 00:27:50,005
I can see their IDs
student?

522
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:52,745
Perhaps in the left
your time machine.

523
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:55,945
Tracy, okay, okay.
These are my guests.

524
00:27:58,915 --> 00:28:01,315
It's very generous of you, Carl.

525
00:28:01,986 --> 00:28:03,053
Barely.

526
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:05,625
Thank you.

527
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:08,893
Sweet. Down.

528
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:10,193
Yes

529
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:12,894
<i> You owe me one. </ i></i>

530
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,033
Is that one of the waitresses in the bar?

531
00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:19,902
That would be Lita,
the sexy assistant.

532
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:22,939
And look. Here is our brand.

533
00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:27,041
See how our fully evaluated
soft history teacher.

534
00:28:27,076 --> 00:28:28,143
You're amazing.

535
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:30,448
You had to try
a couple tonight, no?

536
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,850
Just trying.
Notes, no hands.

537
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:35,848
You know, Carl has been coming
my group for years.

538
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:39,585
Incubated these confabulations
produced outside of bypassing,

539
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,360
because it can not simply walk
toward a woman and invite them to leave.

540
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,196
I will have to happen tonight.
Just preparing the bomb.

541
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:48,398
Man, maybe I should spend more
time in the secondary.

542
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:51,235
You see, you missed all these
secondary social

543
00:28:51,245 --> 00:28:52,535
because you were concerned about the dance.

544
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,573
Could have been
kissing all the time.

545
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:56,074
You know how to do that, no?

546
00:28:56,784 --> 00:29:00,178
<i> Okay, bring the whole
the world to the dance floor </ i>.</i>

547
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:02,744
<i>Only  Scroll down a bit.
Here it is, is perfect. </ I></i>

548
00:29:02,754 --> 00:29:04,514
<i> Great smile, nice. </ i></i>

549
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:06,648
<i> One more, one more. </ i></i>

550
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:08,249
- Maybe we should take a picture.
- No.

551
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:09,350
Come with me.

552
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,257
"Corazon intrepid?

553
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:17,255
It is a country song.

554
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:18,294
Yes it is.

555
00:29:18,504 --> 00:29:20,993
We believe it is a public
who likes the country?

556
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:22,899
Daloa back.

557
00:29:23,702 --> 00:29:24,702
<i>I left excited  # # </ i></i>

558
00:29:26,236 --> 00:29:27,436
Correct me.

559
00:29:27,573 --> 00:29:29,706
It is the study of "Hee Haw."
We're going to love.

560
00:29:32,043 --> 00:29:33,576
"Corazon intrepid"
Really?

561
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,713
Think is the best option?

562
00:29:34,723 --> 00:29:36,714
That is not the relationship is doomed

563
00:29:36,724 --> 00:29:39,550
because Joe is afraid of
return to Iraq?

564
00:29:40,286 --> 00:29:41,686
So, I do not know.
If I choose a song,

565
00:29:41,723 --> 00:29:44,156
perhaps choose something that
not emphasize the fact

566
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,153
that Joe is going to desert.

567
00:29:45,226 --> 00:29:46,926
Joe told me he likes this song.

568
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:52,094
And indeed, received the Cross of
distinguished service, you know?

569
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,897
It is an incredibly brave man.

570
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,600
I sent him because he could not
leave behind what she had seen.

571
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:01,107
Is anguished, but not a coward.

572
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,142
And I sent it to me,

573
00:30:03,152 --> 00:30:05,311
- And then do not listen to my recommendation.
- But still --

574
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:07,546
Well, there are all kinds of courage, Trevor.

575
00:30:08,456 --> 00:30:11,082
With what Joe saw there, I think

576
00:30:11,092 --> 00:30:13,318
to get up every morning
and face the day

577
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:14,086
is an act of courage.

578
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:18,089
And is this other guy, I think,
experienced a tragedy

579
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:20,759
in its past, and can not handle it.

580
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:24,662
Choose fend inventing
a fictional character.

581
00:30:24,795 --> 00:30:27,595
and hide under a false reality.

582
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,100
What? You mean that pretends

583
00:30:29,135 --> 00:30:32,935
be Captain America or --
Wait. I see.

584
00:30:32,945 --> 00:30:35,936
- You speak to me.
- Nothing's wrong, right?

585
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:38,207
You know. It's funny.

586
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,410
Is calling me a chicken
woman who will not dance

587
00:30:41,513 --> 00:30:43,546
because they laughed at it 15 years ago.

588
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,130
Listen. Yes!

589
00:32:31,752 --> 00:32:31,885
Hello.

590
00:32:34,056 --> 00:32:35,256
Guys, have seen Claire?

591
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:36,226
Is there.

592
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,194
<i> Ladies and Gentlemen,
we're ready to start </ i></i>

593
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,997
<i> boarding the flight ...</ i></i>

594
00:34:20,968 --> 00:34:22,034
It is the first of many.

595
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:27,709
Not be open until
on the plane, okay?

596
00:34:34,249 --> 00:34:34,949
Come here.

597
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:52,392
Wait.

598
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:54,429
No. Wait.

599
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:56,529
- Do not close the doors!
- Miss.

600
00:34:56,539 --> 00:34:58,997
- Please do not close the door!
- Excuse me, lady!

601
00:35:07,445 --> 00:35:08,445
Trevor.

602
00:35:08,846 --> 00:35:10,146
Trevor, are you there?

603
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:11,147
You awake?

604
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:16,481
Joe will provide the service.
Will not go to Canada.

605
00:35:16,985 --> 00:35:19,152
Will go to Iraq.
I can not stop doing that.

606
00:35:19,362 --> 00:35:22,554
Not for me. If something comes to pass,
I could not forgive.

607
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,554
We have to find it.
Come on. Come on!

608
00:35:25,564 --> 00:35:29,762
- Go to where?
- I do not know. But I have to talk to him.

609
00:35:29,898 --> 00:35:31,831
Okay, let me think.

610
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:36,997
Perhaps there is something about where
Joe should report to your file.

611
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:38,937
We go to the office of Claire.

612
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:42,050
- Work on a Sunday?
- No, well we have luck.

613
00:35:55,752 --> 00:35:57,218
May I ask what
are you doing here?

614
00:35:57,621 --> 00:35:59,121
Thank you for coming so fast.

615
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:00,726
I called when I saw in this disaster.

616
00:36:00,736 --> 00:36:02,861
So, it seems that someone in here

617
00:36:02,896 --> 00:36:04,762
and reviewed all the files,
which makes me very badly,

618
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:07,066
because, you know,
I am a patient of Dr. McCrae.

619
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:08,669
So, I am enough
paranoid itself.

620
00:36:09,479 --> 00:36:12,602
- I am going to shoot, right?
- I found the file!

621
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:15,072
Your file. Joe, here is your.

622
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:16,544
Thank you.

623
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:18,843
I was in the administration
and they called me --

624
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,416
Well, well, well.

625
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:26,918
This man claims to be his patient?

626
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:29,155
This man, in fact it is my patient,

627
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,454
and this is my wife ...

628
00:36:31,392 --> 00:36:32,159
in charge of catering.

629
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:35,863
I got it from here.
Thank you.

630
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:40,402
- Can explain.
- I do not want to hear.

631
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:43,804
- Joe will return to Iraq.
- But is not ready.

632
00:36:43,814 --> 00:36:44,997
So I stopped.

633
00:36:45,298 --> 00:36:47,175
There is something here that
where reports say?

634
00:36:47,185 --> 00:36:50,177
No, nothing, Trevor.
It's just saying that paper,

635
00:36:50,181 --> 00:36:53,148
in my professional opinion,
Joe is ready to go to Iraq.

636
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:56,983
Something that his commander
you disagree.

637
00:36:59,621 --> 00:37:01,588
So I know their commander.

638
00:37:02,325 --> 00:37:04,625
I do not like, but I know him.

639
00:37:06,096 --> 00:37:07,530
Get the
information on the road.

640
00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:15,169
Joe Adams?
Meet Joe Adams? No?

641
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:18,605
Sorry.
Dude, Where's Joe?

642
00:37:18,715 --> 00:37:21,639
- Joe Adams. Joe Adams.
- It's in your company?

643
00:37:22,149 --> 00:37:24,574
- Joe Adams. Meet Joe Adams?
- No.

644
00:37:24,584 --> 00:37:28,011
- Someone who is in charge?
- Know who Joe Adams?

645
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:29,882
Someone has seen Joe Adams?

646
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,280
Joe Adams.
It's in your company?

647
00:37:34,923 --> 00:37:37,656
Have any idea where is Joe Adams?

648
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:40,428
Joe!

649
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:43,965
Peaches?

650
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:47,199
Are you supposed to be on the plane.

651
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:49,037
Are you supposed to be
en route to Winnipeg.

652
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:52,072
Okay, look, there's still time.
You can not do this.

653
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:54,842
Not for me. That is,
We had two nights together,

654
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:56,931
you can not do this type
decision based on that.

655
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,942
Look, I managed to hide all
my no attractive qualities.

656
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:02,383
That is, collect figurines of children.

657
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:06,120
Tejo costume for my dog.
I ...

658
00:38:05,122 --> 00:38:10,355
I have seen "High School Musical"
as 30 times.

659
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,793
I plan to see it 30 more times.

660
00:38:12,963 --> 00:38:15,129
I'm going to Iraq,
because if I do,

661
00:38:15,131 --> 00:38:17,931
means that perhaps
can return some day

662
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,800
and learn more about the nightmare you are.

663
00:38:21,803 --> 00:38:25,169
And if not I can never do that.

664
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:27,240
May need a
Southern restaurant in Winnipeg.

665
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:28,842
Come on. You hate the cold.

666
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:32,212
Perhaps I am accustomed.

667
00:38:32,322 --> 00:38:34,848
This large family you love so much?

668
00:38:35,717 --> 00:38:37,250
I could not ask that the leave,

669
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,486
and you did not want.

670
00:38:40,022 --> 00:38:41,722
I want to do these 12 months.

671
00:38:43,158 --> 00:38:45,592
And get off my head, and for the first time

672
00:38:45,662 --> 00:38:47,395
feel that there is some
place to go home.

673
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:50,870
I want to go to church with your mom.

674
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,466
I sit in the
swing entry y. ..

675
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,597
and let the past go
and begin to live the present.

676
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,273
It appears your big closed the deal.

677
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,613
Going to war for me.

678
00:39:06,623 --> 00:39:08,677
Going to war for love.

679
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:09,847
As I said.

680
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:20,026
<i> # I can not promise that
this will work fine # </ i></i>

681
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:26,698
<i>"But  kill me, dear,
if we had not tried # </ i></i>

682
00:39:26,935 --> 00:39:30,068
<i> # # I got a fearless heart </ i></i>

683
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:34,873
<i>#  strong enough to
go through the part that frightens # </ i></i>

684
00:39:36,144 --> 00:39:38,944
<i>#  has been broken many times before # </ i></i>

685
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,550
<i> # A fearless heart
just back for more # </ i></i>
