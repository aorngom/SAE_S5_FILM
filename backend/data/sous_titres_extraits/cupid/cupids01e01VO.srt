1
00:00:11,154 --> 00:00:13,065
Now you're confident
this will impress her...

2
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,964
Not drive her
into witness protection?

3
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,901
Grand gestures, Dave.
Makes them weak in the knees.

4
00:00:18,294 --> 00:00:20,478
- Are you ready?
- Last couple.

5
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:22,817
Heads up!
It's almost showtime.

6
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:29,111
- This is gonna blow Holly's mind.
- On that, we can agree.

7
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,498


8
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:45,252
Happy new year!

9
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,543
<i>"Holly, I'm here."</i>

10
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:54,917
<i>Well, it looks like someone has pulled
quite a prank tonight.</i>

11
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,260
<i>Wherever you are, whoever you are,</i>

12
00:00:58,465 --> 00:01:01,227
<i>I hope you're impressed.
Someone is looking for you.</i>

13
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:03,609
You better run, girlfriend.

14
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:09,344
We should get going.
I'm sure the cops are on their way over.

15
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:10,496
That's awesome.

16
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:12,692
- We need you to get caught.
- Come again?

17
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:15,766
You get arrested.
Then you get interviewed.

18
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:19,190
You tell the reporter your story.
You can't buy that kind of publicity.

19
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:21,729
Dude, I'm here on an expired visa.

20
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,962
They'll send me straight back
to Ireland. My story won't matter.

21
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:26,543
I wish you'd mentioned that.

22
00:01:26,942 --> 00:01:29,130
I wish you'd mentioned
the "getting arrested" part.

23
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:32,633
I thought I'd just take credit
in a personals ad or something.

24
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:34,364
I'll get arrested, okay?

25
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,395
I'll tell your story.

26
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,391
"Lang syne"

27
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:44,145
Happy new year, officers!

28
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,772
{\SINGLES NIGHT with BEST SELLING AUTHOR
Dr. Claire McCrae}

29
00:01:50,897 --> 00:01:52,945
Did everyone see the ball drop?

30
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,530
Someone has <i>cojones</i>.

31
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:56,573
Out there

32
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:59,617
somewhere there's this Holly
realizing,

33
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,344
"someone loves me".

34
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:04,404
Super romantic.
Don't you think, Dr. McCrae?

35
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:05,624
I don't know.

36
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:08,363
I'd ask myself if I were this Holly,

37
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:10,756
what kind of man have
I become involved with...

38
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,638
The sort of man who breaks the law?

39
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:15,048
The sort of man who
won't take "no" for an answer?

40
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:17,356
I guess it's more of a fantasy.

41
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:20,946
Fantasy's overrated. These days,
I'm looking for a relationship

42
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:23,809
that doesn't make me crazy
or inconvenience me.

43
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,644
Excuse me.

44
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:29,383
What is it?

45
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:32,651
I was surprised to get
your call, Charles.

46
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,201
I was under the impression
that you were trying to force me out.

47
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:38,173
Well, it's true that generally speaking,
I prefer psychiatrists

48
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:41,058
who believe in psychiatry,
but I do know how your fans

49
00:02:41,183 --> 00:02:42,912
are clamoring for a follow-up.

50
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:46,071
This particular case
seemed right up your alley.

51
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:48,773
Maybe it's your next best seller.

52
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:55,841
He believes he's Cupid?

53
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,718
He's steadfast on that point.

54
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:00,604
I doubt I can do anything

55
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:04,378
with as much haloperidol and risperidone
as you've got pumped into him.

56
00:03:04,503 --> 00:03:06,560
He's probably sitting in a puddle
of his own drool.

57
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,060
He has been oddly resistant
to medication.

58
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:11,816
But here, you can see
for yourself. He's...

59
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,278
He's gone.

60
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,197
Can't hear you, schizophrenics!

61
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:39,385
Wild guess... that's our guy?

62
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:41,534
All together now.

63
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:45,724
"Everybody."

64
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,946
Isaac, can you bring your newest patient
to my office, please?

65
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,986
That's enough, people!

66
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:23,177
- Mister...
- It's Cupid.

67
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:27,308
- I've got all night.
- Fantastic. It appears I'm free, too.

68
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:30,227
Maybe we should hang
the "do not disturb" sign.

69
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:34,523
I'll have to ask you to refrain
from that kind of <i>innuendo</i>.

70
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,651
Doctor... Patient.

71
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,404
- I suppose you'd like me to disrobe?
- That won't be necessary.

72
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm fine here.

73
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:45,409
I'll be just outside the door.

74
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:48,219
Thought he'd never leave.
So...

75
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,130
- Where were we?
- "Cupid."

76
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:54,293
I can't help you unless you let me.

77
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,940
You want to help me?

78
00:04:57,436 --> 00:04:58,754
Get me out of this place.

79
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,924
I got a job,
and I can't get it done in here.

80
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:04,256
- So this is a job?
- Punishment is more like it.

81
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,097
200 mortals matched.

82
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,059
100 happily ever afters
before I'm allowed back.

83
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:11,810
- Back where?
- Olympus.

84
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,729
- Of course.
- You asked.

85
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:17,157
So this punishment...
Did you do something wrong?

86
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:20,132
At my expulsion, they yammered on

87
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:22,267
about relearning my craft

88
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:24,257
and the screwed up
state of love and romance.

89
00:05:24,382 --> 00:05:26,116
I had trouble taking
this thing seriously.

90
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,561
Why is that?

91
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,016
A hundred couples?
I used to knock that out before lunch.

92
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:33,040
- How did you pull that off?
- My bow. My arrows.

93
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:36,156
They're magic.

94
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:38,963
Do you have those with you now?

95
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:42,634
- You mean at this moment?
- Maybe you could shoot me,

96
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,927
and I'd more fully understand
this... magic.

97
00:05:47,268 --> 00:05:49,306
Do you see a bow?

98
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:55,270
How long do you think this quest
will take you... bowless?

99
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,982
- Two weeks, max.
- Two weeks?

100
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:59,775
- Make it ten days.
- Final answer?

101
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:00,954
Six days.

102
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:03,815
Four.

103
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,305
39 days into observation,

104
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,938
patient presents no relief
from his delusional state.

105
00:06:09,063 --> 00:06:11,089
We continue to monitor
missing person reports

106
00:06:11,214 --> 00:06:13,722
in the hopes of learning
his true identity.

107
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:16,103
This is what you're gonna do.
You're gonna walk up to Marla,

108
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:18,364
tell her the best part
of your day is watching her

109
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:20,555
medicate the old-timers
in that east wing bay window.

110
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,091
As a side note, he has managed
to win over much of the staff.

111
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:27,094
Tell me about Olympus.

112
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:29,722
- Describe home to me.
- You framed a postcard?

113
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:31,998
I took that.

114
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:34,065
It's the view from my apartment.

115
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,353
You were telling me about Olympus.

116
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,885
Nonstop clothing-optional party.

117
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,507
An amazing place.
You have no idea.

118
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:44,497
A vague idea. You just described
the Playboy mansion.

119
00:06:44,622 --> 00:06:47,031
Mercury... tell me about him.
Gangsta's got my back.

120
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:48,866
Dude's bailed me out
of so many jams.

121
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,948
One time, we stole this unicorn...

122
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:53,459
Listen, why don't we just stick
to career highlights?

123
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,750
Fine. Mercury...
Messenger of the gods. Son of Jupiter.

124
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,126
- Venus and Mars.
- Mom and Dad. Come on.

125
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:02,293
We started easy. Romulus?

126
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:04,048
- Founder of Rome.
- Peneleos?

127
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,436
The ban leader during
the Trojan war.

128
00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:08,589
- Way into black chicks.
- Fine.

129
00:07:08,714 --> 00:07:11,720
You know your mythology.
Tell me, how did Psyche react

130
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:14,108
- when the gods sent you back to Earth?
- Who?

131
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,083
Psyche.

132
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,921
Psyche. Cupid's wife.

133
00:07:21,084 --> 00:07:24,475
- My what?
- His wife. She was a mortal.

134
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:27,299
He fell in love with her
despite the gods' objections.

135
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:28,970
I can't believe you don't know this.

136
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:31,781
- This is the best-known myth of Cupid.
- That never happened.

137
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:33,826
Sure it did. There's even a picture.

138
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,496
I think I would remember.

139
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:38,102
See for yourself.

140
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:42,535
Recognize her?

141
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:45,089
Cupid was married?

142
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:48,031
He was.

143
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:52,712
Over the past 90 days,

144
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:55,390
the patient who refers
to himself as "Cupid"

145
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:58,852
has demonstrated no danger
to himself or others.

146
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:00,686
A John Doe? You still have no idea

147
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,815
as to the patient's true identity,
no name?

148
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:04,565
It's Trevor.

149
00:08:05,446 --> 00:08:06,646
Trevor Pierce.

150
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:09,959
Good.

151
00:08:10,084 --> 00:08:11,740
That relieves one of my qualms.

152
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,868
We will approve
the release of Trevor Pierce

153
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:18,204
on a trial basis if you continue
to monitor his progress.

154
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:22,912
To that end, we would like
to receive weekly reports

155
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:25,328
keeping us informed
of the patient's progress,

156
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:26,839
including finding employment.

157
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:29,707
I'm sorry, but my caseload
is such that I can't...

158
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:32,621
If you find that the patient
stops making progress,

159
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,346
he should immediately
be readmitted so we can begin

160
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:37,800
a more aggressive,
pharmacological approach.

161
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,852
Thank you, Dr. McCrae. Next case.

162
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:53,407
A couple of nights a week,
I mediate a group.

163
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:56,535
- Look at that. You got a card.
- Yeah. I've got a card.

164
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:59,648
It's a singles group.
Kind of an informal, roundtable thing.

165
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,671
We discuss relationships
and healthy dating patterns.

166
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:05,002
Singles group. Perfect.
Fish in a barrel.

167
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:08,672
Wait a minute.

168
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:12,426
- What are you saying, Trevor?
- I'm saying I've got a job to do...

169
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,073
Find Holly,
match another 99 couples.

170
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:16,731
I got a lot to do before I get home.

171
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,855
I wasn't gonna get it done
in that place.

172
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:20,434
You were faking.

173
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,105
Look, Trevor, I just staked
my professional reputation on you.

174
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,890
Which was sweet. Keep it.

175
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:29,193
- You want one? On me.
- What? No.

176
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,863
Look, Trevor. You are not a god.
You are a man.

177
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:35,240
I'll see you tonight.
Sounds like these people need me.

178
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,771
Excuse me. Stop, please.
Thank you.

179
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,207
Synchro: -Ori-, Reborn,
Walyd20-101, Breys

180
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:48,043
Proofreading: mpm

181
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:11,437
Where have you been?
I thought they sent you up the river.

182
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:14,661
All that matters is that we're back
in business. You got plans tonight?

183
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:30,411


184
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,314
- Oh my God, look who's here!
- You're renting my room.

185
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,012
You were here for a week,
and you disappeared for 3 months.

186
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:54,515
- What I was supposed to do?"
- I've been in a hospital,

187
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,962
thank you very much.

188
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:58,532
How am I supposed to know that?
You okay?

189
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,952
I was misdiagnosed. It was nothing.
<i>Buenos días, lita.</i>

190
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:05,088
<i>Quiero bañar en tu sudor.</i>

191
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,207
Hey that's my sister.

192
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:11,093
The guys at Arriba Arriba said
that's a common Spanish greeting.

193
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,922
"I want to bathe in your sweat"?
Not really.

194
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,633
This thing works.

195
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,468
Don't, that's a future antique.

196
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:20,762
- Leave it alone.
- Listen, you got a key for me?

197
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,723
You got the rent?

198
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:25,267
I will if you let me pick up
a couple shifts around here.

199
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,898
Haven't exactly been
packin' 'em in lately.

200
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:31,356
Keep me on, chief,
and I promise you'll be packed tonight.

201
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,787
Margaret, I respect your decision.

202
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:39,707
I do. All I'm suggesting is
that if you're going to continue

203
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,852
to place an ad in the personals,
it might be wise

204
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:44,786
to mention your chastity pledge
within the text.

205
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,145
It looks like we've got time
for one more person.

206
00:11:53,252 --> 00:11:55,333
Trevor,
maybe it'll be a good idea

207
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,646
if you just audited
the first couple of meetings.

208
00:11:57,771 --> 00:12:01,428
It's not for me. It's for my friend,
Dave. He needs help.

209
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,454
- What are you doing?
- Tell your story.

210
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:06,516
All right. Welcome, Dave.
Tell us about your love life.

211
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:11,195
Last summer I was
working in my dad's pub,

212
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,387
and this American girl comes in

213
00:12:13,512 --> 00:12:15,609
asking for directions
to Connolly station.

214
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,811
And then she had to go catch
a plane back to New York.

215
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:20,370
But,

216
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:23,158
those 20 minutes were all it took.

217
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:25,083
We... we just had this...

218
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,121
transcendent,
palpable connection.

219
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:32,292
But unfortunately
I only caught her first name... Holly.

220
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,004
Oh, my God. You're the guy
who changed the ball drop sign.

221
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:40,971
- With a little bit of help.
- So you know what Dave did?

222
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:45,305
Dave took all his money,
bought a one-way ticket to New York,

223
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,642
and he's been here ever since,
on the streets, on a quest.

224
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,660
So spread the word, people.

225
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:53,688
If you know a Holly
who had a magic moment

226
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,358
with a guy in a pub in Dublin?
He's here.

227
00:12:56,535 --> 00:12:59,986
He's looking for her, and that,
good people, is love!

228
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,243
I'm sorry.
That may be romantic, but it's not love.

229
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,246
What?

230
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:11,111
Didn't you hear him?
"Palpable, transcendent connection"!

231
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:13,834
Perhaps we can agree
to call it infatuation.

232
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,585
We could agree to disagree.

233
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,592
What are you preaching in here...
just don't do it?

234
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:23,400
- Reach for the copperring?
- I tell people, "be smart."

235
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:26,179
Love isn't smart.
Love is stupid.

236
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:29,076
You want to wrestle
that minotaur? Be bold!

237
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:31,810
Love at first sight is a myth.

238
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:35,042
Love is built on
a sturdier foundation, Trevor...

239
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:38,066
shared interests,
mutual respect, friendship...

240
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,759
things you can't possibly
establish in a couple of days,

241
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:44,310
- let alone 20 minutes.
- No. Love is passion.

242
00:13:44,993 --> 00:13:47,617
Love is heat, chemistry, sex.

243
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,077
Love is what's left

244
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:54,318
after the heat and the passion die.

245
00:13:58,763 --> 00:14:01,281
Or fades away...

246
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:03,780
kind of slowly.

247
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,504
Who ripped your heart out? 

248
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:12,798
This is a good place to wrap up.

249
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:15,539
An announcement, though.

250
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:18,113
Tres Equis, just down the street,

251
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:21,526
is offering half-price
margaritas for singles tonight.

252
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,115
It's mariachi/karaoke duets night.

253
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,824
I will be bartending
and pouring 'em strong.

254
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,013
See you tonight, people!
Be bold!

255
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:31,835
Trevor, stay.

256
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,622
15 years of training

257
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:39,779
has prepared me
to help these people.

258
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,270
And what, and being
the roman god of love since

259
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:44,455
the dawn of time
has prepared me for what...

260
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,143
celebrity judge on <i>Blind Date</i>?

261
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:49,006
Let's just say for a minute
that you really are Cupid.

262
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:51,061
Remind me again
how you made your matches.

263
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:53,666
That's right. You shot them.

264
00:14:54,285 --> 00:14:56,497
Random people falling madly in love.

265
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:59,664
Look around you, Cupid.
Your methodology didn't work.

266
00:15:00,423 --> 00:15:03,235
So how about letting someone
who actually gives a damn take a shot?

267
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,860
- Have at it.
- I plan on it.

268
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,447
- Go to town.
- I'm living in town... downtown.

269
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:12,099
And another thing...
I don't want you feeding Dave's fantasy.

270
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:15,446
- He'll end up getting hurt.
- Or living happily ever after.

271
00:15:15,571 --> 00:15:19,068
I promised the hospital board you
were no danger to yourself

272
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:20,328
or others.

273
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:22,945
Don't make me regret that.

274
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:36,393
Hey, boss.

275
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,061
Margaritas are half price?

276
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:42,399
It's Manhattan.
They're still 6 bucks.

277
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:56,488
You can't back out.
I mean, we already signed up.

278
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:59,146
I'll tell you what.
I'll go get us tequila shots.

279
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:03,056
- A little liquid courage?
- Fine, I'll sing. Don't get me a shot.

280
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:05,839
- I take a coffee if you're getting up.
- Be right back.

281
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:08,302
Don't go anywhere.

282
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,842
Tequila shot, no lime.
<i>Por favor, señor.</i>

283
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:16,725
- And a coffee.
- The coffee's gonna take a minute.

284
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:18,893
I gotta drain the dragon, anyway.

285
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,691
The java's for the hottie.

286
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,732
- You're making that happen,
- I'm working on it.

287
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,793
She's frosty, though.
Reporter from <i>The Post</i>.

288
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:29,253
She's got her gloves up.

289
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:31,615
That's okay.
Jimmy likes a little fight.

290
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,007
I'll take her the coffee.

291
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,499
Hi. I'm Trevor.
I'll be your server tonight.

292
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:48,131
Coffee, black.
Word is you're a reporter.

293
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,394
That's right.

294
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,678
How about doing a story
on my friend Dave?

295
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,652
Go with me. What happens is,
Holly reads it,

296
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:57,030
shows up here at Tres Equis
where Dave is performing.

297
00:16:57,155 --> 00:17:00,190
You get not one,
but two heartwarming stories.

298
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:03,647
- How long have you lived in New York?
- Not long.

299
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,555
I'll let you in on a little secret.

300
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,527
People don't come here to fall in love.
People come here to make it.

301
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,916
<i>Next up, we have Jimmy and...
Madelyn.</i>

302
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,544
That's my cue.
Sorry I can't help you.

303
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,066
<i>Jimmy, where are you?</i>

304
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,118
Dave, get up there on stage.
Opportunity's knocking, my friend.

305
00:17:51,243 --> 00:17:54,406
She is a reporter for <i>The Post</i>.
She can help us find Holly. Go.

306
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:04,124
<i>Jimmy, wherever you are,
you're a dead man.</i>

307
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,533
<i>That's it for the week.</i>

308
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,697
Mariachi will be here next Tuesday.

309
00:19:24,242 --> 00:19:25,931
Couldn't keep away from me,
could ya?

310
00:19:26,056 --> 00:19:29,501
I wanted to verify employment.
I'm responsible for you, remember?

311
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:32,170
Likely story.
So what can I get you?

312
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:33,880
- Sex on the beach?
- No.

313
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:37,342
One screaming orgasm?
After-hours grope on a lunatic's futon?

314
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:38,468
Bartender!

315
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:40,637
Think about it.

316
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:48,905
You were so great up there.

317
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,813
Thanks.
My partner carried me.

318
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,101
He was really something.
Though I...

319
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:56,277
I can't quite get over his story.

320
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,851
I mean, if I were that Holly,

321
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,256
I would be so unnerved
if I found out that some guy

322
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:03,243
had flown all the way
across the coun...

323
00:20:04,696 --> 00:20:05,835
There you go.

324
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,665
So you two are leaving?

325
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:11,855
We're gonna go find someplace quiet.

326
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,880
- I think I'm gonna do a story on Dave.
- That's a... that's a great idea.

327
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,883
Trevor deserves the credit.
It was his suggestion.

328
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:21,006
Gotta boogie.

329
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:22,846
- See ya.
- See ya.

330
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:35,608
I asked you to do one thing for me.
What was it?

331
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:38,364
Drawing a blank.

332
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:40,238
I asked you not to feed
Dave's fantasies.

333
00:20:40,627 --> 00:20:44,665
It is one thing to proclaim
you are Cupid, the god of love,

334
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,381
but it's something else entirely

335
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:48,499
when you insert yourself
into strangers' lives.

336
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,373
Then it's called divine intervention.

337
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:52,959
What's the big deal anyway?
I mean, it's not like

338
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:56,170
I'm telling my followers to send me
their social security check.

339
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,048
Trevor, you do not have followers.

340
00:20:59,217 --> 00:20:59,949
Really?

341
00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:02,384
Then how come there's a temple
of Eros in Chelsea?

342
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:06,306
- They sell thrashy lingerie.
- Of course. It's one of sacraments.

343
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,076
What's the next on the agenda for Dave
after the newspaper interview?

344
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:14,355
Holly told Dave about this DJ she likes
who spins

345
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,400
like twice a year, including tomorrow
night at this club in Brooklin.

346
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,874
We're gonna see if we can find her.

347
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,821
What are the odds?

348
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:26,447
Parlor trick.

349
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:29,829
I'm going with you tomorrow.

350
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:31,623
- Why?
- To make sure

351
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,834
you are no harm to others
like I promised the hospital board.

352
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,413
- Thanks Yvonne.
- Thanks.

353
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,981
How did your family react
when they heard

354
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,808
you were flying off to the States
to track down this mysterious stranger?

355
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,363
Me Da had to support me, you know?

356
00:21:53,488 --> 00:21:56,505
He met my mom a a matchmaking festival
in Lisdoonvarna.

357
00:21:58,389 --> 00:22:00,465
I'm not sure what I have
a harder time believing...

358
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,173
a matchmaking festival
or a town called "Lisdoonvarna".

359
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:04,914
They're both real, trust me.

360
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,491
Never me a happier couple.

361
00:22:07,171 --> 00:22:09,716
So your mom must have been
really supportive as well.

362
00:22:09,974 --> 00:22:12,606
No, she was killed when I was 12.

363
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,249
Drunk driver.

364
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,830
I'm so sorry.

365
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,627
Me too.

366
00:22:18,006 --> 00:22:19,887
Do you want to see a picture of her?

367
00:22:20,368 --> 00:22:21,881
She was a music teacher.

368
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,677
She's your screen saver.

369
00:22:27,255 --> 00:22:29,705
Be careful who you show that to.
This is Manhattan.

370
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,921
Did you not see the "you must be
this cool to enter" sign?

371
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,937
Then I'm in real trouble then,
because I am absurdly uncool.

372
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,149
But you know, I never hung out
with the cool people anyway, you know?

373
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,243
They always seem such a drag.

374
00:22:44,707 --> 00:22:48,188
So I'm mopping up back at the bar
when I get this idea.

375
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:51,403
Why don't you get the newspaper
to hire a sketch artist,

376
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:54,038
do a composite of Dave's dream gal,
run it with the story?

377
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,185
She'll see it and show up
at Tres Equis.

378
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:01,379
It's been a long time.
You can give a description?

379
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:03,047
Oh, absolutely.

380
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:05,339
Excellent.

381
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:25,445
You're not planning on opening
a pool hall in here, are you?

382
00:23:28,248 --> 00:23:32,022
My sister said she heard you arguing
with some woman last night after close.

383
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:35,152
- Said the woman called you "Trevor".
- Yeah. That was my shrink.

384
00:23:35,277 --> 00:23:37,749
So then she says that you believe
that you're Cupid.

385
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,752
Yeah. It's a real bone of contention
between us.

386
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:45,190
- You told me your name was Ed Ross.
- No, I told you my name was Eros.

387
00:23:46,274 --> 00:23:49,802
It's what the Greeks call me.
The Italians say "Cupid" take your pick.

388
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,555
- Probably go with Trevor.
- Whatever makes you comfortable.

389
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,461
- What's this all about?
- I don't get to go home

390
00:23:55,586 --> 00:23:56,736
- Home?
- Mt. Olympus

391
00:23:56,861 --> 00:23:58,509
until I match up a hundred couples.

392
00:23:58,634 --> 00:24:01,884
- This just helps me keep score.
- So what, you get a point for every...

393
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,609
If every couple
you hook up does a...

394
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,975
You know what I'm talking about...

395
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:10,114
- Makes love?
- I wish.

396
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,676
Only counts if the gods decide
it's true love.

397
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:17,206
Yeah, the hair is good.
Can you make the eyes more, like...

398
00:24:17,963 --> 00:24:18,963
playful?

399
00:24:20,982 --> 00:24:22,919
I'm starving. Is anyone else hungry?

400
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,178
I'm dying to find
a decent Greek place.

401
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,097
Baklava.

402
00:24:27,222 --> 00:24:29,175
Aren't you meeting a photographer
 in an hour?

403
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,410
Damn.

404
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,647
Should we all cab out there
together?

405
00:24:32,842 --> 00:24:34,847
I can't.
I gotta meet up with somebody.

406
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,123
We'll catch up with you
at the ferris wheel.

407
00:24:39,337 --> 00:24:41,126
Did I just see a picture of you,

408
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:43,940
- Daryl Hall and John Oates go by?
- That's right.

409
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:46,526
- You got a problem with that, sport?
- Why?

410
00:24:47,188 --> 00:24:49,800
Because they are awesome,
that's why.

411
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:53,095
They invited the webmasters
of the top ten fan sites in the country

412
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,202
- to hang out backstage.
- There are ten Hall & Oates fans?

413
00:24:57,213 --> 00:24:59,956
I certainly feel better about
my "property of the Borg" boxers now.

414
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:02,083
Get a life, nerd.

415
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,870
Something like this?

416
00:25:06,384 --> 00:25:08,904
That's her.
That's the girl I came here to find.

417
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,924
Let's see.

418
00:25:13,689 --> 00:25:15,221
That'd launch a thousand ships.

419
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:24,572
Act natural, Mr. Cool.

420
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,290
I think I got it.

421
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:28,776
Thanks

422
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,156
Hey, "dance dance revolution".

423
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,800
- What are you doing?
- Teach how we used to kick it

424
00:25:42,925 --> 00:25:44,225
in the mid '90s.

425
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,499
Is it like golf,
the lower the score, the better?

426
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:52,430
Hush.

427
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:56,846
So what happens if you find Holly
and she has a boyfriend?

428
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:59,085
I'll get over it eventually, but,

429
00:25:59,505 --> 00:26:02,209
not knowing whether it was real would be
worse than knowing that it wasn't.

430
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,493
If you say so.

431
00:26:03,802 --> 00:26:06,244
Didn't anyone tell you
this thing we call romantic love

432
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:08,107
was an invention
of the 19th century?

433
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,359
Take these two.

434
00:26:12,128 --> 00:26:14,530
For them, love is winning
a giant stuffed animal,

435
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,130
a photo booth make-out session,

436
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:18,367
a ride on the ferris wheel,
but that's not real.

437
00:26:18,622 --> 00:26:21,120
I couldn't tell you.
I've never been on a ferris wheel.

438
00:26:22,256 --> 00:26:23,456
Inconceivable.

439
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:26,834
Better luck next time, lady.

440
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:32,465
Ferris wheel.

441
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,598
Are you sure Dave remembers
you're taking him to this club tonight?

442
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:42,491
He was supposed to be right here.

443
00:26:42,616 --> 00:26:45,983
Maybe you two would be better served
by altering your expectations.

444
00:26:46,108 --> 00:26:48,542
Poppycock.
That's mortal-think.

445
00:26:54,194 --> 00:26:55,321
<i>Here, give me that.</i>

446
00:26:58,013 --> 00:26:59,313
<i>How high are we?</i>

447
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:01,317
Are you okay?

448
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:03,280
I'm fine. I'm just...

449
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:06,888
I thought this thing
was like a kiddie's ride, you know?

450
00:27:07,013 --> 00:27:09,763
Like a...
Like a merry-go-round on its side.

451
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,690
Okay, this thing is terrifying.

452
00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:14,767
You're right.
You're totally uncool.

453
00:27:14,892 --> 00:27:17,364
Yeah, but you have to admire
my keen self-awareness.

454
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:19,842
We'll get through this together.

455
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:45,423
Chalk one up for mortal-think.

456
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:49,616
She threw herself and you didn't.

457
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:51,562
She kissed you, right?

458
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,088
Spilt milk, bad guys.

459
00:27:54,535 --> 00:27:56,450
Didn't exactly find Madelyn off.

460
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:58,674
Maybe that's a sign.

461
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:02,562
Do you think it's possible that you're
created a perfect woman in Holly

462
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:05,728
that no flesh and bone woman
could compete with her until now?

463
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,164
Why do you hate me?

464
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,692
When we get inside,
we're looking for the woman

465
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,393
that inspired you
to buy a one-way ticket to America, OK?

466
00:28:17,518 --> 00:28:20,865
So try not to trip and land with
your tongue in anyone else's mouth.

467
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,996
It's just that Madelyn's
so easy to talk to.

468
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:24,899
- Focus, dude.
- Ease of communication

469
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:27,427
- is one of my four pillars of...
- Zip!

470
00:28:29,227 --> 00:28:31,038
Madelyn would probably
love this place.

471
00:28:31,163 --> 00:28:34,387
- You should see her dance.
- Madelyn is busy filing her story,

472
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,172
because Madelyn understands her role
in this epic journey.

473
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:40,154
- Epic.
- People, if you are not on the list,

474
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,851
- you will not get in tonight.
- This sucks!

475
00:28:42,976 --> 00:28:46,725
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

476
00:28:47,618 --> 00:28:48,437
Big.

477
00:28:48,821 --> 00:28:52,511
My buddy was in the bar last night,
and he thinks he left his credit card.

478
00:28:52,636 --> 00:28:55,658
- Can he go inside real quick and check?
- Quick like a bunny.

479
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,027
Remember, in and out.
See if she's in there. Go.

480
00:29:02,647 --> 00:29:06,309
It's a human interest piece.
It's not Watergate.

481
00:29:06,977 --> 00:29:08,232
Ten more minutes.

482
00:29:09,424 --> 00:29:11,367
I don't get it.
You say you're on a mission

483
00:29:11,492 --> 00:29:12,947
to match 100 couples.

484
00:29:13,072 --> 00:29:16,872
We find a man and a woman
you introduced hitting it off, kissing,

485
00:29:17,377 --> 00:29:18,977
and you drag him away.

486
00:29:19,102 --> 00:29:21,382
Have you not been
paying any attention?

487
00:29:21,694 --> 00:29:24,640
Look, I only get credit
for a match if it's true love,

488
00:29:25,037 --> 00:29:27,598
The kind of love
you'd cross oceans to find.

489
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,101
They were very specific
on that point.

490
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,375
Romeo and Juliet counts.

491
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,964
Romeo and the coat
check girl doesn't.

492
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:35,856
Guys.

493
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:39,151
- What's up?
- No luck.

494
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:42,113
All right, on to plan "B".

495
00:29:47,165 --> 00:29:50,979
There are two guys in the alley
trying to drop off a p.a.

496
00:29:51,104 --> 00:29:53,791
They're asking me for a check.
Except I didn't rent a p.a.

497
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,709
Don't you read the paper?

498
00:29:56,832 --> 00:29:58,593
Having a big show here tonight.

499
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,300
You should fire him.

500
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,845
What is it with you and strays?

501
00:30:08,735 --> 00:30:11,478
The patient who was given
the single name Jenny Q

502
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:14,478
suffers from somatoform disorder.

503
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,487
Now specifically she suffered
from conversion disorder representing

504
00:30:18,612 --> 00:30:21,026
a central neurological symptom
such as...

505
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,460
<i>It's Trevor.</i>

506
00:30:26,388 --> 00:30:27,588
<i>Trevor Pierce.</i>

507
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:09,408
- Big night.
- Yeah.

508
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:12,328
They all want to know
if this Holly is gonna show up.

509
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:18,161
Still think I should fire him?

510
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,498
You sure clean up nice.

511
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:28,177
Am I being stupid?
He's in love with someone else.

512
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,930
You're being proactive.
That's chapter one of my book.

513
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:34,298
Well, if it isn't the lady
that made it all possible.

514
00:31:34,423 --> 00:31:35,806
These are on the house.

515
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:38,854
Well, if it isn't "tremor pierced."

516
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:52,119
Cheers. Thanks very much.

517
00:31:53,147 --> 00:31:54,578
This... this next song

518
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,512
I learned especially for tonight,

519
00:31:56,637 --> 00:31:59,839
and it goes out to somebody
who's spectacularly uncool, but,

520
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,122
that's what I dig about her.

521
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,075
All right!

522
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:12,159
<i>What I want, you've got</i>

523
00:32:12,284 --> 00:32:14,723
<i>And it might be hard to handle</i>

524
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:18,936
<i>Like a flame that burns a candle
The candle feeds the flame</i>

525
00:32:19,336 --> 00:32:22,510
A couple of days ago, I felt sorry
for the girl on the Times Square sign,

526
00:32:22,635 --> 00:32:24,525
- and now, I'm jealous of her.
- Don't be.

527
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:27,736
He's only in love
with the idea of someone else.

528
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,762
<i>Well, well, well, you</i>

529
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:35,087
<i>You're makin' my dreams come true.</i>

530
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,010
I knew I'd find you.

531
00:33:11,735 --> 00:33:13,490
This is it.
You've got your story!

532
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,237
But I didn't want
to get the story this time, Trevor.

533
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:18,255
I wanted to be the girl
that got the song,

534
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,279
- and I was this close.
- But, Madelyn...

535
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,475
I tried being bold, Trevor.

536
00:33:23,575 --> 00:33:25,705
I should've stuck with being smart.

537
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,306
I love this place.

538
00:33:37,718 --> 00:33:40,934
All it needs is those little jukeboxes
that they have in the booths, you know?

539
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,866
This is Holly.
Holly, this is a friend of mine.

540
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:47,805
This is the guy who's responsible for
twisting the fabric of space and time

541
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,361
- and getting us back together.
- A regular Cupid.

542
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:51,533
Who told you?

543
00:33:51,658 --> 00:33:54,197
We were just talking about
what our first real date should be.

544
00:33:54,322 --> 00:33:57,242
Simple. Red-eye to Vegas.
Elvis impersonator hitches you.

545
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,810
Lifetime of bliss.

546
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:01,914
- I was thinking a movie.
- You came a long way.

547
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,124
You don't want
to make it dinner and a movie?

548
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,710
I make it a point to clear
my schedule for any man

549
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,294
who puts my name
in lights on Times Square.

550
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:12,132
Well, how about
a carriage ride through the park?

551
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:19,556
Oh, my God.
You were serious. I'm so sorry.

552
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,962
Jaded New Yorker completely devoid
of a sense of wonder.

553
00:34:23,087 --> 00:34:25,108
So... What was your reaction

554
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:27,911
when you saw Dave's picture
in the paper, and you read the story?

555
00:34:28,036 --> 00:34:30,275
My first reaction?
"Who is this guy?"

556
00:34:30,831 --> 00:34:33,042
But I called my sister,
and she reminded me.

557
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:35,114
I guess I'd sent her
an e-mail that said,

558
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,396
"Finally met a cool guy in Ireland.

559
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:39,280
"Too bad it was my last day."

560
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:41,495
You're that cool guy.

561
00:34:44,628 --> 00:34:45,791
Cool is not everything.

562
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,304
- Hello?
<i>- Hi. It's Trevor.</i>

563
00:34:59,872 --> 00:35:03,100
I think I screwed up last night,
and I need you to help me fix it.

564
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:04,810
What did you have in mind?

565
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,938
That picture in your office...
That was taken from your building?

566
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,569
Baklava.
You and me.

567
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,441
I've been investigating.

568
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:22,619
I know where we can find
the best in the city.

569
00:35:22,924 --> 00:35:24,570
To understand
the history of baklava,

570
00:35:24,695 --> 00:35:27,336
you first have to understand
the history of Cyprus,

571
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:31,361
which is to say the entire narrative
of the Greek-Turkish conflict.

572
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,526
Some heretics will have you believe
that syrup is an authentic topping.

573
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:39,408
Humbug. Give me honey.

574
00:35:44,703 --> 00:35:46,518
They said it was <i>alfresco</i>.

575
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,222
This isn't a restaurant, Trevor.

576
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:50,765
No, I... what do you call it?
Google maps'ed it.

577
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:53,584
Let me go find the manager.

578
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:01,104
<i>I've been so many places</i>

579
00:36:01,229 --> 00:36:03,246
<i>In my life and time</i>

580
00:36:05,494 --> 00:36:06,997
<i>Sung a lot of songs</i>

581
00:36:09,178 --> 00:36:11,084
<i>And I've made some bad rhymes</i>

582
00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:22,971
<i>I've acted out my love on stages</i>

583
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,934
<i>10,000 people watchin'</i>

584
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:30,020
<i>We're alone now</i>

585
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:34,149
<i>And I'm singing this song for you</i>

586
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,244
I was such an idiot.

587
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:47,172
Yeah, you were.

588
00:37:24,488 --> 00:37:28,340
<i>If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,
I doubt I would have believed it.</i>

589
00:37:28,465 --> 00:37:31,111
<i>Certainly there was
no magic bow and arrow,</i>

590
00:37:31,236 --> 00:37:33,500
<i>but Trevor created
a romantic scenario</i>

591
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:36,325
<i>that witnesses would describe
as "magical".</i>

592
00:37:36,793 --> 00:37:39,265
<i>Casebooks are full
of stories about soldiers</i>

593
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,671
<i>who have seen so much suffering
on the battlefield</i>

594
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:44,445
<i>that the only way they can cope
is to convince themselves</i>

595
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,347
<i>they're Jesus Christ.
The delusion serves</i>

596
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,854
<i>to protect these soldiers'
fragile minds.</i>

597
00:37:49,979 --> 00:37:53,687
<i>I believe my mystery patient
who calls himself Trevor Pierce</i>

598
00:37:53,812 --> 00:37:56,012
<i>has experienced no less a tragedy.</i>

599
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:59,860
<i>The key to dispelling the delusion,
therefore, is to learn the cause,</i>

600
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,937
<i>treat the heartbreak and allow
this Cupid to find his Psyche.</i>

601
00:38:04,622 --> 00:38:06,033
All right, later!

602
00:38:09,443 --> 00:38:10,495
Dave O'leary?

603
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm agent Morris, immigration
and customs enforcement.

604
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:17,044
I'm afraid I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

605
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:20,441
Nice story about you
in the paper, by the way.

606
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:27,673
Hey, boss.
What's the good word?

607
00:38:29,653 --> 00:38:30,849
That singer Dave called.

608
00:38:31,383 --> 00:38:33,884
He was hoping you'd be around.
Immigration caught up with him,

609
00:38:34,009 --> 00:38:36,146
and they put him
on a plane back to Dublin.

610
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:40,841
He wanted me to tell you thanks
for everything and say good-bye.

611
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,111
You might want to get a cell phone.

612
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:59,220
I missed his call.
I didn't even get to say good-bye.

613
00:38:59,345 --> 00:39:03,345
I was reading <i>Modern Invention</i>.
There's this riveting piece in there.

614
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:06,593
Apparently, there are
these flying contraptions now

615
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,769
that allow passengers
to travel great distances.

616
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:12,557
I have a life here, a job.
I can't just pick up.

617
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:14,643
True love crosses oceans.

618
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,395
Haven't you heard, Trevor?
People don't fall in love in two days.

619
00:39:19,044 --> 00:39:20,837
See, that's where we're different.

620
00:39:20,962 --> 00:39:24,695
You take your advice from Dr. McCrae.
I take my advice from captain Kirk.

621
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:26,358
I can't.

622
00:39:26,483 --> 00:39:29,306
I can't put myself
out there like that.

623
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,383
That's how you get hurt.

624
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:35,356
Okay, I get it.

625
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:39,418
I got a phone now.
Don't be a stranger.

626
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,586
I won't.

627
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:42,504
Be good.

628
00:39:46,642 --> 00:39:49,550
<i>It was all I could do to not throw her
over my shoulder and put her on a plane.</i>

629
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:51,325
<i>I'm pleased you didn't.</i>

630
00:39:52,312 --> 00:39:55,362
<i>I had one card left to play.
No idea if it worked.</i>

631
00:39:58,936 --> 00:40:01,314
Why do mortals make
falling in love so difficult?

632
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:03,275
You'll get used to it, Trevor.

633
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,971
<i>"Be bold."
What was I thinking?</i>

634
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:11,514
There's someone
for everyone, Trevor.

635
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:14,383
You say that
with your authoritative tone.

636
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:16,811
Even though I know better,

637
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:18,582
I almost believe you.

638
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:21,376
Someone broke your heart.
I'm sure of that much.

639
00:40:22,122 --> 00:40:25,380
But you'll heal.
You'll even fall in love again.

640
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,175
Here, with a mortal?
Not likely.

641
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,552
Cupid fell in love with Psyche.
She was a mortal.

642
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,262
I told you, that never happened.

643
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,920
<i>And I never did get that baklava.</i>

644
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,392
You ever hear of this place...
St. Nick's?

645
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:39,811
Greek place in Soho.
People rave.

646
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,689
Let's have lunch tomorrow.
You and me. I'll buy.

647
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,960
There are rules, Trevor.

648
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,376
Doctor, patient.
Lest I forget.

649
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:50,697
Here's the thing.

650
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,765
<i>I could really use
some counseling, Dr. McCrae.</i>

651
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:56,681
Suddenly doubting your omniscience?

652
00:40:57,972 --> 00:41:00,582
But from what people tell me,
you're the best shrink around.

653
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,777
It might take a little time, but...

654
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:06,288
And with
around-the-clock availability,

655
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:07,813
some elbow grease,

656
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:10,383
you might actually be able
to cure me of this.

657
00:41:10,742 --> 00:41:11,593
This what?

658
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:13,428
Homesickness.

659
00:41:15,408 --> 00:41:16,558
<i>Homesickness?</i>

660
00:41:17,189 --> 00:41:20,268
All right, I will meet you down there,
see if we can't make this work.

661
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:25,107
- Do you know where we're goin'?
- No earthly idea.

662
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:32,011
<i>It's on 2nd between Pacific
and Atlantic. How does 1:00 sound?</i>

663
00:41:57,069 --> 00:41:58,769
- I'll be there.
- Bye.
