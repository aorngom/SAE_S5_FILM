1
00:00:00,618 --> 00:00:02,871
<i>Kids, as long as
I'd known your uncle Barney,</i>

2
00:00:02,996 --> 00:00:05,504
<i>he'd always had some pretty
strong opinions on relationships.</i>

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,222
Your girlfriend?
She's your girlfriend?!

4
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:11,272
She's a girl and a friend?

5
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:15,139
Do not humanize the enemy, Ted.

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,268
But nice to meet you.

7
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:19,852
<i>And yet, in the fall of 2009,</i>

8
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:21,771
<i>he was the one with the girlfriend.</i>

9
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:23,272
Go ahead.
Open it.

10
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:25,024
Open it! Open it!

11
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:27,863
It's my porn collection!

12
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:29,570
Just kidding.
That would be weird.

13
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:34,135
- It's your porn collection.
- Yes, it is. I'm giving you my porn.

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,244
Now that things are so great with Robin,
I don't need it anymore.

15
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:39,205
You are voluntarily...

16
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:42,086
giving up your porn?

17
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:45,294
- You really are serious.
- Well, that's obvious.

18
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,431
- What does that mean?
- Nothing, it's just,

19
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:48,839
you got relationship gut.

20
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:49,933
What?!

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,070
No, I do not "got relationship gut."

22
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:54,387
That is ridiculous.

23
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,977
It's no big deal. 
Once you're dating someone,

24
00:00:57,102 --> 00:00:59,712
it's natural to let things
go a little bit. Trust me,

25
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:01,494
we've been there.

26
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:04,021
Boy, did I pudge out for a while.

27
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:06,607
We should get going.

28
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:09,235
Good-bye, my sweet, beloved friends.

29
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,587
You have always been there for me.

30
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:13,062
You'll be missed.

31
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:14,699
He's talking to the porn.

32
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,243
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

33
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:20,139
God, look at these videos.

34
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:21,314
<i>Space orgy</i>?

35
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,041
<i>Horny co-ed surprise party 23</i>?

36
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,086
You'd think after the first 22 parties,
co-eds wouldn't be surprised anymore.

37
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:29,096
So...

38
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,966
We can get rid of these for you.

39
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:35,902
It's not a problem.
I'll take care of them.

40
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:37,626
Are you sure?
No biggie.

41
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:40,808
We can just swing by the back alley
and drop the box in the dumpster.

42
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:43,686
I see six of the words you just said
on this video label.

43
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,144
Seriously, it's not a big deal.
I'll take care of it.

44
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:47,913
- 'cause, I mean...
- Leave them!

45
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,446
You know, in a way, it's sad, right?

46
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,447
I mean, Barney's giving up his porn.
He's got relationship gut.

47
00:01:55,572 --> 00:01:57,874
They eat at the same
diner every night.

48
00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:00,169
It's, like, the end of Barney Stinson
as we know him.

49
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:03,032
- Yeah, well, so what? They're happy.
- Yeah, well, we gotta go.

50
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:08,449
- So what'd you get?
- I got <i>Squat</i>.

51
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:10,885
What are you...?
I thought I saw you take one.

52
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,810
I did.
It's called <i>Squat</i>.

53
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:20,104
<i>Archisexture</i>.

54
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:24,122
That is not how you spell
"Buckminster fuller."

55
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,617
<i>Kids, pornography is bad,</i>

56
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:30,024
<i>and so I was getting rid of that
vile pornography right away...</i>

57
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:33,277
I am getting rid of this vile
pornography right away.

58
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:36,362
<i>... when something terrible
happened.</i>

59
00:02:58,475 --> 00:02:59,887
<i>Archisexture...</i>

60
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:01,013
<i>Hello.</i>

61
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,792
<i>If you're watching this tape...
And I knew you'd pick this one.</i>

62
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:07,125
<i>Then you are now
in possession of my porn.</i>

63
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:09,086
<i>This can only mean
one of two things.</i>

64
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:12,066
<i>Either I'm dead,
or I'm in a committed relationship.</i>

65
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:16,072
<i>If I'm dead,
I want you to honor my memory</i>

66
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:18,942
<i>by taking my body to the Hamptons</i>

67
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:21,367
<i>and recreating</i> Weekend at Bernie's.

68
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,585
<i>I want to dance.</i>

69
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:25,725
<i>I want to have sex with a girl.</i>

70
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,769
<i>And I want to go fishing.</i>

71
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,622
<i>If, on the other hand, I'm
in a committed relationship,</i>

72
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:35,422
<i>then as your best friend,
I have only one request,</i>

73
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,562
<i>please, for the love of god,</i>

74
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,730
<i>get me out of it!</i>

75
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,359
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

76
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,858
.:: La Fabrique ::.

77
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:56,485
<i>I might look happy,
but don't believe it.</i>

78
00:03:56,746 --> 00:03:59,321
<i>Barney Stinson
is meant to be single.</i>

79
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,411
<i>So please,</i>

80
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:03,133
<i>if you value my best-friendship...
That's right, Marshall,</i>

81
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:05,320
<i>I'm his best friend,
how does that feel?</i>

82
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:07,580
<i>Then get me out of this.</i>

83
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,866
<i>And finally, since you were
expecting some porn...</i>

84
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,882
<i>No, no, no, baby, don't worry.</i>

85
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,234
<i>The flashing green
light means it's off.</i>

86
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,895
Are we sure he was finished talking?

87
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:28,549
Look, there's no reason we should
take this seriously, right?

88
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:30,644
Of course not.
This is an old tape.

89
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:32,438
Barney is happy with Robin.

90
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,473
<i>But over the next couple weeks,
I started to notice things.</i>

91
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:38,068
<i>Barney and Robin stopped having
crazy adventures.</i>

92
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,523
- So what'd you guys do last night?
- I wanted to go to a concert.

93
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,140
He wanted to go to a party.

94
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:45,775
Obviously, we couldn't
do what just one of us wanted,

95
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,166
we just stayed in,
watched a movie on cable.

96
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,588
It was legen...
Wait for it...

97
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:52,625
... of the fall.

98
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:54,852
Legends of the fall!

99
00:04:56,407 --> 00:04:57,542
It was okay.

100
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:00,044
<i>Barney stopped being himself.</i>

101
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,635
Barney, I'm...
I'm chatting up this girl

102
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,394
over there, and I could use a
little help landing the plane.

103
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:08,599
Sorry, Ted, I'm my own
wingman tonight.

104
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:14,647
<i>And Robin got annoyed
at everything he said.</i>

105
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,315
So, how are you two?

106
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,433
So great.

107
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:19,777
- Relationships are the best.
- Shut up.

108
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,613
- The sharing, the compromise,
- Shut up, shut up, shut up...

109
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,199
- the monogamy, can't beat it.
- Shut up, shut up...

110
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:28,087
Catchphrase! Yes!

111
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:31,076
<i>But the worse they got...</i>

112
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:33,530
I'm full... Sweetie.

113
00:05:34,015 --> 00:05:36,344
<i>... the more they kept saying
things were great.</i>

114
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,638
<i>Now, the truth is Barney and Robin
kind of let themselves go a little bit.</i>

115
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:41,640
<i>But I swear after few more weeks,</i>

116
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:43,217
<i>to us, they seemed like this.</i>

117
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,512
I'll be there...

118
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:49,344
in a minute.

119
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:58,399
- They're killing each other.
- They love each other.

120
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,785
They love each other, but they're not
Barney and Robin anymore.

121
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,655
- They're the fat guy and the old lady.
- My favorite '70s detective show.

122
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:07,116
Look, it's so clear.

123
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,695
Barney's been overeating because
he hates being tied down like this.

124
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,497
And Robin's stressing out because
she hates what Barney's turned into.

125
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,582
No, they're a perfect match.

126
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,127
Well, maybe that's the problem.
Maybe they're too similar.

127
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,671
It must be tough having 2 alpha dogs
in 1 relationship.

128
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,757
- We've 2 alpha dogs in our too.
- Sure we do, sweetie.

129
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:26,719
If they're not happy,
why don't they just break up?

130
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,101
They're too stubborn.

131
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:31,066
Neither one of them wants to be
the first to admit that they want out.

132
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,518
- They're playing relationship chicken.
- He ate the relationship chicken.

133
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,479
Ted, it's just a rough patch.

134
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:39,883
It takes time getting used
to being with someone else.

135
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:41,185
And they're both...

136
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,444
- What's the nice word for selfish?
- Independent.

137
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,155
Independent. Every relationship
goes through this.

138
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:49,356
It's true,
I have this astronaut friend...

139
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:51,281
Totally loved his fiancée.

140
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,950
And then, the day before his
mission she caught him

141
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:56,987
with, like, four other chicks,
a couple of dudes.

142
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:58,685
Things got really tense.

143
00:06:58,904 --> 00:07:01,253
Finally, she ended up sneaking
onto the space shuttle...

144
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,297
- Are you talking about <i>Space Orgy</i>?
- Yes.

145
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,185
Ted, it's just a rough patch.
Just let things run their course.

146
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,554
- She's right.
- Two-to-one, Ted. Leave them alone.

147
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,580
<i>So I did leave them alone.
But that weekend...</i>

148
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,611
Have you noticed how beef ribs
used to always be disgusting,

149
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:21,794
and then recently, they found a way
to make them really delicious instead?

150
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:25,845
Okay, Barney, I'm going to go
ahead and ask you this head-on.

151
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,657
- Are you happy with Robin?
- Are you kidding?!

152
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,295
How could I not be happy
with Robin? It's Robin!

153
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,035
You're happy?

154
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,991
I can't believe you would ask me that.
I mean, yes, we fight all the time,

155
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,924
but you know what they say
about relationships,

156
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:42,132
every moment's a battle.

157
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,163
You're happy?

158
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:47,451
And you know what goes
hand in hand with fighting?

159
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:49,007
The makeup sex.

160
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:50,472
Which is...

161
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:52,475
different

162
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,015
when you're in a loving,
long-term relationship.

163
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,726
Heads we have sex,

164
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,396
tails we order a whole pizza
and just lay here moaning.

165
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,190
Great.
Let the coin decide.

166
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:08,487
- Which was pizza again?
- Tails.

167
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,805
It was tails.

168
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:13,438
Sex... am I right?

169
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:15,554
Thank god that's mostly over.

170
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,665
I'm still hungry.
You hungry?

171
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,489
We have to break them up.

172
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:29,550
You're right. Barney and Robin
are miserable together,

173
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,475
but they're too stubborn
to admit it.

174
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:34,196
- We have to get them to break up.
- How do we do that?

175
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:35,471
We unleash...

176
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,057
the kraken.

177
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:40,031
<i>Kids, as you know, earlier that year</i>

178
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:42,329
<i>I'd learned that lily had
broken up not one,</i>

179
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:45,746
<i>not two, but seven
of my past relationships.</i>

180
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:48,318
Forget it.
I'm retired.

181
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:50,853
- I'm out of the game.
- But nobody's better than you.

182
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:53,912
I'm telling you,
I swore off that racket.

183
00:08:54,186 --> 00:08:55,454
I've gone legit.

184
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:56,952
I'm a matchmaker now.

185
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,538
- Set me up with someone.
- I'm just starting out.

186
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:02,749
Please. You've, got to break them up.
This relationship is killing them.

187
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,730
I know it is,
but I've learned my lesson.

188
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:08,755
No more interfering.
Let things run their course.

189
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:11,425
- It's two-to-one.
- Yes, but the one is me.

190
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,597
We don't need her.
We can break them up on our own.

191
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,747
How?

192
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:19,948
Remember when
Robin and I were dating?

193
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:22,936
What was the one big thing that
really freaked her out?

194
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:26,805
No, no, no, no, no.
Ted, you cannot do this to me!

195
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:31,501
- What are you talking about?
- This! This is what I'm talking about.

196
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:33,322
What is this doing in my champagne?

197
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:36,538
If we make Robin think for even a second
that Barney is proposing,

198
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:39,422
- she'll lose it and they'll break up.
- That's crazy. Why don't we...

199
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:40,957
lead Barney into temptation?

200
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:42,956
We'll find a hot woman
to hit on him...

201
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,791
Okay, the ring thing.

202
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,678
- Stakeout van.
- What?

203
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:59,243
We should've gotten a stakeout van.
We could've ordered pizza,

204
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:01,440
looked through
big binoculars and said,

205
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,810
"this ain't what I signed up
for", stuff like that.

206
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:05,312
Here comes the waiter.

207
00:10:06,462 --> 00:10:08,398
- Please shut up.
- What?

208
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:10,692
I thought you said something, sorry.

209
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:18,575
Is that an engagement ring?

210
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:20,973
Are you...?

211
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:25,152
It's not me. They must have delivered it
to the wrong table.

212
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,370
Can you imagine us getting married?

213
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:31,922
Well,
we are committed to each other.

214
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:34,675
Most of your stuff
is already at my apartment.

215
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,719
- It might make taxes easier.
- It'd speed up your citizenship.

216
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,680
"Scherbatsky" is so hard to spell.

217
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:41,932
My mom would be so happy.

218
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:45,937
- I guess so.
- No reason not to.

219
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,154
- We're getting married!
- Not so loud, geez.

220
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,949
What did you do?
I am furious right now!

221
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,235
This is so wrong!

222
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,277
- Lily, will you be my maid of honor?
- My god! I would love to!

223
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,409
Are you out of your mind?!

224
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:03,829
They're playing relationship chicken,
and what did you do?

225
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:06,665
You put an engagement ring
in front of them!

226
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:08,375
Okay, that's it.

227
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:10,011
I'm taking over.

228
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,341
Coming out of retirement,

229
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,381
for one, last breakup.

230
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,861
- How are we'll do it?
- They are in so deep,

231
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:19,746
just one fight ain't going to do it.

232
00:11:19,871 --> 00:11:21,351
We need to reignite

233
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:24,599
the four biggest fights
they've ever been in all at once.

234
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,978
Number one,
the battle of the dirty dishes.

235
00:11:31,736 --> 00:11:32,646
Number two,

236
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:34,693
the ex-girlfriend conflict.

237
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:38,415
Don't you know that girl over there?

238
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,039
I don't think so.

239
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,451
In fact, I have definitely not...
It's Meg.

240
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:47,164
I am certainly not comparing you two
in my mind right now.

241
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,965
Will you get that for me?

242
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,503
- What's the problem? I'm not...
- You're embarrassing me in public.

243
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,025
Number three,

244
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,965
the <i>Star Wars</i> altercation.

245
00:11:57,313 --> 00:11:59,760
Isn't it time
you got rid of your stupid doll?

246
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:02,596
It's not a doll.
It's a stormtrooper.

247
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:04,639
He's wearing a diaper.

248
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:07,267
It's not a diaper, Robin,
it's protective armor.

249
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:09,989
Stormtrooper?
More like storm-pooper.

250
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,248
Stop it.

251
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,824
It sounds like your storm-pooper here
needs a changing.

252
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,733
- I'm sick of it, of the jokes...
- What? I didn't say anything

253
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:20,072
I cant joke?

254
00:12:20,445 --> 00:12:22,400
And of course the biggie,

255
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,364
the Canadian/American war.

256
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:27,162
Thank god, that song's over.

257
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:29,539
Who the hell
was that old lady singing?

258
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,043
You know that Neil Young
is my favorite musician.

259
00:12:33,276 --> 00:12:36,164
Right. Now, was that the same old lady
who played Archie Bunker's wife

260
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,173
in all in the family,
or just a sound-alike?

261
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:41,020
Neil Young is a Canadian treasure.

262
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:43,678
Do not make fun of Neil Young.

263
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,236
I would never make fun

264
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:48,350
of a defenseless old lady
with vocal cord paralysis...

265
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,353
- Here we go. In public? Really?
- Ever. I'll go there.

266
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,438
- What's the problem?
- Everything I say...

267
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:54,856
I got it.

268
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:58,819
We e-mail them pictures
reminding them of each of these fights.

269
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:00,338
You child.

270
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,989
Here's how it goes down.
They're at the diner...

271
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:06,671
<i>First, rekindling
the canadian-american debate,</i>

272
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,445
<i>Ontario native Alan Thicke
stops by the table.</i>

273
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,834
- Alan Thicke?
- Right.

274
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,080
Robin knew him back
when she was a singer.

275
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:19,689
And they still keep in touch.
I already got his number off her phone.

276
00:13:19,814 --> 00:13:21,713
Seriously... Amateurs.

277
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,262
<i>So Alan Thicke restarts
the Canada/U.S. Fight.</i>

278
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,557
<i>Right at that moment,
crazy Meg shows up.</i>

279
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:30,780
<i>Then, a stormtrooper happens</i>

280
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,577
<i>to walk by the window.</i>

281
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,984
<i>And just
when they can't take anything more,</i>

282
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:37,607
<i>a busboy walks by
with a tray full of what?</i>

283
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:39,715
<i>Dirty dishes.</i>

284
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:52,539
This is your masterpiece.

285
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,375
We're getting a stakeout van!

286
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:56,751
A station wagon?

287
00:13:57,251 --> 00:13:59,501
Really?
You rented a station wagon?

288
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:02,591
- A van cost, like, 25 bucks more.
- A station wagon?

289
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:06,751
Greetings, Will Robinson!

290
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,638
Where's the birthday boy or girl?

291
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:10,217
Climb on in.

292
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:11,683
What is this?

293
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:13,795
They didn't have any stormtroopers,

294
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,021
so I get a different robot.
This'll still work.

295
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:17,491
Different robot?

296
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:19,316
Stormtroopers aren't robots.

297
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:22,819
Of course they're robots!
"Must kill Luke Skywalker."

298
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,531
- Nobody says that in <i>Star Wars</i> at all.
- That's a really lousy robot voice.

299
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:28,533
Someone order
an extra large sausage?

300
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:31,536
One of Barney's videos
starts off just like that.

301
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,001
Barney's ordering...

302
00:14:33,126 --> 00:14:34,414
five of something.

303
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,389
- I don't know if it'll fit.
- Now you're just quoting the video.

304
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:38,526
Still ordering.

305
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:42,422
- Waiter's taking out a second pad.
- We need it. We're on a stakeout.

306
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:46,218
- Shouldn't you be in a van?
- A van cost more.

307
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,375
Score me a slice, Will Robinson!

308
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,904
You get a stain on that costume,
they're gonna charge us.

309
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:53,183
Dude,
will you just chill about money?

310
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,464
- Let the stormtrooper have a slice.
- It's not a stormtrooper!

311
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:00,857
Sorry I'm late.
I was looking for a van.

312
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,629
- Thank you!
- $25!

313
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,420
- So should I go say hi to Robin?
- Not yet, get in the car.

314
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,280
So wait, wait, wait.

315
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,567
When they blew up the Death Star,

316
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:12,284
knowing full well there're
thousands of stormtroopers on it,

317
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:13,495
those were people?

318
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,205
It was called the Death Star.

319
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,954
They knew what they're getting into.

320
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:19,443
I don't want to play
the "I'm Alan Thicke" card,

321
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:21,595
but I really do have a dinner
to get to, so...

322
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,505
Someone has got
to take this sausage!

323
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,424
Were you in that video?
Were you the guy with the farmer tan?

324
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,939
Jonesin' for some'za, Will Robinson!

325
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:30,814
Come on, I'm Alan Thicke!

326
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,597
This ain't what I signed up for.

327
00:15:33,153 --> 00:15:34,152
You know what?

328
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,392
Everyone, stop!

329
00:15:35,564 --> 00:15:38,478
Alan Thicke, shut up!
It's a station wagon. Get over it!

330
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,336
Ted, stop talking about porn!

331
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,650
And for the love of god,
somebody get the stormtrooper pizza!

332
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,235
It's not a stormtrooper!

333
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:46,278
Crap!

334
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:49,287
They see us!

335
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:50,212
Danger!

336
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:51,337
Danger!

337
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,207
Are you sure they saw us?

338
00:16:01,148 --> 00:16:03,718
Can I go talk to Barney now?
I'm so excited!

339
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:06,089
Do you really think
he's going to propose to me?

340
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,217
Forget it, we've been made.

341
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,114
If we try anything,
they'll know it's us.

342
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,846
I think
we should all just go home...

343
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,833
This is my masterpiece.

344
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,601
So what if they saw us?
It'll still work.

345
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,082
- Stop. We'll think of something else.
- Let me repeat,

346
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:21,605
"I am Alan Thicke".

347
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:24,065
You're Alan Thicke?!

348
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,361
Alan Thicke, you're up.
Get on out there.

349
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:31,740
<i>And so,
Lily followed through with her plan.</i>

350
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:34,295
<i>First, Alan Thicke.</i>

351
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:36,994
<i>Followed by crazy Meg.</i>

352
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:39,306
<i>Then, the robot.</i>

353
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:42,779
<i>And finally, the dirty dishes.</i>

354
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:47,439
<i>But by the end of it...</i>

355
00:16:49,336 --> 00:16:51,582
They're kissing?
They shouldn't be kissing!

356
00:16:51,707 --> 00:16:53,053
Why isn't this working?

357
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:54,721
Because they're in love.

358
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,100
It really was just a rough patch.

359
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,228
What the hell am I doing?

360
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,399
This whole thing was a mistake.

361
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:10,918
So, any of you dudes
want to get high?

362
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,533
I never thought
I'd be saying this tonight, but...

363
00:17:15,898 --> 00:17:17,661
To Barney and Robin,
the happy couple.

364
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:20,620
<i>That was the moment we learned</i>

365
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,524
<i>that relationships take hard work,</i>

366
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:24,703
<i>but eventually,
everything will work out.</i>

367
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:26,703
Where's Barney?

368
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:28,296
We broke up.

369
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,820
<i>And that was the moment
we unlearned that other lesson</i>

370
00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:32,836
<i>we had just learned
a few seconds earlier.</i>

371
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:35,523
<i>You see, earlier that night,
when Lily thought</i>

372
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,456
<i>Barney and Robin had spotted her,</i>

373
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:39,182
<i>this is what they really saw.</i>

374
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:45,039
Why do that fat guy
and old lady keep sta...?

375
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,031
My god. That's us!

376
00:17:51,141 --> 00:17:52,270
Look at us.

377
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,322
Did we always look this awful?

378
00:17:57,018 --> 00:17:58,568
Robin, I'm not happy.

379
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,832
I mean, I wish I was.

380
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:03,596
Nothing would make me happier
than being happy, but...

381
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,331
I'm not.

382
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:08,837
What are we doing wrong?
We love each other.

383
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,684
If this doesn't work, what will?

384
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:13,347
We're so similar.

385
00:18:13,722 --> 00:18:15,927
We both like scotch.
We're both awesome.

386
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:17,818
You know, maybe that's it.

387
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:19,806
Maybe there's just
too much awesome here.

388
00:18:20,395 --> 00:18:21,395
Exactly.

389
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:24,021
Two awesomes cancel each other out,

390
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:27,569
and I'm tired
of being cancelled out.

391
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:29,133
Me, too.

392
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:33,153
Are we breaking up?

393
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:35,071
I think so.

394
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:38,456
Crap.

395
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:40,805
Now comes the next part.

396
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:44,330
The part where you and I
can't go back to being friends.

397
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:47,883
Well, maybe this isn't a breakup.

398
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:50,568
Maybe this is...

399
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:52,376
two friends...

400
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:54,340
getting back together.

401
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:02,919
It's always so great
to see a fellow hoser.

402
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,896
Good news! I forgive you
for the whole restraing order thing.

403
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,983
Is that a stormtrooper?

404
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,435
That's not a stormtr...

405
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,460
You want to get out of here?

406
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:17,549
See you guys.

407
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,157
See you, Alan.

408
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:23,047
So you still on 73rd Street?

409
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:25,196
How do you know that?

410
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:28,293
Getting back together

411
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,512
as friends...

412
00:19:29,637 --> 00:19:30,585
I like that.

413
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,462
One more for the road?

414
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:40,892
And who knows?

415
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:43,890
Maybe, when, like, you turn 40,
if you haven't found anyone...

416
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,820
I already have that deal with Ted.

417
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:47,434
Right. Stupid.

418
00:19:48,411 --> 00:19:50,173
Well, maybe when you turn 39,

419
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,992
if you haven't found anyone...

420
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:56,486
<i>It turns out that they really did need
to let things run their course.</i>

421
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:58,919
So, how's Barney doing?

422
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,580
He's okay, I think.

423
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:03,140
It might be awhile
before he fully recovers, but...

424
00:20:04,408 --> 00:20:06,079
Did you guys just feel a chill?

425
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:24,473
Daddy's home.

426
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:31,604
- I'm glad we could catch up.
- Let's do it again soon.

427
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,720
I love that you guys
are still friends

428
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:35,650
so long after
you did that music video.

429
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,929
The music?
The "sandcastles" video!

430
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:41,406
We did that together, too.

431
00:20:41,877 --> 00:20:43,906
- What do you mean "too"?
- We had this...

432
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,621
failed Canadian TV variety show.

433
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,496
That was so embarrassing.

434
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,347
Imagine what would happen
if anybody ever got their hands on that?

435
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,253
You!
