1
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:03,461
Guess what I've got behind my back.

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,883
Wait, wait, wait,
I got this one. Left.

3
00:00:06,293 --> 00:00:07,993
Wrong game. But correct.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,500
Five front-row tickets

5
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,557
to <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>.

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,264
- <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers?</i>
- That is awesome!

7
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,510
- You've heard of <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>?
- Never.

8
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:21,464
We assume it's a sort of sporting event
that pits robots against wrestlers!

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,315
That's exactly what it is,
according to the Web site!

10
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,049
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:30,071
Who's the fifth ticket for?

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,930
I know,
she moved in with her boyfriend

13
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:36,950
and said she doesn't want
to hang out with us,

14
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:39,121
But this is <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>.

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,200
Barney is right.
It's impossible to say no to that.

16
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,986
No to that. I wish I could, but
I have plans with Don on Saturday.

17
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:51,342
He's making me Chinese.

18
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:55,071
I'll assume you're talking about food,
Otherwise I've some follow-up questions.

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,829
I'm sorry, but I got to give this thing
with Don a chance.

20
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:02,045
I can't do that if I'm out drinking
with you guys every single night.

21
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,147
Especially when "you guys"
includes two of my ex-boyfriends.

22
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,820
I understand.
You're right.

23
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,519
It's just we all really miss you.

24
00:01:10,297 --> 00:01:11,549
I miss you, too.

25
00:01:11,674 --> 00:01:13,668
Listen, I got to go.
Talk soon?

26
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:18,999
Sorry, New York, I had to take that.
Now, where were we?

27
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:21,017
Yeah. Yes. Bus crash.

28
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,249
She said no?

29
00:01:23,802 --> 00:01:25,174
How could she say no?

30
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:28,785
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i> is
our most important tradition as a group.

31
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,234
Tradition?
We've never done this before?

32
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:35,435
It's <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>, Lily.
How is that not gonna be a tradition?

33
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:39,025
This is how it starts.

34
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,537
First Robin moves in with Don,
then Marshall and Lily have a baby,

35
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:44,395
- Then Ted...
- Gets married?

36
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,326
I was gonna say, "is found alone
in his apartment devoured by his cats,"

37
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:49,942
but either way, not pretty.

38
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,374
Everyone's leaving me,
and I don't like it!

39
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:56,400
Barney, you don't have to worry
about Marshall and me having kids.

40
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:58,377
That's a long way down the road.

41
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:01,267
Exactly, it's down the road,
a medium way.

42
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:04,874
- A medium-long way.
- I mean, you can see it ahead.

43
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,126
In the vast, vast distance.

44
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,171
- But you're seeing exit signs for it.
- Really? I didn't see any.

45
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,339
You might want to get
in the right lane.

46
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,842
I understand how you feel.

47
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,519
Friendships are important.

48
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:18,421
In fact, Emerson wrote

49
00:02:18,546 --> 00:02:21,098
a great poem entitled "friendship."

50
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:22,933
You are gonna love this.

51
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:26,771
"A ruddy drop of manly blood,
the surging sea outweighs..."

52
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,399
<i>That's how it had
always been for me with the gang.</i>

53
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:33,611
<i>Any time I tried to get
a little high-minded.</i>

54
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:36,405
You guys,
you've got to try this Syrah.

55
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,231
Hints of creme de cassis,
red berries,

56
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:40,516
toasty oak...

57
00:02:45,478 --> 00:02:48,215
Five letters, blank baritone.

58
00:02:48,898 --> 00:02:50,942
Of course! Lyric baritone!

59
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:53,714
Which is actually higher
than a dramatic baritone.

60
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,842
You know, there's a telling moment
in the second act of <i>la Boheme</i>...

61
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,629
Guys, come on, I'm just trying to add
a little class to these proceedings.

62
00:03:03,037 --> 00:03:05,142
It's like that line
From <i>Dante's inferno</i>.

63
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,951
"Consider your origins:
you were not born to live like brutes."

64
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:13,931
"But to follow virtue
and knowledge""

65
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,195
Or...

66
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:19,119
In the original Italian...

67
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,599
Synchro: ShalimarFox, JoJo13

68
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,175
.:: www.sous-titres.eu::.

69
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:42,263
You are right. I'm totally overreacting
to this whole Robin thing.

70
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,201
What's that?
Is this a wedding invitation?

71
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:46,311
Robin's marrying Don.
I'm gonna die alone!

72
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,060
Ted's gonna get eaten by cats!

73
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,063
Relax, it's for Marissa Heller.

74
00:03:51,257 --> 00:03:52,982
Marissa Heller?
She sounds hot.

75
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,979
Face, boobs, describe.
Start with boobs.

76
00:03:56,374 --> 00:03:57,843
<i>Who was Marissa Heller?</i>

77
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:01,490
<i>That mystery began
when Marshall and I first moved in.</i>

78
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:04,326
We got our first mail delivery!

79
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:06,396
We are popular.

80
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:09,141
We've got a golf magazine for...

81
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:14,003
We've got a wicker
furniture catalog, also for her,

82
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:18,116
And... a coupon for a bird store...

83
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,285
addressed to Marissa Heller or
stay with me...

84
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,929
"Current occupant." That's us!

85
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,032
- We've got mail!
- Fantastic!

86
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,926
She must be the woman
who lived here before us.

87
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:31,960
I wonder what she was like.

88
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,416
<i>And just like that,
a picture began to take shape...</i>

89
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:40,395
<i>a picture of Marissa Heller,
the golfer...</i>

90
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:45,618
<i>... Marissa Heller,
the wicker catalog shopper...</i>

91
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:49,444
<i>Marissa Heller, the bird owner.</i>

92
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:53,566
And since then, with each
piece of mail we've gotten,

93
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:55,336
the picture's become
a little clearer.

94
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:58,360
The only thing we don't know
is what she looks like.

95
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,925
I guess I'll forward this along
like I've been forwarding...

96
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,721
- Just open it.
- Okay.

97
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:07,444
It's an invitation
to Jefferson Van Smoot's

98
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:10,059
annual spring social
this Saturday night...

99
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:12,133
In the penthouse apartment
of the Alberta!

100
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:14,757
You guys... That's the most
beautiful building in Manhattan!

101
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,273
We got to go to this party.

102
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,489
That depends, does it say
anything on that invitation

103
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:21,654
about robots battling wrestlers
for intergalactic supremacy?

104
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,197
No, but it says open bar.

105
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,449
Revised agenda for Saturday night:

106
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,911
free booze at Marissa Heller's party,
then <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>.

107
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,199
One of us just needs to pretend
to be Marissa Heller.

108
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,921
Guys, I'm flattered,
but I think Lily should do it.

109
00:05:40,384 --> 00:05:42,062
<i>So the big night arrived.</i>

110
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:43,537
<i>Our first stop...</i>

111
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:45,737
<i>The Alberta building.</i>

112
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,666
This building is amazing!

113
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:52,142
Did you guys see the Porte Cochere
and the Terra-cotta pandrels outside?

114
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,031
I just got a text from Robin.
It says...

115
00:05:57,892 --> 00:05:59,492
Okay, guys, huddle up.

116
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:01,846
Now, Lil, you can do this,
all you have to do

117
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:04,326
is look that guy in the eye,
say your name is Marissa Heller,

118
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:07,449
and we are golden. And again,
just so we're clear, no accent.

119
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:10,119
Are we sure
she's not British, isn't it?

120
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:13,038
All right! Here I go.

121
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:17,080
Sorry.

122
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:18,111
Go ahead.

123
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:20,004
I'm here for the Van Smoot party.

124
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,147
My name is Marissa Heller.

125
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:25,508
Bollocks.

126
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:31,807
So that's Marissa Heller.

127
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,666
<i>She fine.</i>

128
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,324
Her teeth look really nice.
She must be remembering

129
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:40,890
to go to the dentist even without those
reminder postcards.

130
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,651
So, what are we doing?

131
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,986
I'm getting us into
the party, that's what!

132
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,382
We met at that gathering for...

133
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:52,661
bird owners.

134
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:54,246
I don't think so.

135
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,373
- Wicker lovers?
- No.

136
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,256
Stinson out.
Guys, it's not gonna happen.

137
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:00,711
I got this.

138
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:06,329
You know, this elevator
still uses the same mechanism

139
00:07:06,454 --> 00:07:08,510
from when it was first
installed in 1906.

140
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:10,132
Rumor is,

141
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:12,644
Louis Lamar Skolnick, the architect who
designed this building,

142
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:14,141
carved these panels himself.

143
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:15,684
A Skolnick fan?

144
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:18,001
I love his juxtaposition between

145
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:20,022
the north German
renaissance exterior...

146
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,941
And the decidedly French
influence on the inside! I know!

147
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:26,236
He was an architect
with the soul of a poet, really.

148
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,952
No, no, no, don't, don't.
It's working.

149
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:30,449
I've a confession to make.

150
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,045
We're not on the guest list,

151
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,329
but... I've always wanted to see
the inside of the Alberta.

152
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,485
Well, then right this way.

153
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,289
We're all together.

154
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:44,213
Told you I'd get us in.

155
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:47,876
So...

156
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:50,995
Anyone been watching
<i>the young and the restless</i>?

157
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:56,600
Awesome! Who ordered
soap opera illustrated?

158
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,222
Marissa Heller, I like your style.

159
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,982
Anyone?

160
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,462
Am I to understand that there isn't

161
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:12,241
a single soap opera fan
in this entire elevator?

162
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:14,769
I don't own a TV.

163
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,767
The only operas I watch
are at the met.

164
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:24,609
Dibs.

165
00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:29,465
Excuse me.

166
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,040
Jefferson, darling.

167
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:38,533
I am not dressed for this.

168
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:40,709
One word, made up:

169
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:42,521
"douche-pocalypse""

170
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,940
Guys...
That's Peter Bogdanovich

171
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:47,808
Talking to Arianna Huffington
and Will Shortz,

172
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,869
editor of the New
York times crossword!

173
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:52,630
Let's give this party a chance.
There's free food, free booze.

174
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:54,755
20 minutes, then we can leave.

175
00:08:55,407 --> 00:08:57,661
But, you see, music was changing,

176
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,256
and Giovanni Artusi
simply didn't understand

177
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:02,457
the new style of composing.

178
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,982
Excuse me, are you
talking about Monteverdi

179
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:06,837
and his fourth book of madrigals?

180
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,463
My dear chap, what else?

181
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,675
That's my favorite
book of madrigals!

182
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:14,483
Smoked Foie gras

183
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:17,306
with caramelized mango
and crème fraiche?

184
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:21,059
Do you have anything in the
mini cheeseburger department?

185
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:23,560
I don't think so, sir.

186
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,453
Mini pizzas?
Little cups of fries?

187
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:28,692
Any food at all
that'll make me feel like a giant?

188
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:30,718
I'll check, sir.

189
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:35,559
He's not gonna check.

190
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:39,690
I'm performing open-heart surgery
on the Dutch ambassador in the morning.

191
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:41,622
I hope he pulls through.

192
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:42,925
Really?

193
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,001
A colleague of mine
just prescribed cumadin to him.

194
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:48,823
And there's no way
she'd be on anticoagulants

195
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:51,006
If she were about
to undergo surgery.

196
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:53,635
Just...

197
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,347
You know who published
a great article

198
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:00,434
on Walt Whitman
and the politics of semantics?

199
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,226
Professor Hammersmith of Oxford.

200
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,353
I am Professor Hammersmith.

201
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,024
Which is exactly what Truffaut
was talking about

202
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,735
In his 1954 article
in <i>Cahiers Du Cinéma.</i>

203
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,804
Film is an auteur's medium
full stop.

204
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:18,700
Movies...

205
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:20,012
Right?

206
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:21,433
Actors.

207
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,227
Willem Dafoe.

208
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:28,401
Funny thing about Willem Dafoe,
his name

209
00:10:28,724 --> 00:10:30,555
kind of sounds like a frog...

210
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:32,511
Talking to a parrot.

211
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:34,737
Willem.

212
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:35,862
Defoe!

213
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,264
As undersecretary of the treasury,

214
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:47,971
I had a big hand in crafting
that legislation.

215
00:10:48,229 --> 00:10:49,147
Now...

216
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:51,650
I wonder If you'd like to join me
in the map room

217
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,599
and give my package some stimulus.

218
00:10:55,642 --> 00:10:58,759
I'm afraid not, darling.
You are too old for my taste.

219
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:04,413
Zsa Zsa Gabor is still looking
pretty hot, but otherwise,

220
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,669
this party sucks.

221
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:08,399
Yeah, we gave it a chance.
It's been 20 minutes.

222
00:11:08,524 --> 00:11:10,168
Let's get out of here. Where's Ted?

223
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:12,232
I know how to find him.

224
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,875
Gongs, right?

225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,469
Louder than you think.

226
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:25,969
Young man,

227
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:28,926
that gong is a 500-year-old relic

228
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:32,746
that hasn't been struck
since W.S. Gilbert hit it

229
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:36,445
at the London premiere
of the Mikado in 1885.

230
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:42,538
Wife is a 500 year relic that hasn't
been struck since W.S. Gilbert hit it

231
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:44,939
at the London premiere
of the Mikado in 1885.

232
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,760
Will Schorz, editor
of the<i> Times' crossword.</i>

233
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:51,701
You know how I've been saying
they always use ulee from Ulee's gold

234
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:53,740
because of the vowels?
Tell 'em, will.

235
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:55,756
It's because of the vowels.

236
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:58,002
Ted, can I talk to you?

237
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:01,219
Ten-letter-word
for diminutive egg-based torte?

238
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,641
Mini-quiche?
Where?

239
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:03,826
Right there.

240
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:06,977
Such a great party.
Such a Great party!

241
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:10,312
Yeah, totally, Ted. It's time to go.
It's Robots vs. Wrestlers o'clock.

242
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:12,462
There you are.

243
00:12:12,587 --> 00:12:15,150
We'll be blind taste-testing
French whites in a bit.

244
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,860
Should be a hoot and a half.

245
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:19,501
Well, I decan't miss that.

246
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:26,203
I know. You don't have to say it.
You don't decant white wine.

247
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,956
Miss Lily in the living room
with the candlestick.

248
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,373
My heavens, no!

249
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,976
- That was Edgar Allan Poe's!
- Sorry!

250
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:41,301
I'm having fun here, so I think
I'm gonna skip<i> Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>

251
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,847
But Ted, you've never missed
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers!</i>

252
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:53,811
Ted, this isn't happening.

253
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:56,213
First Robin ditches us, and now you?

254
00:12:56,494 --> 00:12:59,111
And for these stuffy,
pretentious snoots?

255
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,693
Actually, I kind of like these stuffy,
pretentious snoots.

256
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:03,907
They don't make fart noises
when I open my mouth.

257
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,561
I'm going to stay.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

258
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,205
- Come on. It's just one night.
- It doesn't mean anything.

259
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:13,526
It means everything.
Ted, if you don't come

260
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:15,301
to <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers,</i>

261
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:17,087
it's the end of our friendship.

262
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,548
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

263
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:20,823
Fine.

264
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:23,655
Then you are out
of our gang forever.

265
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:26,352
You can reapply in two years.

266
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,519
Let's go watch
<i>Wrestlers fight robots.</i>

267
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,988
So embarrassing.
I forgot something.

268
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:53,290
So Ted, where did those chums
of yours scoot off to?

269
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:55,544
You know.

270
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:56,710
Poetry reading.

271
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:02,901
Best tradition ever!

272
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:05,093
Don't humor me, Marshall.

273
00:14:05,503 --> 00:14:07,565
Let's face it.
The gang is over.

274
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:11,683
Ted's gone. Robin's gone. We might
as well just go our separate ways.

275
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:14,585
Barney, enough
with a abandonment issues.

276
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,689
Ted's allowed to have a life
outside of the group. We all are.

277
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,492
Wait a minute.

278
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:21,738
Why are you saying
that all of a sudden?

279
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:24,070
God, you're pregnant!

280
00:14:25,512 --> 00:14:27,616
God, you already had the baby!

281
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:30,425
It's right behind me, isn't it?

282
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,546
No, you idiot.
It's just,

283
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:35,019
eventually, we're all gonna move on.

284
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,245
It's called growing up.

285
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:40,003
<i>Is that all you got, bitch?</i>

286
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:43,048
Can you at least promise me that
you won't get pregnant for another year?

287
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:45,390
- I can't make that promise.
- You can't?

288
00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:46,515
You can't?

289
00:14:54,323 --> 00:14:55,330
Citrus

290
00:14:55,455 --> 00:14:58,119
and honeycomb flavors
with crisp acidity.

291
00:14:58,795 --> 00:15:00,916
It's a Sauv blanc, Loire valley.

292
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,193
Town of Sancerre.

293
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,194
Correct again!

294
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,033
Bravo, boy!

295
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:10,825
You can't have kids!

296
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,828
You don't want to bring a child
into this crazy, messed-up world.

297
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,331
I don't know. The world
seems pretty awesome right now.

298
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,359
Lily, you leave me no choice.

299
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,457
If you have a daughter,

300
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:27,175
the day, nay,
the minute she turns 18...

301
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,233
Babies.

302
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,187
I hope Ted is miserable right now.

303
00:15:39,457 --> 00:15:41,168
<i>Constance fry,</i>

304
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:43,067
<i>Constance fry</i>

305
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:46,282
<i>Anytime you'd call</i>

306
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:50,254
<i>Constance would fulfill your needs</i>

307
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,195
<i>Winter, spring</i>

308
00:15:53,488 --> 00:15:55,366
<i>Or fall</i>

309
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:03,637
Ted, your lyric baritone
is outstanding.

310
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,700
Thank you, Will Shortz.

311
00:16:09,138 --> 00:16:11,219
Fine, you guys can have a baby,

312
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:16,891
One: You promise to always love me
more than the baby

313
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:18,602
Two:

314
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,895
Once a month,
I get to use the baby to pick up chick.

315
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:22,230
Three:

316
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,421
that may involve

317
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:26,151
the baby falling from a two-story window
and me heroically catching it.

318
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,736
Four:

319
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,362
No breastfeeding in front of me.

320
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,699
Five: Forget about four.
You can whip them out whenever you want.

321
00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:35,433
<i>And then,
something amazing happened.</i>

322
00:16:38,235 --> 00:16:39,623
Holy crap!

323
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,012
I don't believe it.

324
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,667
Of course, hell
is an interesting concept, isn't it?

325
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:48,292
I've always loved to imagine it

326
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:50,694
as Dante did in the divine comedy.

327
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:53,014
If you'll allow me.

328
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:54,596
In the original Italian.

329
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,525
<i>I cannot believe this.</i>

330
00:17:06,853 --> 00:17:08,704
<i>I'm reciting the divine comedy</i>

331
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,405
<i>In its original Italian,
and nobody's making fart noises!</i>

332
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,328
<i>This is weird.
Never gotten this far.</i>

333
00:17:20,768 --> 00:17:22,791
<i>I actually sound kind of douchey.</i>

334
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:27,752
<i>My God, I'm out of control!</i>

335
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:30,260
<i>Listen to me.
I'm completely unleashed.</i>

336
00:17:30,722 --> 00:17:32,676
<i>I'm the biggest douche
on the planet.</i>

337
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:42,778
<i>I wish somebody would stop me.</i>

338
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,646
<i>And then, somebody did.</i>

339
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:51,040
<i>Kids, I think I told you
how earlier that year,</i>

340
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:53,697
<i>we had seen some doppelgangers
of ourselves around town.</i>

341
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,079
<i>There was lesbian Robin.</i>

342
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:00,512
<i>There was moustache Marshall.</i>

343
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:03,581
<i>And, of course, stripper Lily.</i>

344
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:06,501
<i>That night,</i>

345
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,920
<i>One more doppelganger surfaced...</i>

346
00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:11,106
<i>Mexican wrestler Ted.</i>

347
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,867
<i>Soy el conquistador de las máquinas!</i>

348
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:30,057
I got to go.

349
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:35,588
Rule number 83.

350
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:39,688
If anything that comes out of that baby
gets on one of my suits,

351
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:41,378
I get to touch Lily's boobs.

352
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:44,190
What is it with you
and my wife's boobs tonight?

353
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:46,065
I don't make the rules.

354
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:50,545
Baby, are you really starting
to think about this?

355
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:52,206
I don't know.

356
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:53,715
Maybe a little.

357
00:18:55,757 --> 00:18:57,719
For whatever it's worth,
I think that we're ready.

358
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:00,518
We love each other,
we're financially stable,

359
00:19:00,643 --> 00:19:03,518
and honestly, I don't think It would
change our lifestyle all that much.

360
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,760
<i>Aunt Lily still likes to remind
uncle Marshall he once said this.</i>

361
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,151
If we were at home
with a baby tonight,

362
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:11,274
we never would have seen
Ted's doppelganger.

363
00:19:11,635 --> 00:19:13,818
Imagine missing that.
How would that feel?

364
00:19:14,248 --> 00:19:16,237
I would blame that child
for the rest of his life.

365
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,573
Exactly.
For the rest of her life.

366
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:23,119
You're right.
There's, there's no hurry.

367
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:24,983
How about this?

368
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:27,140
We agree there's no sense
in having a baby

369
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:29,584
until we've seen all five doppelgangers,
right?

370
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,393
Of course. Stands to reason.

371
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,265
So when we finally see
Barney's doppelganger,

372
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,725
that's the universe telling us
it's go time.

373
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:39,260
And that's when we'll start trying.
Deal?

374
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:41,221
Deal.

375
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,814
Well, well,

376
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:47,568
look who thinks
he can just waltz in here

377
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:49,326
and be part of the gang again.

378
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:52,106
- Well, you can forget it.
- Listen, Barney, I...

379
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,845
Please be part of the gang again!

380
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,361
I don't want to lose anyone else!
We're all really sorry.

381
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,892
We'll even let you recite
all the douchey poems you want,

382
00:19:59,017 --> 00:20:01,825
and we'll never, never say
a bad thing about it, I promise.

383
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:02,829
Really?

384
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:05,495
Because there actually
is a poem I'd like to recite.

385
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:08,126
"Friendship" by Ralph Waldo Emerson.

386
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:10,657
"A ruddy drop of manly blood,

387
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:12,661
"The surging sea outweighs.

388
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:14,712
"The world uncertain comes
and goes..."

389
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:18,800
Sorry. Someone had to do that.

390
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:22,001
- Who wants another drink? I'm buying.
- <i>Kids,</i>

391
00:20:22,126 --> 00:20:25,032
<i>I'd love to tell you that over years,
we didn't all drift apart a little</i>

392
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,079
<i>at one time or another. You don't mean
for it to happen,</i>

393
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,477
<i>but it does.</i>

394
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,255
<i>But no matter what, to this day,</i>

395
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,259
<i>Come hell or high water,</i>

396
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:38,185
<i>we still all get together every year
for Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>

397
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:45,422
Good night! Thanks a lot.
I had a great time.
