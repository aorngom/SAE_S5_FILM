1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,200
Hey.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,100
Jack Gallagher.

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,800
On and off. Where's Hank?
- That way.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,200
Ok, tomorrow.
We'll have a room ready.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,000
Same as last time.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,290
Ok, he's here.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,100
How long has he been up there?

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,990
Going nine hours.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,490
Leonard Steinberg -

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,390
He checked in this morning
for a hernia operation.

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,090
Nine hours? Food, water?
A bathroom break?

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,990
Just stands there on the edge,
looking down,

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,890
Threatening to jump
if anyone comes close.

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,900
Uh-Huh.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,290
Police negotiator's
getting so frustrated

16
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,090
He's about to
push him off himself.

17
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,390
I called you hoping
for a little magic.

18
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,600
Nine hours. Tommy!

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,790
Yes, Dr. Gallagher?

20
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,790
Do me a favor,
will you?

21
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,990
Call Mort's deli for me
and order, uh -

22
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,390
Order a sky-high pastrami
sandwich, lean, on rye,

23
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,490
With some new pickles,
and rush the delivery.

24
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,000
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,990
Make that two sky-highs and
a couple of deli cream sodas.

26
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,690
Money's in my desk.
Thanks, Tommy.

27
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,300
There's no rush.
Plenty of time for a snack.

28
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,500
Hank, push the button.

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,490
You want to see me
go splat?!

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,490
Take another step,
dumb cop!

31
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,090
Mr. Steinberg, at least let us
get you some dry clothes.

32
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,890
Come on, a little closer!

33
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,390
See the middle-aged Jew
take his first flying lesson!

34
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,690
Sir, you don't
want to do this.

35
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,800
You want to bet, grandpa?
I'll even give you odds!

36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,990
Who's this clown?

37
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,200
Gallagher, head shrink.

38
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,800
Wow.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,700
Nice night for it.

40
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,690
You think you're gonna
talk me down.

41
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,400
Wouldn't even consider it.

42
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,900
Everyone's got a right
to die, Leonard.

43
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,000
News choppers were here earlier
before the weather blew in.

44
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,190
Sorry I missed it.

45
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,790
My family show up?

46
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,100
No idea.

47
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,400
"No chance"
is more like it.

48
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,590
Is that a new pickle?

49
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,590
Uh-Huh.

50
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,700
I could tell
from the crunch.

51
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,500
Mmm.

52
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,500
Man, that's good.

53
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,590
From mort's?

54
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,600
Where else?

55
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,390
Cole slaw or potato salad?

56
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,200
Neither. I'm watching
my cholesterol.

57
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,100
Me too!

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,300
Good one.

59
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,100
I'm kind of hungry.

60
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,700
Hey, you want some?

61
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,690
How come you're not trying
to reason with me?

62
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,190
Don't you have some medical
ethics or code or something?

63
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,400
Situation like this?
Kind of a gray area, Leonard.

64
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,300
You're weird.

65
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,600
Got to be to work
in a place like this.

66
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Yeah, sure.
What the hell.

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,700
Catch.
Wha-

68
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,500
Gah!

69
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,390
You did that on purpose!

70
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,090
Who in their right mind would
toss a perfectly good sky-high

71
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,900
off a nine-story building?

72
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,790
Gone for good.

73
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,000
Splat.

74
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,400
Hey, I've got another one.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,590
This time, how about
I hand it to you?

76
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,890
Oh, I get it!

77
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,200
Of course you do.

78
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,300
I've got another soda, too,
and a pickle.

79
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,700
The new ones are the best.

80
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,300
It's supposed to rain
again tomorrow.

81
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,590
No chance.

82
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,900
You want to bet?

83
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,900
I guess I could
hold off a day.

84
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,500
It's your choice.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
My choice.

86
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Okay, sir.

87
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,400
Easy.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,690
You're some
piece of work.

89
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,600
Well, we all
are, Leonard.

90
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,890
I recommend it.

91
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,800
What?

92
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,100
Life.

95
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,390
Fong is out
with the flu. Still?

96
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,490
Mm-Hmm. Body aches,
congestion, temp of 103.

97
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,990
You know, I offered to go to her
place and rub hot oil on her chest,

98
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,090
But for some reason,
she declined.

99
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,390
Maybe you were too subtle.

100
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,390
You think? When's Dr. Belle
back from Australia?

101
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,690
It's a two-week conference.
What about Dr. Mayberry?

102
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,000
His wife's birthday.

103
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,290
Dr. Sunn?

104
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,800
Also the flu.

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,490
I guess we're gonna
have to call off the game.

106
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,700
Not yet. Malcolm says he's got
a few ideas he's working on.

107
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,690
Hey.
Hey.

108
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,690
You working a double?
Uh, yeah, everybody's got the flu.

109
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,590
I feel great.
What's up?

110
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,490
Uh, we got a poker game we
organize about once a month -

111
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,790
People from the ward.

112
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,500
There's an opening
if you're interested.

113
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,190
When?
Tomorrow night.

114
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,900
It's just for laughs, you know,
cool off from work - Friendly.

115
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,000
Friendly? How friendly?
Who's coming?

116
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,390
It's me, uh, Dr. Jones,
Dr. Suarez, a couple of others.

117
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,490
All right, why not?
Where's it at?

118
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,900
Your place, 8:00.

119
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,890
we rotate hosts.

120
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,990
Uh-huh.

121
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,990
Sandwiches, drinks, and
something sweet, if that's cool.

122
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,190
Sure.

123
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,500
Great.
I'll tell everybody.

124
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,800
Suckered again.

125
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,900
Ms. Crane.

126
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,800
I'm Dr. Gallagher.

127
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,490
I'm - I'm looking
for Dr. Howard.

128
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,890
We have a deposition scheduled
for this morning.

129
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,700
Actually, the deposition
is with me.

130
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,800
What?
I'm filling in.

131
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,500
yeah, I don't think so.

132
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,790
Marcie Crane. I need to speak
to judge latimer immediately.

133
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,900
Yeah, I'll hold.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,200
Excuse me.

135
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,090
I don't know what you and
the public defender's office

136
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,590
Are trying to pull, but
I'm here to depose Dr. Howard

137
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,390
Regarding his memorandum
to the court in the matter of -

138
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,400
Trey Hansen, charged
with first-degree murder.

139
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,090
I wrote the memorandum,
not Dr. Howard.

140
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,990
You did?

141
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,100
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,000
I assumed
you'd read my report.

143
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,990
Uh, of course
I read it.

144
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,790
Great. You're
the court reporter?

145
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,300
Yes, I am.

146
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,000
You ladies
like to follow me?

147
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,800
I'm sorry
for all the confusion.

148
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,390
Dr. Howard
was originally retained

149
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,990
By the public defender's office,
but he became unavailable.

150
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,990
So I stepped in.

151
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,690
Mr. Hansen
is a patient of yours?

152
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,990
Yes, yes, he is.

153
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,100
He's currently undergoing
treatment for his condition.

154
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,790
I'm sure he is.

155
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,790
This is some kind of crusade
for you, isn't it, doctor -

156
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,190
Save the innocent patient
from the clutches of the law?

157
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,790
Prosecutor or not,
Ms. Crane,

158
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,490
Shouldn't this be a crusade
for you, too,

159
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,600
as a representative
of the state?

160
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,490
Except that
your innocent patient

161
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,900
murdered another
human being.

162
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,300
Allegedly.

163
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,890
Marcie, Lynn Conivar,
PD.'s office.

164
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,500
We've met at several
bar functions.

165
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,700
Of course, Lynn.
Nice to see you again.

166
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,500
You don't remember me,
do you?

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,500
Sorry. No.

168
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,190
If I could have a moment

169
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,090
To review Dr. Gallagher's
memorandum?

170
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,300
No problem.

171
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,800
Can I offer anyone
anything to drink?

172
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,090
Tea? Coffee?
Pint of blood?

173
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,090
No, thank you.

174
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,500
I'm fine.

175
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,890
I, um, think
we're ready.

176
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,690
No objection.

177
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,990
I'd like to state first,
for the record,

178
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,390
That this deposition
is being held

179
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,390
At wharton memorial hospital

180
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,600
Per the defense and
so ordered by the court.

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,200
Noted.

182
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,590
Dr. Gallagher, when is the first
time you met Trey Hansen?

183
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,590
15 days ago.

184
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,800
So, approximately nine months
after the murder of Andrew Wohl?

185
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,790
That's correct.

186
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,790
In general, is nine months
sufficient time

187
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,890
For a psychiatric patient's
mental state

188
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,690
To change significantly,
for better or worse?

189
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,790
In general, yes.

190
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,990
So, the memorandum
that you prepared

191
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,190
describes Trey Hansen's
current mental state,

192
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,290
rather than any mental state that may
or may not have existed

193
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,390
on the day
the crime occurred.

194
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,290
Certain characteristics
wouldn't have changed.

195
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,690
Yes-or-No question,
doctor. It's "yes" and "no. "

196
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,290
Meaning that your report
may or may not be valid.

197
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:18,990
Objection.

198
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,300
Dr. Gallagher, what is
Trey Hansen's I.Q.?

199
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,490
I didn't conduct
those tests.

200
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,700
But you're familiar
with the results.

201
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,090
It's around 75.

202
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,090
Low.
Below average.

203
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,700
Is Trey Hansen capable of
distinguishing right from wrong?

204
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,190
Yes.

205
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,690
Is he capable
of understanding

206
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,890
The consequences of his actions,
cause and effect -

207
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,090
For example, the cause of
his running a sharp knife

208
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,290
across the throat
of Andrew Wohl

209
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,490
And the effect of Mr. Wohl

210
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,890
bleeding to death
within minutes?

211
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,790
Objection.

212
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,000
Trey Hansen understands
cause and effect.

213
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Thank you.

214
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,590
I'd like to direct
your attention now

215
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,590
To paragraph two

216
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,700
Of your very
imaginative report.

217
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,000
That concludes
my questions.

218
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,500
Well, that wasn't
too terrible.

219
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,200
It gets worse.

220
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,090
May we talk in private?

221
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,100
Of course. I'd like
Dr. Gallagher to stay.

222
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,190
This is my best offer -

223
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,190
Voluntary manslaughter,
15 to 20,

224
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,100
based on the retardation.

225
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,390
My client is innocent
of any crime.

226
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,500
Going...

227
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,700
...gone.

228
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,200
I'll see you in court.

229
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,290
I can't believe it.

230
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,790
Did we just break through?

231
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,590
Too soon to tell.

232
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,700
But it's definitely
a new wrinkle.

233
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,790
Anyone drop by to see him?

234
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,790
I called his ex-wife and kids,
told them he was here.

235
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,290
No takers.
Medication?

236
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,600
Haldol, Ativan, Cogentin -
5, 2, 1.

237
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,990
That should have
calmed him down.

238
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,590
Oh... he told me he knew

239
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,990
how to swallow his tongue
and suffocate.

240
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,600
That's a myth, isn't it?

241
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,600
Unless he bites
it off first.

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,890
How do you feel about
dying today, Leonard?

243
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,990
Thinking about it.

244
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,490
Any particular reason?

245
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,490
Well, I sure screwed up
my life pretty bad.

246
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,690
That's a fact.

247
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,690
And then there's the 56k
as of yesterday.

248
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,100
What happened yesterday?

249
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,890
No way the Cubs
lose that game!

250
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,390
Garza on the mound, Robinson
on a 16-game hitting streak,

251
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,390
St. Louis in the cellar -
No way!

252
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,490
Throwing error in the 9th.
Two runs scored.

253
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,790
Just my stinking,
rotten luck.

254
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,100
Wait a second.

255
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,290
You bet 56k
on a baseball game?

256
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,590
25.

257
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,990
Would have put me square
with Jimmy

258
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,990
And paid for
the hernia operation.

259
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,390
Now I'm dead meat.

260
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,700
Jimmy's your bookie?

261
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,290
He does this thing
with a ball peen hammer.

262
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,490
Then he throws you
off a freeway overpass.

263
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,090
And you figured
you'd skip step one.

264
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,990
Ah, you don't want
to kill yourself, Leonard.

265
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,390
How do you know?

266
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,390
You enjoy a good
pastrami sandwich too much.

267
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,190
It's not like I've got
other options here.

268
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,200
I'm tapped out,
asset-Free.

269
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,990
Cpa in another life.

270
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,500
Friends with money?

271
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,690
I hate pain.

272
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,900
That's very sensible,
Mr. Steinberg.

273
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,300
Leonard, supposing I wanted
to get in touch with Jimmy.

274
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,600
How would I go about it?

275
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,900
You came back, I see.

276
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,000
Dr. Gallagher.

277
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,990
The truth is,
I never really left.

278
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,590
I have another meeting across
the street in 20 minutes.

279
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,000
It was quiet here, so...

280
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,090
I have 131 messages
and e-Mails to return.

281
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,900
Wow.

282
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,200
Yeah.

283
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,300
Sorry if I broke any rules.

284
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,400
Well, you don't seem to have
done any permanent harm.

285
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,300
You know, I admire
the work you do.

286
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,990
I even admire what you're
trying to do for Trey Hansen.

287
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,700
Does that mean you're gonna
go easy on me in court?

288
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,300
Now, what did our friend
from the p. D.'S office tell you about me?

289
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,300
That you're a legend -
Unstoppable, never lose a case.

290
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,200
Destined
for great things -

291
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,500
Politics, private practice,
write your own ticket.

292
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,200
She mention my nickname?

293
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,800
"The great white. "

294
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,400
Flattering...

295
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,290
Till you stop to consider

296
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,200
It's Trey Hansen's blood
in the water.

297
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,190
It's never personal.

298
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,100
Really?

299
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,700
Come with me.

300
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,090
I shouldn't be here without
Mr. Hansen's attorney present.

301
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,690
He can't see you,
can't hear you.

302
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,900
Even so...

303
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,790
Trey Hansen lives
with his grandmother.

304
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,500
He has since he was 6.

305
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,000
I know that.

306
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,090
He works, he comes home,

307
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,490
And the two of them
cook supper together,

308
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,900
And then they watch tv.

309
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,790
Their favorite thing to do on
the weekends is go to the zoo.

310
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,300
He's terrified. He won't
last even a day in prison.

311
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,300
Now, tell me -
How is that not personal?

312
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,600
I don't make the law.

313
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,500
Whatever happened to the
victim's stolen wallet?

314
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,190
It was never found.

315
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,900
Absence of evidence
is not evidence.

316
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,100
You should have
taken the deal.

317
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,590
Your honor,
members of the jury,

318
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,590
We come here today
seeking justice.

319
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,590
The facts in this case
are brutally simple.

320
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,390
On the evening
of november 12, 2005,

321
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,890
Andrew Wohl -
Age 35, happily married,

322
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,890
With two children,
kevin, 8, and andrea, 6-

323
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,490
Entered Rock Garden - It's
a sports bar in west L.A. -

324
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,490
With the intention
of meeting two friends,

325
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,000
Having a beer, and watching
the game on the big-Screen tv.

326
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,500
You will hear testimony
from the victim's two friends,

327
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,490
Mr. Greer and Mr. Walker,

328
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,290
Describing an altercation
that occurred

329
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,100
Between Mr. Wohl and Trey Hansen
in this case...

330
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,600
How Trey Hansen went a little
overboard with his drinking...

331
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,700
Ugh!

332
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,000
...and his demeanor.

333
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,200
Don't touch me!

334
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,990
Hey, man, what is your problem, man?
Nothing.

335
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,300
I'm talking to you.

336
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,990
You will hear, as well,

337
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,300
The testimony of the bartender,
jason garcetti.

338
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,100
Ms. Crane?

339
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,800
Sorry, your honor.

340
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,590
The defendant
was subsequently ejected

341
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,990
From the rock garden by
the bartender, jason garcetti.

342
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,490
Get off, man!

343
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,400
Get off!
No, I'm not leaving!

344
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,800
Now, it should have
ended there, but it didn't.

345
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,090
About an hour later,
with the game nearly over,

346
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,890
Andrew Wohl left rock garden
and his friends

347
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,000
To return home to his family.

348
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,200
He never arrived.

349
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,990
Acting on descriptions

350
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,390
From Mr. Greer,
Mr. Walker, Mr. Garcetti,

351
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,000
And others that were present
at the rock garden that evening,

352
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,200
The police traced Trey Hansen
to his home.

353
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,890
They found there
a hooded sweatshirt and jeans

354
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,290
Stained with the victim's blood.

355
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,900
Also, they found
the murder weapon.

356
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,290
They found a diary entry
in Mr. Hansen's diary,

357
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,500
Describing the attack in detail.

358
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,900
Confronted with this evidence,

359
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,090
Mr. Hansen confessed

360
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,390
To the murder and robbery
of Andrew Wohl,

361
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,700
A confession
that was later withdrawn.

362
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,890
We come here today
seeking justice,

363
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,990
Justice for the murder
of Andrew Wohl,

364
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,390
Justice for his grief-Stricken
family and friends,

365
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,800
Justice for a heinous,
tragic crime.

366
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,990
We look to you,
members of the jury,

367
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,600
For justice.

368
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,600
Ms. Conivar,
your opening statement.

369
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,090
Is this inappropriate
contact?

370
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,100
Yes.

371
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,890
But it's not punishable

372
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,190
Unless I attempt
to influence your testimony,

373
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,790
Or you my performance.

374
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,400
Neither of which
is possible.

375
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,990
It's punishable to try.
Punishable - That's a good word.

376
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,500
That's a prosecutor's word.

377
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,190
Not right or wrong,
nor good or evil - Punishable.

378
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,190
It's how
we administer justice.

379
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,600
In your world.

380
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,800
Speaking of which,
you were brilliant.

381
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,900
See, there's no way that
you could know this, doctor,

382
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,900
But...

383
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,290
The trial's
already over.

384
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,290
And that's justice?

385
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,700
That's reality.

386
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,590
See, I have
a sympathetic victim,

387
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,790
A nervous defendant,
strong evidence, and -

388
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,200
And you never lose.

389
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,000
Someday I will.

390
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,700
Not today.

391
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,390
One question, counselor.

392
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,390
If your case
is so airtight,

393
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,900
Why did you offer a plea bargain
to the defense?

394
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,700
It couldn't be an act
of mercy, now, could it?

395
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,790
How much time do I have?

396
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,290
Prosecution witnesses
then another recess -

397
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,990
A couple of hours,
at least.

398
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,890
Okay, I'll be back in time
for my testimony.

399
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,800
I'll keep it moving along.

400
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,690
Is he in my office?

401
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,290
Hey, Jimmy brought
his bodyguard.

402
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,790
Two against two -
Fair fight.

403
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,800
Uh, you haven't seen
the bodyguard.

404
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,000
You got it?

405
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,090
Got it.

406
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,990
How much?

407
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,400
$15.95.

408
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,800
Let's go.

409
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,090
Old-fashioned sit-down

410
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,100
In a shrink's office -
That's a first.

411
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,690
Leonard Steinberg
owes you 56k.

412
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,200
Plus the vig.

413
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,490
There's no way he can pay.

414
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,500
Nice meeting you.

415
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,800
Wait.

416
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,600
In case you forgot yours.

417
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,290
This cost me $15.95.

418
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,200
It's gonna
cost you $56,000...

419
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,500
...plus the vig.

420
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,200
Lay it out for me.

421
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,890
Leonard's cut off for good.
He's out of options.

422
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,490
He's a compulsive gambler.
He needs treatment, not action.

423
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,090
I'm in the action business.

424
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,790
Give him a year
to get back on his feet.

425
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,290
Then he starts paying the
interest at a reasonable -

426
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,490
Reasonable rate.

427
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,790
Can't do it, doc.

428
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,090
Worrying about bad debts
keeps me up nights,

429
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,100
And I'm way down on sleep.

430
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,690
How many nights,
say, in a month?

431
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,690
Why?

432
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,200
How many hours sleep would you
say you average on a night?

433
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,490
Three, four.

434
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,490
Three or four? That's not
enough. You need at least six.

435
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,790
Sleep disorder is among the most
common psychological problems

436
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,790
We deal with...
and the most serious.

437
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,200
How's your
medical insurance?

438
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,500
You're looking at him.

439
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,990
well, there's this clinic.

440
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,890
It's hard to get into,
but I've got some influence.

441
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,390
Maybe we can work
something out.

442
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,000
That's all you got?

443
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,200
Maybe not.
Who does your taxes?

444
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,190
My sister's third husband.

445
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,390
The government's
eating me alive,

446
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,690
And idiot boy's
setting the table.

447
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,500
Leonard is a cpa.

448
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,690
75% of his hourly rate
goes to paying the debt.

449
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,090
What's in it for you?

450
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,090
9th inning, 2 down.
Your team's one up.

451
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,600
They've got two runners on,

452
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,290
And their best hitter's
at the plate.

453
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,300
What do you do?

454
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,790
Bring in a closer.

455
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,490
What if your closer
strikes him out?

456
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,590
Gets a save.

457
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,500
Well, that's what's in it
for me.

458
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,700
Just the occasional save.

459
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,900
I love baseball.

460
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,890
Conivar: based on your tests
and observations, doctor,

461
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,490
How would you describe Trey Hansen's
psychological condition

462
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,890
Now and at the time
of the murder?

463
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,690
He suffered then
as he suffers now -

464
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,690
From a tendency towards
magical thinking and misattribution.

465
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,100
Can you define those terms
for us?

466
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,390
Well, magical thinking
is pretty much as it sounds -

467
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,190
A belief in non-Causal,
nonscientific events,

468
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,490
Confusing fantasy
with reality.

469
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,990
Misattribution,
on the other hand,

470
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,090
Is having or believing in
false memories.

471
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,690
And could Mr. Hansen's
relatively low I.Q.

472
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,590
Be a contributing factor?

473
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,690
Yes, although
both conditions

474
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,790
can occur in highly intelligent,
highly educated individuals.

475
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,690
And those conditions
could explain the defendant's

476
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,090
initial confession
and diary entry?

477
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,790
We can't know for certain
what happened in that bar.

478
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,600
There are
conflicting accounts.

479
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,290
And if Mr. Hansen wasn't
the aggressor, as he contends -

480
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,190
And especially given
his inebriated state -

481
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,900
It's possible that he concocted
a revenge fantasy.

482
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,200
Then later, when confronted
with Mr. Wohl's murder,

483
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,100
He took it further,

484
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,790
Imagining himself
as the slayer.

485
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,490
That's why he picked up
the knife - his knife -

486
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,900
And brought it home.

487
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,790
And he recorded
that fantasy in his diary,

488
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:18,000
Later recounting the fantasy
as his story to the police.

489
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,290
So, how was court today?

490
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,800
Pretty much
as I expected.

491
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,790
Who are we
waiting on?

492
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,700
At least one,
maybe two.

493
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,600
What's up there?

494
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,000
Oh, bed, bath, closet, you know.
You renting?

495
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,290
It's all I could find on
the internet on short notice.

496
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,800
Is this your family?

497
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,090
It's my mum and dad,
sister, and I.

498
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,300
Dad died about a year
after that was taken.

499
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Oh. I'm sorry.

500
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,790
Mum remarried
a couple of years later

501
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,990
To an american naval officer
serving with n. A.T.O.

502
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,790
When his tour ended,
he brought us back to the u. S.

503
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,100
They retired recently
to florida.

504
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,800
And your sister?

505
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,000
I haven't seen becky
in four years.

506
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,200
That's a long time.

507
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,200
I'll go.

508
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,090
What are you
doing here?

509
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,500
Playing poker.

510
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,800
not with me, you're not.

511
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,290
You want me to go.

512
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,000
Yes. No, no.

513
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,000
Look who I found!

514
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,300
I can't even
buy a hand.

515
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,200
All right. The pot's good.
Three players.

516
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,690
Bets.

517
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,300
Four bucks.

518
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,400
Raise you.
Mm-Hmm.

519
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,000
Call.

520
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,900
Re-Raise.

521
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,000
Again.

522
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,600
Call.

523
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,790
Last card.

524
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,700
Uh, check.

525
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,900
Bet.

526
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,900
Raise.

527
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,700
Call.

528
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,300
Call.

529
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,400
On their backs.

530
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
Three of a kind.

531
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,590
Straight.

532
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,200
Ohh!

533
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,000
you had to bet?

534
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,490
Yes. I flopped a nut straight.
Of course I had to bet.

535
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,100
Couldn't you know that he -
That he caught the flush?

536
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:01,990
<i>Had you beat.</i>

537
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,990
Oh, god. Unbelievable!

538
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,890
Read a book
or something.

539
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,900
Learn how to play
the game.

540
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,900
You're the expert.

541
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,200
There's frozen yogurt
in the freezer.

542
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,290
Okay, good night.
Night.

543
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,290
I'll walk you out.

544
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,800
Oh, no, don't bother.

545
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,290
Hey, thanks for everything.

546
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,600
Yeah. We're on again
next month.

547
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,300
Do me a favor - Don't cash this
for a day or two, all right?

548
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,790
I know you're
good for it.

549
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,900
Nothing like
a friendly game, huh?

550
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,090
Uh, Dr. Moore
requested a psych consult.

551
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,800
Right here.
Thank you.

552
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,900
I need help.

553
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,890
not here.

554
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,990
See me tonight.
I can't.

555
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:22,890
I'm dying.

556
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,200
Uh-huh.

557
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,500
I'll try.

558
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,800
Thank you, doctor.

559
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,290
Is this real
ice cream?

560
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,800
Real soy ice cream.

561
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,890
Don't think
I'm not grateful.

562
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,790
You got to get
used to the taste.

563
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,590
I'm talking about Jimmy,
what you did for me.

564
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,790
I just don't think
it can work.

565
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,700
Why not?

566
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,390
I'm gonna get the urge,
Dr. Gallagher.

567
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,690
Maybe not for a while.
Maybe I'd fight it.

568
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,090
But when it hits,
it's gonna hit hard,

569
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,790
And I'm gonna be looking
for someone to take my action.

570
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,200
Jimmy's not the only fish
in the pond.

571
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,900
You walk
out of here tonight,

572
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,890
How long before
you're back on the roof?

573
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,690
What if it's better
this time?

574
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,800
My losing streak's got to
take a turn sooner or later.

575
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,590
Jimmy went over
your losses with me.

576
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,090
Now, you usually bet
on the favorite, right?

577
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,400
Sit down for a minute.

578
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,390
That means that you should have
won maybe 60% of those bets?

579
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,390
That's what I'm saying.
I'm due.

580
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,290
You're cursed.
I'm cursed?

581
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,500
I want to try something -
An experiment.

582
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,000
I think I've got a deck
around here somewhere.

583
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,300
Yeah.

584
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,800
High card wins.

585
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,100
You want me to do that?

586
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,900
I- I got it. I got it.

587
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,100
All right.

588
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Again?

589
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,100
Damn.

590
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,900
You want to
make it interesting?

591
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,700
Sure.

592
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,800
Okay, you're down 2-0.

593
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,000
8 more cuts, 100 bucks a pop.
My money against your time.

594
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,300
You win even one,
you get paid.

595
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,090
I win all eight, you owe me
eight weeks at gamblers united.

596
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,400
I'll sponsor you.

597
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,600
0 for 10?

598
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,500
You're on.

599
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,800
Damn!

600
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,600
What are the odds?

601
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,900
Astronomical.

602
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
<i>I am cursed.</i>

603
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,590
You see, there's - There's
something I don't understand.

604
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:32,290
How I can throw away my family,
my career, everything?

605
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,190
<i>No, it's a disease, Leonard.
That I do understand.</i>

606
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,190
Then what?

607
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,300
Well, you say you crave
the action, but what action?

608
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,000
What kind of thrill
can there be when you -

609
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,000
When you know you're gonna
lose almost every time?

610
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,100
Where's the fun in that?

611
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,600
No more questions,
your honor.

612
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,200
Ms. Crane, would you like
to cross-Examine this witness?

613
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,090
I would, your honor.

614
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,090
Proceed.

615
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,590
Dr. Gallagher,
the defendant, Mr. Hansen,

616
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,090
Isn't psychotic, is he?
No.

617
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,390
Bipolar, schizophrenic, or delusional?
Nope.

618
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,090
Clinically depressed
or suicidal?

619
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,690
Addicted to any substance or
a pattern of aberrant behavior?

620
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,390
No.

621
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,390
Suffering from
any neurological disorder

622
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,990
that might make him a danger
to himself or others?

623
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:19,990
None.

624
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,290
Would you describe
the conditions

625
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,090
Magical thinking
and misattribution

626
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,690
as serious mental diseases?

627
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,800
No, but they can have serious
consequences, as in this case.

628
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,490
Thank you for that
clarification, doctor.

629
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:33,390
If I saw a burning bush
on my way home from work today

630
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,590
And in the crackling sound
I heard the voice of god,

631
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:39,800
Could I be described as having
lapsed into magical thinking?

632
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,790
Well, that would
very much depend

633
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,590
On what type of smoke
you'd inhaled

634
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,290
And whether or not
you had much of a yearning

635
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,500
To be a biblical prophet.

636
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,690
Magical thinking, then,

637
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,190
Represents
a kind of wish fulfillment,

638
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,500
Seeing what one wants or needs
to see or experience?

639
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,990
To a degree.

640
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,090
Magical thinking
is wishful thinking.

641
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,590
That's
an oversimplification.

642
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,900
Is wishful thinking the product
of a diseased mind, doctor?

643
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,490
No, but, um -

644
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,790
Then I assume
it's entirely sane

645
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,790
For us to act
to fulfill our wishes?

646
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,690
Of course.

647
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,490
Such as robbing and butchering a
man we perceive to be a threat?

648
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,490
Objection.
Sustained.

649
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,690
Misattribution - The conviction
that a false memory is true.

650
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,590
More or less.

651
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,790
A man witnesses a murder.

652
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,090
He then remembers himself
not as a witness,

653
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,890
But as having committed
the murder.

654
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,790
I believe that's
exactly what happened.

655
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,500
Well,
the defendant confessed...

656
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,590
Then he un-Confessed.

657
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,690
When his true memories
reasserted themselves.

658
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,490
Or else, faced with the
possibility of incarceration

659
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:50,400
Or execution
for premeditated murder,

660
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,890
Mr. Hansen did a little more
magical thinking,

661
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,290
Instead becoming
the blameless witness,

662
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,700
Making the lie the memory.

663
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,800
Mr. Hansen has a history
of good behavior,

664
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,090
A steady job,

665
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,790
Good relationships
with co-Workers, friends, and family

666
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,990
Who universally describe him
as passive, shy,

667
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,390
And very good-natured -

668
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,590
No trouble with the police,
no acts of violence,

669
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,490
Despite a lifetime
of being made fun of

670
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,190
For being just
a little bit slow.

671
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,690
That's Trey Hansen,

672
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,290
Not the murderer
you're making him out to be

673
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,600
For the sake
of winning this case.

674
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,590
We know what, uh,
what you believe, doctor.

675
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,790
You - You care
about your patient,

676
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,790
And it also suits your case
to see him in that light.

677
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,090
But what about Hansen himself?

678
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,790
I'm curious -
How suggestible is he?

679
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,500
Could you, for example,
reconvince him

680
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,600
So that he, in fact, believes
he did murder Andrew Wohl?

681
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,590
It's possible to implant
false memories.

682
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,490
Could I,
hypothetically?

683
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,900
Hypothetically.

684
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,500
Given his ongoing condition,

685
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,990
Mr. Hansen
may never be 100% certain

686
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,600
If he actually
is a murderer or not.

687
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,900
Possibly not.

688
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,800
Then how on earth
can you be so certain?

689
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,900
<i>How on earth can you?</i>

690
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,590
I have a defendant with a desire
and opportunity to kill.

691
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,290
I have the murder weapon
in his possession.

692
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,490
I have his clothing drenched
with the victim's blood.

693
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,790
I have two confessions,
one unsolicited.

694
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,200
I have evidence, doctor.

695
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,500
Not wishful thinking.

696
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,000
<i>I am certain.</i>

697
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,100
That's how it's done.

698
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,090
Winning?

699
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,200
The job.

700
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,300
I gave you honest answers
without agenda.

701
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,600
You took what I said -
You twisted it.

702
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,590
You repackaged it

703
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,800
And sold it to the jury
as something else.

704
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,800
It's called advocacy.

705
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,390
Lynn, as an advocate
for Mr. Hansen,

706
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,590
Did a decent job
on your redirect.

707
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,690
It tends to balance out.

708
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,890
Sure, Lynn did a decent job,
but she's not in your league.

709
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,190
You were better.
You were tougher.

710
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,390
You were more driven.

711
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,800
So a man ends up
guilty as charged.

712
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,190
There's judge and jury.
There's court of appeals.

713
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,800
I'm a small part
of the process.

714
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,600
That's your excuse.

715
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,200
Why do I need one?

716
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,100
Someday, Marcie, you may.

717
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,000
I just hope when the time comes,
you'll know, uh...

718
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,700
You'll know where
to find the help.

719
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,100
Psychiatrist.

720
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,600
It's all so clear to you.

721
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,300
Do you think you know me?

722
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,390
What if the jury
comes back not guilty?

723
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,390
They won't.

724
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,700
What if they do?

725
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,900
Will you think
you might have been wrong?

726
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,890
Will you actually
take a look at Trey Hansen,

727
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,590
Not as a prosecutor
but as a human being?

728
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,590
Because if you did,

729
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:17,790
You'd realize all the
so-Called facts in this case

730
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,190
Prove nothing.

731
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,300
The real win here
is to set him free.

732
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Set yourself free.

733
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,000
Jury's back.

734
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,490
"In the matter of the state
of california vs. Trey Hansen,

735
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,700
"On the count
of premeditated murder,

736
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,900
We, the jury,
find the defendant... "

737
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,900
And you...

738
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,400
"we, the jury,
find the defendant... "

739
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,890
"We, the jury, find
the defendant, Trey Hansen... "

740
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,000
Guilty.

741
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,300
"... Guilty of murder
in the first degree. "

742
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,200
guilty.

743
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,700
What really happened?

744
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,200
Hansen was waiting for the bus,
just like he said -

745
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:35,300
Wrong time, wrong place,
wrong emotional state.

746
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,390
He saw the murder.
He saw everything.

747
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,590
Resulting
in emotional shock,

748
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:46,090
Magical thinking,
and misattribution.

749
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,300
Here was his tormentor,
his enemy,

750
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,490
Lying helpless at his feet.

751
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,090
Who knows what Trey had imagined
on his own?

752
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,600
Whatever it was,
this was so much more.

753
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,190
What happened in the bar?

754
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,490
They found the real killer
eventually.

755
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,190
He had the victim's wallet,
and after he confessed,

756
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,990
The police went back
to the rock garden

757
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,800
And re-Interviewed
the witnesses.

758
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,090
Wohl and his two buddies -

759
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,200
They were regulars.
They knew the bartender.

760
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,090
They had too much to drink that
night and started riding Hansen,

761
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,490
You know, tripping him,
spilling beer on him.

762
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,590
He didn't know
how to fight back.

763
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,090
So he complained
to the bartender.

764
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:27,200
<i>But when he did, he was the one
that got thrown out.</i>

765
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,490
And everyone was very
contrite after Hansen died.

766
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,190
That's when the truth
came out.

767
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,290
Too late for Hansen.

768
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,790
Strangled in his
holding cell,

769
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,590
Waiting for transport to state
prison after the guilty verdict.

770
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:44,000
And too late for Marcie Crane.
She had a complete breakdown.

771
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,990
<i>I read about the case
in the journal,</i>

772
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,800
Got in touch
with her doctors.

773
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,990
That's when
we hatched the plan -

774
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,590
You know,
to re-Enact the trial.

775
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,890
How many times
have you tried?

776
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,400
This was strike two.

777
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,190
You see, all during
the trial, it rained.

778
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,490
So, whenever it rains

779
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,990
For more than a couple
of days in a row -

780
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,590
She relives it.

781
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,000
Yeah.

782
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,290
For Marcie,
winning is a reflex.

783
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,300
She won't give in.
She doesn't know how.

784
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,290
So, it's no good,

785
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,890
Us just pronouncing
Trey Hansen innocent.

786
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,790
We tried it the first time.
It doesn't work.

787
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,990
We have to somehow build a case
that's convincing enough

788
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,100
So that Marcie
is willing to lose.

789
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,200
At least,
that's the theory, anyway.

790
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,100
Next time,
can I play Hansen?

791
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,700
I don't know.
Can you?

792
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,490
I'll meet you downstairs.

793
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,600
Okay.

794
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,290
We came closer this time.

795
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,890
She almost tripped up over
the new memorandum to the court

796
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,500
And the new diagnosis.

797
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,700
Then there was
the plea-Bargain offer.

798
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,590
Also, she opened up to you
more than she has.

799
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,900
She even hesitated before
pronouncing the verdict.

800
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,990
You nearly
got to her, Jack.

801
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,490
Yeah, but in the end,
her verdict was the same.

802
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,590
Don't be discouraged, doctor.
We'll try again.

803
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,200
Next rainy days.

804
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,190
I'm sorry, denny,
but what am I supposed to do?

805
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,790
Half the staff's
still out with the same bug,

806
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,000
And they need me
to cover for a while.

807
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,690
Uh...

808
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,390
Well, that - That's sweet,
but don't bother.

809
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:16,190
I'll, uh, I'll get
something to eat

810
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,000
When I, uh,
when I-I get home.

811
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,800
Yeah, no, I mean, uh,
before I leave.

812
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,890
Okay.

813
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,800
Yeah, I-I love you, too.
Bye.

814
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,000
All clear?

815
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,100
I have to be home
by 11:00.

816
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,200
That'll have to do.

817
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,600
Oh, hey, wait up!

818
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,600
Hey!

819
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,590
Mort's?
Where else?

820
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,900
Pastrami?

821
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,000
Uh, brisket...
with new pickles.

822
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,800
sounds good.

823
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,300
Y- You know, you don't
have to go in with me.

824
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,000
Confession time?

825
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,000
When we cut the cards,
I stacked the deck.

826
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,400
I, uh, figured.

827
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,700
We're not so different,
you and I.

828
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,500
I'm scared, doc.

829
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,790
I mean, uh, eight meetings
of gamblers united -

830
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,590
That was the deal.

831
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,600
So why am I scared?

832
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,100
Well, maybe
because this time...

833
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,200
There's actually something
important at stake.

834
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,300
Win some, lose some, right?

835
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,200
Right.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
