1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,412
<i>This new coach, he's got himself
a lot of pressure right now.</i>

2
00:00:02,582 --> 00:00:03,957
Got yourself a heck of a QB.

3
00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:06,543
Is true that you can throw
a 400-yard touchdown

4
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:08,378
pass to three different receivers?

5
00:00:09,848 --> 00:00:11,619
<i>That's a gigantic hit on Street.</i>

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:14,175
Jason's paralyzed.
He'll regain use of his arms,

7
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:17,009
his hands, but they don't think
he's gonna regain use of his legs.

8
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,139
Jason can never know
what happened between us.

9
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:22,100
You think little Matt Saracen
can get it done?

10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,228
- What's your name?
- Matt Saracen.

11
00:00:25,648 --> 00:00:27,480
- What do you play?
- QB 1.

12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,483
Boys think about sex
every single minute of the day.

13
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:33,804
Your mother wanted me to add that
football players are the worst offender.

14
00:00:33,974 --> 00:00:36,489
However, I think
that it pretty much crosses all lines.

15
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:38,908
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,578
If you're not doing anything
on Friday...

17
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:43,455
- Yes.
- It's a date, then.

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,934
You look good,
like real good.

19
00:00:46,104 --> 00:00:48,404
Probably because yesterday
I was baptized and accepted Jesus

20
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:50,712
- as my lord and savior.
- Still the best I've ever had.

21
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:54,466
- I think I got myself a job.
- Really? That fast you got a job?

22
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:57,969
Yeah, I'm the new guide counselor
at the high school.

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,933
<i>Smash Williams...
He breaks a tackle!</i>

24
00:01:04,193 --> 00:01:06,848
<i>- He's dragging guys along.
- Touchdown!</i>

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,644
<i>Panthers win State!</i>

26
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:12,442
Just be honest with me.

27
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:15,695
It's my parents.
It's me feeling trapped.

28
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:19,366
Nothing seems right anymore.
I just really need some space.

29
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:21,535
- Leave my sister alone.
- You've one of ours,

30
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:23,370
why shouldn't we get one of yours?

31
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:27,123
They're revoking my scholarship.
That's the mark of death, coach.

32
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:28,959
That's my future.

33
00:01:29,594 --> 00:01:31,954
This team has never been
about one player, it's about all of us,

34
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:33,296
every single one of us.

35
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:36,591
Not one man,
every single one of us, together.

36
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:39,212
- Clear eyes, full hearts...
- Can't lose!

37
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:40,532
Let's get 'em!

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,776
<i>This is Slammin' Sammy Mead, folks,</i>

39
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:58,196
<i>and Panther football
is just five days away.</i>

40
00:01:58,456 --> 00:02:00,978
<i>You know what that means:
time to start talking.</i>

41
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:03,952
<i>Coach Eric Taylor,
misunderstood genius,</i>

42
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:05,445
<i>a one hit wonder.</i>

43
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:08,131
<i>John, from Seven Lakes, you're on,
come on, what d'you got?</i>

44
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:11,357
<i>I'll tell you, Sammy, I was all
for bringing Taylor back from TMU</i>

45
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:13,006
<i>even though he abandoned us.</i>

46
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:16,090
<i>But we all saw what happened
which was Smash Williams got injured.</i>

47
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,073
<i>And the guy had no back-up plan.</i>

48
00:02:18,243 --> 00:02:19,601
<i>- Zero.
- I hear you, John.</i>

49
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:22,679
<i>Anyone who coach a Pop Warner of the NFL
and I've coached my share of Pop Warner,</i>

50
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,056
<i>you've got to have a back-up plan.</i>

51
00:02:25,726 --> 00:02:27,892
The sprinkler is on.
It's not about the Celica.

52
00:02:28,152 --> 00:02:30,119
I know it's a practicable car,
it's about the fact

53
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:32,082
that I can't have you
changing your classes.

54
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,131
You need to be
in Dr. Wells English class.

55
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:36,736
Mom, stop it,
only for 12,000 miles in the car.

56
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,487
I know all the tricks, so technically
they're all christian miles.

57
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:41,550
I don't care
what kind of miles they are.

58
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,424
- You act as I'm dropping out of school.
- She's not listening to me.

59
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:46,161
I just want to get a job.

60
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:48,446
I'm taking same amount of classes
in fewer hours.

61
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:51,283
- I'm making my time more efficient.
- It's not efficient

62
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:54,377
for you to take a class with a teacher
who is in failure.

63
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:57,496
It'd be nice if people didn't throw
the trash in my car. This is my car.

64
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,161
And second of all,
Principal Taylor, you look hot.

65
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:02,681
- Thank you, thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

66
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:08,033
Coach Taylor.

67
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:12,244
The problem remains your team
imploded in last year's playoffs

68
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:14,189
when Smash Williams hurt his knee.

69
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:18,051
We couldn't win without him then,

70
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,960
how could we win
now that he's graduated?

71
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,448
Team's got a lot of spirit, team's doing
just fine. Very solid, very solid.

72
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:36,403
We have Tim Riggins stepping in the
Smash Williams crucial role of tailback.

73
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:38,638
What if he takes off to Mexico
like last year?

74
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:40,340
Is Tim Riggins...
Is he focused?

75
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:51,142
One thing I can guarantee
about Tim Riggins is

76
00:03:51,402 --> 00:03:53,741
that he is focused on football
and only football.

77
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:55,980
How are Riggins and Saracen jelling?

78
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,278
Just keep running for the ball.
I'm putting the ball where you gotta be.

79
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:04,075
Tim and Matt are like brothers.

80
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,159
About that new quarterback
from Dallas...

81
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,166
- You know, J.D. McCoy.
- McCoy.

82
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:10,537
There are rumors
that he may replace Saracen...

83
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:18,211
Nice snag, come up.

84
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:19,838
J.D. McCoy is a freshman.

85
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:22,524
But he broke state records
when he was in middle school.

86
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:26,552
- Since you're into rebuilding year...
- We're not in a rebuilding year.

87
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:29,597
- We're not in a rebuilding year.
- You're saying Matt Saracen's your man?

88
00:04:29,857 --> 00:04:31,311
That's very much what I'm saying.

89
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:33,601
Matt Saracen,
whether he's on the field

90
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:35,107
or off the field...

91
00:04:35,277 --> 00:04:37,730
Whatever you throw at that young man,
he can handle.

92
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,816
I can't get this knot
out of my shoe, okay?

93
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:42,016
Matt, forget about...
You're not gonna do it.

94
00:04:42,186 --> 00:04:44,772
- You've been working on it all summer.
- Take your time, seriously.

95
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:47,692
Well, my point is
that this is your senior year...

96
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:50,726
and after this, it's all...
It's all just downhill.

97
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:54,383
I mean, right, Tyra? Doesn't he need
to suck up every second of this?

98
00:04:54,553 --> 00:04:58,546
Look, this year is all about doing well
so I can get out of Dillon forever.

99
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:01,457
- It's all I care about.
- Baby, that's not the point...

100
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:02,706
What I'm...

101
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:04,439
Don't call me that.

102
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:06,363
What's going on with y'all two?

103
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,246
- We broke up.
- Taking a break.

104
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,533
We broke up.

105
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:12,181
Three steps back,
watch your shoulders. Ear high.

106
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,670
Left.

107
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:16,738
Is that...
Is that J.D?

108
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:20,356
Looks like the clock
is ticking, man.

109
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:22,525
Let's just go to pep rally.

110
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,650
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would like to introduce to you...

111
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,585
New Dillon High Principal,
Mrs. Tami Taylor.

112
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:55,642
How are you doing?
Y'all having fun?

113
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:02,023
Don't even worry
about that two game rumor deal.

114
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:04,776
What two-game rumor?

115
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,911
I got it under control.

116
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,117
So, without any further due,

117
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:17,400
I'd like to introduce the coach
of the Dillon Panthers,

118
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,322
my date to the Homecoming dance,
Eric Taylor.

119
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:46,192
I wanna ask one question.

120
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,798
I wanna ask all of you...

121
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:52,234
only one question.

122
00:06:57,104 --> 00:06:58,965
Are you ready for Friday night?

123
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:08,715
Here are your 2008 Dillon Panthers.

124
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:50,256
3x01: I KNEW YOU WHEN

125
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:55,303
Subtitles: Team Panthers

126
00:07:55,563 --> 00:07:57,472
With the participation of:

127
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:02,560
benj!, charliea, DarKsh, GillesSilb,
Ju, loky34, ouazo, tactactac, Teardrop

128
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,674
Lyla, rise and shine, baby.

129
00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:37,369
I've made
your favorite pegs and eggs.

130
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,399
And chocolate chip pancakes.

131
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:46,771
- Dad, I'm not 7 anymore.
- I know.

132
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,481
But I'm just...

133
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:51,194
so happy you're here. It's first day
at school and you're a senior.

134
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,690
You can go to any college you want to,
and I'm proud of you.

135
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,655
You're here with me
and not with mum.

136
00:08:56,543 --> 00:08:59,711
Northern California
or some vegetarian raising figs...

137
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:01,911
I'm just...
It's a great day, let's go.

138
00:09:02,171 --> 00:09:03,371
I'll be up in 5.

139
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,757
- Is there enough pegs and eggs for me?
- Shut up.

140
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:18,010
Maybe you need to get a workout
before breakfast.

141
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,023
You know what?
No, what are you gonna do? Come on.

142
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:28,920
Let's go!

143
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:45,561
Well, you cut off two 10s for sec.

144
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:48,862
- Two 10s? Let's call Sammy Mead.
- Two 10s.

145
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:51,961
Tell him I'll be able to run the Buddy
Garrity's 5 day charity race this year.

146
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:53,678
You go see that doctor tomorrow,

147
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:56,924
I wanna start doing some side-to-side on
that knee. Find out what he has to say.

148
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:00,277
What do you spend
all this time on me?

149
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:03,266
I mean, I graduated,
I'm not your problem anymore.

150
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:08,577
The reason I'm spending
all this time on you...

151
00:10:08,747 --> 00:10:10,624
It's 'cause I wanna get you
on team and college

152
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:13,583
so I don't have to see your ugly face up
at Alamo Freeze anymore.

153
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:15,234
Call me after you see that doctor.

154
00:10:16,076 --> 00:10:17,151
Yes, sir.

155
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:20,925
Don't forget
to pick up those cones!

156
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,124
Emily, Barbara, good morning.

157
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:35,755
Good to see y'all.
Yeah, here we go.

158
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:38,564
Hey, Sarah,
great to see you this year.

159
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:41,058
- Hey, Principal T.
- Cute haircut.

160
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:43,747
- Congratulations.
- It's gonna be a great year.

161
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,114
- Good luck.
- For you.

162
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:47,949
- You're gonna have a good day.
- Thank you.

163
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:50,186
Hi, vice-principal Trucks,
how are you this morning?

164
00:10:50,446 --> 00:10:52,296
Good morning.
AC system is down.

165
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:54,148
We've 34 students on Cortese Avenue

166
00:10:54,408 --> 00:10:56,828
abandoned 'cause there was
no room on the school bus.

167
00:10:56,998 --> 00:10:59,362
Good lord, we need to get
those students taken care of.

168
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:02,022
I've borrowed the team buses,
I put a request into the district

169
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:04,663
for 3 additional buses.
Hopefully, that will get us one.

170
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,959
So there are gonna be
taken care of these kids?

171
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:08,704
Great, what about the AC?

172
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:10,957
We've put a band-aid on it
and pray like always.

173
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:12,715
All right. Thank you.

174
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:14,938
Don't forget the budget's due
by the end of the week.

175
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,358
I'm collecting all the data for that,
have a great day.

176
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:24,113
That feels good.

177
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:26,385
Hey, how are you?

178
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:38,150
I guess I lost the lottery.
I'm your rally girl this year.

179
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:39,934
Damn...

180
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:42,622
Lyla, rally girl.

181
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:45,866
So are you two together?

182
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,330
- No, we're buddies.
- No, we're just friends.

183
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,333
- Good buddies, strong friends, yeah.
- Good friends buddies.

184
00:11:57,442 --> 00:12:00,131
Anyway, Tim, here's my number.

185
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:03,718
Anything you need,
anytime you want it.

186
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:10,808
That's good, I think we've spent
enough time in school today.

187
00:12:11,068 --> 00:12:12,810
Let's go to the roof
and see what happens.

188
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,937
- What about homeroom?
- What about homeroom?

189
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:18,040
- What's going on, Rigs?
- Gentlemen.

190
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:21,444
Party Wednesday at Gangi's,
his parents are out of town.

191
00:12:21,704 --> 00:12:24,663
The cheerleaders said something
about baby oil and a bounce house.

192
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,400
- I don't know.
- Really?

193
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,076
- Twins are gonna be there.
- That's gonna get greasy.

194
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:03,027
Set your feet, J.D, set your feet.

195
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:07,302
Bring him up, bring him up.

196
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:15,865
McCoy is looking good.

197
00:13:16,202 --> 00:13:19,352
Let's see what happens
when the more of us drop.

198
00:13:19,888 --> 00:13:22,296
White, 9!

199
00:13:22,842 --> 00:13:23,673
Hut!

200
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,397
What the hell are you doing?
Come on!

201
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,887
Come on, you got to make it straight,
let's go!

202
00:13:30,473 --> 00:13:33,523
I'd rather see my boy
getting some reps out there.

203
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,101
Yeah, that'll happen.

204
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:37,518
Let's go! Get your head
in the game, let's go.

205
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:39,399
Get on the ball, Riggins!

206
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:42,233
Who the hell is that up there
talking to him?

207
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:44,944
That's J.D. McCoy's daddy.

208
00:13:45,294 --> 00:13:48,239
Big beer distributor,
called the stud of suds.

209
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:50,849
Look at old Buddy
sucking up up there.

210
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:52,410
Hey, Buddy!

211
00:13:56,773 --> 00:13:57,998
Let's go, gentlemen!

212
00:13:58,593 --> 00:14:01,141
What schools were you thinking
of applying to?

213
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:04,471
I was thinking of...
U.T. Austin,

214
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:07,854
TMU, Southern Methodist, maybe INM.

215
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:09,968
I see.
Tyra...

216
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:13,471
you really think
that sounds realistic?

217
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:17,339
Well, okay,
I know INM is a long shot, but...

218
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:19,519
You have a 2.6 GPA.

219
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:23,274
There is no way any of those schools
you just mentioned are going

220
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:26,509
- to seriously consider...
- You have to look at my progress.

221
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:29,303
My grades from last year
have radically improved.

222
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:32,449
I know, but your 1.9
in freshman year still counts.

223
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:33,925
It all counts.

224
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,546
- I don't want you to waste your time...
- Mrs. Taylor, she told me...

225
00:14:37,716 --> 00:14:40,781
Ms Colette,
state's schools are a pipe dream.

226
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:45,885
Can you think about other options?
Technical Colleges, Junior Colleges...

227
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:48,225
Like Dillon Tech?

228
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,925
Don't look out on Dillon Tech,
it's a good option.

229
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,138
It's a realistic option.

230
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,396
- Bored in the midnight hole, are you?
- Buddy...

231
00:15:03,658 --> 00:15:06,363
T. Tami, what are you doing,
making some big power moves?

232
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:07,942
Yeah, it's awfully glamorous.

233
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:11,220
Right now, I'm trying to decide
if we can afford chalk

234
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,198
or soap this year.

235
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,076
- Wish I was kidding.
- T. Tami, I'm here to cheer you up.

236
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:17,452
You always do.

237
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:19,134
I got those two words for you.

238
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:21,425
- Come on.
- Jumbo Tron.

239
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:23,262
Jumbo Tron?

240
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:27,469
Have you ever seen
two people engaged

241
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:30,466
on a Jumbo Tron, at a football game?
Just think about it.

242
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:34,187
Love and football are
the two greatest things in the world.

243
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:38,348
You put the two together,
put it on a 30 ft Mitsubishi screen,

244
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,142
and it's pure nirvana.

245
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,356
- That's a big check.
- Yes, ma'am.

246
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:48,007
Oh, my...

247
00:15:49,058 --> 00:15:50,568
We have lost four teachers

248
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,737
to budget cuts this year.

249
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:56,056
We need a Jumbo Tron, you think?

250
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:59,202
Well, no Tami, we don't need one.
But we want one.

251
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,535
And we are gonna have one
because of that,

252
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:04,869
and you are gonna get
all the credit.

253
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:09,129
- That's a lot of zeros right there...
- Yes, it is.

254
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:13,634
You and I are gonna make
a beautiful team together, T. Tami.

255
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:18,471
- Clear eyes, full hearts...
- Okay, let's not go there.

256
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:35,161
For six weeks, it's great.

257
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,559
Great sex, great everything,
you know?

258
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:42,024
Then, we go to school,

259
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:44,539
it's like...
it's like a 180.

260
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,289
Sounds to me Tim,
like you got a problem.

261
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:50,990
It's what it sounds like.

262
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,549
I told you from day one that Lyla
was never gonna take you seriously.

263
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:59,210
One of these days, you're gonna stop
with all the screwing around,

264
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,561
and find you
the love of a good woman.

265
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:02,974
Like I got with Mandy.

266
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:06,728
Yeah, Billy, you got a real fairy tale
going on right now.

267
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,830
That's a job, Tim.

268
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:11,357
You think I give a crap
that my girlfriend

269
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:14,527
is giving some fifty year old
fat-ass trucker a lap-dance?

270
00:17:16,193 --> 00:17:18,425
Hey, Mand, I love you baby!

271
00:17:18,595 --> 00:17:20,590
- I'm lucky I have you.
- See?

272
00:17:21,254 --> 00:17:22,577
You see that, Tim?

273
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:24,959
That's public. Look at me.

274
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:26,456
That's love.

275
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:28,545
That whole Lyla thing...

276
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,878
She went to bed with Jesus,

277
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:32,818
and woke up with you.

278
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:34,162
Jesus...

279
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:35,507
you.

280
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:38,168
- You are a rebound from Jesus.
- No, I'm not a rebound.

281
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:40,199
You're a summer fling, Tim.

282
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:43,014
I don't believe that.

283
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:46,457
The A.C.L. is healing nicely.

284
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:51,298
The muscles surrounding your knee
are getting stronger, which is great.

285
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:54,897
Looks like you are
on your way to a full recovery.

286
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:57,515
Got yourself a clean
bill of health, son.

287
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:59,031
That's wonderful, ain't that?

288
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,648
He still gonna get
that scholarship, I know it.

289
00:18:01,818 --> 00:18:04,703
- I'm just trying to think positive...
- I lost the scholarship.

290
00:18:04,873 --> 00:18:07,245
- They gave it away.
- They said for you to contact them...

291
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:10,565
The semester started kick-off this week,
I missed the year.

292
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:13,929
And Dr. Wabono,
if everything is back to normal,

293
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:17,090
why am I still having a second slow
on a forty than I was before the injury?

294
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:19,217
Well, Smash,
your progress have been great,

295
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,513
but there's no guarantee, that you'll
regain the speed you had pre-injury.

296
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,028
So you're saying
this is as fast as I'm gonna get?

297
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:29,243
Possibly.

298
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:34,257
Look, you need to be thankful for
the progress that you've made so far...

299
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:37,736
and keep working at it
and that's all you can do.

300
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,198
- Well...
- Hold on one second. I'm almost done.

301
00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:45,827
A second is long enough.

302
00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:47,639
There's a lot of calculations...

303
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:50,998
Landry, honey, did you get
to fix that toilet, I really gotta go.

304
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:54,194
Yeah, I fixed it, but you all gonna
have to start flushing genuinely

305
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:57,555
and tell Mandy to stop putting
so much toilet paper in it.

306
00:18:58,016 --> 00:18:59,949
You are so smart,
thank you, you angel.

307
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,009
- Isn't he fantastic?
- You're embarrassing me.

308
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,796
Thank you, sweetheart.
You have fun.

309
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:09,851
See something?

310
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,130
- If I carry the one...
- What?

311
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:15,901
Okay, so...

312
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:20,032
In order for you to get
a 3.5 GPA overall, you'll need to get...

313
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:23,698
like a 6.4 GPA this year.

314
00:19:25,603 --> 00:19:27,262
Which is gonna be tough.

315
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:36,268
I just wanted to say
I'm so honored to be here

316
00:19:36,438 --> 00:19:38,004
with you all this year, and...

317
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:40,004
And I'm here to make
your jobs easier.

318
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:43,677
I'm here to make us all
the best educators we can be, so please,

319
00:19:43,937 --> 00:19:46,512
I want open dialog,
I want you all to speak up,

320
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:48,668
and I wanna open
the floor right now,

321
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:51,226
for questions,
or comments or concerns

322
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:53,102
or anything...
Anybody.

323
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,469
I'd love to hear you.

324
00:19:56,716 --> 00:19:59,984
Any chance the four teachers
that got laid off are gonna...

325
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:02,070
return?
Be replaced?

326
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:04,864
You know we're working
through the budget right now.

327
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:08,993
It's tricky. It's gonna be a tricky one
and it's gonna weigh on everyone...

328
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:11,162
But we're not even gonna
get a Spanish teacher

329
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:14,030
- that actually speaks Spanish...
- How about supplies?

330
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,752
I've been teaching out of the same
history book for fifteen years.

331
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:20,171
You know, I do have textbooks...

332
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:23,424
Do you know a lot of us
buy our own supplies?

333
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:28,179
- I'm gonna start making a list.
- How about just getting us some paper?

334
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:31,238
- Let's go!
- Let's go, let's go guys.

335
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,977
- What's your read, Matt?
- Black eight!

336
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,880
Black eight, hut!

337
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,733
Throw the ball, throw the ball!

338
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:42,068
Get rid of it!

339
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:44,692
Saracen, Riggins, get over here!

340
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,614
- Come here.
- Let's go, Riggins!

341
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:51,619
Is there something going on
I need to know about?

342
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:57,948
Let me tell you two something,
you better get together right now.

343
00:20:58,118 --> 00:21:01,713
Cause if you don't, I will replace you,
I promise you that. You got me?

344
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:04,674
- Yes, sir.
- Make it work.

345
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:07,260
Let's go out there
and run it the right way.

346
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:10,555
Come on, let's move.
Looking around, let's go!

347
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,084
What the hell is that?

348
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,517
J.D. McCoyle's daddy
bought us all smoothies.

349
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:19,272
Not for now, for after the practice.

350
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,827
Smoothies?

351
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:23,800
Yeah, those frosty tiny things
with a non-fat yoghurt...

352
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,736
I know what the hell a smoothie is.

353
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,747
Tell him to get
the hell off the field.

354
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,954
You mean for good,
or to come back later? Or what?

355
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,495
Tell him we don't
need any damn smoothies.

356
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:35,106
Alright, alright!

357
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,291
Get that pink ass suck-up off the field,
just get him out of here!

358
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:41,711
Just move it up the premises,
let's go.

359
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:46,299
- Damn! I want a smoothie. Damn, man.
- What was that, Charles?

360
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:49,260
What did you say?
You want a smoothie?

361
00:21:49,987 --> 00:21:52,180
- Do you want a smoothie?
- It's like 120 degrees in here.

362
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:53,898
It's hot out here, isn't it?

363
00:21:54,068 --> 00:21:56,017
- Yeah.
- I'd like a smoothie too, Charles.

364
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:59,697
It'd be good, wouldn't it? But you know
why I'm not gonna have one, Charles?

365
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:01,895
Cause I don't feel
like I deserve a smoothie!

366
00:22:02,065 --> 00:22:04,901
Does anybody else out here,
feel like he deserves a smoothie?

367
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:08,519
I'll tell you what,
we win Friday night

368
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:11,073
and you can have all the damn smoothies
you want, gentlemen.

369
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:14,025
But until then,
get your minds back in the game

370
00:22:14,195 --> 00:22:17,206
and let's finish up this practice.
Let's go!

371
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:18,916
Let's go, boys.

372
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:26,798
Everything's okay?

373
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,421
- Fine. Ditching class.
- Where are you going?

374
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:31,761
Wait a minute, hon.
No, you're not ditching class.

375
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:33,862
What are you doing?
You're not ditching class.

376
00:22:34,032 --> 00:22:37,693
- After all we've talked about...
- Why? So I can get into Dillon Tech?

377
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:38,914
What do you mean?

378
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:42,214
'Cause that's the only college I'm gonna
be able to get into, ain't that right?

379
00:22:42,384 --> 00:22:44,315
Wait a minute, hon, hold on...

380
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:46,817
You filled my head
with all of these possibilities.

381
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:50,321
- Okay... What are you talking about?
- TMU, University of Texas...

382
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,518
But none is possible
with my grades, is it?

383
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:54,963
- It's not just about grades.
- Oh, it's not just that?

384
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:58,746
The average student getting
into UT has a 3.8, TMU is 3.7.

385
00:22:59,354 --> 00:23:01,457
So, what?
I've never said it was gonna be easy.

386
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,418
You never said impossible.

387
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,754
I've worked my ass off
these last two years.

388
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:07,015
I know.

389
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,459
You know, Mr. Trucks,
he had a good point.

390
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:12,385
I gotta be more realistic.

391
00:23:12,998 --> 00:23:15,302
- Wait a minute, honey...
- Put my time to better use.

392
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:18,151
No, ma'am... No, ma'am!
You come back here right now.

393
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:20,935
Tyra! You come back here right now.

394
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:23,932
Girl, listen!
After all we've been through...

395
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:25,189
Don't do this!

396
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,527
Tyra, don't do it.

397
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,020
Julie, let's go!

398
00:23:40,143 --> 00:23:41,144
Here.

399
00:23:42,343 --> 00:23:44,800
- Eggs, what's the occasion?
- The occasion's your mother wants you

400
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,420
to start eating breakfast
'cause that's the most important meal.

401
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:49,545
Dad, I only eat free-range eggs.

402
00:23:49,715 --> 00:23:52,669
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard, eat your eggs.

403
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:55,886
So you got dumped
with me and Gracie again?

404
00:23:56,295 --> 00:23:57,805
No, your mother had to deal

405
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:00,118
with an urgent
air-conditioning situation.

406
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:03,841
If I had my car, I could drop Gracie off
in the morning and pick her up at night.

407
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:05,439
You don't have one.
Sit down...

408
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:07,572
Well, I can fix
my schedule right, okay?

409
00:24:07,742 --> 00:24:09,820
So, mum wanted me
to take an AP English class

410
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,440
and Mr. Munios is teaching
AP English class in 3rd period,

411
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,257
so I can take
7th and 8th period free,

412
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:17,783
and then take social studies during
5th period as an independent study.

413
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,918
And today is the last day
I can make schedule changes,

414
00:24:22,088 --> 00:24:23,539
so I was hoping you could sign.

415
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,409
Sign? I'm not gonna sign off anything
without your mum's permission.

416
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:29,921
Dad, please. I tried to get her
all week, she's been so busy.

417
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:32,304
Hang on, babe.
I know. Sorry. I can't do that.

418
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:34,387
You want me to get a job, right?

419
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,196
You want me to become more responsible,
join the work force,

420
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:41,201
have goals for myself, become an adult,
become independent, right?

421
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:44,775
Please?

422
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:55,458
Sit down, eat your eggs
and I'll look at it.

423
00:24:56,842 --> 00:24:59,282
She's throwing riddles at me,
Williams.

424
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,701
What do I do?

425
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,725
This is an exchange
for shutting up about Lyla.

426
00:25:06,886 --> 00:25:07,886
Alright?

427
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:11,319
I heard you are playing
my old position,

428
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:13,360
how's life for a tailback?

429
00:25:15,442 --> 00:25:16,892
You want the truth?

430
00:25:17,527 --> 00:25:21,055
I go back to fullback and RB,
I got coach, I got 7,

431
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:24,575
rotting my ass every single day
like I asked for the gig...

432
00:25:24,745 --> 00:25:26,584
And you're gonna like this one,

433
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:30,410
I'm reminded every single day
that out there, I'm no Smash Williams.

434
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,696
We're in the same boat, Rigg.

435
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:36,391
I've just been told
I'm not Smash Williams either.

436
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:39,183
- What do you mean?
- The knee...

437
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,957
I'm slow.

438
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,037
Doctor said I'm as good as done,
but Coach thinks I should keep trying.

439
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,234
Okay, wait.

440
00:25:50,024 --> 00:25:53,750
Doctor says you can't do it, right?

441
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:56,103
Right?

442
00:25:57,437 --> 00:25:58,917
What's the issue?

443
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:03,073
That's a very good question.

444
00:26:05,968 --> 00:26:08,895
- Your love line is so deep.
- Oh, yeah, it is.

445
00:26:09,155 --> 00:26:10,647
- You know what that means?
- No.

446
00:26:10,907 --> 00:26:12,774
Means you're really good in bed.

447
00:26:14,692 --> 00:26:17,632
I've heard lots of stories
about you.

448
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:22,517
But I mean I've never gotten
into experiences except for myself.

449
00:26:22,687 --> 00:26:24,035
Get off him, Joanie.

450
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,626
Joanie Pinchel, Tim?
Really?

451
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,049
Oh, man...

452
00:26:35,424 --> 00:26:38,550
Why is it the minute you walk in school
you turn into some dumb jerk?

453
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,553
What is the problem
with being a Panther, now?

454
00:26:41,723 --> 00:26:43,778
Everything!
And everyone looks at you

455
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:46,161
like the pinnacle
of the dumbest part of it.

456
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:48,310
And you just totally play into it.

457
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:52,397
- No idea what you're talking about.
- Really?

458
00:26:52,657 --> 00:26:56,109
You know what the problem is?
You don't take me seriously.

459
00:26:56,369 --> 00:26:59,154
- I'm some fling to you.
- You're not a fling.

460
00:27:01,304 --> 00:27:03,154
Okay, then what's the problem?

461
00:27:06,187 --> 00:27:08,955
- Shoot.
- You wanna know what the problem is?

462
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:11,750
You scare me.

463
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:16,922
- I scare you?
- You scare me. You're Tim Riggins.

464
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:19,572
You show up drunk to school.
You don't...

465
00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:23,644
You got rally girls do your homework
for you. You don't go to class.

466
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:27,661
Your relationships last
about 20 minutes.

467
00:27:27,831 --> 00:27:31,771
How am I supposed to take you seriously
if you don't take yourself seriously?

468
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,975
Sorry to barge in on you now,
don't mean to bother you.

469
00:27:48,145 --> 00:27:51,344
I had to stop by and apologize
for those smoothies today

470
00:27:51,514 --> 00:27:54,406
'cause that was one dumb ass move.

471
00:27:54,576 --> 00:27:55,961
I heard on the radio,

472
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:58,129
record-high sum.
I figured

473
00:27:58,389 --> 00:28:01,564
I make this big gesture and now
you must think I'm one of those

474
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:04,384
in your face football dads, now.
So, sorry.

475
00:28:04,635 --> 00:28:05,977
That is my apology.

476
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,182
- I can't take that.
- Oh, come on.

477
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:12,183
That's a nice bottle of scotch
and those are 2 Cuban cigars.

478
00:28:12,353 --> 00:28:14,521
- If I were you, I would take those.
- I'm sure they are,

479
00:28:14,782 --> 00:28:16,265
but I can't take that.

480
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:19,843
Can I tell you what I hate?

481
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:24,197
I hate all those bozos on the radio
clamoring for your job.

482
00:28:25,128 --> 00:28:27,155
All those people,
they say you made a mistake

483
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:29,227
building an offense
around Smash Williams.

484
00:28:29,397 --> 00:28:32,551
Where were those people
when you won the State Championship

485
00:28:32,721 --> 00:28:34,418
with that strategy?
Please!

486
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,541
If you have a star
like Smash,

487
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:40,685
you build a team around him.
Period.

488
00:28:41,378 --> 00:28:43,927
- We just need a couple of wins.
- That'll shut them up.

489
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,164
That probably won't,
but it's a start.

490
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:48,730
And what you did
with Matt Saracen...

491
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:50,807
That truly amazes me.

492
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,600
Well, he's a great talent.

493
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,516
That's the thing.
He is not a great talent.

494
00:28:55,686 --> 00:28:57,371
He is an average talent.

495
00:28:57,848 --> 00:29:00,692
He is 5'9".
He runs a 4'7, 9'40,

496
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:02,771
and he has a mediocre arm at best.

497
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,710
Only a great coach like you
could've ever made it to State with him.

498
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,842
- I don't know about that.
- I do.

499
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:12,593
That's why I'm here, Coach.
My boy, J.D.

500
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:15,086
He's the real deal.

501
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:19,711
He is a great quarterback and
I want him mentored by a great coach.

502
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:23,833
And that is why I moved my family
to Dillon, Texas.

503
00:29:25,314 --> 00:29:28,303
You tell me that you moved here
from Dallas just for this football team?

504
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:31,181
For you, sir.
For you.

505
00:29:32,212 --> 00:29:34,784
You are looking
at the next Jason Street.

506
00:29:35,223 --> 00:29:37,520
You got a franchise sitting
right under your nose.

507
00:29:39,493 --> 00:29:41,207
All you gotta do is sniff.

508
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:44,361
- Anyway...
- I can't take these.

509
00:29:44,932 --> 00:29:46,698
A gift given is a gift given.

510
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,107
If you care to pass it on
to somebody else,

511
00:29:49,277 --> 00:29:51,416
be my guest.
I'm looking forward to Friday.

512
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:53,309
Hope J.D. gets some snaps.

513
00:30:04,248 --> 00:30:06,925
- Emily, how are you?
- Can I have a second?

514
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:08,908
What's going on?
You're here late.

515
00:30:09,078 --> 00:30:10,929
I just wanted you
to hear this from me.

516
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:14,307
I took a position at St. Matthews.

517
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:19,396
Oh, no!
Emily, please, no!

518
00:30:19,656 --> 00:30:22,211
They have smaller classrooms,
more resources.

519
00:30:22,381 --> 00:30:25,985
I love this school, but I just wanna
have what I need to do my job.

520
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,279
I'm sorry, Tami.

521
00:30:45,283 --> 00:30:46,381
It's 9:45.

522
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:48,491
I know. I had to stay and...

523
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:52,632
make photocopies
of the new budget

524
00:30:53,206 --> 00:30:54,764
for the whole staff

525
00:30:55,024 --> 00:30:58,519
because the district
won't let us pay secretaries' overtime.

526
00:30:59,697 --> 00:31:01,299
And you know what else?

527
00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:02,992
Miss Walker quit.

528
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:05,856
Cause she's going to St. Matthews,
'cause at St. Matthews,

529
00:31:06,026 --> 00:31:08,987
they have smaller classes
and they have resources.

530
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:11,097
So that's where she's going.

531
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,112
I feel like an idiot.

532
00:31:18,282 --> 00:31:21,664
I thought I was gonna go in there
with all my great ideas, and...

533
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,212
They don't need my great ideas.
They just need money.

534
00:31:26,472 --> 00:31:27,622
Don't do that.

535
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:30,875
Come here.
You'll be alright.

536
00:31:31,538 --> 00:31:33,011
It'll be alright.

537
00:31:37,471 --> 00:31:38,641
It's early on.

538
00:31:40,216 --> 00:31:43,266
5 years from now,
you'll look back and laugh at it.

539
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:47,025
You're just trying to get laid.

540
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:48,865
It's 9:45.

541
00:31:49,357 --> 00:31:50,357
Honey...

542
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,783
Is this Julie's new schedule?

543
00:31:56,425 --> 00:31:58,324
Oh, shoot!

544
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:00,583
She's in this stupid

545
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:03,917
- Munios's English AP class.
- It's alright. I signed it.

546
00:32:04,593 --> 00:32:07,739
What are you talking about?
You did not tell her that was alright.

547
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:10,531
The whole conversation was
that she needs AP English class

548
00:32:10,701 --> 00:32:12,550
- She is taking some.
- ... with Dr. Wells.

549
00:32:14,988 --> 00:32:16,681
Should I not have signed it for?

550
00:32:17,427 --> 00:32:19,807
She needed someone to sign
the piece of paper

551
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:22,936
'cause she was going to school,
she couldn't get in touch with you...

552
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:25,438
she couldn't talk to you,
so I signed it for her.

553
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:27,395
Honey, we gonna
change the schedule.

554
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:30,515
We can't change it.
Dad already signed off on it.

555
00:32:30,752 --> 00:32:33,738
Did you not understand the part
where I said that you had to be

556
00:32:33,998 --> 00:32:35,398
in Dr. Wells English class?

557
00:32:35,568 --> 00:32:37,872
They are both AP English teachers,
correct?

558
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:39,042
Correct.

559
00:32:39,212 --> 00:32:42,206
But as you well know, Dr. Wells
is a much more experienced teacher.

560
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:45,026
Today was the last day
you could change it.

561
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:46,711
That's why I signed it.

562
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,380
Well, you know what's great, babe?
The great thing is: I'm the principal.

563
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,008
And that's something I can change.
So that's gonna be changed, okay?

564
00:32:54,268 --> 00:32:56,344
- Mom you can't do...
- End of the discussion.

565
00:32:56,604 --> 00:32:59,159
- Why are you getting so mad?
- Don't you raise your voices.

566
00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:02,512
- Did you know you're supposed...
- That is the end of the discussion!

567
00:33:02,836 --> 00:33:05,728
Come here. Did you know you weren't
supposed to be in Munios's class?

568
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:08,002
I'm asking.

569
00:33:09,043 --> 00:33:12,569
When you see that car in our driveway,
you're gonna be 25.

570
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:30,578
You know what
we're looking at, right now?

571
00:33:30,748 --> 00:33:33,824
A bunch of white people that can't dance
and need to lose all weight.

572
00:33:33,994 --> 00:33:36,165
My future, Landry.
Right there.

573
00:33:36,335 --> 00:33:39,637
Right in front of me.
I'm gonna become my sister, then my mom.

574
00:33:40,445 --> 00:33:42,473
I don't think I'll be
any different, you know?

575
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,402
Shut your mouth!

576
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,165
Mandy, go ahead.

577
00:33:57,761 --> 00:34:00,305
I know we've only been dating
for 5 weeks,

578
00:34:00,475 --> 00:34:02,035
and, you know...

579
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:04,871
When we started dating,
I saw a future for you

580
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:06,944
and me. Here, here...

581
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:08,889
And here in Dillon, Texas,

582
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:12,417
I see you and me
having like, 3 or 4

583
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:15,234
little Mandys and Billys
running around.

584
00:34:15,404 --> 00:34:17,842
Maybe, maybe less.
But, uh...

585
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:22,042
I humble myself,
here in "Seven <i>señoritas</i> cantina",

586
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:24,974
and I ask you:
will you marry me?

587
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:28,616
Will you spend
the rest of your life with me?

588
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:33,149
Yes!

589
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:54,924
Honey, honey, don't be blunt.

590
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:58,007
There's a man for you in Dillon
right here, maybe in this room.

591
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:00,760
I gotta sit down.

592
00:35:13,138 --> 00:35:14,139
Hey, honey.

593
00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:16,743
Billy Riggins just proposed
to my sister.

594
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,695
Congratulations.

595
00:35:18,955 --> 00:35:21,906
It's not worth congratulating. They're
just gonna have a kid and get divorced.

596
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:26,158
She's gonna spend the rest of her life
going after Billy for child support.

597
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:28,617
Look, I love my sister.
I do.

598
00:35:28,787 --> 00:35:31,903
And I want her to be happy,
and hope she will be.

599
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:34,920
But I don't wanna end up like her.

600
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,517
And the thing is,
is that I am good at maths.

601
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:41,658
I'm good with numbers.
I would be great at business.

602
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:44,511
I want that for myself.
I want that so badly.

603
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:46,739
I'll do anything to go to College.

604
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:50,010
The thing is, vice-principal Trucks,
he thinks I'm a moron.

605
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,687
I know you're the principal now
and I'm so proud of you for that.

606
00:35:52,947 --> 00:35:55,070
I know you're super busy, but...

607
00:35:56,308 --> 00:35:57,694
I need your help.

608
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:03,406
Come on in, honey.
Come on, come on.

609
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,133
You're late.

610
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:25,470
You're not dressed.

611
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:27,991
What's going on?

612
00:36:28,364 --> 00:36:30,734
I'm not gonna do this anymore,
Coach T.

613
00:36:33,254 --> 00:36:35,445
Well, you're not gonna do what?

614
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,984
Pretend like I got a shot in hell
of getting a scholarship.

615
00:36:40,244 --> 00:36:42,236
Playing football again.
This is over.

616
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:47,551
You let me tell you something...

617
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:50,443
Look, I appreciate
everything you've been doing,

618
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:54,348
but the truth is,
I'm never gonna be who I was.

619
00:36:56,221 --> 00:36:58,672
I gotta start
living my life as Brian.

620
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,961
I'm never gonna be Smash again.

621
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:14,714
All right, Brian.
It's your decision.

622
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:19,899
Thanks for everything, Coach.

623
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,060
I had the best time of my life
on this field.

624
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:46,425
Miss Colette...

625
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:49,976
Here's my application for the University
of Texas. I'd appreciate your thoughts.

626
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:52,685
Also, I'm gonna be running
for students council president.

627
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:55,685
Here is my petition
with all my signatures. One more thing.

628
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:59,355
Don't tell me that I can't get
to college ever again.

629
00:37:59,864 --> 00:38:02,233
If I don't get in,
then you can call me an idiot.

630
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:05,153
But I don't wanna hear that
from you again. See,

631
00:38:05,376 --> 00:38:07,409
I don't accept that fate
for myself.

632
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:10,366
And I'm gonna do
everything in my power to avoid it.

633
00:38:15,924 --> 00:38:16,924
Hey, hon.

634
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:26,017
You were right...
about the all Julie thing.

635
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:31,678
I should have spoken to you
about that beforehand.

636
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,471
Well, I think that's true.

637
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:37,459
You know, I wouldn't have done that
myself the way you did, but...

638
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:41,621
she needed to have more conversation,
I know I wasn't available for that.

639
00:38:46,143 --> 00:38:47,635
Thank you for the apology.

640
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:50,071
I don't want you to be mad at me
on big opening night.

641
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:53,199
I can never be mad at my wife.
It's a damn principle.

642
00:38:53,871 --> 00:38:56,746
All right.
I just got to get back to work.

643
00:38:57,007 --> 00:38:59,128
See? I'm not mad at you.

644
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:04,807
Is that a new computer?

645
00:39:06,488 --> 00:39:08,966
Didn't they just get new computers
that year before we arrive?

646
00:39:09,384 --> 00:39:13,011
Couple years ago, these are networks
so we can communicate in house.

647
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:15,430
Well, nice for you.

648
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:20,479
How is it so cool in here?

649
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,562
It feels like it's 68°.

650
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:24,314
It's the way I like it.

651
00:39:25,556 --> 00:39:27,206
It's the way I like it.

652
00:39:31,022 --> 00:39:33,657
<i>The long dry season is over, folks.</i>

653
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:37,914
<i>We are finally back under the lights,
and we are ready to play some football.</i>

654
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,705
Set!

655
00:39:41,953 --> 00:39:44,042
<i>Matt Saracen lines up
on the center.</i>

656
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:48,088
<i>He steps back,
and pitches up to Riggins.</i>

657
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,851
<i>Riggins has it, he's got room...</i>

658
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:53,176
<i>He cuts up in the middle.
He runs in the second area,</i>

659
00:39:53,438 --> 00:39:54,605
<i>puts his shoulder down,</i>

660
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:58,185
<i>and Riggins has smashed his way
through the second area,</i>

661
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:02,341
<i>and the Dillon Panthers
are in the red zone, play one.</i>

662
00:40:11,872 --> 00:40:13,049
<i>Saracen back.</i>

663
00:40:13,902 --> 00:40:16,079
<i>He answers to Riggins,
he comes inside,</i>

664
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:18,923
<i>Oh, big stiff arm.
He clears another tackle,</i>

665
00:40:19,093 --> 00:40:22,385
<i>Riggins running like a man possessed,
he's in the barn, folks!</i>

666
00:40:22,801 --> 00:40:24,207
<i>Touchdown, Panthers!</i>

667
00:40:27,931 --> 00:40:29,630
<i>Saracen over the ball.</i>

668
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:30,797
Hut!

669
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,871
<i>Here's the snap, he brings back.</i>

670
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:35,191
<i>Oh, Saracen, he's gonna keep it!</i>

671
00:40:35,564 --> 00:40:38,263
<i>Nice moves on the inside,
he's picked up some blockers,</i>

672
00:40:38,525 --> 00:40:41,808
<i>and it is a touchdown
for Matt Saracen!</i>

673
00:40:50,018 --> 00:40:53,069
<i>It ends up to Riggins, in the middle.
He's got one man to beat!</i>

674
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:56,990
<i>Oh, he's airborne!
Touchdown, Tim Riggins!</i>

675
00:40:58,044 --> 00:40:59,409
<i>He ain't not Smash Williams,</i>

676
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,996
<i>but Tim Riggins is smashing
everything in his path.</i>

677
00:41:03,451 --> 00:41:05,816
<i>It's a brand new year
for the Dillon Panthers,</i>

678
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:09,503
<i>and Coach Taylor is putting on a clinic,
here tonight.</i>

679
00:41:17,248 --> 00:41:19,804
<i>Coach Taylor is taking out
his starting backfield.</i>

680
00:41:20,066 --> 00:41:23,308
<i>They've done an absolutely
outstanding job, tonight.</i>

681
00:41:25,572 --> 00:41:28,897
<i>And here he comes, folks.
J.D. "young gun" McCoy,</i>

682
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:31,650
<i>the phenom from Big D.</i>

683
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,825
<i>J.D. takes the snap.</i>

684
00:41:39,187 --> 00:41:42,206
<i>The boy is back to pass,
he sets up, and he fires.</i>

685
00:41:42,478 --> 00:41:46,187
<i>He throws a strike
and completion of the middle.</i>

686
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,801
<i>Boy! He's really looking sharp here</i>

687
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:53,900
<i>in these closing minutes.</i>

688
00:42:09,824 --> 00:42:12,315
<i>Oh, my God!
A perfect pass!</i>

689
00:42:12,827 --> 00:42:16,486
<i>Just sent on the wings of angels
into the receiver's hands.</i>

690
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:20,824
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
it is Jason Street reincarnated.</i>

691
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:23,952
<i>That boy can throw a foot ball!</i>

692
00:43:10,058 --> 00:43:13,748
Did you hear that J.D's dad
has donated

693
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,589
the Jumbo Tron?

694
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:19,976
Hey, Steve, how are you doing?

695
00:43:20,146 --> 00:43:23,636
Hey, Coach. Great win, congratulations.
Thanks for putting my boy in there.

696
00:43:23,898 --> 00:43:27,278
You know, we always give the other boys
a chance once we get one in the bag.

697
00:43:27,448 --> 00:43:29,998
- I appreciate it.
- You're very welcome.

698
00:43:32,007 --> 00:43:33,438
Coach, good job.

699
00:43:33,939 --> 00:43:35,460
It's completely digital.

700
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,516
It's got 7.1 surround sound.

701
00:43:38,905 --> 00:43:40,073
It's the newest thing.

702
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:44,157
It is just a beautiful Jumbo Tron,
I'm telling you.

703
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:47,368
Tami Taylor is the brain child
behind all of this.

704
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,787
I think we should
give her the credit.

705
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,350
The Jumbo Tron!

706
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,044
It is gonna bring us
national attention to you.

707
00:43:55,305 --> 00:43:56,794
Can I talk to you for a quick sec?

708
00:43:57,355 --> 00:43:58,838
- Sure, excuse me.
- Alright.

709
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,630
Just a quick sec.

710
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:03,341
Yes, Ma'am.

711
00:44:07,121 --> 00:44:10,059
You know what?
I couldn't sleep, last night.

712
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,352
I know, it's hot.
It's the hottest...

713
00:44:12,613 --> 00:44:14,638
It wasn't because of the heat,
it was because

714
00:44:14,808 --> 00:44:18,441
I can't stop worrying
about all the things school needs.

715
00:44:18,611 --> 00:44:20,996
School needs basic,
basic things, like...

716
00:44:21,267 --> 00:44:22,648
teachers, for one.

717
00:44:23,252 --> 00:44:26,574
You know, and pencils,
and chalk, and textbooks.

718
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,308
- We need these.
- I know.

719
00:44:29,478 --> 00:44:31,570
I'm totally supporting
of the academics.

720
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,865
Last year, we did the bike sell,
we did the keg sell.

721
00:44:34,035 --> 00:44:37,126
You know, we did, I think,
$3.000 on that heavy duty thing.

722
00:44:37,388 --> 00:44:39,712
We can do that again.
We're gonna get those teachers.

723
00:44:39,974 --> 00:44:41,005
I've decided

724
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:44,968
I'm going to reallocate
the Jumbo Tron funds to academics.

725
00:44:48,023 --> 00:44:50,504
No, wait,
Tami, the funds have been...

726
00:44:50,674 --> 00:44:53,165
I've checked with the district.
It turns out, according to the laws,

727
00:44:53,335 --> 00:44:56,902
the principle has the final jurisdiction
over the allocation funds.

728
00:44:57,072 --> 00:45:00,108
In the past,
the way we've always done is...

729
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:02,716
This year, it's gonna be different.

730
00:45:02,886 --> 00:45:05,154
I'm telling you
there is not gonna be a Jumbo Tron.

731
00:45:05,629 --> 00:45:06,870
I'm sorry.

732
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,069
We'll talk later if you need, okay?

733
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,964
Hey, can I steal her
for two seconds?

734
00:45:24,371 --> 00:45:26,786
- Sorry, guys.
- Go ahead, bye.

735
00:45:28,545 --> 00:45:30,129
- How are you?
- Good.

736
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:32,682
Two things: thank you...

737
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,620
for kinda keeping my ass in gear
cause I know I needed it,

738
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,479
and I kinda owe tonight to you.

739
00:45:40,348 --> 00:45:41,274
And two...

740
00:45:41,852 --> 00:45:44,502
I'm okay if you don't tell
anyone about us.

741
00:45:44,827 --> 00:45:46,779
As long as this works with you.

742
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:23,650
I just told Buddy Garrity

743
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:27,167
I'm gonna reallocate
the Jumbo Tron funds to academics.

744
00:46:39,356 --> 00:46:40,625
Thank you, everybody!

745
00:46:40,887 --> 00:46:42,179
Thank you, James.

746
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:45,254
James Hent for West Texas,
ladies and gentlemen!

747
00:46:48,478 --> 00:46:49,478
Now...

748
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:51,494
Without further ado,

749
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:53,729
ladies and gentlemen...

750
00:46:54,054 --> 00:46:56,314
Great moments of Panthers!

751
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:37,200
Get in!

752
00:48:39,098 --> 00:48:42,448
You realize this is the wildest sport
in history, right?

753
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,601
- It's yours!
- My point, Coach.

754
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:32,273
You wanna work at the Alamo Freeze,
I don't give a damn!

755
00:49:32,443 --> 00:49:33,919
Go ahead, work there.

756
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:36,676
Look me in the eye,
tell me you don't wanna play football.

757
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,887
I didn't say I didn't want to,
I said I can't.

758
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,370
I don't buy that crap.

759
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,398
I lost my scholarship,

760
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:52,893
I'm slow,

761
00:49:53,896 --> 00:49:55,550
and no school wants me.

762
00:49:56,388 --> 00:49:57,467
How's that?

763
00:49:58,184 --> 00:49:59,579
I don't know how it works.

764
00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:01,619
Maybe you have
to change your game!

765
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:03,695
Humble yourself, I don't know!

766
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:06,461
But I can promise you this...

767
00:50:06,813 --> 00:50:07,957
We can figure it out.

768
00:50:08,632 --> 00:50:11,182
If you want this,
I will help you get it.

769
00:50:12,691 --> 00:50:14,745
Into college,
and playing football again.

770
00:50:14,915 --> 00:50:17,462
And I can promise you
I won't stop...

771
00:50:17,855 --> 00:50:19,366
until you get there.

772
00:50:23,475 --> 00:50:26,225
Can I ask you
why this means so much to you?

773
00:50:26,647 --> 00:50:29,097
'Cause I need something good
to happen.

774
00:50:55,985 --> 00:50:58,132
There is nothing wrong
with your knee.

775
00:50:59,037 --> 00:51:02,136
Man, if you want this,
it is waiting for you.

776
00:51:06,694 --> 00:51:08,344
I can't want it for you.
