1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:03,172
- That is one fine ass cowboy.
- Really?

2
00:00:03,334 --> 00:00:04,798
<i>... Texas, Cash Browler!</i>

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,467
Okay, if you want to choose

4
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:09,887
- a guy that rides horses...
- Yes, I'm choosing him!

5
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:13,349
There's this abandoned power plant,
they got copper wire out there.

6
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:15,309
We were gonna go out there
and steal it.

7
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:18,326
- I don't look for you to call me mom.
- Well, what do you want?

8
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:20,814
I just really would love to see
if I can lend a hand.

9
00:00:20,976 --> 00:00:24,318
J.D. McCoy, he's got the best arm any
high school quarterback I've ever seen.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,153
I know what I've got
with Matt Saracen.

11
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:29,406
If I bench him, halfway through
his senior year, it will kill him.

12
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:31,867
Let's go, let's go!

13
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,520
Hey, we run red eagle! Rig,
you're over George's side to mark...

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,412
<i>Now Coach Taylor's experiment,
alternating two quarterbacks,</i>

15
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:40,191
<i>is backfired in a big way.</i>

16
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:42,823
<i>His team is dazed and confused.</i>

17
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:47,508
<i>And that's the third
delay of game penalty.</i>

18
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:49,718
What is that?!

19
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,234
<i>Here we go again
with the switcheroo.</i>

20
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,337
<i>McCoy is coming in for Saracen.
Buckle up, folks.</i>

21
00:00:57,847 --> 00:00:59,360
You stay right there!

22
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:02,523
Josh, what are you doing?
Go over there.

23
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:05,317
- J.D!
- On the side!

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,027
Together, come on!

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,155
<i>Now, J.D. McCoy
is not fairing any better.</i>

26
00:01:10,318 --> 00:01:13,117
<i>Coach Taylor's indecision
in picking a quarterback</i>

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,160
<i>is a certified disaster.</i>

28
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,381
<i>McNaulty over the ball...</i>

29
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:23,293
<i>There's a snap, it's a fake hand off,
swing pass to the right.</i>

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,923
Pick him up!

31
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:29,216
<i>He cuts inside and picks up a block.
He is gonna score.</i>

32
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:30,551
<i>Touchdown.</i>

33
00:01:30,877 --> 00:01:33,554
Oh, hell, oh, hell!

34
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:37,992
<i>Panthers are coming off for lost,
and if they loose this one,</i>

35
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:40,853
<i>they can kiss this season goodbye.</i>

36
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:44,148
Let's keep our composed right there.
Do you understand me?

37
00:01:44,457 --> 00:01:46,976
Stay calm, stay steady.
They're getting confused out there.

38
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:49,319
We're gonna win this game thing,
you understand?

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,907
Let's go, come on.

40
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:17,222
Here we go again!

41
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:24,891
<i>Touchdown, he is in, folks!
Touchdown Panthers...</i>

42
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,690
<i>Oh my, what a pass!</i>

43
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:30,525
<i>Matt Saracen
has been hanging tough</i>

44
00:02:30,645 --> 00:02:34,424
<i>but J.D. McCoy
is </i>on fuego<i> tonight.</i>

45
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:38,243
<i>The freshman has really shown
his stuff in this new offense.</i>

46
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:42,376
<i>McNaulty back to the pass...</i>

47
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:44,815
<i>Bubble screen to the left,
he cuts inside</i>

48
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:47,864
<i>and he takes it to the barn.
Touchdown.</i>

49
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:51,965
<i>This has turned out to be
one wild shoot-out, folks.</i>

50
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:54,510
Let's go, bring it in!
Bring it in, let's go!

51
00:02:54,672 --> 00:02:57,296
Listen up, J.D, you're in,
you understand?

52
00:02:57,418 --> 00:03:01,061
We're going straight up the field,
play pass, we got to get what we can.

53
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,060
You understand me?
Clock management.

54
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:05,315
Let's take it to 'em.
Let's go.

55
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:11,568
<i>It looks like the torch
has been passed to the freshman.</i>

56
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:14,196
<i>It was Saracen's turn
but J.D. McCoy</i>

57
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,949
<i>is coming in
with under a minute to go.</i>

58
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:19,952
<i>McCoy in the shotgun,
there's the snap.</i>

59
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,612
<i>He rose right,</i>

60
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:24,915
<i>he's got Brooks on the edge,
inside the thirty yard line.</i>

61
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:26,583
Let's go, let's go!

62
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:31,213
<i>Now there's no more time-out</i>

63
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:34,174
<i>and the clock is rolling,
they're gonna have to hurry.</i>

64
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,219
<i>There's the snap, he looks left...</i>

65
00:03:38,027 --> 00:03:39,721
<i>He's got a man over the middle.</i>

66
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:41,709
<i>And a nice touch pass
to Tim Riggins.</i>

67
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:45,310
<i>He's down inside the fifteen to the ten.
And a big hit.</i>

68
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:49,273
<i>As Tim Riggins goes down
inside the five.</i>

69
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:50,762
<i>That's a first down folks,</i>

70
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:54,127
<i>and that'll stop the clock
while the refs reset the ball.</i>

71
00:03:57,522 --> 00:04:00,858
9-29 down, key that damn defense.
You understand me? Get there, let's go.

72
00:04:00,978 --> 00:04:03,537
<i>And Matt Saracen
is going back into the game.</i>

73
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,238
<i>The ball is set,
the clock is winding.</i>

74
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:09,672
<i>Coach Taylor has this McNaulty defense
trying to sub</i>

75
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,004
<i>for the Saracen offense.
But there is no time.</i>

76
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:15,584
<i>We are under ten seconds, folks.
They're gonna have to hurry.</i>

77
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:16,758
Blue, 8!

78
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:18,852
<i>And it's too late.
There is the snap.</i>

79
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:20,621
<i>It's a hand-off to Riggins...</i>

80
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,932
<i>No! Saracen has the ball
on the keeper</i>

81
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:26,219
<i>What a call!
Touchdown.</i>

82
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:29,205
<i>My grandmother
could have walked that one in.</i>

83
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:31,983
<i>Panthers win, Panthers win!</i>

84
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:45,783
- Good game, Matt!
- You too.

85
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:56,113
<i>Let's the coronation begin.
There's another king in the castle:</i>

86
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:59,593
<i>J.D. "young gun" McCoy
has arrived</i>

87
00:04:59,756 --> 00:05:02,179
<i>and he is the real deal, my friends!</i>

88
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:17,946
3x05: EVERY ROSE HAS ITS THORN

89
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:22,944
Subtitles: Team Panthers

00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:30,201

loky34, ouazo, tactactac, Teardrop

92
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:05,070
Thank you for doing that, honey.
I appreciate that.

93
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,704
What is that mess on your leg?

94
00:06:07,864 --> 00:06:10,731
Were you drawing on yourself
with pens or something?

95
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:14,127
It's a tattoo. Do you guys
want tortilla soup on your salad?

96
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:17,867
Like a little lick-n-stick tattoo?
That seems a little...

97
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:19,689
A little young, doesn't it, for you?

98
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:22,260
I've a real tattoo,
the ones lick-n-stick are modeled after.

99
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:28,333
What did you... What?

100
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:29,934
You're kidding?

101
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:32,348
It's a tattoo.

102
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:34,856
- Where do you have a tattoo?
- On my ankle.

103
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:38,568
What were you thinking?
Why did you get a tattoo? Honey!

104
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:41,807
What? I was walking home from work,
and I had my paycheck,

105
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:44,407
- I've always wanted one so I bought it.
- You got to be kidding me.

106
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,119
I knew that job was a terrible idea.
You have permanently

107
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,372
- marked your body. Your beautiful body.
- Is that what you do with your money?

108
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:54,302
Your skin is now ruined.
Do you realize that? Forever.

109
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:56,919
- What were you thinking?
- Tyra said you'd get upset about it.

110
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,173
What? Tyra? What do you want Tyra
to have to do with anything?

111
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,092
- Tyra was there when I got it.
- Well, that's just fascinating.

112
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,386
Really? That's fascinating?

113
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:08,765
- Don't you dare talk to me like that.
- It's a tattoo, mum.

114
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:10,558
It's this big,
you're acting as though

115
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:12,977
I have giant, like,
dancing Popeye on my biceps...

116
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,939
- Don't be a smart ass.
- I'm not being a smart ass.

117
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:19,776
I'm telling you, it's done, it's over,
it's on my leg. Too late.

118
00:07:30,546 --> 00:07:33,966
You've thrown away my porn again?
I ain't finished with this one yet.

119
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,178
I'm pretty sure, I can tell
what comes out in the end.

120
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:39,828
Dude, you do not have
to hide porn from a baby.

121
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:42,129
Babies are not freaked out
by boobies.

122
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:44,425
There's more than boobs
in those magazines, first of all.

123
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:46,528
What? Vaginas?
Babies love vaginas, man.

124
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:48,974
They took a trip through one.
It's like looking at a postcard.

125
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,016
How many times do I have to tell you?
Clean up all this before the baby comes.

126
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:54,060
- OK?
- Baby's here. Baby's here.

127
00:07:54,317 --> 00:07:56,867
- There's the little monkey.
- Hey, guys.

128
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:58,689
- How's it going?
- How's the boy?

129
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:00,455
He's doing well.

130
00:08:02,802 --> 00:08:04,267
Someone is wiped out.

131
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:07,573
Hey, little man! You wake up
a little bit and we'll play, okay?

132
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:13,037
I'll be working an extra three-hours
shift tonight. I'll be back by ten.

133
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:15,150
- To pick him up.
- Alright.

134
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,833
OK, bye, precious.

135
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:19,430
Look...

136
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:23,989
You know, Erin, ten o'clock,
it's awfully late to be moving Noah.

137
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:27,437
Maybe he could sleep over.

138
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:30,758
Or he can just move in.

139
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:33,434
Our names are next to each other
on the birth certificate.

140
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:37,554
I figured it'd be easy enough to
put them next to each other on a lease.

141
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:40,773
Or you can just pick Noah up at ten.

142
00:08:42,463 --> 00:08:44,861
God, I wish it was that easy.

143
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:47,154
I wish I could think about

144
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,551
long-term things but...

145
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:51,654
Well, I'm still trying
to get more hours

146
00:08:51,774 --> 00:08:54,630
at the dealership so you can
come back to part-time.

147
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:58,206
- It's just...
- I know. Car sales suck right now.

148
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,502
I'll come up with plenty
of more money though, I promise.

149
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:05,131
I know you're working hard,
thank you.

150
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:07,842
Don't work too hard, okay?

151
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,227
- Be good.
- Bye, mama.

152
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:11,846
- Bye.
- See you at ten.

153
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,886
Damn it, Missy.

154
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:24,817
No, I do not understand
why you haven't sold this house yet.

155
00:09:25,662 --> 00:09:27,929
It's steal at 250.

156
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:31,051
No, don't tell me that,
that's just an excuse.

157
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:33,039
Listen, I'll leave or take 220.

158
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,453
Yes, I will. I'll take 220.
Just get the thing sold.

159
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:38,882
No, I don't want to hear
your excuses, Missy.

160
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:40,207
Listen, I...

161
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:43,252
I've been a salesman my whole life.
Don't tell me how to sell.

162
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:47,454
All right, here's what you do.
You go out and you just tell everyone

163
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,065
that when all the scared rats
are leaving a sinking market,

164
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:55,002
that's when a real entrepreneur
steps in.

165
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,931
A true visionary.

166
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:58,809
You say it, just like that. No...

167
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:02,772
I am emerging money here,
Missy, why... Wait!

168
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:06,488
Those guys are gonna come out
on a black, 8 parade, Coach Crowley.

169
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:08,604
Slide the sandbag over,
and punch him in the mouth.

170
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:12,031
We go double Y, motion away,
he's gotta drop and cover.

171
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:15,809
Matt and J.D. will need two more
wideouts if we stay with spread.

172
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:18,450
- You understand that, don't you?
- What about our power game, Coach?

173
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,624
- None of them {\guys }can leave the block.
- We sub in an out-and-down distance,

174
00:10:21,784 --> 00:10:23,608
start double flex,
it works for both of them.

175
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:26,045
You want to install another set?
Another set?

176
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:28,673
As more blocking schemes, more raps?

177
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,217
More zone reach for Matt and J.D?

178
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:35,137
- Good, it'd place our strength.
- No, our strength is J.D. McCoy, Coach.

179
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,080
Go on.

180
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:44,437
All right, we've beaten McNaulty.

181
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:47,130
And it was a great strategy
to platoon that game,

182
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,766
but we're done with that.

183
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:50,257
We're passed that.

184
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:53,027
Matt's a tough kid.

185
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:54,914
He'll be all right.

186
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:57,934
And he deserves all of our respect.

187
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:00,789
And we all feel this, Coach.

188
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:05,531
But you've got to tell him
the truth, Eric.

189
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:12,216
There's gotta be something big,
people don't have what they need.

190
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,372
- All right, you got any ideas?
- Sharp pencil.

191
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:21,142
You're onto something. We'll invent
the pencil sharpener all over again.

192
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:23,755
Come on, seriously...

193
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,942
Think about, like...
little things.

194
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:28,232
Like post-it notes.

195
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:31,443
- Just got to focus, you know.
- No, you're right, you're right.

196
00:11:33,315 --> 00:11:35,265
I got nothing. I got nothing.

197
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,948
You could always flip
Buddy Garrity's house.

198
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:42,830
What are you talking about?
It's not an invention.

199
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,541
Well, his house
is on the market for 250.

200
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:47,918
I happen to know he'll take 220.

201
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:50,882
Maybe you throw a 30 in there
and sell it for 350.

202
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,625
I mean, it's flipping houses,
I saw it on TV, it works.

203
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:56,510
Okay, well guess what, genius?
House market sucks right now.

204
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,745
Yeah.

205
00:11:57,865 --> 00:12:01,611
Yeah, it's when all the scared rats are
running away from a sinking market

206
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:03,952
that the real entrepreneurs come in.

207
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,437
The true visionaries.

208
00:12:13,085 --> 00:12:15,571
Well, I'm good with design
and you know this.

209
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:18,861
220 thousands?
What's this? It's a steal.

210
00:12:19,003 --> 00:12:22,286
220,000? How much
would down payment need for 220,000?

211
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,955
35 grand.

212
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:26,781
Yeah, but I don't have that.

213
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,176
Billy and I have
some copper wire money.

214
00:12:31,296 --> 00:12:32,469
So I mean...

215
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,029
We'd all go in on it, but...

216
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:37,259
The only is, you got
to convince that guy.

217
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:02,671
Hey, Coach.

218
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:08,173
J.D. is gonna start Friday.

219
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,502
All right?
You're gonna be QB 2.

220
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:15,730
Okay...

221
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,653
Listen, I want you to know...

222
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:25,708
- I'm willing for making this decision.
- I know.

223
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:27,560
Oh, my lord, have mercy.

224
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,312
Coach Eric Taylor, how are you?

225
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:34,108
- Hello, Mrs. Saracen.
- Mercy! What a surprise to see you

226
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:35,814
- on my door step.
- How are you?

227
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:37,780
I'm great.
Have you had supper?

228
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,923
Yes, ma'am, I have.
Yes, I have.

229
00:13:40,043 --> 00:13:42,741
- I would like to fix you something.
- I appreciate that.

230
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:45,202
Yes, ma'am, I've already...
Thank you very much.

231
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:49,004
- Hello, how do you do?
- It's my mother.

232
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:54,669
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

233
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:57,089
- I heard a lot about you.
- This man walks on water.

234
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,773
Walks on water!

235
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:02,275
- And he's a hero in this house.
- Thank you very much.

236
00:14:02,395 --> 00:14:05,662
I'm gonna get you just something little
that maybe you can take at home.

237
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:08,556
I don't mind to be it.
I don't mind to be it.

238
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,316
Tell your grandma thank you,
would you?

239
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:19,360
I'll see you tomorrow.

240
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:21,905
- Very nice to meet you.
- That's nice to meet you, too.

241
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:30,210
Are you okay?

242
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:35,470
I'm fine.

243
00:14:39,803 --> 00:14:41,605
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

244
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,941
I'm sorry. I understand you're hurting.
This is power ballets?

245
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:09,238
Really? How cliché can you be?

246
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:33,434
Well, let's go.

247
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:38,857
What's going on, Tyra?

248
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:40,400
Nothing.

249
00:15:42,422 --> 00:15:43,805
Nothing's going on?

250
00:15:44,356 --> 00:15:45,530
No, really.

251
00:15:46,218 --> 00:15:48,767
Cause where I sit,
I see you and your senior year

252
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:51,101
kinda going off the deep end
a little bit.

253
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:52,886
And you've been skipping school,

254
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:56,916
and Mr. Tracton said you just
completely screwed up a history test.

255
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,912
You win some, you loose some.

256
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:05,341
Who's the guy in the truck?

257
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:07,133
Excuse me?

258
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:11,096
That man that has been dropping you off
at school every day.

259
00:16:12,965 --> 00:16:15,231
I think I'm allowed
to have a boyfriend, Mrs. T.

260
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:18,689
You are allowed to have a boyfriend.
He didn't look like a boy to me.

261
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:22,183
And I tell you right now,
if that relationship is anything

262
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:25,446
like what I can imagine it is,
that is a one-way ticket to nowhere.

263
00:16:26,305 --> 00:16:28,972
I don't see it as any of your business,
to be honest with you.

264
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:32,494
I feel like it is my business,
because I've made an investment in you.

265
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:36,128
And because I care about you.
I feel like we've made it this far,

266
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:37,251
together.

267
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:42,079
And I don't like what I'm seeing.
I don't like it.

268
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:46,155
So look, we think we can turn
this thing over, about 30 days time.

269
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:49,151
And get you a 20% profit
on your investment.

270
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:51,610
Now, you ain't gonna get
a return like that anywhere else

271
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,598
it doesn't involve
some crazy ass risk.

272
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:58,520
How do I know
this isn't some crazy ass risk?

273
00:16:59,387 --> 00:17:01,189
- Excellent question, Billy.
- That's good.

274
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,275
I tell you why.
Cause people need housing.

275
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:05,860
And in this neck of the woods,
there's a serious lack of

276
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:07,348
upgraded upscale housing.

277
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:10,573
Now, I did some research.
The good houses, they go. Quick.

278
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:13,676
I don't know, Jason.

279
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:15,621
It's a lot at stake here.

280
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:18,456
You know? This is my money
to start a new life with Mindy.

281
00:17:19,132 --> 00:17:21,376
It's a lot at stake here
for all of us, Billy.

282
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:24,129
And that's how I know it's gonna work,
cause we're all gonna get together

283
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,923
- and make it work.
- Teamwork.

284
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,675
It's when all the scared rats
start running away

285
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:31,946
from the sinking market that
the true entrepreneurs come in, Billy.

286
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,973
True visionaries.

287
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:39,353
- I'm a visionary.
- Look at you.

288
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:44,982
- I'm in.
- Grand!

289
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:50,446
- Really?
- Yeah, let's do this! So what's next?

290
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:53,241
We go to the bank tomorrow
to get details on the loan.

291
00:17:53,402 --> 00:17:56,494
We'll probably need a check, though.
From you guys, for the down payment.

292
00:17:56,949 --> 00:17:59,498
- It's gonna be great!
- Alright!

293
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,145
Hey, there, beautiful.
What you looking at?

294
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:11,175
I just got a C- at my history test.

295
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,762
C-? My mom would
make me cake for a C-.

296
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:16,917
Well, you were trying
to be a cowboy,

297
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:19,087
I'm trying to get into college.
A little different.

298
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:21,895
So, how did that meeting
go at the school?

299
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:24,059
Alright, I guess.

300
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:27,108
- She doesn't like you very much.
- They usually don't.

301
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:31,899
No, it's not like she thinks you're bad
or anything. She...

302
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:35,075
thinks you're some cowboy who just
wanders around from town to town.

303
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:37,327
You met me!

304
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:41,073
I like to think
there's more in you than that.

305
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:45,169
Sometimes, {\I guess }it just takes the right
woman to make it more in your heart.

306
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,428
- Didn't you take some this morning?
- I did just take it this morning.

307
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:56,822
- You ever been thrown off a horse?
- No.

308
00:18:56,942 --> 00:18:59,381
It ain't like the aching
goes away real quick.

309
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:02,895
I wouldn't take it if it didn't hurt.
But that hurts. A lot.

310
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:16,639
I feel old.

311
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:22,705
I feel old, and out of control.

312
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:26,335
Why would she go
and get a tattoo like that?

313
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:29,125
- I don't know.
- Why would she do that?

314
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:33,092
You know, it's a rose, and a heart,
and a... What does that even mean?

315
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:35,862
You know, a lot of kids
are getting tattoos

316
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:37,720
and it doesn't have
to mean anything.

317
00:19:37,882 --> 00:19:40,800
No, honey, it means something.
For sure.

318
00:19:42,136 --> 00:19:44,818
Frankly, it doesn't make me feel
any better knowing Tyra was involved.

319
00:19:44,938 --> 00:19:47,815
That girl is just off the deep end
this year.

320
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:50,317
I don't know what
is going on with her.

321
00:19:50,437 --> 00:19:54,021
I think she's becoming
a good old-fashioned bad influence.

322
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:57,878
And that is a slippery slope.

323
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:01,786
What do you mean?

324
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,840
You know, parties, boys...

325
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:07,982
Drugs...

326
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:11,767
I see it at school every day.

327
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:15,306
Not while she's my girl, no, sir.

328
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:22,266
Thank God, you are here!

329
00:20:23,117 --> 00:20:24,673
Little man giving you trouble?

330
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:27,521
Yeah. He's just so fussy, tonight.
I mean...

331
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:30,840
I have no idea why,
and I've got to get some sleep

332
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,946
or I'm gonna pass out...

333
00:20:33,116 --> 00:20:35,319
I don't know,
you have a way with him

334
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:37,572
- of making him...
- Take a break, okay?

335
00:20:37,782 --> 00:20:39,908
I got some exciting news
to tell you.

336
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,160
I got some irons on the fire.
Things are looking...

337
00:20:44,873 --> 00:20:46,840
Things are looking up, so...

338
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,382
Don't go anywhere.

339
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,718
Mile Launder Road.
This feels legit, Billy...

340
00:20:57,878 --> 00:21:01,578
We need the cash, okay? We have
to be at the bank in the morning.

341
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:05,535
Are you kidding me?
Guy Raston?

342
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:08,201
- Just calm down.
- You wanna deal with this cat?

343
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:10,522
Look, man, we didn't have
anyone else to go to...

344
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:13,422
- Anyone would have been better!
- Look at them!

345
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:15,704
If it ain't the Duke boys.

346
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:17,566
They always come back.

347
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,295
How you doing, Timmy?

348
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,620
How's football, man?

349
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:35,631
Did you lose some weight, man?

350
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:38,811
Alright. I give you 10.

351
00:21:39,183 --> 00:21:40,715
That'll work.

352
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:43,202
You want all 3?

353
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:45,850
That's what I just said.
I give you 10 for all 3.

354
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,977
- 10 grand for 3 spools? It's worth...
- Make it 8.

355
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:51,520
- Give me 2 for my hooker.
- What is going on here, Guy?

356
00:21:51,682 --> 00:21:54,440
We talked about this. You know what kind
of legwork I had to do to get...

357
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:57,860
Man, I feel sorry about that.
But do we got a deal, or what?

358
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:00,864
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Seriously, listen!

359
00:22:01,075 --> 00:22:03,660
- We're way in over our heads right now.
- He's robbing us.

360
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,619
{\We robbed these.}
We gotta be at the bank, tomorrow.

361
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:07,140
I don't care, man.

362
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,081
You guys gonna make a deal
or sit around arguing like dumb asses?

363
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:11,624
What the hell did you call me?

364
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,599
I called you a dumb ass, Billy.

365
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:19,548
A stupid, short, white-trash,
red-neck dumb ass.

366
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:21,708
But it ain't all bad,

367
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:26,549
cause, boy, that Mindy gets
one hell of a VIP dance, doesn't she?

368
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:31,979
- Billy, let's go.
- That's good, man.

369
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,482
Billy, come on!
Get off!

370
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,611
Go to the truck!

371
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:43,699
Go, go, go!

372
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,623
Get down!
Get down!

373
00:23:04,543 --> 00:23:05,893
You like that one.

374
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:11,226
Hey, son, I got some news for you.

375
00:23:11,788 --> 00:23:13,812
Your daddy'll buy a house today.

376
00:23:15,693 --> 00:23:18,501
But don't get too excited,
cause it's not for us to live in.

377
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:21,291
I'm gonna fix it up.
Then I'm gonna sell it.

378
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,071
Then you and me, and your mommy...

379
00:23:24,884 --> 00:23:26,243
can live together.

380
00:23:28,777 --> 00:23:30,316
Yeah, I like it, too.

381
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:08,709
I understand that your friends are late.
I'm sure there's a explanation

382
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:11,327
but unfortunately,
we have to have everyone present.

383
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:15,666
- That shower could be keeping them.
- They'll be here, though.

384
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:19,211
- They will definitely be here.
- Always late, but worth the wait,

385
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:21,241
as those license plates always say.

386
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:23,090
Just a few minutes, Barb,
I promise.

387
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:33,440
You got a plan?
What are we gonna tell?

388
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,388
Awesome! The idiot brigade is here.
It's only 45 minutes late.

389
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,605
- And where is your suit?
- We got a little messed up.

390
00:24:39,524 --> 00:24:42,484
No thanks to you 2,
the bank has approved our loan.

391
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:43,736
No way...

392
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:45,904
We played the crippled
football stars not giving up.

393
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:48,281
Our guy was so emotional,
so believable.

394
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:50,638
Cause I'm a crippled football star
who's not giving up.

395
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:53,009
Where is the money?
We gotta put it in the bank by tomorrow.

396
00:24:53,129 --> 00:24:54,851
This loan depends on it.

397
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,956
- We had a little hiccup.
- What kind of hiccup?

398
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,807
- Well, its a...
- OK, remember when I said...

399
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,965
Remember when I said we have
a lot of copper wire money?

400
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:10,511
What I meant to say was
we just have a lot of copper wire.

401
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:12,227
Like a lot.

402
00:25:12,347 --> 00:25:15,141
It's not exactly liquid.
I guess it's the term...

403
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:18,750
I'm pretty sure I know how to explain
exactly what's at stake, here, Billy.

404
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,568
Telling somebody something is liquid

405
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:23,763
when it's not quite liquid
is a pretty dumb ass thing to do.

406
00:25:23,883 --> 00:25:26,735
Let's not start with the name calling.
Otherwise, I'll walk right out of here.

407
00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:29,280
It's not fair. I can't punch you,
you're in a wheelchair.

408
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:32,909
I'll swing back. Just ask your brother.
You wanna take this outside, shorty?

409
00:25:35,197 --> 00:25:36,496
OK, you're in public.

410
00:25:38,994 --> 00:25:40,003
Ladies,

411
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:44,044
let me take a gander at that wire.
I might know a guy.

412
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,396
Is everything OK?

413
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:59,798
Oh yeah, she just needs a lot of water.
I don't remember she gets angry.

414
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,854
It's really a codependent thing
going on.

415
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:05,858
As long as you're OK.

416
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:10,979
Actually, I wandered
looking for something to buy you.

417
00:26:11,317 --> 00:26:13,799
I stopped at this little hair salon
in town,

418
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,550
that little place, you know,
on 7th street...

419
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:18,102
and...

420
00:26:18,637 --> 00:26:20,533
Anyway, they had a chair opened.

421
00:26:20,653 --> 00:26:22,824
And... that means I can rent it.

422
00:26:23,895 --> 00:26:27,816
And I guess, you know, if I did rent it,
I'd be living here for a while...

423
00:26:28,346 --> 00:26:30,751
help out, till you graduate.

424
00:26:34,323 --> 00:26:36,063
You do whatever you want.

425
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:50,493
- It's premium stuff, man.
- That's an understatement.

426
00:26:51,352 --> 00:26:53,907
- Is it all you got?
- All I got?

427
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,910
Yeah, that's all we got.

428
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:01,331
We can make a deal, man.
How does 20 sound?

429
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:03,052
Grand?

430
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:04,689
Yeah, 20 grand.

431
00:27:05,286 --> 00:27:08,880
- I gotta confer with my people first.
- Why?

432
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:10,507
Let's do it.

433
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,266
That'll work.

434
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:27,667
I've never seen anything
like that before.

435
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:29,363
I figured you hadn't.

436
00:28:49,317 --> 00:28:51,663
Can we come in
and talk to you for a sec?

437
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:53,193
Yeah, sure.

438
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:57,029
Your mother and I would like
to have a conversation

439
00:28:57,996 --> 00:29:00,366
- about the tattoo, right?
- However with calm.

440
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,662
- We want...
- What the hell were you thinking?

441
00:29:04,824 --> 00:29:06,205
Hon! What we mean is...

442
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:10,377
We'd like to have a better understanding
of what your thought process was.

443
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:12,545
Just what I was saying.
What were you thinking?

444
00:29:12,706 --> 00:29:16,174
- It's not a big deal. Everyone has one.
- Yes, honey. It is a big deal.

445
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:18,884
It's a big deal and the biggest deal
is you never discussed it

446
00:29:19,046 --> 00:29:20,719
with your father or with me.

447
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:24,641
- Because you guys would've said no.
- You're damn right we would've said no!

448
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:27,854
- Well, you wonder why I don't ask you.
- {\If we would've }Say no or not is not the point.

449
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,229
What's the point?

450
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,533
This is not like you. And if there's
something going on in your life

451
00:29:32,653 --> 00:29:34,734
that you feel you need
to talk about with us,

452
00:29:34,895 --> 00:29:37,612
we want you to be able to share that
with us. We want to understand

453
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:40,407
- what this is about.
- It doesn't mean anything!

454
00:29:40,568 --> 00:29:44,045
If it doesn't mean anything,
let's just go on and have it removed.

455
00:29:44,165 --> 00:29:47,704
I looked into a place in San Antonio,
it's very reputable,

456
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:49,916
and we're gonna go
and get it removed.

457
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:53,382
- You two have fun, cause I'm not going.
- It's not your decision to make.

458
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:56,004
- Last I checked, it's on my ankle.
- You know what?

459
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:59,716
Until you're 18 years old,
it's not your ankle, OK? It's my ankle.

460
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:02,739
So we're going to San Antonio on Friday
and we're getting it removed.

461
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,289
End of conversation.

462
00:30:05,895 --> 00:30:07,642
I sold your house, Buddy.

463
00:30:08,263 --> 00:30:10,812
- It's my pleasure, it's my job.
- I knew you could do it, Missy.

464
00:30:11,023 --> 00:30:14,377
- Just need you to...
- You're making me one happy guy.

465
00:30:15,016 --> 00:30:16,150
Perfect.

466
00:30:16,754 --> 00:30:19,207
- Oh, good.
- This is... good.

467
00:30:19,895 --> 00:30:21,054
Piece of cake.

468
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:25,740
What are these names?
Billy and Tim Riggins, and Jason Street?

469
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,202
What's this?

470
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,385
They're the buyers.

471
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:37,922
Alright. This is the American dream.

472
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,175
- To the American dream.
- Owner of a house.

473
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,571
Alright.

474
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:47,421
That didn't go down well.

475
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:50,559
- It is known that you got a pink shirt.
- Shut up, man.

476
00:30:52,877 --> 00:30:53,903
Hey, Missy.

477
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,232
Is Buddy happy?

478
00:30:56,444 --> 00:30:58,401
<i>- Not exactly.
- What does he want? More money?</i>

479
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:01,945
No, he's not gonna sell you the house.
Mr. Garrity was happy with the offer

480
00:31:02,107 --> 00:31:03,964
<i>till he saw your names on it.</i>

481
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:06,283
What did he say?
Guys!

482
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:09,213
Something in the vane of
the house can rot into the ground

483
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,748
before I sell it to these
clam cord idiots.

484
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,811
- I think it was a pass.
- Thanks.

485
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:17,117
Don't shush me!

486
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:26,914
- Hey, Mrs. T.
- Hey.

487
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:29,260
I just wanted to...

488
00:31:31,311 --> 00:31:33,060
You've done a lot for me...

489
00:31:33,588 --> 00:31:35,848
You've been there for me,
and you've...

490
00:31:36,453 --> 00:31:37,607
always come through.

491
00:31:37,768 --> 00:31:40,606
Which means there are...
very few people in my life who

492
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,682
I can say that about.

493
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:46,232
It means a lot.
It really does.

494
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:47,352
Thank you.

495
00:31:48,202 --> 00:31:49,202
But...

496
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:51,620
you're wrong about Cash.

497
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,081
- I know you think he's a bad guy.
- I don't think he's a bad guy.

498
00:31:55,201 --> 00:31:57,539
Well, bad for me.
Whatever, but...

499
00:31:58,898 --> 00:32:00,028
you're wrong.

500
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:03,136
He's such a good guy.

501
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,421
He really is.

502
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:13,174
Okay...

503
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,059
I don't care about Cash.
I just care about you.

504
00:32:19,935 --> 00:32:22,025
- It's not my priority straight.
- Well...

505
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:24,487
that's what I wanna see.

506
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:26,732
Thank you.

507
00:32:57,361 --> 00:33:00,658
- What the hell are you doing?
- I do whatever you ask me to.

508
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,729
I helped you win the State championship.
I got you to 3 to 1 this season.

509
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:06,988
I work my ass off at practice.
I do everything that you say.

510
00:33:07,934 --> 00:33:10,956
If it's cause J.D. is better than me,
tell me that.

511
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:16,283
My job is to fill a team out there
that wins games.

512
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:19,207
Right now,
that means J.D. McCoy. Yes.

513
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:33,180
- Then I quit.
- You're not quitting this team.

514
00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:35,475
I'm not gonna let you quit.
I know you.

515
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:37,730
You quit this team,
you gonna hate yourself.

516
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,021
You wanna be pissed? Fine go ahead.
You be pissed. I don't give a damn.

517
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,810
But you're not quitting this team.

518
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:48,967
Fine.

519
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:52,666
Fine, I'll sit on your bench.

520
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,931
I'll come to practice
and I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

521
00:33:58,487 --> 00:34:00,034
But I'm gonna hate it.

522
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:03,959
And you're gonna hate it.

523
00:34:08,336 --> 00:34:09,467
Good talk, Coach.

524
00:34:18,577 --> 00:34:22,230
It's not you, Jason. It's not about you.
It's about Riggins.

525
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:24,601
Riggins has got my daughter,
as you well know.

526
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:27,895
And just between you and me,
I'm not real fired up about it.

527
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:30,182
I mean, Tim is great
on a football field,

528
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,072
but I really don't realist the idea

529
00:34:32,234 --> 00:34:34,658
of him being the father
of my grandchildren.

530
00:34:35,017 --> 00:34:36,506
You know what I mean?

531
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:39,205
And I can't talk to Lyla about this.

532
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:41,731
I love that little girl.
She's all I've got left.

533
00:34:41,851 --> 00:34:44,660
But if I talk to her about him,
she's gonna hate me.

534
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,572
I'm not gonna let those Riggins
buy the house! It's ridiculous!

535
00:34:47,692 --> 00:34:50,767
Let me put it this way.
You're not selling Riggins the house.

536
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,093
You're selling me the house.

537
00:34:53,857 --> 00:34:57,173
And you'd do that, wouldn't you?
You'd sell that house to me.

538
00:34:59,656 --> 00:35:01,099
I can buy your house.

539
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:04,224
But I can't buy it
without those guys, OK?

540
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,930
And I got a baby now.
Alright?

541
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:10,192
And I've got a woman
that I love to death

542
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:12,511
that is keeping me an arm's length,
until I can show her

543
00:35:12,631 --> 00:35:15,334
that I know how to make real money
in this world.

544
00:35:15,773 --> 00:35:17,452
And buying your house
is the first step.

545
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,500
And I'm not gonna
take no for an answer.

546
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:25,883
If you ever cared about me
as a person, Mr. Garrity,

547
00:35:26,003 --> 00:35:27,879
if you ever cared about me
as a player,

548
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:31,311
as the quarterback
of the Dillon Panthers,

549
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:32,884
then you will sell me that house.

550
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,494
Look, Mr. Garrity.
You remember...

551
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:40,412
You remember when I was a sophomore?

552
00:35:40,762 --> 00:35:44,518
We had that last regular season game
against Midland, that year.

553
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:49,832
We needed to win that game
to go to the playoffs. Remember?

554
00:35:49,952 --> 00:35:51,902
4th quarter, we're down by 6.

555
00:35:52,538 --> 00:35:55,580
2 minutes left to go.
We drive right down that field.

556
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,439
We end up at the 4th to go.

557
00:35:58,465 --> 00:36:00,701
I step back into that dark,
and there...

558
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:02,402
I sent a quick slant...

559
00:36:02,774 --> 00:36:04,957
I hit that receiver right scoring...

560
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,292
Touchdown! State playoffs!
You remember that?

561
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:12,458
That was good.

562
00:36:12,986 --> 00:36:14,354
That guy...

563
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,970
That guy is who you're gonna
sell that house to.

564
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:30,987
You wanna think big, man.
Vaulted ceilings.

565
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:33,611
What are you talking about?
You know how much this is gonna cost?

566
00:36:33,821 --> 00:36:36,227
- That's ridiculous.
- What are you talking about?

567
00:36:36,347 --> 00:36:39,493
Raise the ceiling.
This house is stuck in the 60's, man.

568
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:41,494
You get rid of all
this textured wood crap.

569
00:36:41,705 --> 00:36:44,301
- Raise the ceiling.
- You wanna get rid of the wood?

570
00:36:44,421 --> 00:36:46,249
I don't know, man.
I kinda...

571
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,132
- He wouldn't like the wood, you idiot.
- Why you go with the name calling?

572
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:52,182
- I'm not calling you an idiot.
- This crappy wood, Billy?

573
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:54,754
What are you talking about?
You want cottage cheese on the ceiling?

574
00:36:54,874 --> 00:36:57,103
No, I don't want
cottage cheese ceiling, OK?

575
00:36:57,223 --> 00:36:59,011
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

576
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:00,554
Guys, guys!

577
00:37:00,716 --> 00:37:02,056
Why am I here with him?

578
00:37:03,913 --> 00:37:07,353
We gonna keep some things waiting.
Vaulted ceilings? No way in 30 days.

579
00:37:07,473 --> 00:37:09,855
Great ideas, guys.
Keep them coming.

580
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:13,929
- What am I doing here?
- I'll tell you. Come here.

581
00:37:15,898 --> 00:37:18,738
I'm used to raising roof.
I'm gonna raise me the ceiling.

582
00:37:20,136 --> 00:37:22,202
- I bought this house.
- What?

583
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:24,287
I bought this house.
I mean not for us to live in.

584
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:28,394
We gonna fix it up, and turn it over
in about 30 days, make a lot of money...

585
00:37:28,514 --> 00:37:30,823
This gonna get us a great nesting
to start our life.

586
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:33,006
Finally, you know, some good money.

587
00:37:34,596 --> 00:37:36,632
It's not quite the reaction
I was hoping for.

588
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:39,734
I'm moving back East

589
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:41,916
with my parents.

590
00:37:42,478 --> 00:37:43,568
I have to.

591
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:46,433
This isn't working.
None of this is working.

592
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:48,170
It's too hard.

593
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:51,540
I need to go and make a different plan
and start over.

594
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,734
This is a different plan.
This is a new plan, this is a good plan.

595
00:37:54,895 --> 00:37:57,445
- This is gonna make money!
- Jason, this is crazy.

596
00:37:58,547 --> 00:38:00,316
I don't know what else to do.

597
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:02,370
I have to go home.
I can't...

598
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:03,992
I'm sorry.

599
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:10,625
You can come visit.
He's your son, too. Anytime.

600
00:38:12,465 --> 00:38:16,168
Erin, you can't just
take Noah, and go...

601
00:38:18,347 --> 00:38:20,063
This plan is gonna work.

602
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:39,991
- What did she say?
- She's excited.

603
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:43,307
She's really excited.
She's thrilled, she can't...

604
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:46,381
She can't wait to see
what we do with the place.

605
00:38:46,712 --> 00:38:48,829
We got a lot of work to do.
Come on.

606
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,206
Come here.

607
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:21,836
What are we doing?

608
00:39:24,998 --> 00:39:28,368
Did I ever tell you that
I almost dropped out of high school?

609
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:32,420
You almost dropped
out of high school?

610
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,373
I know it's hard to believe, huh?

611
00:39:37,692 --> 00:39:41,027
Your momma was a little bit
of a wild child back in the day.

612
00:39:42,905 --> 00:39:44,461
So, what happened?

613
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:49,054
What happened was your dad happened.
I mean, your dad...

614
00:39:49,174 --> 00:39:50,387
You know...

615
00:39:51,412 --> 00:39:53,394
He had struggles of his own, too.

616
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:57,726
But, you know. We were lucky. We just
had each other, always managed to...

617
00:39:58,098 --> 00:40:00,234
pull each other
up by our bootstraps.

618
00:40:00,918 --> 00:40:04,383
But I know how easy
that road is to go down.

619
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:08,607
And I don't... You know...
I guess when I see

620
00:40:08,727 --> 00:40:12,092
you getting a tattoo,
it's starting making me worry.

621
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:18,545
And you know you are just...
independent and...

622
00:40:19,114 --> 00:40:21,296
smart and... beautiful

623
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:24,928
and you're not gonna need any guy
to pull you out of some hole.

624
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:28,771
But, I feel like...

625
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:35,870
I feel like I need you to promise me
that that's true.

626
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:39,037
I promise.

627
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:42,226
I'm not going down that road.

628
00:40:56,042 --> 00:40:57,658
Alright, let's go home.

629
00:40:58,934 --> 00:41:00,570
So I can keep the tattoo?

630
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,081
Honey, I guarantee you that
by the time you're 30,

631
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:05,626
you're gonna
take that thing off yourself.

632
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,961
And I'm not gonna pay for it, then.

633
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:13,681
2%! We don't drink that!
That's wrong!

634
00:41:13,844 --> 00:41:15,683
- Next time...
- We don't use grape jelly!

635
00:41:16,084 --> 00:41:19,493
- We like strawberry jelly.
- I thought everybody liked grape...

636
00:41:19,805 --> 00:41:21,482
No! We don't like grape jelly.

637
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:26,027
And did you buy any of those cookies
I like, those vanilla creams?

638
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:28,929
I forgot. I know I meant...

639
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,074
Well listen! Young lady,
if you ever do,

640
00:41:32,194 --> 00:41:34,405
go buy something
that I might wanna eat,

641
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,412
right there is
where I like to keep 'em!

642
00:41:42,554 --> 00:41:44,755
She's pretty serious
about her cookies.

643
00:41:51,981 --> 00:41:53,556
Do you like grape jelly?

644
00:41:54,207 --> 00:41:55,683
Nobody likes grape jelly.

645
00:42:04,216 --> 00:42:06,431
You know, I was wondering
if maybe this Friday

646
00:42:06,551 --> 00:42:08,911
it'd be alright if I went
to one of your games.

647
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,703
But I don't have to go.

648
00:42:15,988 --> 00:42:19,885
- If you'd rather, I'd...
- This might not be the best week, OK?

649
00:42:21,811 --> 00:42:22,811
Why?

650
00:42:23,987 --> 00:42:26,045
You know I play quarterback, right?

651
00:42:27,105 --> 00:42:29,344
I've been starring
since sophomore year.

652
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,315
You know I thought I was doing OK.
We won State.

653
00:42:34,317 --> 00:42:35,317
But...

654
00:42:35,963 --> 00:42:39,592
there is this new freshman this year,
and everyone thinks he's...

655
00:42:40,614 --> 00:42:43,515
the next Peyton Manning
or something, so...

656
00:42:45,282 --> 00:42:46,721
I got replaced.

657
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,490
Oh, Matt. I'm sorry.

658
00:42:51,114 --> 00:42:52,114
It's OK.

659
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,936
Is that why the coach was here?

660
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:00,047
You don't deserve that.

661
00:43:01,132 --> 00:43:04,106
I didn't really deserve the job
in the first place.

662
00:43:06,012 --> 00:43:08,882
The only reason I ever started
was because...

663
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:11,321
our quarterback, Jason Street...

664
00:43:13,476 --> 00:43:15,638
he got paralyzed
in the middle of a game.

665
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,583
Oh, my God!

666
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,074
That was pretty horrible.

667
00:43:25,423 --> 00:43:28,685
You know. They needed me
and I stepped up and worked my ass off.

668
00:43:28,805 --> 00:43:31,402
I did everything I could,
you know, but...

669
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:36,033
I guess this wasn't really enough.

670
00:43:37,443 --> 00:43:38,869
Sounds like you did a great job.

671
00:43:40,683 --> 00:43:41,683
Thanks.

672
00:43:43,642 --> 00:43:46,626
Did you ever think about, maybe,
just taking a break?

673
00:43:48,742 --> 00:43:50,556
I can't quit the team.

674
00:43:53,285 --> 00:43:55,201
What would they do?
Shoot you?

675
00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:57,312
Probably.

676
00:43:58,081 --> 00:43:59,390
We do that in Texas.

677
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:04,073
You want a cookie?

678
00:45:21,773 --> 00:45:24,601
- Hi. Can I talk to Cash?
- Cash doesn't live here.

679
00:45:24,761 --> 00:45:26,102
When you see Cash,

680
00:45:26,262 --> 00:45:29,689
just tell him he owes Ally and Tucker
$1,600 in child support.

681
00:45:33,486 --> 00:45:35,861
If you accept this kid,
the team is gonna accept him.

682
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,939
I'm asking for your help.

683
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:39,983
McCoy, get in!

684
00:45:41,461 --> 00:45:43,369
Have a drink, man.
This is a party.
