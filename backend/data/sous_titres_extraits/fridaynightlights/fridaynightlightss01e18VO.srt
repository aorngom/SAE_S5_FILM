1
00:00:00,062 --> 00:00:02,278
This is Austin
Party central.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,361
Here's your welcome package.
Your room key.

3
00:00:04,432 --> 00:00:06,648
- And your jersey...
- But do you work for the team?

4
00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:08,834
Oh no.
I'm a tattoo artist.

5
00:00:08,936 --> 00:00:09,675
Sanskrit

6
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:11,411
It says "Peace".

7
00:00:11,452 --> 00:00:13,474
You wanna see what it looks like
from my ivory tower?

8
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:14,920
From my ivory tower, girl,

9
00:00:14,992 --> 00:00:17,044
you're not hanging out
with tyra collette anymore!

10
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:18,520
You can't punish me
like that!

11
00:00:18,574 --> 00:00:19,750
That is not a punishment.
That's a rule.

12
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:22,160
Can we just
make this easy?

13
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:23,320
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:24,971
I strayed
outside my marriage.

15
00:00:25,077 --> 00:00:27,062
Now she thinks
it's more than it is.

16
00:00:27,175 --> 00:00:29,221
You need to go home
and take care of your wife

17
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:31,302
and think about
those kids of yours.

18
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:32,433
Hey! Buddy!

19
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:33,942
Ooh, god.

20
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:35,632
Lyin' son of a bitch!

21
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:37,920
You could've at least let me
keep the job!

22
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:41,882
De-fense!

23
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:43,503
De-fense!

24
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:45,223
De-fense!

25
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:46,431
De-fense!

26
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:48,162
the panthers are ahead by five,

27
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:49,600
with just seconds to go.

28
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,873
And I'll tell you what,
this has been

29
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:54,142
a nail-biter
from the word "go."

30
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:56,403
And folks, barring
any last-minute heroics

31
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,002
from the royal rock dragons,

32
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:01,390
the dillon panthers will be
heading to the semifinals.

33
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,003
The panthers' offense
can only watch

34
00:01:04,038 --> 00:01:06,252
as royal rock's Jerry Jakowski

35
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:09,383
takes one last shot
at planting a dagger--

36
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:11,390
- go blue!
- Into the dillon season.

37
00:01:11,595 --> 00:01:12,223
Set...hut!

38
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:17,133
Take him down!

39
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:24,012
coach taylor has the Panthers
laying back,

40
00:01:24,048 --> 00:01:26,841
anticipating what has to be
the hail mary pass.

41
00:01:28,536 --> 00:01:30,682
And jakowski launches
a missile.

42
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,592
Somebody
jump-start my heart,

43
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:51,012
because I think
I just died.

44
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:52,582
Lord have mercy!

45
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,963
Your very own
Dillon Panthers

46
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:57,783
are going
to the state semifinals!

47
00:01:58,046 --> 00:01:59,352
Hallelujah!

48
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:01,782
- Hallelujah!
- Whoo!

49
00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:04,622
You have ruined,
ruined this family!

50
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:06,081
All right?
Ruined it!

51
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:07,703
- Do you know what it felt like?
- Hey, I know.

52
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,932
Sitting out there, with
all those people at church,

53
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:12,421
and she walks up and slaps you
in front of me?

54
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,862
There's nothing you can do
to fix this now.

55
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:16,970
Nothing is gonna happen
to Mom and Dad.

56
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:19,043
- How do you know that?
- Listen to me.

57
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:21,353
- Stop it.
- I need you to be strong for your sister.

58
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:23,651
Okay?
It's okay, it's okay.

59
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:25,772
Sometimes grownups fight.
It's okay.

60
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:26,770
Don't touch me, Buddy!

61
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:28,961
You're gonna break
everything we've got!

62
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:30,342
I will if I want to!

63
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:31,910
Go ahead, tear it up!

64
00:02:32,157 --> 00:02:34,342
Do you know
how humiliated I am?

65
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:36,410
And hurt, because of you,
Buddy?

66
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:38,890
I am so done with you.

67
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:39,782
It's okay.

68
00:02:39,846 --> 00:02:42,292
Buddy Garrity...
get out!

69
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,223
Roll out!

70
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:48,682
Come on, move it.

71
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:51,422
Wait, wait.
Forgot my wallet.

72
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:52,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
forget it.

73
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:55,350
Sure, you can't depend
on a functioning spinal column,

74
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:57,862
but one thing you can depend on
is a drink on the house.

75
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,253
Let's go.
There's more than a--

76
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:01,793
Leave it.

77
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:03,123
- Let's go.
- No, no.

78
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:04,422
That's what voicemail's for.

79
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:05,123
It's Lyla.

80
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:08,093
God, that girl has got a radar
for when you're about to have a good time.

81
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:09,531
Hello?

82
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:10,243
Hey.

83
00:03:11,217 --> 00:03:12,190
Party!!!

84
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:13,951
It sounds like
you're busy.

85
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:15,600
Uh, no no no,
we were just

86
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:16,823
- about to go out.
- Let's go.

87
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,000
The train is leaving.

88
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:19,223
Let's go.

89
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:20,682
Are you okay?

90
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:21,722
Yeah.

91
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:24,623
Yeah, I'm fine.

92
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:26,453
Um, just give me a call back
when you can, okay?

93
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:28,031
- You coming?
- Yes.

94
00:03:28,088 --> 00:03:29,591
Written invitation,
gonna take a while.

95
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:30,853
- I'll call you when I get back, okay?
- Train's leaving.

96
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:31,852
Okay, bye.

97
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:33,430
Okay, I love you.

98
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:34,880
- "I love you."
- Shut up.

We're going to state!
Going to state!

Going to state!

107

Riggins!

108
00:05:04,368 --> 00:05:05,092
Riggins!

109
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:05,811
What?

110
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:08,442
There's a woman at the door.
She looks pissed.

111
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:11,511
I got it.

112
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:18,640
Hi.

113
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,172
I'm your new
next-door neighbor.

114
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:23,563
Right there.
Next to your house.

115
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:24,580
Okay.

116
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:26,190
And we can hear
your damn music.

117
00:05:26,346 --> 00:05:28,572
And, weirdly, I have a job,
and I have to be up

118
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,242
at 6:00 in the morning.
So...

119
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:32,682
turn it down, please.

120
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:35,003
Do you think you could do that,
or should I just call the cops?

121
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:38,061
Can you turn it down?

122
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:40,110
I'll, uh...

123
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,920
I'll turn it down
for you, ma'am.

124
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:43,583
Thank you.

125
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:46,743
Good night.

126
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:47,893
Welcome!

127
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:48,871
Who was that?

128
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:49,890
Billy, get in the house.

129
00:05:51,388 --> 00:05:52,711
You always said
it was a bad color,

130
00:05:52,798 --> 00:05:54,992
and then later on,
you realized I was right,

131
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:56,180
- and you were wrong.
- What is that thing

132
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:58,031
that is on our front porch?

133
00:05:58,085 --> 00:05:59,462
What--
It's moving.

134
00:05:59,696 --> 00:06:00,491
Can you...

135
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:04,192
- Damn, that's not--
- That's Buddy Garrity.

136
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,703
That's Buddy Garrity,
honey.

137
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:07,033
Sitting on our front porch.

138
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:08,051
I see it, I see it.

139
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:08,933
Hey.

140
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:11,560
Oh, no, I want
to go to bed, babe.

141
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:12,371
Get out and say hello.

142
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:13,783
- Please make him...
- Get out and say hello.

143
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:14,750
Make him go away.

144
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:17,090
- Hey, Buddy!
- Semis...

145
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,370
Great, oh.

146
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:19,280
Great game!

147
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:20,312
- I know.
- Coach...

148
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:21,480
congratulations, Coach.

149
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:22,640
What are you doing here?

150
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:24,002
- What are you doing here?
- The semis, baby!

151
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:25,761
You could have called.
What are you doing?

152
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:27,391
Oh, no, I-I just, uh...

153
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:29,202
Hell.

154
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:31,231
Pam...

155
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:34,250
Pam locked me out.

156
00:06:34,888 --> 00:06:36,030
She--she kicked me out.

157
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:38,170
You know how women are
about these things.

158
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:40,962
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

159
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:45,541
Yeah, so...

160
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:47,441
I was wondering
if maybe I could just

161
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,001
sleep on your couch
for a couple nights,

162
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:53,333
and, you know, give Pam
a chance to cool down.

163
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:01,491
Hey, Mama.

164
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:03,980
Hey, baby.

165
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:05,380
Oh, I see
you worked your way up

166
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:06,621
from black and white
to color.

167
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:08,891
Well, at least
it's an improvement.

168
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,160
Oh, I love this movie.
It's so romantic.

169
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:16,171
Mom, please tell me that
you're not watching this movie,

170
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:17,033
thinking of Buddy Garrity.

171
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:18,770
'Cause I might actually
have to take your life.

172
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:20,162
Then my own.

173
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:21,280
Right after.

174
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:22,380
Here.

175
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,812
No, I'm not hungry,
I told you.

176
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:26,860
Mom, you're depressed, okay?
You gotta eat something.

177
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:28,341
- Come on.
- No, you know what?

178
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:29,743
I just need to sleep, honey.

179
00:07:29,836 --> 00:07:30,923
I just--I can't sleep.

180
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,662
These pills aren't
doing anything.

181
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:33,790
I just took another one.

182
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:34,900
You just took another one?

183
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,232
I'll be fine tomorrow.

184
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:37,892
I just need one good night,

185
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:38,660
that's all.

186
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:39,831
Let me sleep.

187
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:41,481
I promise.

188
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:51,041
How'd you get in here?

189
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,092
Don't worry about it.

190
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,222
You know what's gonna happen
when my mama hears you?

191
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:57,970
I know.

192
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:00,893
That's why we gotta
go somewhere else.

193
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:02,772
I can't go.

194
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:07,631
Where we going?

195
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,991
How 'bout a nice,
romantic moonlight swim?

196
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:18,860
Waverly Grady.

197
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:21,040
What's gotten into you?

198
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:38,731
I never seen you
like this before.

199
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:43,873
But I could
get used to it.

200
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:06,823
Hey, y'all, this is Street.
Leave a message.

201
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,370
Whoa!

202
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:02,080
Oh, my God.

203
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:04,382
Oh, no, no, no.

204
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:06,110
He is not staying
a couple of days.

205
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:07,232
I'm not crazy
about it either.

206
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,553
He invited himself.

207
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:09,060
Wait wait wait wait.

208
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:10,840
So now you guys are taking sides
in this whole issue?

209
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:12,583
Quit yelling at me.
It's early in the morning.

210
00:10:12,636 --> 00:10:13,702
I woke up this morning

211
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:16,002
with Buddy Garrity in a towel
in my bathroom.

212
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:18,873
Buddy Garrity's right.
Women are very dramatic.

213
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:20,183
You're very dramatic.

214
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:26,841
What are you doing,
Tim Riggins?

215
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:29,923
I'm fixing my truck.

216
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:31,382
Oh. I'm Bo Miller.

217
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:33,121
I'm your new
next-door neighbor.

218
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:34,621
Okay.

219
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:35,881
And you are Tim Riggins,

220
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,131
number 33,

221
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:38,283
who single-handedly

222
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:39,872
led the Panthers
to the semis.

223
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:41,910
What happened
to your eye?

224
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,112
Are you gonna be able
to play in the semis?

225
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:45,052
Can you shut up?

226
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:46,143
I don't know.

227
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:47,121
Can I?

228
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,532
Stop, please.

229
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:49,912
What?

230
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:51,671
I'm gonna need you
to shut up.

231
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:52,452
Okay.

232
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:54,960
'Cause I'm incredibly
hung over right now.

233
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:57,563
- What is that?
- You need to go home.

234
00:10:58,725 --> 00:10:59,342
Okay?

235
00:11:00,396 --> 00:11:01,053
Thank you.

236
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:08,950
We're the best,
because we work hard!

237
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:09,810
Let's go!

238
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:14,943
Concentrate, concentrate.

239
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:17,030
Where are you going, Street?
Let's go!

240
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:20,462
Let's go!

241
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:24,500
What you guys doin'?

242
00:11:25,256 --> 00:11:26,193
Let's go.

243
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:36,113
Hey.

244
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:46,600
I'll see you guys later.

245
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,672
Oh, good Lord,

246
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:49,342
- if it ain't Miss Buzz Kill.
- Shut up.

247
00:11:50,365 --> 00:11:50,861
Bye.

248
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,162
Jackass.

249
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:57,990
Hi.

250
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:00,120
"Hi?"

251
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:02,891
I drove 200 miles,
and all I get is "hi?"

252
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:04,442
I'm just shocked
to see you.

253
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:07,810
Surprised.

254
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:09,511
Happy?

255
00:12:10,238 --> 00:12:11,372
Happy is a much
better word.

256
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:14,261
Baby, what's wrong?

257
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:16,930
What is it?

258
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:20,210
I think my parents
are splitting up.

259
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,540
You Know?
I'm gonna be a Panthers one day.

260
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:29,771
Good luck with that, Bo.

261
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:30,840
Watch this!

262
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:33,382
Ready!

263
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:34,743
Blue 42!

264
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:36,021
Blue 42!

265
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,080
I like candy!

266
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:38,472
Hut! He drops back.

267
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:39,932
He pumps it.
He throws it.

268
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:41,812
It's going, it's going!
It's tipped!

269
00:12:42,056 --> 00:12:44,033
Oh! It's caught
in the end zone!

270
00:12:44,335 --> 00:12:46,232
What do you say
about that, Riggins?

271
00:12:46,628 --> 00:12:48,190
Hey, hand me the ball.

272
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:56,092
I'm gonna teach you
how to spiral, all right?

273
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:57,050
Oh, boy.

274
00:12:57,495 --> 00:12:58,120
Okay.

275
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:00,432
I want you to put
your fingers

276
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:02,070
over the lace,
like that, okay?

277
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:03,462
As big as your hands are,

278
00:13:03,518 --> 00:13:04,932
you just do the best
you can, okay?

279
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:05,453
Got it.

280
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:07,251
And when you pull
the ball back,

281
00:13:07,716 --> 00:13:08,990
you wanna turn your body.

282
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:11,222
So you can put
what little weight

283
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,472
- you have behind the ball.
- Got it.

284
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:13,151
Uh-huh.

285
00:13:13,735 --> 00:13:14,631
And when you throw it,

286
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:16,490
I want you to follow through.

287
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:19,243
Okay, now let me try!

288
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:20,582
Ready!

289
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:22,662
Candy, candy, candy!
Hut!

290
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:28,163
Not too shabby.

291
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:32,612
Don't you think your Mom
will just get over it?

292
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:35,332
I don't know.

293
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:36,962
I don't--

294
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:39,011
I don't know that she should.

295
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:41,893
There's no weakness
in forgiveness.

296
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:47,723
You seem really happy.

297
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:52,472
I am.
It's this sport.

298
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,770
I don't know,
just playing something again.

299
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:01,072
It's awesome.

300
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,193
Just, uh...

301
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,511
I don't think I've been
this happy since the accident.

302
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:09,222
So...

303
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:12,450
That came out wrong.

304
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:13,593
That's okay.

305
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:14,963
Baby, without--

306
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:16,761
without you, I wouldn't even
be here right now.

307
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,661
You make me
extremely happy, okay?

308
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:24,892
What is that?

309
00:14:25,357 --> 00:14:26,173
What? What?

310
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:27,850
What is this?
When did you get a--

311
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:29,400
You have a tattoo?

312
00:14:31,365 --> 00:14:32,241
Is this real?

313
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:34,520
Uh, yeah, um...

314
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:35,903
It was an impulse buy,

315
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,363
and I was,
I was definitely gonna

316
00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:38,262
tell you about it.

317
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:39,582
You are permanently
messed up!

318
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:42,671
I was pretty permanently
messed up before.

319
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,061
It's not a big deal.

320
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:46,380
It kind of is.

321
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:49,471
Okay, maybe it's, uh,
a little...

322
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:51,983
- What does it say?
- tiny bit of a big deal.

323
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:55,273
It, uh,

324
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:56,911
it says "peace."

325
00:14:58,207 --> 00:14:59,691
And it's, uh,
it's Sanskrit.

326
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:01,521
Peace.

327
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:02,630
Yeah.

328
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:05,642
It's just not you.

329
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:09,582
Well, it is now.

330
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:15,402
Hello.

331
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:18,222
I'm in here
making pork chops.

332
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:19,360
Yahoo.

333
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:21,753
- Hey, Buddy.
- Hey, you're home!

334
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:23,442
- How you doin', Bud?
- Oh, I'm good, man.

335
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:24,623
I, uh,

336
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,692
hope you don't mind.
I got the, uh,

337
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:27,730
game tapes out.

338
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:29,463
No, that's fine,
that's fine.

339
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:30,952
I'll be with you
in just a second then.

340
00:15:30,987 --> 00:15:32,062
- Just hang on a second.
- All right.

341
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:32,891
Uh, hey.

342
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:34,751
Can I talk to you
for a second?

343
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:35,920
Mm-hmm.

344
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:41,651
Honey, he's driving me crazy.

345
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:43,733
You know what
he went and...

346
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:45,791
He went and bought
a whole bag of groceries.

347
00:15:45,856 --> 00:15:47,582
- Just listen to me
- I mean, he's making me make pork chops.

348
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:49,422
Relax.
Stop, relax, shh.

349
00:15:49,985 --> 00:15:50,771
What?

350
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:54,081
Neil Kenny, the athletic director
over at TMU,

351
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,271
called this afternoon.

352
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:56,720
He and his wife

353
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:59,080
would like to have dinner
with us this evening

354
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:01,290
to talk about the future.

355
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:02,511
The future?

356
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:03,561
Our future?

357
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,343
You busy tonight?

358
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:06,681
No, I think I'm fine.

359
00:16:06,986 --> 00:16:08,542
- We'll say it's a date, then?
- Mm-hmm.

360
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:14,421
Ohh, that's amazing.
I'm so proud of you.

361
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:15,570
Thanks, baby.

362
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:17,822
What are we gonna do
about Buddy?

363
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:19,143
Bo!

364
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,871
Will you come when I call?

365
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:22,030
What are you doing
over here?

366
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:23,560
- Not now, Mom.
- You promised me

367
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,161
that you'd stay in the house
and do your homework

368
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:26,463
if I went shopping.
Come on, honey.

369
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:27,491
I'm hanging out
with Tim Riggins.

370
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:29,730
And he taught me
everything there is to know

371
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:31,152
about the game of football.

372
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:34,262
And I doubled my skill level
in just one afternoon.

373
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:36,373
That's good, but you said
you'd stay and do your--

374
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:36,761
Hi.

375
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:37,840
Hey there.

376
00:16:39,436 --> 00:16:39,981
Oh.

377
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:41,232
This one.

378
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:42,160
Thanks.

379
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:42,843
You bet.

380
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:45,200
So, uh, Bo tells me
y'all been hangin' out.

381
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,891
Yeah, a little.

382
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:48,633
A lot, actually.

383
00:16:49,437 --> 00:16:51,363
The only rule
was I had to keep my voice

384
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:52,713
down to a level three.

385
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:55,930
Because Tim Riggins had some
massive hangover thing.

386
00:16:56,536 --> 00:16:57,170
Oh.

387
00:16:57,457 --> 00:16:58,840
Good, that's great.
Come on.

388
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:00,413
- He's all yours.
- Yeah.

389
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:02,110
Can he come over
for dinner, Mom?

390
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:02,880
Not now, honey.

391
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:04,683
Please, Mom.
Please!

392
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:06,671
I gotta work
on my truck.

393
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,000
It's gonna get dark.
You can't finish it in the dark.

394
00:17:09,046 --> 00:17:09,731
You know that.

395
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:11,111
Please?

396
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:14,010
If it's all right
with your mama, I guess.

397
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:15,430
- Yes!
- Okay.

398
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:16,993
You little turkey,
come on now.

399
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:18,140
Get in the house
and do your homework.

400
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:19,052
What are we having?

401
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:20,220
I'll make it short.

402
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,751
- You little squirt.
- Sorry!

403
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,882
You are seriously
not expecting me

404
00:17:28,936 --> 00:17:30,200
to stay here alone
with Buddy Garrity.

405
00:17:30,246 --> 00:17:32,513
I mean, are you even comprehending
the depths of awkwardness?

406
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:34,061
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

407
00:17:34,106 --> 00:17:35,220
Why don't I just
stick pins in my eyes?

408
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:36,880
Well, I think that's
a terrible idea.

409
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:37,951
But listen to me.

410
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:39,253
This is a very important
dinner.

411
00:17:39,315 --> 00:17:40,352
It's very important
to your father.

412
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:41,542
It's important
for his career.

413
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:43,612
His career pays
for all those nice things

414
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:45,250
that you always ask for
that you like for him

415
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:46,101
to buy for you.

416
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:47,873
You don't have to sit down
and have popcorn

417
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:48,893
and watch movies with him.

418
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:50,042
- Mom...
- Honey...

419
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:50,931
stop it.

420
00:17:51,406 --> 00:17:51,970
Oh...

421
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:54,741
so you're not
taking sides now, right?

422
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:57,072
Okay, so I'm not allowed
to hang out with Tyra,

423
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:58,103
but a known adulterer,

424
00:17:58,128 --> 00:18:00,221
I'm allowed to spend
the night alone with,

425
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:01,213
in my own home?

426
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:03,120
Well, I'm sorry that
that's the way you see it.

427
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,931
But I think you could--
'scuse me, darlin'--

428
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:06,702
I think that you're gonna
be able to handle it.

429
00:18:06,926 --> 00:18:07,513
Honey!

430
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:09,800
Coming.

431
00:18:11,186 --> 00:18:12,762
Hey, I heard everything
your mother said.

432
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:14,160
You listen to her.
She's always right.

433
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,183
We gotta go.
Let's go.

434
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:18,771
Hey, Smash.
How you doing, man?

435
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:19,633
How you doing, Pastor?

436
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:21,352
Good, man.
Waverly's on her way down.

437
00:18:21,428 --> 00:18:21,812
Okay.

438
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:24,150
So I see you and Waverly

439
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:25,992
been spending a lot of time
together here lately.

440
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,572
Oh, yeah.

441
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:30,592
Sir, I just want
to let you know that...

442
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,960
I only have the best
intentions for your daughter,

443
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:34,892
because she been
somebody in my life that--

444
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:36,552
All right, not that kind
of talk today, all right?

445
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:37,952
- Okay.
- All right.

446
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,431
Um...

447
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:44,391
have you noticed anything
different about Waverly?

448
00:18:46,285 --> 00:18:47,700
No, sir,
I can't say I have.

449
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:48,571
Okay.

450
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:50,341
I need to ask
a favor of you.

451
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,392
If you notice anything
different about her,

452
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:57,460
I need for you
to let me know, okay?

453
00:18:58,627 --> 00:18:59,273
Okay.

454
00:19:06,268 --> 00:19:07,280
That's Troy over there.

455
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:08,930
He's from South Africa.

456
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:11,263
But then he lived
in London.

457
00:19:11,348 --> 00:19:12,472
Now he lives in Texas.

458
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:14,121
Everybody makes fun
of his accent.

459
00:19:14,316 --> 00:19:15,162
Jason.

460
00:19:15,777 --> 00:19:17,062
Hey, Jason, how you doing?

461
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:18,073
- Hi.
- How's your wound?

462
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:19,472
- Oh! Uh--
- Can I check it out?

463
00:19:19,497 --> 00:19:21,003
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

464
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:24,723
Oh, wow.

465
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:26,411
You heal fast, mister.

466
00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:27,980
Looks great.

467
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:29,650
- Thank you.
- Oh, hey.

468
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:32,102
I'm, uh, Suzy.
I did the tattoo.

469
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:33,883
Oh.

470
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:35,573
Well, it looks nice.

471
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:38,871
I'm Lyla...his fiancée.

472
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:48,162
Oh, hi, Julie.

473
00:19:49,977 --> 00:19:50,773
Hey!

474
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:51,971
How you doing tonight?

475
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:54,850
I'm...doing good.

476
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:55,871
Good.

477
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:58,001
You wanna join me
in a pork chop?

478
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:01,252
I don't eat dead pig.
Sorry.

479
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,671
You don't know
what you're missing.

480
00:20:03,747 --> 00:20:04,252
Okay.

481
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:06,361
You know, it is the other
white meat.

482
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:07,543
Really?

483
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:09,802
Hey, you know, uh,
where your parents went?

484
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:11,423
Um...

485
00:20:11,598 --> 00:20:12,560
They went to dinner.

486
00:20:12,607 --> 00:20:14,183
I thought I heard 'em
talking about

487
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:15,682
having a meeting
with somebody.

488
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:16,531
They went by themselves.

489
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:18,240
I think they went to this new
little Italian restaurant.

490
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:20,093
You know,
it's good for the marriage.

491
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:21,210
Right.

492
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:23,362
Yeah, well, um,

493
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:24,980
I'm gonna go to my room
and do some homework.

494
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:26,282
With the doors locked.

495
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:27,160
All right.

496
00:20:27,446 --> 00:20:28,241
So Tim Riggins,

497
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:29,481
do you like the taco casserole?

498
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,480
Mm, you bet.

499
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:32,281
It's good.

500
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:33,941
You know, I'm so glad my mom

501
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:35,272
had to get a fresh start.

502
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:36,380
Bo.

503
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:37,762
Because if she wouldn't
have ever met

504
00:20:37,825 --> 00:20:38,981
that dumb boyfriend Hank

505
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:39,630
Bo!

506
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:41,410
with the abusive
substance issue,

507
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,963
she might have never moved

508
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:44,850
from Knoxville to here, Dillon.

509
00:20:44,936 --> 00:20:46,083
Eat your macaroni
and cheese.

510
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:48,331
That was funny.

511
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:50,163
Okay, that's enough.

512
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,092
Not to get, uh,

513
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:00,150
not to get, you know,

514
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,341
serious and businesslike,

515
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:04,031
but you guys think I got
a remote chance of starting?

516
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:06,210
No.

517
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:08,350
No.

518
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:09,870
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

519
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,850
Just slow it down,
slow it down, man.

520
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:13,760
You're just barely out
of the peewee stages now.

521
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:14,703
Look,

522
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:17,450
you might have a shot
at beelining it.

523
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:19,063
If you make the team.

524
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:21,151
Oh, he'll
make the team.

525
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:24,182
He's an ex-quarterback.

526
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:25,093
Oh, well...

527
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:26,812
thank you so much
for that.

528
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:28,310
I had no idea.

529
00:21:28,715 --> 00:21:30,290
Here I was thinking
he's some candy-ass

530
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:31,542
that fell off a tricycle.

531
00:21:35,457 --> 00:21:37,193
Let me just put this to you,
Ms. Garrity.

532
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:38,583
Mm-hmm, what's that?

533
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:39,580
What's that, Herc?

534
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:40,611
Football...

535
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:43,111
is not quad rugby.

536
00:21:43,848 --> 00:21:44,692
Mm.

537
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,930
Thank you
for the enlightenment.

538
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:50,043
'Cause...
you're right, no.

539
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:50,920
No, it--

540
00:21:51,717 --> 00:21:52,651
it's not, is it?

541
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,972
Just what the hell
are you trying to say?

542
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:56,711
Herc, back off.

543
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:58,272
Exactly what I said.

544
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:02,142
I-I think she was simply...

545
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:03,921
trying to say that...

546
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:06,373
Jason is a football star.

547
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:07,701
Why wouldn't he want
to start?

548
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:09,873
- Right, Lyla?
- Yeah!

549
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,503
Thanks.

550
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:12,871
Thanks a lot, sweetie.

551
00:22:13,427 --> 00:22:14,652
But I can
take care of myself.

552
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,982
Save your charity
for those in need.

553
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:18,270
Maybe Herc.

554
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,041
You know what?

555
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:21,893
While you're at it,

556
00:22:22,197 --> 00:22:25,373
why don't you go and tattoo
someone else's fiancée, hmm?

557
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,280
Oh, snap!

558
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,273
Y'all read that guy
for the Lit test?

559
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,060
What's his name, uh...

560
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:33,830
"I saw two paths..."

561
00:22:34,057 --> 00:22:34,940
Robert Frost.

562
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:36,721
You on that.

563
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:39,172
Somebody been studying,
obviously.

564
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:40,242
I do what I can.

565
00:22:40,557 --> 00:22:41,890
Yeah, you know
what's crazy, though?

566
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:44,571
Think about who we've
been studying this year.

567
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:46,761
Okay, we've got your boy,
Robert Frost.

568
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:49,481
Boring white guy.
Okay?

569
00:22:49,656 --> 00:22:52,663
And then we've got, uh,
Emily Dickinson--

570
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:53,572
psycho chick.

571
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,123
But for real, for real.

572
00:22:57,157 --> 00:22:59,350
Like, let's think about it.
Like what about

573
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:00,170
our poets of color?

574
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:01,861
How come we're not
studying them, you know?

575
00:23:01,928 --> 00:23:02,492
Like who?

576
00:23:02,905 --> 00:23:04,040
Are you serious?

577
00:23:04,285 --> 00:23:06,441
Like Gwendolyn Brooks, okay?

578
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:09,011
Sterling Brown.
We got Amiri Baraka.

579
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,822
And then there's, uh, oh...

580
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,333
Robert Hayden:

581
00:23:12,715 --> 00:23:14,680
"Some I love
who are dead

582
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:17,730
"were watchers
"of the moon,
and knew its lore.

583
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,781
"Planted seeds,
trimmed their hair,

584
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:23,212
"and pierced their ears
for gold hoop earrings

585
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:25,262
"as it waxed or waned.

586
00:23:25,507 --> 00:23:27,210
"It shines tonight
upon their grave.

587
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:29,081
"And--and burned

588
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:30,890
"in the gardens
of Gethsemane.

589
00:23:31,236 --> 00:23:34,572
"Its light made holy
by the dazzling tears

590
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:35,922
"and spread--

591
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:38,022
and spread its radiance

592
00:23:38,647 --> 00:23:40,142
"on the exile's path

593
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,393
"of he who
is the glorious one.

594
00:23:42,425 --> 00:23:45,713
Its light made holy
by his holiness."

595
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,332
And--and--and...

596
00:23:48,198 --> 00:23:50,042
already, okay?

597
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:52,060
Already a mooted goal.

598
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:54,421
And tomorrow perhaps,

599
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:56,742
tomorrow perhaps

600
00:23:56,988 --> 00:23:58,550
an arms base,

601
00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:00,153
a livid sector.

602
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:01,321
You know why, y'all?

603
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:03,543
- Baby...hey, baby.
- Because the full moon...

604
00:24:03,585 --> 00:24:05,921
- Baby, baby.
- That's what I'm sayin', y'all.

605
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,170
I know, I know.

606
00:24:15,596 --> 00:24:16,943
Hey, y'all might want
to get a room.

607
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:21,881
I'm sure there's a hotel nearby.

608
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:22,962
It's your boy.

609
00:24:24,216 --> 00:24:26,501
That's how Robert Hayden
makes me feel.

610
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,901
Robert Hayden
can write.

611
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:30,192
Think she got enough?

612
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:31,712
You'll pass that test
now, huh?

613
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:44,911
Mindy, who turned
the music up?

614
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:46,322
I was trying to sleep.

615
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:48,270
You know what?
You need to stop drinking.

616
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:52,311
What does that mean?

617
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:53,711
Here you go.

618
00:24:55,968 --> 00:24:56,761
You okay?

619
00:24:57,185 --> 00:24:58,071
Seem a little nervous.

620
00:24:58,646 --> 00:25:00,682
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
I just...

621
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:02,232
just...

622
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:05,281
I don't know.
I just don't defy my parents well.

623
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:07,191
Honey, you're not even
doing anything that bad.

624
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:08,511
I mean, really.

625
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:10,151
Yeah, except
for the fact

626
00:25:10,197 --> 00:25:12,463
that I've been totally forbidden
to even hang out with you.

627
00:25:14,027 --> 00:25:14,732
Really?

628
00:25:15,736 --> 00:25:16,501
Forbidden?

629
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:17,951
That's, um...

630
00:25:18,546 --> 00:25:20,003
that's kind of
a dramatic word.

631
00:25:20,775 --> 00:25:22,592
I don't know, I don't think
it was anything personal.

632
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:23,881
Right, of course not.

633
00:25:24,037 --> 00:25:25,262
Oh, there's your friends.

634
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,401
Hey, y'all.

635
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:28,421
- Hey, Tyra.
- Hi.

636
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:29,741
How y'all doin'?

637
00:25:30,156 --> 00:25:30,762
Whoo!

638
00:25:33,368 --> 00:25:34,042
How's it going?

639
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,641
I'm sorry I couldn't
get here earlier.

640
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:36,971
I was running
all these drills

641
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:38,281
to get ready
for the semis.

642
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:41,052
Ah, hard at work,
Mr. Matthew Saracen.

643
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:43,552
Here.

644
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,213
How you doing, Tyra?

645
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:48,182
So what happened? What--

646
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:50,531
Ahem, to your
loving mother.

647
00:25:51,457 --> 00:25:53,002
- To my loving mother.
- You know what? Hold on.

648
00:25:53,376 --> 00:25:54,451
Who's just so loving.

649
00:25:55,107 --> 00:25:56,103
Hold on one second.

650
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:57,870
Another one,
everybody, to Tyra.

651
00:25:58,315 --> 00:25:59,391
Everybody.

652
00:25:59,505 --> 00:26:01,400
- To Tyra.
- Thank you.

653
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:03,142
I'm in your house
right now

654
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:06,173
with you and strippers.

655
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:09,712
And just God bless everyone
who enters here.

656
00:26:10,285 --> 00:26:11,032
Cheers.

657
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:23,092
Does your mom know
that you're here?

658
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:24,020
Matt...

659
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:25,992
why are you
asking that?

660
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:28,460
Look, it's just
I don't really want you

661
00:26:28,515 --> 00:26:29,412
to get grounded again.

662
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:31,260
I kind of like
being allowed to see you.

663
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:35,371
I'm not gonna get grounded
again, okay?

664
00:26:35,616 --> 00:26:36,191
You're not?

665
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:39,031
No, and nothing is gonna
keep me from seeing you.

666
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:40,210
- Okay.
- Are we good?

667
00:26:40,856 --> 00:26:41,403
Yeah.

668
00:26:44,535 --> 00:26:45,402
Hey, Mindy,

669
00:26:45,657 --> 00:26:47,640
- where are my cigarettes?
- Is that Tyra's mom?

670
00:26:47,698 --> 00:26:48,780
Yeah, but she's cool.

671
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:50,722
Mama, they're
on the coffee table.

672
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:51,623
Go back to bed.

673
00:26:52,305 --> 00:26:53,243
I got it.
I'm up,

674
00:26:53,336 --> 00:26:55,412
I'm up.
I'm up, I'm up.

675
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:57,350
- I'm up already.
- Go back to bed.

676
00:26:57,695 --> 00:26:59,060
- Go to bed.
- Is she okay?

677
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:01,373
'Cause she doesn't
really look okay.

678
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,311
Mom?
Are you okay?

679
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,243
- I'm fine.
- Oh, my God, there's blood.

680
00:27:14,747 --> 00:27:16,152
Jesus, somebody call 911!

681
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:19,060
I'm so sorry.
I just fell.

682
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:19,743
I'm so sorry.

683
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:21,811
Everybody's okay.
Everybody's okay.

684
00:27:21,868 --> 00:27:23,001
Everybody's okay.

685
00:27:24,675 --> 00:27:25,862
Not many people
could have pulled off

686
00:27:25,888 --> 00:27:28,213
the season you've had, after that
tragedy with Jason Street.

687
00:27:28,887 --> 00:27:30,631
The fact that you got in there
 with what you had left

688
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,020
and pulled that team together

689
00:27:32,425 --> 00:27:33,580
is nothing short
of miraculous.

690
00:27:34,907 --> 00:27:36,742
I'll tell you what,
we got a bunch of good kids.

691
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:37,960
Oh, it's more than that.

692
00:27:38,998 --> 00:27:40,922
We're all very impressed
over at TMU.

693
00:27:42,376 --> 00:27:43,140
Appreciate that.

694
00:27:44,185 --> 00:27:45,660
Excuse me one second.
So sorry.

695
00:27:46,408 --> 00:27:47,210
Everything all right?

696
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:48,682
Yeah.
Jules?

697
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:50,900
Okay, let me preface this
by saying

698
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:52,683
I'm not hurt, so please
don't have a heart attack.

699
00:27:53,415 --> 00:27:54,161
What's the matter?

700
00:27:54,828 --> 00:27:55,713
I'm at the hospital.

701
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:57,341
Tyra's mom
had an accident, and...

702
00:27:58,488 --> 00:28:00,121
there's no adult
here to handle this.

703
00:28:00,466 --> 00:28:02,372
Well, honey,
what are you doing there?

704
00:28:03,008 --> 00:28:04,640
I was at a party
at her house.

705
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:05,542
Julie...

706
00:28:05,657 --> 00:28:06,520
Look, Mom,

707
00:28:06,627 --> 00:28:08,771
you can yell at me later.
 But can you just get here?

708
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:11,133
Yeah, baby,
I'll be there. I'll be there.

709
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:17,113
Thank you very much for...

710
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:18,401
sitting through that.

711
00:28:18,658 --> 00:28:20,543
No, thanks for having me.

712
00:28:20,675 --> 00:28:21,421
It was great.

713
00:28:21,947 --> 00:28:23,052
He's a funny kid.

714
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:25,521
I'm sure you've got
your hands full.

715
00:28:26,566 --> 00:28:27,412
Yeah.

716
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:31,490
Bo, hurry up.
The man's waiting.

717
00:28:31,568 --> 00:28:33,173
I almost got it!

718
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:36,902
You know, uh...

719
00:28:37,387 --> 00:28:38,571
your rain gutter's

720
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:39,650
falling off, huh?

721
00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:40,881
Oh, yeah, heh.

722
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,092
That's on my long list
of things to do.

723
00:28:44,145 --> 00:28:46,753
I've got, um, work and Bo,

724
00:28:46,795 --> 00:28:47,802
and then homework.

725
00:28:48,136 --> 00:28:49,381
I just don't
 really have time to do it.

726
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,101
- Yeah.
- I'll get to it.

727
00:28:50,217 --> 00:28:50,853
Here it is!

728
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,603
I thought you might
wanna have this.

729
00:28:55,187 --> 00:28:56,550
Well, you
thought right.

730
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:57,500
Yeah.

731
00:28:57,558 --> 00:28:58,273
Handsome.

732
00:28:58,327 --> 00:28:59,311
It's fantastic.

733
00:28:59,377 --> 00:29:00,771
This is going
on the fridge.

734
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:02,761
- Yes!
- I'll tell you that much.

735
00:29:03,468 --> 00:29:04,701
- All right.
- All right.

736
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,181
Good night.

737
00:29:06,985 --> 00:29:08,340
- Thanks again.
- Yeah.

738
00:29:09,055 --> 00:29:10,102
Bye, Tim Riggins!

739
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:12,122
Good night, Bo.

740
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:19,163
You feeling okay?

741
00:29:20,118 --> 00:29:21,560
I feel wonderful.

742
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,560
Why are you asking me?
Why?

743
00:29:24,325 --> 00:29:25,773
Just seem
a little different lately.

744
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:26,830
Just 'cause--

745
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:28,580
'cause I'm alive?

746
00:29:28,775 --> 00:29:30,322
Because I'm feeling
the world?

747
00:29:30,378 --> 00:29:33,613
If that's different, then sign me up,
I'm different.

748
00:29:33,957 --> 00:29:34,992
I feel great.

749
00:29:38,516 --> 00:29:39,872
All right, it's like this.

750
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:42,760
I was taking
some medication for a while,

751
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:45,203
and...now I'm off of it.

752
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:47,353
What kind of medication?

753
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:49,322
It was like this

754
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:51,882
stuff for a mood disorder.

755
00:29:52,378 --> 00:29:54,210
But it's really no big deal.

756
00:29:54,756 --> 00:29:55,901
I'm better now, you know?

757
00:29:55,957 --> 00:29:57,610
I got it under control, I...

758
00:29:58,606 --> 00:30:00,293
I don't need drugs
to keep me straight.

759
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:04,812
Does your dad know
you stopped taking them?

760
00:30:05,576 --> 00:30:07,273
Uh, do you know
who my dad is?

761
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:09,303
You've seen him
in the pulpit.

762
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:12,280
- Sweatin', words.
- He do be sweatin'.

763
00:30:12,516 --> 00:30:13,730
Ooh, he do be sweatin'.

764
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:15,850
No, he's just--
he doesn't get it.

765
00:30:16,018 --> 00:30:18,070
You know, I mean,
it's my body.

766
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:20,261
I can do whatever
 I want with it, you know?

767
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:21,471
Things are good,
 it's like,

768
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,821
how do you feel
when you're out on the field?

769
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:25,663
I feel...

770
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:28,450
- alive.
- Alive!

771
00:30:28,698 --> 00:30:29,651
Exactly.

772
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:30,623
That's what
I'm talking about.

773
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:31,802
That's how I feel.

774
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:33,261
Trust.

775
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:35,843
I feel better
than I've ever felt.

776
00:30:37,188 --> 00:30:37,721
Okay.

777
00:30:39,425 --> 00:30:40,130
Okay.

778
00:30:50,655 --> 00:30:53,250
I really think I had a 
breakthrough with Tyra tonight.

779
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:54,802
Landry...

780
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:56,772
- you're retarded.
- Jules...

781
00:30:57,676 --> 00:30:58,551
Mom, I'm really sorry.

782
00:30:58,596 --> 00:30:59,592
I don't want to talk about it
right here, right now.

783
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:01,112
Okay, please?
How's Tyra's mom?

784
00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:02,533
I guess she's okay.
I don't know.

785
00:31:02,565 --> 00:31:03,373
They won't let us in.

786
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:05,831
Will you do me a favor, please,
and take her home?

787
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:07,222
But I wanna
stay here and help.

788
00:31:07,276 --> 00:31:09,141
I will make sure Tyra's mom
gets home safely.

789
00:31:09,227 --> 00:31:10,381
- Can you do that, Matt? 
- Yes, ma'am.

790
00:31:10,486 --> 00:31:11,271
I want you home.

791
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:14,800
Y'all drive safe.

792
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:16,023
Yes--yes, ma'am.

793
00:31:19,867 --> 00:31:23,312
Uh, can you get me
information on Angela Collette?

794
00:31:23,978 --> 00:31:24,662
Julie!

795
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,661
Hey.
Julie didn't come home?

796
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:30,310
Hey.

797
00:31:32,248 --> 00:31:34,080
So how's Neil Kenny doing?

798
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:39,000
How the hell did you know
I went out with Neil Kenny?

799
00:31:40,516 --> 00:31:41,683
Note pad.

800
00:31:43,587 --> 00:31:45,551
It's a little something
I learned on Magnum, P.I.

801
00:31:46,978 --> 00:31:48,990
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Worked pretty dad gum well.

802
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:50,122
You gotta be kidding me.

803
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:51,691
So did he
offer you a job?

804
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:55,393
No. No, no.

805
00:31:55,448 --> 00:31:56,552
Not officially, Buddy.

806
00:31:56,936 --> 00:31:58,133
No, not officially.

807
00:31:58,396 --> 00:31:59,082
You gonna take it?

808
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,341
No, I'm not gonna
take it, Buddy,

809
00:32:00,415 --> 00:32:01,170
'cause it's not official.

810
00:32:01,178 --> 00:32:02,440
Okay, well,
when it's official,

811
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:03,573
are you gonna take it?

812
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:07,083
Are you?

813
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:08,702
Gee, I don't know.

814
00:32:08,745 --> 00:32:10,540
I'll let you know
 when the time comes, Buddy.

815
00:32:11,005 --> 00:32:12,713
Yeah, I might need to know.

816
00:32:13,977 --> 00:32:14,911
God.

817
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:20,032
Do we need to talk?

818
00:32:25,957 --> 00:32:26,841
Do you love her?

819
00:32:27,586 --> 00:32:28,871
- Do I what?
- Do you love her?

820
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:29,731
Love who?

821
00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:32,221
The cute tattoo girl,
Jason.

822
00:32:33,188 --> 00:32:34,343
Are you serious right now?

823
00:32:34,947 --> 00:32:36,400
- No, I don't love her. 
- You do love her.

824
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:37,920
No, I don't love her.
It's okay, it's okay.

825
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:39,270
- No, I don't.
- No, you can tell me.

826
00:32:39,377 --> 00:32:39,870
Lyla--

827
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:42,020
- Tell me, it's okay.
- I have never seen you this wasted.

828
00:32:43,175 --> 00:32:43,871
I'm not wasted.

829
00:32:43,915 --> 00:32:45,250
You're cracking me up.
 You are!

830
00:32:45,285 --> 00:32:46,401
- Do you love her?
- No, I don't.

831
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:49,121
You're funny
when you're drunk.

832
00:32:49,585 --> 00:32:50,803
It's not funny, Jason,

833
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:52,742
when you drive
all the way from Dillon,

834
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,550
and you find your boyfriend
hanging out

835
00:32:54,757 --> 00:32:56,261
with people
 that scare you.

836
00:32:56,337 --> 00:32:59,261
And getting tattoos
 from sexy girls.

837
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,560
It's not funny.

838
00:33:01,165 --> 00:33:03,012
It's not funny, Jason.

839
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,163
It's not funny.

840
00:33:07,037 --> 00:33:08,042
You're changing,

841
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,661
and it is so real.

842
00:33:09,848 --> 00:33:11,393
And I'm not changing
with you.

843
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:13,452
We're never gonna last,

844
00:33:13,495 --> 00:33:15,011
because I'm not
changing with you.

845
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,202
Well, I'm sorry, I...

846
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:20,632
Lyla...

847
00:33:26,378 --> 00:33:27,472
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

848
00:33:27,528 --> 00:33:28,332
No, it's okay.

849
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:30,110
It's okay, it's okay,

850
00:33:30,165 --> 00:33:30,953
because you know what?

851
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,223
It's bigger than us.

852
00:33:32,266 --> 00:33:33,721
Nothing is bigger
than us, Lyla!

853
00:33:33,787 --> 00:33:35,622
Nothing is bigger than us.

854
00:33:36,856 --> 00:33:37,861
Nothing is bigger

855
00:33:37,988 --> 00:33:39,351
than the love
I have for you in my heart.

856
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,620
Nothing is bigger than that.

857
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:43,670
And I'm not holding
on to you anymore

858
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:44,901
because you're
all I have left.

859
00:33:44,946 --> 00:33:46,693
I'm holding on to you
because I love you.

860
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:48,921
And I need you in my life.

861
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,262
And I'm not giving you up
without a fight.

862
00:33:51,316 --> 00:33:53,540
I am not letting you go.

863
00:33:55,748 --> 00:33:56,490
I love you.

864
00:34:13,077 --> 00:34:14,191
I brought you some water.

865
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,313
Thank you
for doing all this.

866
00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:20,682
You're welcome.

867
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:22,862
Take care of yourself,
all right?

868
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:23,770
Thank you.

869
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:00,691
Thanks for helping me
 bring my mama home.

870
00:35:01,357 --> 00:35:02,220
You're welcome.

871
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:04,251
You can go home now.
You don't have to help me clean up.

872
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:07,052
Well, I think somebody's gonna
have to help you here, hon.

873
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:08,373
Well, it's not
 gonna be you.

874
00:35:09,737 --> 00:35:11,850
Yeah, actually, I think
right now it is gonna be me.

875
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:14,593
You know, why don't you
quit pretending like you actually

876
00:35:14,636 --> 00:35:16,641
give a damn about what
happens to me or my family?

877
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:19,031
- I do give a damn.
- Please.

878
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:21,563
I found out tonight you won't
even let Julie hang out with me.

879
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,483
Like I'm some kind
 of virus.

880
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:24,813
So it's a little annoying

881
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:26,690
when you come into my house
and try to act superior,

882
00:35:26,736 --> 00:35:28,012
start cleaning up
like you're some kind

883
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:29,873
of friend of the family.
 'Cause you are not.

884
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:31,522
So you know what?
 You just--

885
00:35:31,737 --> 00:35:33,271
you go take
your precious little daughter,

886
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:35,621
and you lock her away,
so bad people like me,

887
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:37,122
we can't hurt her.

888
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:38,782
- Honey...
- Just go home!

889
00:35:45,107 --> 00:35:45,852
Tyra...

890
00:35:54,826 --> 00:35:55,760
It's just that...

891
00:35:57,757 --> 00:35:59,053
Julie's my girl.

892
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:05,643
And she's never
behaved like this before.

893
00:36:05,717 --> 00:36:07,302
And I might have been
blaming you for that.

894
00:36:07,326 --> 00:36:08,160
I mean, you know,

895
00:36:08,227 --> 00:36:09,931
it could be that she's
just growing up.

896
00:36:11,528 --> 00:36:12,593
And I thought
that I would be

897
00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:14,350
prepared for all that,
'cause I'm her mother,

898
00:36:14,387 --> 00:36:15,503
and I thought I would...

899
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:19,072
be prepared for whatever
came down the way.

900
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:21,931
And...boy,
I'll tell you what.

901
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:23,372
It feels like
a big ol' freight train

902
00:36:23,386 --> 00:36:24,882
just headin' right
in my direction.

903
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:28,333
And I can't do a thing
to stop it.

904
00:36:28,388 --> 00:36:29,872
But I'm just trying.

905
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:31,973
I'm just trying
my hardest to stop it.

906
00:36:35,677 --> 00:36:37,503
So I'm sorry, Tyra.

907
00:36:41,057 --> 00:36:41,650
Thank you.

908
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:45,692
I'll get the broom.

909
00:36:54,906 --> 00:36:55,422
Hey.

910
00:36:58,238 --> 00:36:58,802
What are you doing?

911
00:36:59,495 --> 00:37:01,362
Oh, I guess I'll go hide out

912
00:37:01,425 --> 00:37:03,052
in some hotel.
Maybe nobody'll see me.

913
00:37:11,288 --> 00:37:12,301
- Okay.
- Eric, I just don't think

914
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:14,120
it's very cool
for you to be meeting

915
00:37:14,157 --> 00:37:16,963
with TMU while I'm living
right under your roof.

916
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:19,680
I mean, do you care
anything about the Panthers?

917
00:37:19,765 --> 00:37:20,870
Can I ask you a question?

918
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:23,282
How can you even
think about that stuff

919
00:37:23,346 --> 00:37:25,051
when you're in the mess
that you are with your wife?

920
00:37:25,568 --> 00:37:26,113
Really.

921
00:37:26,235 --> 00:37:27,391
Pam will forgive me.

922
00:37:28,107 --> 00:37:28,752
You think?

923
00:37:29,688 --> 00:37:30,573
You know what I think?

924
00:37:31,218 --> 00:37:33,090
I think you hide your head
in football

925
00:37:33,136 --> 00:37:34,033
a little too much, Buddy.

926
00:37:34,105 --> 00:37:35,552
'Cause I don't think
you should care about the semis.

927
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:36,712
I don't think
 you should care about

928
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:38,002
who I'm having dinner with,

929
00:37:38,128 --> 00:37:39,940
or who the hell is even
 coaching the team.

930
00:37:40,965 --> 00:37:42,560
I think you need
 to worry about your family.

931
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,003
I think you need to worry
about your family, man.

932
00:37:52,568 --> 00:37:53,420
You know what, Eric?

933
00:37:54,127 --> 00:37:56,070
I'll always care
about the Panthers.

934
00:37:56,215 --> 00:37:58,121
Pam can cut off my head

935
00:37:58,365 --> 00:38:00,683
and stick it on a spike
in the front yard.

936
00:38:01,036 --> 00:38:02,773
But I'll always care.

937
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:03,753
Always.

938
00:38:10,346 --> 00:38:11,943
All right,
I think that's it.

939
00:38:12,107 --> 00:38:12,870
Yeah.

940
00:38:15,115 --> 00:38:17,500
Will you call me if there's
anything your mom needs?

941
00:38:17,915 --> 00:38:18,423
Yeah.

942
00:38:25,317 --> 00:38:26,361
And you know what, Tyra?

943
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,363
Hmm?

944
00:38:28,356 --> 00:38:30,253
Why don't you come on by
my office on Monday?

945
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:33,700
I'd like to talk to you
about your academic future.

946
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:37,213
What am I,
your next project?

947
00:38:38,938 --> 00:38:40,011
Absolutely.

948
00:38:42,968 --> 00:38:44,252
Take care of yourself,
sweetheart.

949
00:38:49,798 --> 00:38:50,633
Mrs. T?

950
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:51,812
Yeah?

951
00:38:54,627 --> 00:38:55,233
Thank you.

952
00:38:56,518 --> 00:38:57,393
You're welcome.

953
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:17,931
Hey, baby.

954
00:39:18,165 --> 00:39:19,573
Dad's at church all day.

955
00:39:20,345 --> 00:39:21,703
You wanna come baby-sit?

956
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:24,692
Give me two minutes.

957
00:39:25,337 --> 00:39:25,913
Okay.

958
00:39:33,895 --> 00:39:34,821
Victory.

959
00:39:46,755 --> 00:39:47,613
You know what?

960
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,123
This is all
gonna work out.

961
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:55,033
You'll see.

962
00:39:57,867 --> 00:39:58,480
Watch.

963
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:00,213
After I make this team,

964
00:40:01,336 --> 00:40:02,741
we'll go
on a little vacation.

965
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,413
We'll go to Beijing
for the Paralympics.

966
00:40:10,768 --> 00:40:11,502
You'll see.

967
00:40:12,185 --> 00:40:12,902
Do you trust me?

968
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:14,273
Hmm?

969
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:15,600
Waverly?

970
00:41:17,805 --> 00:41:18,392
Wavy.

971
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:22,702
Wavy?

972
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:25,442
Waverly.

973
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:29,261
Wavy?

974
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:34,442
Waverly?

975
00:41:44,438 --> 00:41:45,353
Hey.
What's wrong?

976
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:02,533
Mm, thank you.

977
00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:07,753
I got the call.

978
00:42:10,176 --> 00:42:10,830
The call?

979
00:42:13,027 --> 00:42:14,063
TMU made the offer.

980
00:42:20,446 --> 00:42:21,170
Wow.

981
00:42:23,947 --> 00:42:24,462
Yep.
