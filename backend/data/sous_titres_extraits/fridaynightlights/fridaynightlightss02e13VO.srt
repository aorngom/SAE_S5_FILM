1
00:00:00,641 --> 00:00:02,538
Black on white
actually run in the family?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,517
- Leave her alone.
- You got one of ours,

3
00:00:04,677 --> 00:00:06,333
why shouldn't we get one of yours?

4
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:12,089
- You are an interesting girl.
- Thanks.

5
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:17,553
You make me feel too much. It's just
a little time to think about things.

6
00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:20,098
I can't wait around till you realize
that I can't.

7
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:22,350
I don't know what else to do.
Good night.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,311
What we gonna do about the house?

9
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:27,022
We gotta get $2000 in two weeks.

10
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:30,066
Get your crap, let's get out of here.
What are you doing? Come on.

11
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:31,484
It's our mortgage.

12
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:35,238
We juste stole $3000 from one
of the biggest drug dealers in Dillon.

13
00:00:42,088 --> 00:00:45,624
- I don't need a new transmission.
- Hold on, let the man talk.

14
00:00:45,885 --> 00:00:49,669
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
gentlemen. The transmission's shot.

15
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,797
I'm gonna have to pull the housing off,
reset the flywheel

16
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:55,214
I might as well drop in
a new throw out there.

17
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:59,448
You throw the rest of the damn car away?
How much is this gonna cost?

18
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:00,989
4 or 5 grand.

19
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:03,185
The money at least come with an orgasm?

20
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:05,806
We'll know better once we get in there
and see what's wrong.

21
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,867
- This car is not even worth 4 grand.
- You talking about old Bessie...

22
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,101
You told me she was in tip top shape...

23
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:14,110
I told you years ago that you should
take better care of old Bessie

24
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,281
- and rebuild the transmission...
- What? Years ago you know about this?

25
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,867
- You can't put all the blame...
- Look me in the eye!

26
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:22,942
Buddy, can you get in here?

27
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:30,126
Hey, guys, come on.

28
00:01:31,187 --> 00:01:34,012
I have never seen you act like that.

29
00:01:34,172 --> 00:01:35,590
What's wrong with you, son?

30
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,947
Mr. Garrity, it's just...
That guy...

31
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:42,305
He sold me a bad truck, and now,
it's gonna cost $4,000 to get it fixed.

32
00:01:42,565 --> 00:01:45,684
- Do you know how much money I got?
- No, I do not.

33
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:49,196
$8,000. That's half my money.

34
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:52,629
Well...

35
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:56,434
Jason, maybe you just gonna...

36
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:59,114
have to do without a car for a while.

37
00:01:59,374 --> 00:02:02,145
You don't understand
what it's like to have

38
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:05,746
to rely on people to get you around,
all over town, have rides everywhere.

39
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:09,374
I don't fit in most of my friends' cars.
I'm gonna have to pay for this truck

40
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:13,753
and hopefully I won't run out of money
and move back in with my parents.

41
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,851
Tell you something.

42
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:26,975
You ever thought about selling cars?

43
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:38,365
Well...

44
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:40,288
Looky here!

45
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:42,282
Timmy boy Riggins!

46
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,646
What's going on, man?

47
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:47,845
What's going down?

48
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:51,168
Not much, you know... I'm just...
doing my thing, I guess.

49
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:54,209
You don't come around very often
anymore. The ferrets miss you.

50
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:56,225
They're depressed.

51
00:02:58,736 --> 00:03:01,843
Boys and I fixing to go hunting.
Grab some beer and come with us?

52
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:04,512
Actually,
I gotta take care of some stuff, so...

53
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:07,557
Gotta do what you gotta do, huh?
Alright, man.

54
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:11,436
- You guys have a good day.
- Listen, Tim.

55
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:13,927
Hold up, man.

56
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,408
I miss you, you know.

57
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:18,443
I'm worried about you.

58
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:20,974
Worried you might get in
with the wrong people,

59
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,697
do something stupid.

60
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,150
Now, why don't you to tell me
where the hell my money is.

61
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,397
You got till the end of the week,
pretty boy,

62
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,926
or I'll shoot your knees off.

63
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,443
Let's go.

64
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,472
Good luck with the game on Friday!

65
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,656
Ma'am, is Brian Williams your son?

66
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:08,785
- Yes, he is. Can I help you?
- We have a warrant for his arrest.

67
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:11,653
- An arrest warrant? For what?
- On assault charges.

68
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:13,832
- Can your son step out?
- Wait a minute.

69
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:15,458
Sorry, Mama.

70
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:18,848
What's going on here?
An arrest warrant for what?

71
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,173
Something happened last week. I can't
tell you, but it's gonna be okay.

72
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:24,362
- Just say your song.
- I can't tell you...

73
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:26,791
Y'all ain't got to put
no handcuffs on him.

74
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:29,597
We got all served no papers,
and y'all just gonna take him away?

75
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:31,206
What's going on here?

76
00:04:32,845 --> 00:04:33,874
Watch your head.

77
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,273
I don't want this here!

78
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:42,872
2x13: HUMBLE PIE

www.top-series.net (1.00)

81
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:27,761
I need someone else
to coach that damn volleyball team.

82
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:29,722
Coach Pima up and leaves

83
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:32,810
right in the middle of the season.
She up and leaves.

84
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,371
Terrible. Can't be you, that's for sure,

85
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:37,282
even if you are athletic director.

86
00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:39,816
Can you butter some toasts there for me,
babe? Thank you.

87
00:05:39,976 --> 00:05:42,943
- I'd love to butter you some toasts.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

88
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:48,247
Why... Honey, why are you looking
at me like that?

89
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:50,637
You know I can't do it.
I don't have time.

90
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:53,848
You used to play varsity volleyball.
You know the sport.

91
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,329
- Sweetheart, that is irrelevant.
- Did you not just say to me

92
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:59,938
- that you want more exercise?
- I got Gracie Belle.

93
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:02,732
Well, there you go.

94
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:05,860
You get to work with the girls,
you get the exercise.

95
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,487
They've got lots of spunk.

96
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:10,615
They're zero and seven this year.
They're failing miserably.

97
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,952
- You be quiet and eat your breakfast.
- When seven is rebuilding.

98
00:06:14,212 --> 00:06:17,676
Listen. It is 3 weeks. Period.
4 at most.

99
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:20,271
When?

100
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,200
I'll be down there.

101
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:26,589
Alright, thanks, Bill.
Alright.

102
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:29,029
What's up?

103
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:33,054
Gotta go to the police station.
Smash is down there.

104
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,979
I don't know any more.
See you in a little.

105
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:38,076
Thank you.
You're a good woman.

106
00:06:56,254 --> 00:07:00,110
Y'all all know this is one of the finest
quarterbacks we ever had here in Dillon.

107
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,334
He's gonna be a fine sales associate.
Welcome him to our team.

108
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:07,463
I want y'all to treat him like family,
teach him the ropes.

109
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:10,967
- Have a good day, Jason. It'll be good.
- Thank you, Mr. Garrity.

110
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:16,639
Can you believe this?
We're not selling any cars as it is.

111
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:18,985
Now we got competition in a wheelchair.

112
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:21,623
This is great. Great for my mortgage.

113
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:30,155
He couldn't have done this.

114
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,321
Tell me you did not do this.

115
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:36,034
Mama, he was talking smack to Noannie.
Was I supposed to let it happen?

116
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:37,968
You were supposed to walk away.

117
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:40,830
I told you a million times.
You gotta be better than other people.

118
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,660
Let me lay out your options.

119
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:47,147
If we make a case that Brian felt
threatened, was defending himself,

120
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:49,160
could lead to a messy trial.

121
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,592
If he's found guilty,
the judge will throw the book at him.

122
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,658
On the other hand, given that
the injuries weren't too severe

123
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:59,525
and Smash is a respected athlete,

124
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:01,738
I'm pretty sure I can get
the ADA to cut a deal.

125
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,020
A deal?
What kind of deal?

126
00:08:04,412 --> 00:08:07,617
- He pleads guilty to a misdemeanor...
- No.

127
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:10,238
Listen to this man, now.

128
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:12,779
- I don't need to...
- Listen to your mother, would you?

129
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:16,142
I won't sit up here
and let you throw away everything,

130
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:19,079
'cause of your big ignorant ego.
Do you hear me?

131
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:22,523
If making a deal makes
this thing go away,

132
00:08:22,683 --> 00:08:25,451
we gonna listen to
what this man has to say.

133
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:29,501
Now please, go on.

134
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:32,799
<i>Good afternoon,</i>

135
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,842
I appreciate that you're letting me

136
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:38,500
speak on the altercation I had last week
involving white teenagers.

137
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,358
I struck someone,
which I shouldn't have done

138
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:45,853
and I want to apologize to him
and everyone for doing so.

139
00:08:46,113 --> 00:08:48,564
I also want to make it clear
I've learned from my mistakes

140
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:51,432
and assure you all
that it won't happen again.

141
00:08:57,953 --> 00:09:01,761
On the container of one leader,
S is 3 cm²,

142
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,329
L is 5...

143
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:07,375
- That gives us...
- The frequency would be 130 Hz.

144
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:12,171
Landry Clarke, just the man
I need to see.

145
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,342
A long time I've seen you.

146
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:19,053
- Hi, I'm Jean.
- This is Jean.

147
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:21,829
Sorry. Jean, this is Tyra.
Tyra, this is Jean,

148
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:23,410
an old buddy of mine.

149
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:27,081
So, biology quizz.
This is about this rat experiment

150
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:29,981
that says pure calories
lead to a longer life, or something.

151
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:32,692
It's actually a trick question.

152
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,162
The rats that died sooner
were fed on sugar and yeast.

153
00:09:37,322 --> 00:09:40,491
So, it's sort of a question of diet
restriction more than anything else.

154
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,894
Thanks, Landry.
I appreciate that.

155
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm gonna get a coke.
You want anything?

156
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,711
- I'm okay.
- Okay, great.

157
00:09:52,297 --> 00:09:54,523
- It was nice meeting you.
- Bye.

158
00:09:55,474 --> 00:09:57,474
- She's got cool hair.
- So,

159
00:09:57,634 --> 00:10:00,136
using your tutoring skills
to seduce freshmen, is that it?

160
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:05,808
No, we actually got paired up
for a physics project

161
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:08,692
- so it's kind of mandatory.
- She's in your physics class?

162
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:09,974
Looks like she's 12.

163
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:12,482
She's not.
She might've skipped a grade or two.

164
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:16,527
- Good luck with that.
- Okay. Thank you.

165
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:38,556
The only way

166
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:42,007
to really heal the ravages of sin

167
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,432
is to put our trust in the Lord.

168
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:51,074
Give our hearts over to Him.

169
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,548
And if we do,

170
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:57,109
miracles will come into our lives.

171
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:03,449
Do you feel the Lord in your hearts?
Do you feel Him?

172
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:07,370
Do you feel it?
Do you feel the Lord in your hearts?

173
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,249
Do you feel alive? Do you feel
that a friend is coming here tonight?

174
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:13,693
I am a friend of God...

175
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:16,080
Hey, how are you doing?

176
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:18,657
- What are you doing here?
- I gotta talk to you.

177
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:21,217
This is not the place.
What happened to your face?

178
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:23,986
I got beat up
by three meth addicts yesterday.

179
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:25,262
Why?

180
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:28,891
'Cause I stole $3,000.

181
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:31,058
Why would you steal
$3,000 from meth addicts?

182
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:33,040
It's not important right now.

183
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,356
What's important is I wanna talk to you.

184
00:11:35,617 --> 00:11:37,518
Come to my place tomorrow night to talk.

185
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:39,192
I'm not coming to your place.

186
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:41,925
... put our trust in the Lord.

187
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:43,906
I've got something important to say.

188
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,575
Tim, I'm not coming. Please, go.

189
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,330
- Say yes and I'll leave.
- Fine.

190
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,387
I'll come to your place.

191
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,342
For sure? Tell me you're coming
and I'm gone.

192
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:56,502
I'm coming.

193
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:26,149
Watch out!

194
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:29,994
Good start.

195
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:32,913
Over the net!

196
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:37,858
Just pick up the balls.
You're here to help, not to coach.

197
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:41,130
Oh, sweetie.

198
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,216
Now let's try to see
if we can get one back this time, y'all.

199
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:45,885
Talk to each other.

200
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:53,517
Talk to each other.

201
00:12:57,815 --> 00:13:00,643
I didn't hear a thing that time.
Talk to each other.

202
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:02,492
Focus! And I wanna hear you!

203
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,614
So the engine is 217 hp,
217 lbs for the torque.

204
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:09,950
The interior is pretty roomy,
plus the Ultralec seating

205
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,788
that keeps you warm in the winter
and cool in the summertime.

206
00:13:12,948 --> 00:13:15,550
- It's sold, man.
- Excellent! You have the...

207
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,124
dual front stage airbags.

208
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:20,544
I don't think you understand.
We actually wanna buy the car.

209
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,755
- We made up our minds.
- Alright.

210
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:25,575
<i>Jason Street, please report
to the sales lounge.</i>

211
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:28,639
That's me.
Make sure you are in love with the car,

212
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,877
then we'll start the paperwork.

213
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:36,236
Thank you.
What do you need?

214
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,889
What do you think you're doing?

215
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:40,856
I'm selling a car.
They wanna buy that car.

216
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:43,537
That's great.
That's great.

217
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,663
We have rules around here
that we all follow

218
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:47,317
starting with the point.

219
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,741
The point system.
The point system says

220
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,995
that higher your sales figures,
the higher you are in rotation.

221
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,218
If you're number one, as I am,
it means you get the first customer

222
00:13:58,378 --> 00:14:00,505
through the door
at the top of every hour.

223
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:03,254
Second on the list gets the next,
and so on.

224
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:05,541
- Got it?
- Nobody told me yesterday...

225
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:07,166
That's okay.

226
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:09,708
You're new. You're forgiven.

227
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:13,574
- Just check with me next time, okay?
- Okay. Sure thing. Will do.

228
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,851
- How do I look?
- Great.

229
00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:18,887
You know it.

230
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,795
We got a new Malibu out here.

231
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:27,940
Have you heard of this girl, Jane?

232
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,406
She's in Landry's physics class.

233
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,941
She is... long dreads, glasses, short.

234
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:38,303
There's a girl, Jean. She's in my
geometry class, with the pink hair.

235
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,688
She's interesting,
to say the least.

236
00:14:42,612 --> 00:14:44,507
She's a brainiac EPI classes

237
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:47,374
into, like, cult movies
and music and stuff like that.

238
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:50,551
- How's coaching day, honey?
- It was so great.

239
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,221
Those girls are so spunky.
Some of them don't even know the rules.

240
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:56,432
First day,
it's always a reality check.

241
00:14:56,692 --> 00:14:59,782
You did not give full disclosure
on that one, and that is for sure.

242
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:03,647
Can you girls put those chips away?
We're having dinner right now.

243
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:06,466
- Where does it go?
- Above the fridge.

244
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:09,001
Can you put that
on the table, sweetie?

245
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:21,540
- This casserole is something else.
- Thank you, sweetie.

246
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,669
I never realized you were so tall.

247
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:28,756
- 5'11".
- How about that?

248
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:31,074
You're a tall drink of water.

249
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,652
You know in what that'd be great for?
Volleyball.

250
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:37,373
- Mom, drop it.
- You ever thought about that?

251
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:40,333
It'd be great for your college apps,
sweetie.

252
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:44,730
- I'm gonna watch this game.
- Okay, sweetie, enjoy that.

253
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,471
In the colleges,
when they look at the applications,

254
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:50,445
they look at the big picture.
Which is why the sports would be

255
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,120
a great addition for you.

256
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,615
She came over for dinner,
not to get lectured.

257
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,792
The thing I love about athletics,
it's mind, body, spirit.

258
00:15:57,952 --> 00:16:01,217
I look at you and I see
that it would be real good for you.

259
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,542
You look at me and you see a spiker.

260
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:05,614
I do look at you and I see a spiker.

261
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:07,795
You know what I see?
A kick-ass spiker.

262
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,946
- Nothing wrong with that.
- Be honest and ask me for a favor

263
00:16:11,106 --> 00:16:13,583
which is
what you're getting at right now.

264
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:17,366
Well, you know what?
It would be a favor to me.

265
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,508
That would be a favor to me.

266
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,821
And certainly not
that you owe me anything,

267
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,061
but it would be very good for you.

268
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:34,613
What are you doing?
Wanna get together later, grab a movie?

269
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:37,412
Dinner, something?

270
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:42,079
I'd love to, but I told my mom
I'd babysit Buddy Jr.

271
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:44,150
Everything okay?

272
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:47,842
Everything's fine.

273
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,059
I'll call you later.

274
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:12,820
- How you doing?
- I'm okay. How are you?

275
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,695
I'm alright.
Come on in.

276
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:24,663
Sit down.
I made some chicken.

277
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:27,333
- You what?
- I made some chicken.

278
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:30,419
Like, really good.
No, seriously, just...

279
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:33,964
Just sit down, please.

280
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,651
This isn't me.
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:41,637
These candles...
I don't know what that was.

282
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:45,059
I just gotta get something off my chest,
Garrity.

283
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:47,353
No, I dont think that's...

284
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,113
Seriously, wait.

285
00:17:52,992 --> 00:17:55,694
Wait! What? Don't...

286
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:00,015
- I love you.
- What?

287
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:01,483
I love you.

288
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,287
How am I supposed
to react to that?

289
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,666
Brutal honesty.

290
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,463
Please.

291
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:20,082
It's never gonna happen.

292
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:24,954
- Because of this Cristian Sin guy?
- No.

293
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,905
You can't tell me that
you share whatever we had

294
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,590
with this guy. You can't tell me
that he knows everything

295
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,564
I know about you.
You can't tell me that.

296
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:35,063
I don't believe you.

297
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:37,824
Be honest with yourself
for two seconds.

298
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,564
Look me in the eye and tell me
that you don't feel the way

299
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:43,113
I feel about you.
Then, I'll move on.

300
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:46,996
I don't feel the way
you feel about me.

301
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,494
Move on.

302
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:11,644
Beautiful!
That's what I'm talking about.

303
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:14,311
See? Told you
you could do this, Tyra.

304
00:19:14,475 --> 00:19:17,859
There you go! Let's get a smile
on that face. You having fun?

305
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:19,028
No.

306
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:21,106
Start havin'... Uh, uh!

307
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:25,074
That's fun! You are getting this.
I want you to put some power behind it.

308
00:19:25,336 --> 00:19:26,865
I'm trying to put power behind it.

309
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:29,249
Put some of that Tyra power behind it.

310
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:30,845
There you go.

311
00:19:33,815 --> 00:19:35,012
Ball in.

312
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:37,804
Let me talk to you for a second.

313
00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:39,251
You can do this.

314
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,803
You have got the skill,

315
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:43,771
you've got the height,
just like I knew.

316
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:45,803
I'm so proud of you,
now what we need to do

317
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,472
is we need to get that...

318
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,640
Tyra power behind it.

319
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:51,691
Tim, if you hit with that ball...

320
00:19:52,697 --> 00:19:54,006
Now, what I want is...

321
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:56,774
I want you to find a way to get that...

322
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:58,801
- energy.
- I'm trying that!

323
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:02,751
Find something in your head that just
drives you crazy, that just bugs you,

324
00:20:02,963 --> 00:20:05,694
and then make that be the ball, and just

325
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:08,254
slam on it, you know what I mean?
Can you...

326
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:10,244
get something like that in your brain?

327
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:13,499
Yeah, I think I can think of something.

328
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:16,787
That's my girl. Alright.
Come on, now. Let's see it.

329
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:22,354
I knew it.

330
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:26,052
Now we're going.

331
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:42,234
Get it right out of it.

332
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:46,385
This bad boy has all the advantages
of a hybrid, but if you need to,

333
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,854
you can lock the electric motors
out of the drive train,

334
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,370
when extreme engine power is needed
to haul a huge load.

335
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:54,987
Tow of about...
I don't know, about 6,000 lbs.

336
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:57,803
Yeah, I don't know.

337
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:00,963
- Well, did you like the way it drove?
- Oh yeah, yeah.

338
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,617
Okay, well. If it's a matter of price,

339
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:07,951
or of cost,
we could probably talk to my supervisor.

340
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,652
I'm just gonna look around
a little more, alright?

341
00:21:12,031 --> 00:21:14,172
- Thanks.
- No problem.

342
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,086
Come back if you make up your mind.

343
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,301
- Hey, Jay.
- I figured that.

344
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:25,371
How's it going, babe?
Kidding, kidding.

345
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:30,233
How's it going? It's going horribly.

346
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:32,148
That's how it's going. I just...

347
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:36,038
I'm not cut out for this.
I'm terrible at this job, Mr. Garrity.

348
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,157
I spent two and a half hours
with a customer

349
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:40,298
who just walked out
on me for no reason

350
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,091
right when I thought I was gonna
get him, right then and there.

351
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:46,034
To top everything else,
the whole crew here hates me,

352
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:47,790
'cause I messed with the point system.

353
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,219
- So, that's how everything's going.
- The what?

354
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:52,597
The point system.
Where the top seller has...

355
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,807
They told you there was a point system?

356
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,739
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, God!

357
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,295
- Annabelle told you that?
- There's not point system?

358
00:22:00,455 --> 00:22:02,432
No, there's no point system.
They lied to you.

359
00:22:02,592 --> 00:22:05,223
- Can't believe that little phillie.
- She lied to me?

360
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:07,304
She did. And just don't worry about it.

361
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:10,824
You keep your head up.

362
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:14,281
And Gerald, the guy that just
came in here? He's a tire kicker.

363
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:16,327
He's a looky-lou, is what I call him.

364
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:19,333
He comes in here every week,
twice a week. He looks and never buys.

365
00:22:19,915 --> 00:22:22,879
Now you just refocus.
Next person that comes in,

366
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,088
you find out what they wanna hear,
you tell it to them.

367
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:28,438
It's just a job, Jason.
That's all it is.

368
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,197
Nothing more, nothing less.

369
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:32,566
Some days aren't good.
Like Two-A-days.

370
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,741
You don't know why you're doing it
and then later, it pays off.

371
00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:38,276
It's the same thing here.
It's all you think.

372
00:22:38,436 --> 00:22:40,480
You just keep focused. You can do it.

373
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,773
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
- Knock one down.

374
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,780
Annabelle!

375
00:22:49,987 --> 00:22:52,158
Have you had the sizzling apple pie?

376
00:22:53,147 --> 00:22:56,065
- No, I haven't. Is it good?
- Yeah, it's really good, it's like...

377
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,664
it comes out...
sizzling.

378
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:02,750
It'll save your life, it's amazing.
It'll definitely help with physics.

379
00:23:03,012 --> 00:23:05,920
- What are you gonna get?
- Tyra, I didn't know you...

380
00:23:06,182 --> 00:23:07,798
your working days,
this is a surprise.

381
00:23:08,243 --> 00:23:10,003
Yeah, I should have changed.

382
00:23:12,355 --> 00:23:15,613
So, can I serve y'all with some water
before I come and take your orders?

383
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:18,091
Sounds great to me.

384
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:20,213
Just working on some physics here, so...

385
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:21,602
need some...

386
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:24,449
That's different from school.

387
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,775
So...

388
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:30,935
You're wearing a Mayhem shirt.

389
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,113
I am.

390
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,107
Isn't the singer, like, a cannibal?

391
00:23:35,325 --> 00:23:38,508
Cause you're in, like, a Christian
power metal band. Seems kinda...

392
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,396
Kinda weird. I don't know.

393
00:23:40,556 --> 00:23:43,703
No, actually that what just a rumor,
he didn't actually eat anyone.

394
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:46,379
And Crucifictorious is actually...

395
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:48,525
it's not power metal,

396
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:51,531
more of... extreme grindcore with,
like,

397
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:53,131
heavy thrash influences.

398
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,736
Like, what thrash bands do you like?
Like, Napalm Death?

399
00:23:55,896 --> 00:23:57,391
Like, The Keep?

400
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:00,891
Like, Cannibal Corpse? Carcass?

401
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:05,180
I mean, I really only have two sections
for vinyl, like metal, not metal. So...

402
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,616
Well, mainly...

403
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:09,690
Y'all ready to order?

404
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,086
I want the sizzling apple pie,

405
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:17,044
and I think, also...

406
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:22,494
That's pathetic!

407
00:24:23,426 --> 00:24:24,987
Back at the start.

408
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,479
What's up?

409
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:35,901
What's the matter?

410
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:42,262
I haven't been honest with you
about a couple of things.

411
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:44,788
Okay.

412
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:48,256
I lied to you about

413
00:24:48,437 --> 00:24:50,776
babysitting my brother the other night.

414
00:24:54,297 --> 00:24:55,860
That guy at church

415
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:57,888
was Tim Riggins.

416
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,373
We've kind of a history together.

417
00:25:05,992 --> 00:25:07,666
What kind of history?

418
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,089
Get the door, Brian.

419
00:25:20,877 --> 00:25:23,019
I just came by to say that I'm sorry.

420
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,274
Come in.

421
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,025
- Hey Noannie.
- Didn't mom ban her?

422
00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:35,100
Noannie, please.
Just watch the show and be easy, a'ight?

423
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:39,441
I just feel so bad about everything,

424
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:41,867
I really cannot believe
you had to apologize like that.

425
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:44,047
Wish I could erase that whole date.

426
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,938
It's gonna be okay.

427
00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:50,877
- This whole thing's gonna blow over.
- Just really worried about you.

428
00:25:51,692 --> 00:25:53,547
The Smash always lands on his feet.

429
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,849
Hello?

430
00:25:56,584 --> 00:25:57,589
Who is it?

431
00:25:58,484 --> 00:26:02,012
- No, no, I don't. Who is this?
- Noannie, give me the phone.

432
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,256
You guys are jerks. Stop calling here,
or I'm calling the police.

433
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,317
Who was that?

434
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,068
- No one.
- Noannie.

435
00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:17,157
It's just some idiots calling,
saying stupid things, okay?

436
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,749
Like what?

437
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:22,222
- Brian, it's stupid.
- Like what, Noannie?

438
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,550
He says he hears
I put out to white boys.

439
00:26:32,302 --> 00:26:34,955
He calls here again,
you give the phone to me.

440
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:36,932
Do you hear me?

441
00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:40,212
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

442
00:26:40,622 --> 00:26:42,599
This is all my fault, isn't it?

443
00:26:43,674 --> 00:26:44,909
No...

444
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,489
No. Don't you ever say that.

445
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,250
Noannie, look...

446
00:26:49,656 --> 00:26:51,770
This has nothing to do with you.

447
00:26:52,897 --> 00:26:54,440
Come here.

448
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:08,052
I know, I know.
I slept with

449
00:27:08,315 --> 00:27:11,217
my paralyzed boyfriend's best friend.

450
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:13,553
It's the worst thing I've ever done.

451
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:28,173
It'd be great if you said something.

452
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:30,886
Sorry, I'm just...

453
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:36,011
thinking how hard that must have been
for you to tell me.

454
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:38,347
And I'm...

455
00:27:38,912 --> 00:27:41,025
really glad that you did.

456
00:27:47,277 --> 00:27:49,651
I just want us
to be honest with each other.

457
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,552
- You still have feelings for him?
- No.

458
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:09,101
Let's go get some ice cream.

459
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:13,747
Just... in a minute.

460
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,623
Hey, Street...
Here comes your best friend.

461
00:28:34,806 --> 00:28:35,917
Oh, that's funny.

462
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:38,603
Somebody's gotta talk to him.

463
00:28:38,763 --> 00:28:40,880
Low man on the totem pole,
that would be you.

464
00:29:02,795 --> 00:29:04,169
Good afternoon, Gerald.

465
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:05,513
Oh, hey.

466
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:07,036
How you doin' today?

467
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:10,370
All right, just...
came to have a second look.

468
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:15,540
- Can I ask you something, Gerald?
- Yeah.

469
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:17,792
What's the problem, exactly?

470
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:22,036
- Sorry?
- Why won't you let yourself have it?

471
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:23,989
- What do you mean?
- What is it?

472
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:25,859
Is it that you think
if you buy this car,

473
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:29,271
you'll find another car you like better
elsewhere, immediatly after buying it?

474
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:31,681
Or is it that you just think
you don't deserve the car?

475
00:29:31,941 --> 00:29:33,117
You don't know me.

476
00:29:33,277 --> 00:29:36,363
No, Gerald, I'm not insulting you.
Please, don't take it like that, okay?

477
00:29:36,523 --> 00:29:38,295
I'm just trying to understand you.

478
00:29:39,032 --> 00:29:40,855
Because all these sales people
around here?

479
00:29:41,015 --> 00:29:42,162
Take a look at 'em.

480
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,383
They sent me
because they're giving up on you.

481
00:29:44,543 --> 00:29:46,614
They sent me, wheelchair guy, rookie,

482
00:29:46,774 --> 00:29:48,935
low man on the totem pole,
because no of them believe

483
00:29:49,095 --> 00:29:51,242
that you can actually
purchase a vehicule.

484
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:53,872
But let me tell you something.
I know you love this car.

485
00:29:54,032 --> 00:29:56,375
You love this car so much,
you come here two days a week.

486
00:29:56,535 --> 00:29:59,322
Two days a week to just look at it,
then you walk out.

487
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:01,046
Gerald, life's too short, man.

488
00:30:01,206 --> 00:30:03,005
Life is too short, okay?

489
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:05,048
Things change in an instant.
Take it from me.

490
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:07,717
Okay?
So be a man!

491
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:10,345
Take control of your life,
be a man!

492
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:11,830
Buy this car.

493
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,516
Show these people they're wrong,
that you can make a decision.

494
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:17,341
- I'm gonna think about it.
- No, no more thinking, Gerald.

495
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:18,890
No more thinking and dithering,

496
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,647
no more wasting time.

497
00:30:20,908 --> 00:30:23,316
You're wasting your time
every time you come in here.

498
00:30:23,576 --> 00:30:26,830
Buy this car. Because you love it
and because you want this car,

499
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,510
and you wanna drive off this lot
in this car, today.

500
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,532
Buy it.

501
00:30:35,328 --> 00:30:36,379
Okay.

502
00:30:36,865 --> 00:30:39,040
Okay...
Mr. Garrity?

503
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,421
Yes, sir!

504
00:30:41,581 --> 00:30:45,304
Gerald would like to start paperwork
on purchasing this hybrid here.

505
00:30:45,464 --> 00:30:46,620
Yes, I was.

506
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:51,553
Congratulations, Gerald.

507
00:30:52,013 --> 00:30:54,097
- Congratulations.
- Well, thank you.

508
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:58,889
The Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa,

509
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:00,999
is the only region in the world

510
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:05,018
- to lay almost entirely...
- Are you paying me for that?

511
00:31:07,328 --> 00:31:08,445
So, we made an A.

512
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,364
- Did we, really?
- Yeah... Yeah.

513
00:31:11,624 --> 00:31:14,451
That's cool, right?
The best grade in the class. Thank you.

514
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:16,207
Also, uh...

515
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,829
I made you something.

516
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,956
I sensed a bit of reluctance

517
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:23,497
on your part to embraced
the cheese that is power metal.

518
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:26,402
So... It's a variant power metal mix.

519
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,456
It actually says "parking lot mix".

520
00:31:29,616 --> 00:31:31,634
It's like <i>Heavy metal parking lot</i>,
you know.

521
00:31:31,894 --> 00:31:33,680
Do I have to listen to it
in a parking lot?

522
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,764
No, cars...
bedrooms, whatever.

523
00:31:37,024 --> 00:31:38,155
Bedrooms...

524
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,030
But it was nice seeing you...
See you around.

525
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,856
- Bye, guys.
- Well, I appreciate it.

526
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:46,512
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

527
00:31:48,494 --> 00:31:51,056
- Soulmate, right there.
- God's little gift to Landry.

528
00:31:51,216 --> 00:31:52,405
Why can't you just...

529
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:54,824
<i>I struck someone
which I shouldn't have done.</i>

530
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:56,372
Smash, you on TV, homes.

531
00:31:56,532 --> 00:31:58,875
<i>I want to apologize to him,
and everyone for doing so.</i>

532
00:31:59,035 --> 00:32:01,101
<i>Anyone can say "I'm sorry",
doesn't mean they are.</i>

533
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:03,583
<i>Smash Williams is
an arrogant, violent thug</i>

534
00:32:03,843 --> 00:32:06,044
<i>who attacked us because we're white
and have money.</i>

535
00:32:06,304 --> 00:32:09,297
<i>Everyone is defending him. He's lucky
me and my friends acted civilized.</i>

536
00:32:09,557 --> 00:32:11,504
<i>And from the Smash Williams controversy,</i>

537
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:14,037
<i>we go now to cabin
witt the rest of today's sports...</i>

538
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:17,972
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Did you see Adam Hughes on TV...

539
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:20,808
- You're tryin' to get me in trouble.
- No, just get the truth.

540
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:22,140
Tell the truth!

541
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,455
Just shut the hell up!
Just shut the hell up!

542
00:32:24,615 --> 00:32:26,634
What happened?
Was your sister hittin' on him?

543
00:32:26,794 --> 00:32:28,336
Is what he said true?

544
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:30,860
Hell, no, that's not true.
That's not true.

545
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:34,489
I'll tell you like this. He was sayin'
some foul things to my sister and I.

546
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:36,980
- Racial, sexual and threatening.
- That's right?

547
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,371
Someone comes to my sister
and is talking like that,

548
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:42,707
you just gonna smile?
No, you gonna ask him to stop.

549
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:44,749
If they don',
you're not gonna do anything?

550
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,626
So, you shouldn't have apologized?

551
00:32:46,886 --> 00:32:49,087
- Not the way he's talking!
- So that's a yes?

552
00:32:53,982 --> 00:32:55,593
He didn't deserve an apology.

553
00:32:55,935 --> 00:32:59,411
<i>He deserved worse than what I gave him.
Should have messed him up worse.</i>

554
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,444
<i>And with that latest salvo
from Smash Williams,</i>

555
00:33:03,604 --> 00:33:06,890
<i>it appears the Dillon Panthers' problems
are far from over...</i>

556
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,880
Turn it off,
will you, Crowley.

557
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:18,459
Hubby's home.
How was your day, darling?

558
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:20,614
It was, uh...
It was good.

559
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:23,329
It was good.
And I sold a car, so...

560
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:25,411
What?
You did?

561
00:33:27,828 --> 00:33:29,894
Out-freakin'-standin'!

562
00:33:30,054 --> 00:33:31,890
Oh, man, you did!

563
00:33:33,234 --> 00:33:36,438
So what? You're like a car salesman now,
you're like Willy Loman?

564
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,297
You're a salesman, uh?

565
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:41,347
Yeah, I guess I am.

566
00:33:43,627 --> 00:33:47,812
It's all good. You got a little money
in your pocket, nothing wrong with that.

567
00:33:48,072 --> 00:33:52,202
Just for now. Good to have a roommate
that can pay his half of the rent.

568
00:33:55,386 --> 00:33:58,440
Hey, what do you say?
You and me, head down to the Rex Center,

569
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,137
gotta pick up rugby game going on
and maybe go get me some ribs.

570
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:05,204
Some corn, some hot chicks...

571
00:34:06,106 --> 00:34:09,000
Maybe she got a friend for you...
but one of them ugly ones, bucktooth,

572
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:12,587
you know, just got the fangs,
got the fangs happenin'.

573
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:14,008
Uh?

574
00:34:14,415 --> 00:34:15,673
You know what?
Yeah.

575
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:18,035
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

576
00:34:18,195 --> 00:34:22,096
Just gimme a couple minutes to change,
and I will... Wait on me out.

577
00:34:22,356 --> 00:34:24,366
Dinner is on you tonight,
you still owe me...

578
00:34:24,526 --> 00:34:26,976
- I think, what is it, $19.40?
- Are you serious about that?

579
00:34:27,236 --> 00:34:29,562
Yeah, dinner and girls.
Both on you tonight.

580
00:34:29,822 --> 00:34:32,178
No, the girls will be on me.
I...

581
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:36,238
Rucy, Marino, Ram Dog...
I mean, all theses guys started to...

582
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:39,906
invest a couple months back.
They're doing well... I mean, so...

583
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:42,742
Iif those idiots can do stuff
in the stock market, why can't I?

584
00:34:43,002 --> 00:34:47,538
Oh, my God, you're gonna play
a grade 9 education to the stock market?

585
00:34:49,618 --> 00:34:50,934
I'm not that stup...

586
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:00,216
- Yeah, go.
- Be quiet.

587
00:35:03,563 --> 00:35:04,564
Sorry...

588
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,267
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah...

589
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:09,889
- What's up?
- Is Tim here?

590
00:35:10,631 --> 00:35:11,562
Yeah.

591
00:35:16,229 --> 00:35:18,111
I came to bring you this.

592
00:35:18,677 --> 00:35:19,579
What's this?

593
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:22,573
The money you owe those guys...
Don't want you to get beat up.

594
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:25,921
- I'm not bringing you into this.
- You're not bringing me in anything.

595
00:35:26,081 --> 00:35:27,328
This is why you came over?

596
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,670
Yeah...

597
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,446
And, I'm not...

598
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,135
I'm not coming back here anymore.

599
00:35:36,657 --> 00:35:38,172
Chris makes me happy.

600
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,761
That's it.

601
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:44,345
- I'm not taking it.
- Okay.

602
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:48,948
All right.

603
00:36:13,742 --> 00:36:16,383
Nice, y'all!
That's the way!

604
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,416
That's the way!

605
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:20,757
Good teamwork!

606
00:36:28,748 --> 00:36:30,817
Y'all need to call it!

607
00:36:32,084 --> 00:36:34,937
Watch that hole in the center!
Y'all need to pick that up.

608
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:44,697
Hey, time out!

609
00:36:44,957 --> 00:36:45,960
Time out!

610
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,951
- Looking great.
- They're double-blocking me.

611
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:51,114
- It's okay.
- They figured out our moves.

612
00:36:51,274 --> 00:36:55,124
No! Don't act like this is luck,
this is not. Y'all doing a great job!

613
00:36:55,384 --> 00:36:57,752
We're kind of lucky,
'cause their star hitter is out sick.

614
00:36:58,012 --> 00:37:01,547
Y'all playing a great game. I want you
to keep it up and simple, and remember:

615
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:04,425
you're playing and winning this game
because of your teamwork.

616
00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:07,304
You are a team, you work together.
And you,

617
00:37:07,464 --> 00:37:10,431
you just focus on that Riggins,
you slam it down his throat, got it?

618
00:37:10,691 --> 00:37:12,725
You know you can do this.
Let's go, girls.

619
00:37:12,985 --> 00:37:15,144
- One, two, three...
- Panthers!

620
00:37:39,845 --> 00:37:42,043
All right, girls.
That's what I'm talking about!

621
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:44,590
All right, keep it together!
Keep it together!

622
00:38:27,842 --> 00:38:29,481
You had fun, right?

623
00:38:33,655 --> 00:38:34,657
Good job!

624
00:38:34,817 --> 00:38:35,917
Good job!

625
00:38:37,302 --> 00:38:39,828
So, what?
Now they're like, what, 1 and 7 down?

626
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:43,693
Why you gotta be like that for?
Mom is 1 and 1!

627
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,861
- The team is 1 and 7...
- 1 and 0, 1 for 1!

628
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,206
Ready?

629
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:06,589
- What's up?
- Let's just get this over with.

630
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:10,480
- Here's your money.
- How you doin', Billy? Good to see you.

631
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,463
It's all there.
I'll see you around.

632
00:39:13,623 --> 00:39:16,012
Come on in, let's count it first,
make sure it's all here.

633
00:39:16,172 --> 00:39:18,726
- No, if you got the money, we're good.
- Just bring it in.

634
00:39:19,461 --> 00:39:22,480
Okay? I wanna make sure I got my money,
so come on in. I'll count.

635
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,483
100, 2, 3, 4,

636
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:27,151
5, 6, 7,

637
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:30,091
- 8, 9... We're up to a thousand?
- Yep.

638
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:31,366
At one.

639
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:35,216
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17...

640
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:38,176
18, 19...
Two thousands?

641
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:39,762
Getting closer.

642
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:43,000
What's wrong, Tim?
You look a little depressed.

643
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,462
Just get this over with, man. Count
the money and let's get out of here.

644
00:39:46,722 --> 00:39:49,465
You wanna calm down, man?
I was the one who get ripped off here!

645
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,521
Why you don't call cops then, Guy?

646
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,903
Good one, Billy.
Breathe.

647
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:59,141
What do you know?
It's all there.

648
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:00,403
All right.

649
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:03,700
It's taken care of, it's all paid up
and we don't owe you a dime extra.

650
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,607
- It's over with now.
- I don't want a dime extra.

651
00:40:07,131 --> 00:40:08,776
You're not gonna touch him again.

652
00:40:09,036 --> 00:40:11,696
I hope he doesn't give me a reason
to touch him again...

653
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:14,991
I don't give a crap he gives you one.
You're not gonna touch him again!

654
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:16,358
Billy, let's go.

655
00:40:16,518 --> 00:40:19,412
- You need to calm down.
- Listen to me, you fat son of a bitch!

656
00:40:19,672 --> 00:40:22,033
You're not gonna touch him again,
you understand me?

657
00:40:22,193 --> 00:40:23,874
- How is Jackie?
- You don't...

658
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:32,606
Go!

659
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:33,939
This is crap!

660
00:40:37,941 --> 00:40:40,016
He's got a gun.
Just get in the truck!

661
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:44,566
- I'm trying!
- He's got a gun, let's go!

662
00:40:44,726 --> 00:40:46,318
Billy, I'm trying!

663
00:41:14,212 --> 00:41:15,217
Come on in.

664
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:19,733
Coach here's got something
he wanna tell you.

665
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,042
Board called...

666
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,460
They've decided...

667
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:33,861
to suspend you for three games.

668
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:36,009
Suspend me?
