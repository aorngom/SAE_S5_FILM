1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:02,369
Santiago, if the Lyla
vouches for you..

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,925
- I do.
- I give you a job..

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,532
I'll do everything, that you ask me to
do, and try not to mess it up too bad.

4
00:00:06,552 --> 00:00:09,867
Landry has never lied to me.
You stay away from my boy.

5
00:00:09,924 --> 00:00:12,779
I get you want to walk again,
but guess what, never going to happen.

6
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:15,795
Best case scenario, you lose 10 000 $,
The worse case scenario, dead.

7
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:17,990
You think I want to go back to Dillon…

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,379
Jay!

9
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,373
***

10
00:00:21,374 --> 00:00:23,776
***
I'm not having the surgery.

11
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:24,927
Let's go back to Texas.

12
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,181
I'm turning 19 on Tuesday.

13
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:41,434
What did I get you last year, Six?

14
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:44,224
Nothing.

15
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,237
And I expect nothing from you
this year either,

16
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:50,841
because last time you actually gave
something, it was your brother's ********* 

17
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,436
And you didn't tell him about it...

18
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,342
and he threatened to beat to me up,
unless I gave it back to him, so...

19
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:58,344
I much rather not get
anything from you this year.

20
00:00:58,945 --> 00:01: 00,384
I remember that.

21
00:01: 02,396 --> 00:01: 03,666
Coming back to Dillon.

22
00:01: 06,222 --> 00:01: 07,417
Nineteen.

23
00:01: 08,788 --> 00:01: 10,709
What the hell I'm
doing with my life?

24
00:01: 13,734 --> 00:01: 15,710
You see, your mother
doesn't have to do it.

25
00:01: 15,711 --> 00:01: 17,221
- I'm leaving, dad.
- And when you leave, make sure...

26
00:01: 17,256 --> 00:01: 19,312
your mother doesn't have to pick any of
that up, I'm tired of that.

27
00:01: 19,313 --> 00:01: 22,091
It's so rude, selfish,
and it's so typical of my sister.

28
00:01: 22,126 --> 00:01: 23,654
You should make her, don't let her get away
with that, tell her to pick it up.

29
00:01: 23,689 --> 00:01: 24,746
It's my first day at work,

30
00:01: 24,795 --> 00:01: 26,372
first day of having
to leave Gracie.

31
00:01: 26,422 --> 00:01: 27,663
- Maybe she got stuck in the traffic.
- She could have come in

32
00:01: 27,698 --> 00:01: 30,460
a day or two days earlier, to make
me feel more comfortable, but no!

33
00:01: 30,538 --> 00:01: 33,037
She's in her own head, always.
She's always in her own head-space.

34
00:01: 33,687 --> 00:01: 36,095
Hey babe, I think you
got your first check.

35
00:01: 36,243 --> 00:01: 40,433
And you know there's not going to be
any kind of apology. That's for sure.

36
00:01: 40,543 --> 00:01: 43,036
I mean, she just walks in
here like it's nothing.

37
00:01: 43,138 --> 00:01: 44,857
Babe, something's wrong
with your check.

38
00:01: 45,355 --> 00:01: 47,123
- What?
- Come here.

39
00:01: 48,285 --> 00:01: 49,307
That's not right.

40
00:01: 50,576 --> 00:01: 52,322
That is not right.

41
00:01: 52,458 --> 00:01: 54,513
- It's half what it's supposed to be.
- I know.

42
00:01: 54,953 --> 00:01: 57,605
- It's less than half, what it's supposed
to be. - What did you spoke about with Buddy?

43
00:01: 58,210 --> 00:01: 59,766
What you decided with Buddy?

44
00:01: 59,809 --> 00:02: 02,526
- We just... you know.
- No, I don't know.

45
00:02: 02,771 --> 00:02: 05,333
- Did you...
- No, I just assumed that...

46
00:02: 05,417 --> 00:02: 08,234
- You can't assume things like salary. - I'm
sure it's a mistake. It will be taken cared of.

47
00:02: 08,362 --> 00:02: 10,933
She's here! She's here!
You wake up the baby.

48
00:02: 11,175 --> 00:02: 12,263
She's here, Gracie!

49
00:02: 15,714 --> 00:02: 18,083
Oh my God!

50
00:02: 18,118 --> 00:02: 20,388
- I am so happy to see you!
- Oh, my God!

51
00:02: 20,855 --> 00:02: 22,782
Look at you. You
look amazing!

52
00:02: 22,945 --> 00:02: 24,483
Oh, stop it. I look like a cow.

53
00:02: 25,115 --> 00:02: 27,534
Do you think my ass got bigger
after I got this baby?

54
00:02: 28,463 --> 00:02: 30,273
Give me a break. You bounced
a quarter of that.

55
00:02: 30,308 --> 00:02: 32,219
- Where is she?
- She's right here.

56
00:02: 32,220 --> 00:02: 34,241
- Hey, Shelley.
- Hi, Eric.

57
00:02: 34,246 --> 00:02: 35,397
How are you?

58
00:02: 35,432 --> 00:02: 37,576
Honey, she said that I could
bounce a quarter of my ass.

59
00:02: 37,577 --> 00:02: 38,840
You could bounce all kinds of things.

60
00:02: 38,890 --> 00:02: 42,943
- That's my little Gracie-girl.
- She looks just like her mama.

61
00:02: 43,872 --> 00:02: 44,961
That's your aunt Shelley.

62
00:02: 45,665 --> 00:02: 48,099
Aunt Shelley!
How are you doing?

63
00:02: 49,059 --> 00:02: 50,675
Boys must be going crazy.

64
00:02: 52,056 --> 00:02: 54,600
She's gorgeous!
She's hot!

65
00:02: 54,820 --> 00:02: 56,488
She sure is.

66
00:02: 56,623 --> 00:02: 59,161
- You want some coffee?
- I'd love some coffee.

67
00:03: 00,439 --> 00:03: 02,800
- I am so happy that she is here.
- Tami, you cannot use these diapers.

68
00:03: 02,880 --> 00:03: 05,510
You got to use cloth diapers.
These are bad.

69
00:03: 05,735 --> 00:03: 08,779
I don't think that we have
all that time with laundry.

70
00:03: 09,475 --> 00:03: 11,821
Eric, I can't believe I spent all
this time being jealous of you.

71
00:03: 11,822 --> 00:03: 13,414
This is what I make teaching
pre-school.

72
00:03: 13,449 --> 00:03: 15,372
Really, is that it?
That's just a...

73
00:03: 15,407 --> 00:03: 17,485
We're going to get this taken
cared of. It's just a mistake.

74
00:03: 17,674 --> 00:03: 19,988
You know what?
It's good to see you.

75
00:03: 20,132 --> 00:03: 21,302
You too, baby.

76
00:03: 21,583 --> 00:03: 23,332
You need to get that taken cared of.

77
00:03: 23,890 --> 00:03: 25,538
- You need to get that taken cared of.
- I know.

78
00:03: 26,853 --> 00:03: 30,385
Welcome everybody to the Buddy
Garrity hog wild sale.

79
00:03: 30,420 --> 00:03: 32,788
Everybody come all in,
you will not believe your eyes.

80
00:03: 33,186 --> 00:03: 34,913
Hey, you all show'd up..

81
00:03: 34,962 --> 00:03: 37,281
I told you, he's going to
bring you here, didn't I?

82
00:03: 38,396 --> 00:03: 39,461
Any luck?

83
00:03: 39,706 --> 00:03: 42,128
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Hog wild sale.

84
00:03: 42,172 --> 00:03: 43,876
- What?
- Hog wild sale.

85
00:03: 43,934 --> 00:03: 48,094
I do 150 cars in a day like this.
It's is fantastic. You know what?

86
00:03: 48,138 --> 00:03: 51,525
I want you to see this, you're not going to
believe this. I think I got our problem solved.

87
00:03: 51,849 --> 00:03: 53,123
Everybody, check this out.

88
00:03: 53,280 --> 00:03: 56,557
Big loud aplaudes
for Mr. Santiago Herrera!

89
00:04: 01,614 --> 00:04: 02,708
Release!

90
00:04: 04,527 --> 00:04: 05,843
Get it, Santiago!

91
00:04: 05,968 --> 00:04: 07,056
Get it!

92
00:04: 17,023 --> 00:04: 18,780
It is fast or what?

93
00:04: 25,639 --> 00:04: 27,565
I think we found our new tied in.

94
00:04: 28,107 --> 00:04: 29,695
You want to tell me about this?

95
00:04: 30,255 --> 00:04: 31,757
Let's go to office.

96
00:04: 32,364 --> 00:04: 33,378
Excuse us.

97
00:04: 34,508 --> 00:04: 37,917
State championship and my
salary get's reduced 40%?

98
00:04: 37,986 --> 00:04: 41,291
No, it's 37%. And I have every
intention to do something about that.

99
00:04: 41,292 --> 00:04: 44,952
I got a baby, I got a mortage. Tami
wants to put a new room on the house.

100
00:04: 45,036 --> 00:04: 46,966
- It is not a very good time.
- You think?

101
00:04: 47,114 --> 00:04: 50,016
Eric, I know you're upset
and I understand.

102
00:04: 50,119 --> 00:04: 51,641
But let me tell you
something right now.

103
00:04: 51,676 --> 00:04: 54,657
We had to pay MacGregor off,
and we had to get you back here.

104
00:04: 54,812 --> 00:04: 58,016
That depleted the booster club funds.
And to tell you the truth,

105
00:04: 58,091 --> 00:05: 00,413
right now, that fund is not solved.

106
00:05: 00,554 --> 00:05: 04,469
Just between you and me. I'm trying to do
everything I can to make this go away.

107
00:05: 04,504 --> 00:05: 05,958
I'm going to make
this okey for you.

108
00:05: 06,945 --> 00:05: 08,069
Believe me.

109
00:05: 09,045 --> 00:05: 10,149
Fix it.

110
00:05: 10,273 --> 00:05: 11,397
What?

111
00:05: 11,751 --> 00:05: 13,025
Fix it!

112
00:05: 16,964 --> 00:05: 20,404

116
00:05: 41,610 --> 00:05: 44,828
Appreciate your work....

117
00:05: 46,569 --> 00:05: 50,839
but how can it take so long?

118
00:05: 56,947 --> 00:05: 59,926


119
00:06: 02,439 --> 00:06: 04,957
Alright, gentlemen!
Hit the field.

120
00:06: 05,319 --> 00:06: 07,291
Let's go!
Let's get a move on!

121
00:06: 07,326 --> 00:06: 09,352
Let's have a good practice today,
what do you say?

122
00:06: 09,588 --> 00:06: 12,419
- How it is, 85?
- Good to finally have you back.

123
00:06: 12,519 --> 00:06: 13,883

124
00:06: 13,884 --> 00:06: 14,996
What's going on, man ?

125
00:06: 14,997 --> 00:06: 16,316
- Came on, huh.
- Yes, sir.

126
00:06: 16,351 --> 00:06: 18,087
Great win on weekend.

127
00:06: 18,122 --> 00:06: 19,466
- Nice time, Rigg?
- Good to see you, bro.

128
00:06: 19,566 --> 00:06: 21,457
- See about that.
- Let's go down, get a move on.

129
00:06: 34,110 --> 00:06: 35,645
Strecth it out deep.

130
00:06: 35,862 --> 00:06: 37,395
- One thousand!
- Three.

131
00:06: 37,510 --> 00:06: 38,695
- Coach.
- One thousand.

132
00:06: 39,310 --> 00:06: 40,325
- One thousand!
- Five.

133
00:06: 40,326 --> 00:06: 41,527
- Missed week of practice.
- Is that it.

134
00:06: 41,562 --> 00:06: 42,721


135
00:06: 43,649 --> 00:06: 45,261
You're done with me?

136
00:06: 45,620 --> 00:06: 48,316
Let me tell you something,
we'we been down this road before.

137
00:06: 48,317 --> 00:06: 50,219
Too many times, you understand me?

138
00:06: 50,388 --> 00:06: 51,646
Lean to the right.

139
00:06: 53,578 --> 00:06: 54,731
One thousand!

140
00:06: 54,766 --> 00:06: 56,677
Coach, I deserve at
least one more change.

141
00:06: 57,044 --> 00:06: 59,075
I want you, to step out
of my field right now.

142
00:06: 59,110 --> 00:07: 00,186
One thousand!

143
00:07: 00,221 --> 00:07: 03,214
Alright, ***.
Let's break down in teams.

144
00:07: 03,249 --> 00:07: 06,084
Defense down here in the End Zone.
Let's go, Right now!

145
00:07: 07,924 --> 00:07: 11,815
This is quite a list that
you've left me here, Glenn.

146
00:07: 11,850 --> 00:07: 14,544
Now, Susie Miller is straight-A student,
what is she doing in this list?

147
00:07: 14,579 --> 00:07: 16,315
Complaints about her hygiene.

148
00:07: 16,675 --> 00:07: 17,787
That's awful.

149
00:07: 17,822 --> 00:07: 21,980
I passed her in the hallway few times,
and the complaints are definitely valid.

150
00:07: 22,015 --> 00:07: 24,627
But I figured that since
you were coming back

151
00:07: 24,662 --> 00:07: 27,516
and returning to us, I would
leave that one to you.

152
00:07: 27,861 --> 00:07: 29,117
Oh, so sweet of you.

153
00:07: 29,152 --> 00:07: 32,896
Thank you so much, Glenn.
That is so adorable. Thank you.

154
00:07: 32,931 --> 00:07: 33,974
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.

155
00:07: 34,009 --> 00:07: 36,335
- Can I speak to you for sec?
- You must be Eric.

156
00:07: 36,525 --> 00:07: 38,355
Eric, Glenn.
Glenn, Eric.

157
00:07: 38,390 --> 00:07: 40,812
- Hey, Glenn. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

158
00:07: 42,080 --> 00:07: 43,398
Can I speak to my
wife for a minute?

159
00:07: 44,859 --> 00:07: 47,078
Of course. Sure thing.
I'll get out of your way.

160
00:07: 47,151 --> 00:07: 50,235
Well, I happily pass the
baton back to you.

161
00:07: 50,500 --> 00:07: 52,824
Thanks for everything
you did, and..

162
00:07: 52,859 --> 00:07: 55,456
I will see you later,
I'll see you in the lounge, okey?

163
00:07: 55,491 --> 00:07: 58,116
Absolutely. Thanks,
You did a great job.

164
00:07: 58,391 --> 00:08: 01,120
- Thanks. See you.
- Take care.

165
00:08: 02,116 --> 00:08: 04,420
Meeting in the lounge? Why are you
meeting him in the lounge for?

166
00:08: 04,688 --> 00:08: 07,078
- I thought you ate in the cafeteria.
- Honey, are you jealous?

167
00:08: 07,082 --> 00:08: 08,598
I'm not jealous, I'm
just asking a question.

168
00:08: 08,659 --> 00:08: 10,866
That is adorable,
that you're jealous.

169
00:08: 10,901 --> 00:08: 11,950
You like that?

170
00:08: 12,798 --> 00:08: 14,915
Listen, I just came by to
say, I talked to Buddy.

171
00:08: 14,950 --> 00:08: 16,297
He's working on it.

172
00:08: 16,332 --> 00:08: 18,031
And for your information,

173
00:08: 18,066 --> 00:08: 20,102
you'd better start doing
something out here.

174
00:08: 20,733 --> 00:08: 22,341
Would you call Glenn,

175
00:08: 22,376 --> 00:08: 24,604
and maybe he can come help
me do some co-counceling.

176
00:08: 26,787 --> 00:08: 30,611
Hey man, this is some old fool. Taking
Rigg away is like hanging me out to ***

177
00:08: 30,639 --> 00:08: 33,603
Look, I know we need him out there,
but coach do have a point.

178
00:08: 33,638 --> 00:08: 35,698
What if he's just trying to bounce up
before our playoff games or something..

179
00:08: 35,733 --> 00:08: 37,917
Don't you remember. He benched you out
last week, he's out of control.

180
00:08: 37,918 --> 00:08: 40,454
Matt. Hi, I'm Lauren.

181
00:08: 40,841 --> 00:08: 43,073
- Hi, I'm Matt.
- I just wanted to introduce myself.

182
00:08: 43,108 --> 00:08: 44,652
I just started going here.

183
00:08: 44,687 --> 00:08: 46,625
I know. I've noticed you.

184
00:08: 46,660 --> 00:08: 48,551
Cheerleading. I've seen
you cheerleading.


185
00:08: 48,586 --> 00:08: 49,870
Why are you hitting me?

186
00:08: 50,131 --> 00:08: 51,257
Yeah.

187
00:08: 51,292 --> 00:08: 54,636
Well, I'm so glad that I'm
cheering for your team.

188
00:08: 54,736 --> 00:08: 55,805
It's such an honor.

189
00:08: 55,840 --> 00:08: 57,530
You're so incredibly talented.

190
00:09: 00,205 --> 00:09: 01,727
So, I see you around, okay?

191
00:09: 01,762 --> 00:09: 03,705
Yeah. I'll be, you know..

192
00:09: 04,547 --> 00:09: 06,749
- Around.
- Around? Okay.

193
00:09: 06,784 --> 00:09: 08,091
- Bye.
- Bye.

194
00:09: 09,490 --> 00:09: 11,632
With good luck your Julie-problems
are about to be over.

195
00:09: 11,700 --> 00:09: 13,344
Watch, coach. He takes the
inside gap, we're coming outside.

196
00:09: 13,690 --> 00:09: 15,666
We got to get downside block.

197
00:09: 15,766 --> 00:09: 16,887
- What's that? 4-3?
- Yes.

198
00:09: 16,891 --> 00:09: 18,390
They're walking that guy up ***.

199
00:09: 18,425 --> 00:09: 20,132
We got to come from the weak 
side and cut that guy.

200
00:09: 20,401 --> 00:09: 23,030
- Get it fixed?
- I'm working on it.

201
00:09: 23,838 --> 00:09: 28,679
Coach, we owe it to the team,
to check this kid out.

202
00:09: 29,475 --> 00:09: 30,785
I'm not kidding you.

203
00:09: 32,592 --> 00:09: 33,987
Give me 15 minutes.

204
00:09: 36,064 --> 00:09: 37,457
..watch this next set up.

205
00:09: 48,089 --> 00:09: 50,862
Alright, we'll start on your move.

206
00:09: 58,914 --> 00:10: 00,429
4.72, coach.

207
00:10: 01,861 --> 00:10: 04,087
I won't say I told you so,
but this kid's going to be a star.

208
00:10: 04,088 --> 00:10: 05,772
I'll see what he can
do with his hands.

209
00:10: 06,074 --> 00:10: 07,150
Hut!

210
00:10: 15,564 --> 00:10: 16,576
Alright.

211
00:10: 16,611 --> 00:10: 18,187
It's Alright, buddy.

212
00:10: 18,370 --> 00:10: 19,435
Let's hit the next one.

213
00:10: 19,470 --> 00:10: 20,980
How long have you been
going to school here?

214
00:10: 21,015 --> 00:10: 23,173
He just rolled in about
a week ago, coach.

215
00:10: 24,396 --> 00:10: 25,682
Where did you go before this?

216
00:10: 26,012 --> 00:10: 31,404
He was doing this little juvenile retainer
for a minute, but he's done with that.

217
00:10: 31,439 --> 00:10: 33,870
I assume he can talk.

218
00:10: 33,905 --> 00:10: 34,905
Absolutely.

219
00:10: 35,073 --> 00:10: 37,940
- You tell him, Santiago.
- You played football before?

220
00:10: 39,113 --> 00:10: 40,286
No, Sir.

221
00:10: 40,321 --> 00:10: 42,155
You ever played anykind
of sport before?

222
00:10: 42,314 --> 00:10: 43,726
No.

223
00:10: 44,285 --> 00:10: 46,738
You want to come out here, you
want to play football for us?

224
00:10: 47,299 --> 00:10: 48,303
Sure.

225
00:10: 48,338 --> 00:10: 50,012
That wasn't exactly an offer.

226
00:10: 51,174 --> 00:10: 54,612
Let's see what you
can do going long?

227
00:10: 54,647 --> 00:10: 56,302
Just run as fast as you can.

228
00:11: 04,905 --> 00:11: 06,692
Well, I didn't tell him to catch.

229
00:11: 06,727 --> 00:11: 08,600
I just told him to go long.

230
00:11: 08,635 --> 00:11: 10,518
You best stop him, before
he climbs that fence .

231
00:11: 10,653 --> 00:11: 12,601
Well, kid's got a lot to learn.

232
00:11: 12,817 --> 00:11: 14,531
- Oh, you think?
- Yes.

233
00:11: 14,608 --> 00:11: 15,791
But it should be alright.

234
00:11: 18,534 --> 00:11: 20,530
- Landry.
- Yes?

235
00:11: 21,498 --> 00:11: 22,648
Come in.

236
00:11: 24,365 --> 00:11: 26,090
You're not going to
join us for supper?

237
00:11: 26,704 --> 00:11: 28,976
I'm not too hungry,
you can go ahead.

238
00:11: 29,011 --> 00:11: 30,393
Mom made chicken fried steaks.

239
00:11: 30,428 --> 00:11: 32,511
And you haven't been
hungry for a week.

240
00:11: 33,886 --> 00:11: 35,629
- Something going on?
- No.

241
00:11: 44,452 --> 00:11: 46,501
She dumped me.

242
00:11: 50,950 --> 00:11: 52,827
Well..

243
00:11: 53,277 --> 00:11: 55,598
Girls can be *** their way.

244
00:11: 56,764 --> 00:11: 58,865
Especially the cute ones.

245
00:12: 01,230 --> 00:12: 04,569
She didn't have you feeling badly
about yourself, does she?

246
00:12: 07,070 --> 00:12: 08,508
That's good.

247
00:12: 09,275 --> 00:12: 11,381
Surely you know there
will be another girls.

248
00:12: 11,416 --> 00:12: 12,756
Not that I care.

249
00:12: 18,254 --> 00:12: 20,471
Come on, Julie.
We want to see it!

250
00:12: 23,388 --> 00:12: 25,538
- Let me see.
- Oh my God!

251
00:12: 25,573 --> 00:12: 27,985
- Let me see!
- My God!

252
00:12: 28,578 --> 00:12: 30,766
- She's amazing.
- No.

253
00:12: 31,296 --> 00:12: 33,220
And you best take that of before
your father gets home.

254
00:12: 33,255 --> 00:12: 35,025
- But it was a present.
- You look incredible, honey.

255
00:12: 35,060 --> 00:12: 36,153
Take my word for it.

256
00:12: 36,188 --> 00:12: 37,620
- How are you doing?
- Hi, baby.

257
00:12: 38,143 --> 00:12: 39,761
My God, look.

258
00:12: 41,050 --> 00:12: 42,353
Why are you dressed like that?

259
00:12: 42,388 --> 00:12: 45,031
- This is what everybody in Brazil is wearing.
- Yeah, what everybody in Brazil is wearing.

260
00:12: 45,066 --> 00:12: 47,364
- We are not in Brazil.
- You need to sit down.

261
00:12: 47,399 --> 00:12: 49,779
You need to write a thank you note
to your grandmother for those boobs.

262
00:12: 49,814 --> 00:12: 52,223
- Because they are unbelievable.
- Go change.

263
00:12: 52,258 --> 00:12: 53,629
You excuse me.

264
00:12: 53,664 --> 00:12: 57,085
Summer of 86, loose-string bikini and your
butt hanging out of those dolphin shorts.

265
00:12: 57,120 --> 00:12: 59,471
If I gave you a hundred dollars,
would you please stop?

266
00:12: 59,506 --> 00:13: 01,981
Yes, but you don't have
a hundred dollars, Eric.

267
00:13: 02,116 --> 00:13: 03,152
Okay.

268
00:13: 07,944 --> 00:13: 09,591
- Are you taking Spanish?
- Yeah.

269
00:13: 09,691 --> 00:13: 13,037
Perfect, because you're going to need
it when we take our trip to Costa Rica.

270
00:13: 13,044 --> 00:13: 14,903
- Costa Rica?
- Yes.

271
00:13: 14,938 --> 00:13: 16,331
Well, your mom and I,
we were supposed to go.

272
00:13: 16,431 --> 00:13: 18,846
But then she went and got herself
knocked up, so I want to go with you.

273
00:13: 18,913 --> 00:13: 19,923
Thank you, Shelley.

274
00:13: 20,009 --> 00:13: 21,694
- I would love to go.
- What? I'm just teasing.

275
00:13: 21,794 --> 00:13: 23,827
That baby, she's worth of
thousand trips to Costa Rica.

276
00:13: 23,839 --> 00:13: 25,264
- Yeah, she is.
- I know.

277
00:13: 25,772 --> 00:13: 28,198
Listen, I have a little
consolation prize for you.

278
00:13: 28,647 --> 00:13: 31,260
The Dixie Chicks, are coming to
Midland Wednesday night.

279
00:13: 31,295 --> 00:13: 33,161
- I love the Dixie Chicks.
- I know you do.

280
00:13: 33,474 --> 00:13: 35,992
- You want to go? - We got
a booster meeting on Wednesday, Tam.

281
00:13: 36,027 --> 00:13: 37,577
I know, Honey.

282
00:13: 37,930 --> 00:13: 40,984
There's no way I could go to the Dixie
Chicks. Are you kidding right now?

283
00:13: 41,019 --> 00:13: 42,852
I just started back to work.

284
00:13: 43,161 --> 00:13: 45,627
A concert on a Wednesday,
what's the big deal?

285
00:13: 45,727 --> 00:13: 47,894
I just don't see how I can do it.

286
00:13: 47,994 --> 00:13: 49,302
- Just an idea.
- It's a good idea.

287
00:13: 49,402 --> 00:13: 50,686
Okay. You are welcome.

288
00:13: 51,317 --> 00:13: 52,725
I'll go to the Dixie Chicks.

289
00:13: 53,086 --> 00:13: 54,524
Can I take your daughter
to the Dixie Chicks?

290
00:13: 54,624 --> 00:13: 56,279
You can change. You
need to go change.

291
00:13: 56,314 --> 00:13: 57,686
Shelley's going to 
show me some pictures.

292
00:13: 57,721 --> 00:13: 58,747
Ah, yeah, come.

293
00:13: 59,941 --> 00:14: 03,019
This was the beach. It
was unbelievable.

294
00:14: 03,054 --> 00:14: 06,269
You could see for miles,
you cannot see any people.

295
00:14: 06,369 --> 00:14: 07,533
It's so cool.

296
00:14: 16,928 --> 00:14: 18,014
Coach.

297
00:14: 18,149 --> 00:14: 19,496
Welcome home.

298
00:14: 21,505 --> 00:14: 22,506
Thank you.

299
00:14: 22,543 --> 00:14: 24,230
- How are you doing?
- Welcome home to you too.

300
00:14: 24,527 --> 00:14: 26,486
- Is it good to get back to your family?
- Yes, it is.

301
00:14: 26,528 --> 00:14: 27,602
I saw Gracie.
She's cute.

302
00:14: 27,634 --> 00:14: 29,361
- She's a cute little girl, huh?
- Yes, she is.

303
00:14: 29,401 --> 00:14: 30,993
- You're doing good?
- Yes, Sir.

304
00:14: 31,028 --> 00:14: 32,177
Good to be back?

305
00:14: 33,311 --> 00:14: 34,791
Yes.
Yes, Sir.

306
00:14: 35,433 --> 00:14: 36,621
Are you still coaching?

307
00:14: 38,283 --> 00:14: 41,113
I do not know, coach.

308
00:14: 41,864 --> 00:14: 43,642
I'm just figuring out
my life right now.

309
00:14: 43,761 --> 00:14: 45,566
Truth to be told,
I could use some help.

310
00:14: 46,374 --> 00:14: 47,622
Got a lot going on.

311
00:14: 48,201 --> 00:14: 50,442
I need someone who knows me,
and knows the team.

312
00:14: 51,113 --> 00:14: 52,273
Hell..

313
00:14: 54,235 --> 00:14: 55,714
I need someone I can trust.

314
00:15: 01,454 --> 00:15: 02,696
When do you want me back?

315
00:15: 09,645 --> 00:15: 11,255
***

316
00:15: 11,290 --> 00:15: 12,789
***

317
00:15: 12,835 --> 00:15: 14,747
I'm working out 24/7.

318
00:15: 15,457 --> 00:15: 17,987
I'm eating out alright.
I'm trying to lose weight.

319
00:15: 18,243 --> 00:15: 22,035
Looks can deceive you. Back
then I was just "Sticks".

320
00:15: 22,264 --> 00:15: 23,975
They actually called me "Sticks".

321
00:15: 25,951 --> 00:15: 29,960
It was fun time, you know. I think
it would've been a good life.

322
00:15: 44,333 --> 00:15: 45,415
Tim!

323
00:15: 48,857 --> 00:15: 50,909
Rise and shine.
It's three pm.

324
00:15: 50,944 --> 00:15: 51,995
Yes, it is.

325
00:15: 56,718 --> 00:15: 58,502
I'm glad you stopped by,
actually, because..

326
00:15: 58,686 --> 00:16: 02,801
You know anything about
Organic and Biological compounds?

327
00:16: 03,023 --> 00:16: 04,431
Not doing your homework, Tim.

328
00:16: 05,172 --> 00:16: 06,609
I am here
about Santiago.

329
00:16: 08,870 --> 00:16: 10,000
Alright.

330
00:16: 10,291 --> 00:16: 12,144
Santiago, isn't that a..

331
00:16: 13,659 --> 00:16: 14,716
hog catcher?

332
00:16: 14,925 --> 00:16: 17,538
He's not a hog catcher. He's a
student trying to learn football.

333
00:16: 18,758 --> 00:16: 20,145
No, thank you.

334
00:16: 20,817 --> 00:16: 21,958
I heard..

335
00:16: 22,903 --> 00:16: 24,497
I heard he's a crap.

336
00:16: 24,605 --> 00:16: 25,662
Right.

337
00:16: 27,299 --> 00:16: 30,242
Okay, which is why I was wondering
if you could help him out.

338
00:16: 30,500 --> 00:16: 34,032
Maybe teach him a few things
about football, how to play.

339
00:16: 34,349 --> 00:16: 38,547
I don't know if you've heard or not, but
I kind of got kicked of the football team.

340
00:16: 39,213 --> 00:16: 42,210
So I don't really see, why
I'd helped someone get on it.

341
00:16: 42,650 --> 00:16: 46,276
I don't know Tim. Why would
any human being help another?

342
00:16: 47,771 --> 00:16: 51,457
Why would someone drop everything
and go all the way to Mexico

343
00:16: 51,604 --> 00:16: 53,580
just because someone called
and asked for help?

344
00:16: 53,892 --> 00:16: 57,020
See this is a bit different,
because that was a life or death.

345
00:16: 57,223 --> 00:17: 00,140
This doesn't really sound
like life or death to me.

346
00:17: 00,234 --> 00:17: 01,504
It's a favor, Tim.

347
00:17: 05,919 --> 00:17: 07,086
Unbelievable.

348
00:17: 09,233 --> 00:17: 10,409
Thanks a lot.

349
00:17: 15,838 --> 00:17: 17,722
So Eric, we think we've found

350
00:17: 17,804 --> 00:17: 21,157
a solution to this
little salary problem.

351
00:17: 21,209 --> 00:17: 22,981
- A little creative approach.
- Yes.

352
00:17: 23,563 --> 00:17: 27,200
I cannot free up
anymore coaching funds.

353
00:17: 27,313 --> 00:17: 28,371
For the time being.

354
00:17: 28,474 --> 00:17: 30,904
But there's a small pool
of money set aside

355
00:17: 31,210 --> 00:17: 33,333
for an athletic director.

356
00:17: 33,686 --> 00:17: 34,994
Me being an athletic director?

357
00:17: 35,434 --> 00:17: 39,098
You would be the head of the
entire athletic department.

358
00:17: 39,319 --> 00:17: 41,871
That's great, but I think I got 
enough responsibilities.

359
00:17: 42,133 --> 00:17: 44,674
Eric, it's not a big deal. The
department pretty much runs itself.

360
00:17: 44,775 --> 00:17: 47,705
just think about this:
Athletic director, title.

361
00:17: 48,132 --> 00:17: 50,189
I mean, if you need it on the resume,

362
00:17: 50,279 --> 00:17: 52,862
if you ever applied for another
job, it looks really good.

363
00:17: 53,011 --> 00:17: 55,528
The paycheck is pretty much just
a ?gravy train? paycheck.

364
00:17: 56,045 --> 00:17: 57,083
What do you say?

365
00:17: 59,129 --> 00:18: 00,773
How much does this job pay?

366
00:18: 01,071 --> 00:18: 04,807
Well, it's not budgeted at
full-time position, it's part-time.

367
00:18: 04,937 --> 00:18: 07,453
But you combine it, with what
you're already bringing home,

368
00:18: 07,762 --> 00:18: 10,204
you're going to be within spitting
distance of what you're making last year.

369
00:18: 10,382 --> 00:18: 11,582
Spitting distance?

370
00:18: 11,795 --> 00:18: 14,202
Eric, it's only temporary.

371
00:18: 14,634 --> 00:18: 15,634
I swear to you.

372
00:18: 16,864 --> 00:18: 17,977
Temporary.

373
00:18: 19,818 --> 00:18: 20,818
What is that?

374
00:18: 22,212 --> 00:18: 24,134
It's a pump for her breast.

375
00:18: 25,273 --> 00:18: 26,311
What?

376
00:18: 27,311 --> 00:18: 28,529
Are you serious?

377
00:18: 28,778 --> 00:18: 29,982
It squeezes..

378
00:18: 30,842 --> 00:18: 32,972
It squeezes milk out
of a ladys udders.

379
00:18: 33,356 --> 00:18: 34,737
You just hook it up and next..

380
00:18: 35,108 --> 00:18: 37,250
do something in there
and just pump it.

381
00:18: 37,285 --> 00:18: 38,778
Does it have motor or something?

382
00:18: 38,787 --> 00:18: 40,246
It's got somekind of motor to it.

383
00:18: 40,918 --> 00:18: 42,729
Hey, Tami.
Sorry.

384
00:18: 42,730 --> 00:18: 44,368
That's really not a toy.

385
00:18: 45,937 --> 00:18: 48,076
Welcome back, Tim.

386
00:18: 48,077 --> 00:18: 49,809
Glad you made it home safely.

387
00:18: 49,810 --> 00:18: 52,442
I feel sorry about that.
Disappearing and all.

388
00:18: 52,443 --> 00:18: 57,526
I'm been trying to get him to be
more responsible to himself, to others.

389
00:18: 57,527 --> 00:19: 00,433
That's good advice, considering
you're banging my ex-girlfriend.

390
00:19: 00,434 --> 00:19: 01,576
She's not your ex-girlfriend.

391
00:19: 01,577 --> 00:19: 03,413
Alright, we all, 
can we focus, please?

392
00:19: 03,414 --> 00:19: 04,957
And that kid likes me twice
as much he likes you.

393
00:19: 04,958 --> 00:19: 06,961
That's just  not true.

394
00:19: 06,962 --> 00:19: 08,381
Can we focus? Thank you.

395
00:19: 08,883 --> 00:19: 11,537
Because it looks to me like,
on your little ***, Tim.

396
00:19: 11,572 --> 00:19: 14,895
You missed yourself
two biology exams.

397
00:19: 14,896 --> 00:19: 18,941
And what looks like a pretty important
term paper, in your english lit-class.

398
00:19: 18,942 --> 00:19: 20,178
So, let's start there.

399
00:19: 20,819 --> 00:19: 22,822
I don't know what *** is, mam.

400
00:19: 23,956 --> 00:19: 27,037
A *** is what's going to
keep you back a year

401
00:19: 27,038 --> 00:19: 28,287
if you don't get it together.

402
00:19: 28,288 --> 00:19: 29,892
- That's right.
- Change your attitude.

403
00:19: 29,893 --> 00:19: 32,394
That's what *** is.
The rest of it you can look up.

404
00:19: 32,736 --> 00:19: 34,345
Tami, I just want you to know

405
00:19: 34,346 --> 00:19: 37,481
I'm going to be squeezing his testicles
until he's bleeding term papers.

406
00:19: 37,907 --> 00:19: 39,988
But that aside, I mean

407
00:19: 40,519 --> 00:19: 41,869
I just need to get
him back on the team.

408
00:19: 42,317 --> 00:19: 44,028
I mean his future is
riding on this.

409
00:19: 44,029 --> 00:19: 46,244
I was thinking, like,
maybe you could

410
00:19: 47,256 --> 00:19: 49,063
exert a little influence on coach.

411
00:19: 49,161 --> 00:19: 50,985
Is that right? Is that
what you were thinking?

412
00:19: 50,986 --> 00:19: 52,295
What is that you want her to do?

413
00:19: 52,296 --> 00:19: 55,319
You know, maybe..

414
00:19: 55,934 --> 00:19: 58,482
I'm here as his
educational advisor.

415
00:19: 58,483 --> 00:19: 59,924
Okay? That's what I'm here for.


416
00:19: 59,925 --> 00:20: 02,476
That's what my role is. You
want to talk coach Taylor?

417
00:20: 02,477 --> 00:20: 04,350
You know where he is. You
can go talk to him yourself.

418
00:20: 05,116 --> 00:20: 07,195
Yes, mam. Come on, jackass.

419
00:20: 07,368 --> 00:20: 08,971
Well now, wait a minute.
I'm not finished.

420
00:20: 10,255 --> 00:20: 11,873
Like father, like
son. Huh, Chad?

421
00:20: 12,740 --> 00:20: 14,302
Boy played well on Friday night.

422
00:20: 14,385 --> 00:20: 18,173
Yeah, I don't want him to get fat hit,
thought, he still got ways to go.

423
00:20: 18,174 --> 00:20: 19,557
Chad, Ronnie Blair.

424
00:20: 20,298 --> 00:20: 21,993
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleasure.

425
00:20: 22,464 --> 00:20: 24,756
They brought me in from Midland
to help out with your homicide.

426
00:20: 24,757 --> 00:20: 27,038
Yeah, is that right?
How is the case going?

427
00:20: 27,039 --> 00:20: 29,424
All be dead until
we came across these.

428
00:20: 29,425 --> 00:20: 32,015
The coroner found some
car seat fibres

429
00:20: 32,050 --> 00:20: 33,992
on the dead guy's jacket zipper.

430
00:20: 34,027 --> 00:20: 35,972
I'll think they came from the vehicle,
that took him to the river.

431
00:20: 36,007 --> 00:20: 37,744
The killer propably
pulled the body out,

432
00:20: 37,779 --> 00:20: 40,905
and didn't realize, he was taking some
of his own car padding with him.

433
00:20: 41,034 --> 00:20: 42,654
Do you know what kind of car?

434
00:20: 42,689 --> 00:20: 44,933
Well, it matches three
different models of GM.

435
00:20: 44,934 --> 00:20: 47,476
Manufactured between 74 and 78.

436
00:20: 47,477 --> 00:20: 50,909
DMV is propably going to pull up
about 20 of these in Dillon alone.

437
00:20: 51,583 --> 00:20: 54,614
- Alright. Well good luck with your
digging. - Thanks.

438
00:20: 54,615 --> 00:20: 57,006
Tell your son to keep
up the good work.

439
00:20: 57,007 --> 00:20: 58,970
We'll do. Thanks for
helping us out.

440
00:20: 58,971 --> 00:20: 59,992
No problem.

441
00:21: 10,650 --> 00:21: 12,365
Set! Hut!

442
00:21: 13,968 --> 00:21: 15,191
Shrader!

443
00:21: 15,989 --> 00:21: 17,949
You stand up like that, you're going
to get your running back killed.

444
00:21: 17,984 --> 00:21: 21,036
If you stand up like that on blitz, you're
going to get your QB killed. Understand me?

445
00:21: 21,232 --> 00:21: 23,255
Left eye underneath his left ear hole.

446
00:21: 23,290 --> 00:21: 25,789
Get low and drive.
What do you do?

447
00:21: 25,790 --> 00:21: 27,432
- Get low and drive.
- Thank you.

448
00:21: 44,330 --> 00:21: 45,419
Jesus!

449
00:21: 53,722 --> 00:21: 55,850
Can't you block for me, fool?

450
00:21: 55,851 --> 00:21: 57,050
I am, but you're
not following me!

451
00:21: 57,051 --> 00:21: 58,488
- Coach, what the hell!
- Set down.

452
00:21: 58,943 --> 00:22: 00,155
What's wrong, Smash?

453
00:22: 00,190 --> 00:22: 01,707
You're hearing me?

454
00:22: 01,796 --> 00:22: 03,217
- Yes, I'm hearing alright.
- Alright, now.

455
00:22: 03,629 --> 00:22: 04,842
Now, hit it back.

456
00:22: 05,073 --> 00:22: 08,027
Yes, I got the invoice here,
but I don't have the equipment.

457
00:22: 08,170 --> 00:22: 11,379
I'm not. I'm just trying to tell you,
I'm not going to send you a check 

458
00:22: 11,414 --> 00:22: 13,565
until I have the equipment.
Why would I..

459
00:22: 15,572 --> 00:22: 16,655
Alright,

460
00:22: 16,739 --> 00:22: 18,827
and that's when you
get the check then.

461
00:22: 18,943 --> 00:22: 20,227
Yeah, you too.

462
00:22: 20,660 --> 00:22: 21,785
- What?
- Hey coach, look I don't mean no

463
00:22: 21,885 --> 00:22: 26,593
disrespect but, I got my ass handed
to me, out there in the field today.

464
00:22: 26,628 --> 00:22: 28,512
And I know Riggins shouldn't
had gone to Mexico,

465
00:22: 28,547 --> 00:22: 31,054
and he has disrespect for you
and the coaches staff.

466
00:22: 31,089 --> 00:22: 33,216
He drinks too much, and
misses too many practices.

467
00:22: 33,251 --> 00:22: 34,738
But I need him.

468
00:22: 35,313 --> 00:22: 37,422
I need him, coach. I'ma get
killed out there without him.

469
00:22: 37,865 --> 00:22: 39,300
Is it really worth
throwing away season

470
00:22: 39,301 --> 00:22: 40,437
just to prove a point?
- Stop right there!

471
00:22: 40,472 --> 00:22: 41,731
I'm not throwing away my season.

472
00:22: 41,766 --> 00:22: 43,550
- Are you throwing away your season?
- I'm not throwing away my season.

473
00:22: 43,585 --> 00:22: 46,138
Seems to me Tim Riggins is the
one throwing his season away.

474
00:22: 46,173 --> 00:22: 47,902
As far as your block-issues are,

475
00:22: 47,937 --> 00:22: 49,146
It will be taken cared of.

476
00:22: 49,181 --> 00:22: 50,696
- I'm just saying..
- Now go to class.

477
00:22: 52,131 --> 00:22: 53,726
Go to class!

478
00:23: 08,379 --> 00:23: 09,654
Yeah?

479
00:23: 12,814 --> 00:23: 17,520
And what do I owe to presence, of
the captain, of the Dillon Panthers?

480
00:23: 17,620 --> 00:23: 19,161
Nice crib, Rig.

481
00:23: 19,898 --> 00:23: 21,782
What's up? The maid's
on the vacation

482
00:23: 23,314 --> 00:23: 25,076
- What's up?
- Hey, look

483
00:23: 25,111 --> 00:23: 26,883
I want you to come
to dinner tonight.

484
00:23: 27,237 --> 00:23: 28,555
My mom cooks.

485
00:23: 28,986 --> 00:23: 30,878
Are you asking me on
a date, Williams?

486
00:23: 30,913 --> 00:23: 32,194
Just save it.

487
00:23: 32,229 --> 00:23: 34,623
I need to talk to you, about how
you're messing up this team.

488
00:23: 35,346 --> 00:23: 37,545
I'm screwing up the
team I'm not on?

489
00:23: 37,580 --> 00:23: 38,975
Alright, Rig. I got
no fullback, because

490
00:23: 39,010 --> 00:23: 40,493
of your drunk, selfish ass.

491
00:23: 40,628 --> 00:23: 41,695
And you're coming
to dinner tonight,

492
00:23: 41,724 --> 00:23: 43,366
so I can talk some sence into you.

493
00:23: 44,124 --> 00:23: 45,464
7.00 o'clock.

494
00:23: 45,599 --> 00:23: 47,213
Be on time for once.

495
00:24: 01,975 --> 00:24: 03,242
Hi, Julie.

496
00:24: 04,142 --> 00:24: 05,570
Hey!

497
00:24: 05,982 --> 00:24: 08,120
What can I get you?

498
00:24: 11,307 --> 00:24: 14,192
I don't really want
anything, I just..

499
00:24: 14,886 --> 00:24: 17,351
I wanted to say something to you.

500
00:24: 19,410 --> 00:24: 20,696
I just..

501
00:24: 21,524 --> 00:24: 24,773
I wanted to tell you, that I thought
about what you said the another night.

502
00:24: 26,014 --> 00:24: 30,148
And that you were right.
And that I was wrong.

503
00:24: 32,261 --> 00:24: 34,285
I don't really know
what I was thinking.

504
00:24: 35,123 --> 00:24: 40,082
I wanted to apologize for..
like everything.

505
00:24: 41,670 --> 00:24: 45,214
And to tell you I'm sorry, and
I'm really sorry that I hurt you.

506
00:24: 46,663 --> 00:24: 47,721
Thanks.

507
00:24: 47,956 --> 00:24: 51,167
And I just hope you
can forgive me,

508
00:24: 51,202 --> 00:24: 53,480
and maybe we can be
friends or something.

509
00:24: 56,911 --> 00:24: 58,686
Yeah, me too.

510
00:25: 00,452 --> 00:25: 03,779
- I guess I just see you around,
okay? - Okay.

511
00:25: 14,373 --> 00:25: 16,711
- Hello, reverend.
- I am proud of you, Lyla.

512
00:25: 16,746 --> 00:25: 18,911
- Thank you.
- And I'm praying for you every day.

513
00:25: 18,946 --> 00:25: 20,094
Thank you.

514
00:25: 25,079 --> 00:25: 27,437
- Hi.
- Hello.

515
00:25: 29,331 --> 00:25: 30,520
You got a second?

516
00:25: 30,867 --> 00:25: 32,233
Yes, of course.

517
00:25: 32,467 --> 00:25: 34,187
Looking for the big party tonight.

518
00:25: 34,222 --> 00:25: 35,667
Please, don't.

519
00:25: 36,975 --> 00:25: 41,083
Anybody I ever said hello to
in my life, my mom has invited.

520
00:25: 41,558 --> 00:25: 42,931
Yeah, well..

521
00:25: 43,691 --> 00:25: 44,838
What's up?

522
00:25: 46,045 --> 00:25: 48,465
Have you ever noticed, that nobody
ever changes in this town?

523
00:25: 49,501 --> 00:25: 51,015
Nothing ever changes.

524
00:25: 51,212 --> 00:25: 54,132
All go to the same church,
or the same job,

525
00:25: 54,167 --> 00:25: 55,566
and the same restaurants.

526
00:25: 55,601 --> 00:25: 57,968
And everybody goes to the
football game Friday night.

527
00:25: 58,420 --> 00:26: 01,850
It's like this huge fishtank,
that we're all stuck in,

528
00:26: 01,885 --> 00:26: 03,977
and we can't find our way out.

529
00:26: 06,065 --> 00:26: 09,261
I'm kind of.. stuck.
I'm stuck.

530
00:26: 12,002 --> 00:26: 14,374
- Well there's a way..
- No, no..

531
00:26: 14,609 --> 00:26: 16,822
I know what you're thinking.

532
00:26: 17,072 --> 00:26: 18,620
And no, I don't need saving.

533
00:26: 18,655 --> 00:26: 20,474
I'm not here to talk to God.

534
00:26: 20,509 --> 00:26: 21,770
I'm here to talk to you.

535
00:26: 21,805 --> 00:26: 24,198
Because, out of
everyone I know,

536
00:26: 24,233 --> 00:26: 27,440
you're just about a only one,
that has changed her life.

537
00:26: 27,961 --> 00:26: 29,937
I admire it, and..

538
00:26: 30,944 --> 00:26: 33,035
I'm just wondering
how you did it?

539
00:26: 36,676 --> 00:26: 38,417
You just do it.

540
00:26: 43,938 --> 00:26: 45,156
What I am saying is..

541
00:26: 45,479 --> 00:26: 47,251
coach Taylor needs to
see you take it up now.

542
00:26: 47,419 --> 00:26: 49,722
I said what I could to the
coach and he said no.

543
00:26: 49,822 --> 00:26: 51,357
- It's out of my hands.
- So, that's it?

544
00:26: 51,392 --> 00:26: 55,209
- You're just going to.. give up?
- I don't know what else to tell you.

545
00:26: 55,369 --> 00:26: 57,220
- He said no.
- God, my sister can talk!

546
00:26: 57,355 --> 00:27: 00,231
Okay, Tim, are you ready for
a piece of pie for dessert?

547
00:27: 00,266 --> 00:27: 03,462
- Yes, mam. That sounds great.
- Now you want pie.

548
00:27: 03,582 --> 00:27: 04,925
Can I say no?

549
00:27: 04,960 --> 00:27: 06,046
I don't like the way
you flirt with my mom.

550
00:27: 06,081 --> 00:27: 08,095
Brian! What is wrong with you?

551
00:27: 08,130 --> 00:27: 09,687
- He's being polite.
- Exactly.

552
00:27: 09,725 --> 00:27: 10,789
Look, look..

553
00:27: 11,491 --> 00:27: 13,012
We aren't a lot
different, you and me.

554
00:27: 13,047 --> 00:27: 15,798
Me, I'm the Smash.
I'm ***.

555
00:27: 15,833 --> 00:27: 17,901
- I'm prime time, 24/7.
- Right.

556
00:27: 17,936 --> 00:27: 21,397
And you.. you know,
you're that brute and,

557
00:27: 21,623 --> 00:27: 23,256
rough..

558
00:27: 23,788 --> 00:27: 25,798
Whatever. Look, the point is,

559
00:27: 26,134 --> 00:27: 29,082
neither of us can be who
we are without football.

560
00:27: 29,891 --> 00:27: 31,527
It's the key to the ignition.

561
00:27: 31,742 --> 00:27: 34,497
And if you don't
fight for that,

562
00:27: 34,868 --> 00:27: 37,632
you're just wasting a whole
lot potential, that's all.

563
00:27: 39,041 --> 00:27: 41,611
Ah, mama, come on!
I wanted apple pie.

564
00:27: 59,599 --> 00:28: 01,499
Dad, what are you doing?

565
00:28: 01,739 --> 00:28: 03,150
We're not going inside.

566
00:28: 04,356 --> 00:28: 07,075
They found blood residue outside
the convenience store.

567
00:28: 07,958 --> 00:28: 09,665
Matches up with the dead guy.

568
00:28: 10,243 --> 00:28: 13,881
Based on the head wound, they
figured that he was struck there

569
00:28: 13,916 --> 00:28: 15,405
with some sort of hard object,

570
00:28: 16,127 --> 00:28: 18,007
and the put in a car,

571
00:28: 18,400 --> 00:28: 21,980
either unconscious or dead, and taken
to the bridge and dumped in the river.

572
00:28: 23,141 --> 00:28: 24,942
I don't know why are
you telling me this.

573
00:28: 25,042 --> 00:28: 29,453
The water and the fish pretty much
did away with any foreign DNA

574
00:28: 29,488 --> 00:28: 31,735
or prints, that could
had led to suspects,

575
00:28: 31,770 --> 00:28: 37,056
and with no witnesses,
the detectives don't have much.

576
00:28: 38,683 --> 00:28: 40,591
Except for one thing.

577
00:28: 40,835 --> 00:28: 44,655
The coroner found fibres,

578
00:28: 44,929 --> 00:28: 48,892
in the zipper of
the deceased's jacket.

579
00:28: 49,033 --> 00:28: 51,141
And guess where they come from?

580
00:28: 53,023 --> 00:28: 56,828
The GMC wagons,
just like this one.

581
00:28: 57,157 --> 00:28: 58,479
Well, that..

582
00:28: 59,250 --> 00:29: 02,066
I don't know what
you're thinking,

583
00:29: 02,101 --> 00:29: 03,337
but how many different..

584
00:29: 03,372 --> 00:29: 05,852
- How many different GMC wagons..
- Landry.

585
00:29: 06,325 --> 00:29: 11,643
If you had something to do with
this, you have got to tell me.

586
00:29: 12,348 --> 00:29: 15,568
Better you tell me, than wait
for them to drag you in,

587
00:29: 15,603 --> 00:29: 17,955
because, help me God, that's
what's going to happen.

588
00:29: 23,827 --> 00:29: 25,510
Talk to me.

589
00:29: 28,208 --> 00:29: 29,549
Time to trust me.

590
00:29: 40,675 --> 00:29: 43,028
I didn't mean to do it, dad.

591
00:29: 43,853 --> 00:29: 45,756
I didn't mean to.

592
00:29: 46,679 --> 00:29: 48,273
It just happened.

593
00:29: 49,444 --> 00:29: 51,062
Oh God.

594
00:29: 51,489 --> 00:29: 53,072
I didn't mean to do it.

595
00:29: 54,747 --> 00:29: 56,596
Oh God, Landry.

596
00:29: 58,860 --> 00:30: 00,627
Okay, listen to me.

597
00:30: 01,954 --> 00:30: 06,577
We're going to need to
take a drive. Right now.

598
00:30: 07,633 --> 00:30: 09,365
Where?

599
00:30: 09,400 --> 00:30: 11,939
Get in the car.

600
00:30: 11,974 --> 00:30: 15,741
- Follow me. Right now.
- Yes, Sir.

601
00:30: 16,333 --> 00:30: 18,450
Let's go.

602
00:30: 24,014 --> 00:30: 26,835
This is a good protection,
good blocking by everybody.

603
00:30: 26,870 --> 00:30: 29,951
Nice little pump fake.
Our favourite move..

604
00:30: 30,428 --> 00:30: 32,937
Speaking of good blocking,
Williams. What just happened?

605
00:30: 32,972 --> 00:30: 35,484
Smash Williams, he's our
number one wide out actually.

606
00:30: 35,513 --> 00:30: 37,613
He always is catching
the long ones.

607
00:30: 38,674 --> 00:30: 40,499
And, Bradley, that..
There we go.

608
00:30: 40,534 --> 00:30: 43,783
Bradley hiked in on 2 and that
was supposed to be on 3.

609
00:30: 43,818 --> 00:30: 47,192
Bradley can't count that high.

610
00:30: 47,227 --> 00:30: 48,954
Don't worry about it, we
still won that game though.

611
00:30: 48,989 --> 00:30: 50,712
We still won that game
by 12, I think.

612
00:30: 50,739 --> 00:30: 51,744
There it is.

613
00:30: 51,767 --> 00:30: 56,313
Watch it very carefully. Watch
his wheels, here he goes.

614
00:30: 56,870 --> 00:31: 00,231
He takes out, watch his wheels. 

615
00:31: 00,266 --> 00:31: 02,035
Here comes the hand!

616
00:31: 04,427 --> 00:31: 08,022
There it is, right there. 620 yards
in that day. Broke the record!

617
00:31: 08,057 --> 00:31: 10,040
We could have been
a dynasty, kid.

618
00:31: 10,075 --> 00:31: 12,590
And Lyla would have been rich.

619
00:31: 12,625 --> 00:31: 13,856
- Dad!
- What?

620
00:31: 13,891 --> 00:31: 15,601
No, he's right.

621
00:31: 16,143 --> 00:31: 19,132
You can have it all, but
you can't have it all once.


622
00:31: 19,167 --> 00:31: 21,025
You take your memories, where
you can get them, right Riggs?

623
00:31: 21,060 --> 00:31: 22,723
Absolutely.

624
00:31: 22,758 --> 00:31: 26,179
Here's to many more memories.
Happy birthday, Six.

625
00:31: 26,214 --> 00:31: 28,783
Happy birthday!

626
00:31: 29,255 --> 00:31: 31,146
Cheers.

627
00:31: 32,830 --> 00:31: 35,497
I know it's like.. you know.

628
00:31: 36,786 --> 00:31: 39,315
At my old school, my
boyfriend and I broke up

629
00:31: 39,350 --> 00:31: 41,230
for inexplicable reasons.

630
00:31: 42,151 --> 00:31: 47,297
But every single time I would see him,
I would get these pains in my heart.

631
00:31: 47,767 --> 00:31: 50,544
Like someone was stabbing
it with, like a..

632
00:31: 50,579 --> 00:31: 52,330
With a knife.

633
00:31: 52,364 --> 00:31: 55,399
No, worse.
Like a ***.

634
00:31: 56,936 --> 00:31: 59,864
- What?
- Actually.

635
00:31: 59,897 --> 00:32: 03,328
I don't even know
what a *** is.

636
00:32: 03,363 --> 00:32: 06,224
You mean like a shank, like
what they use in prison?

637
00:32: 06,259 --> 00:32: 09,505
Yes, yes! Like a shank.

638
00:32: 09,540 --> 00:32: 12,730
Like a rusty old shank.

639
00:32: 20,108 --> 00:32: 23,664
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to be so forward.

640
00:32: 23,699 --> 00:32: 25,280
I thought that maybe..

641
00:32: 28,130 --> 00:32: 30,213
Bye, guys.
Hey, Colette.

642
00:32: 30,484 --> 00:32: 33,963
- Could I get a ride home?
- Of course.

643
00:32: 34,611 --> 00:32: 38,926
How are you holding up? Matt
coming up with that *** girl.

644
00:32: 38,961 --> 00:32: 43,641
It's not like we're together or
anything. It's not really my business.

645
00:32: 43,676 --> 00:32: 45,755
Very mature.

646
00:32: 52,050 --> 00:32: 54,830
Okay, hey..

647
00:32: 54,863 --> 00:32: 56,563
Julie..

648
00:32: 56,906 --> 00:33: 00,579
What do you say, you and I, go
get a big vat of ice cream,

649
00:33: 00,614 --> 00:33: 04,016
and rent “Thelma and Louise”
and cry our eyes out?

650
00:33: 04,825 --> 00:33: 06,669
Sure.

651
00:33: 10,259 --> 00:33: 12,928
Hey coach? coach Taylor?

652
00:33: 12,963 --> 00:33: 14,430
You got a couple of minutes?

653
00:33: 14,464 --> 00:33: 15,897
Yes.

654
00:33: 16,539 --> 00:33: 18,464
Before going, I just wanted to a..

655
00:33: 18,497 --> 00:33: 21,755
I wanted to give these or donate
them to the athletic department.

656
00:33: 21,790 --> 00:33: 25,063
It's all my tapes and
everything. My glory years.

657
00:33: 25,097 --> 00:33: 28,730
From freshman year on. I just
figured it to be something good for

658
00:33: 28,763 --> 00:33: 31,987
the freshmen, or the JB
quarterbacks to look at. 

659
00:33: 32,022 --> 00:33: 34,379
You're saying you
quitting the team?

660
00:33: 34,404 --> 00:33: 38,397
Yeah, I am. I just..

661
00:33: 38,430 --> 00:33: 41,430
I keep on trying to go back and
be the Jason from before,

662
00:33: 41,464 --> 00:33: 45,330
but I need to figure out
a way to be a new guy.

663
00:33: 45,363 --> 00:33: 50,130
I thought the team was going to
do that for me, but it hasn't.

664
00:33: 50,163 --> 00:33: 52,805
And I'm so sorry coach
if I let you down.

665
00:33: 53,263 --> 00:33: 56,164
But that's just something,
I have to do.

666
00:33: 58,497 --> 00:34: 00,664
Let me tell you something.

667
00:34: 01,772 --> 00:34: 04,964
Coaches and players,

668
00:34: 04,999 --> 00:34: 07,400
they learn from each others.

669
00:34: 07,435 --> 00:34: 10,451
Goes by twice.

670
00:34: 11,833 --> 00:34: 16,365
You lived up everyone around you.

671
00:34: 17,995 --> 00:34: 21,030
That's a powerful gift earned.

672
00:34: 22,481 --> 00:34: 25,146
I hope I didn't let you down.

673
00:34: 26,231 --> 00:34: 27,978
No.

674
00:34: 29,542 --> 00:34: 32,192
You didn't le me down, Trainer.

675
00:34: 33,053 --> 00:34: 36,335
This I hold on to.

676
00:34: 36,370 --> 00:34: 39,319
Until you come and pick it up.

677
00:35: 01,647 --> 00:35: 03,680
Dad, what are we doing here?

678
00:35: 18,013 --> 00:35: 21,013
Dear God, forgive us for this.

679
00:35: 21,046 --> 00:35: 23,080
Forgive us.

680
00:35: 32,380 --> 00:35: 34,780
Alright, let's back up.

681
00:35: 47,746 --> 00:35: 49,851
These young cats did not
believe in protection.

682
00:35: 49,886 --> 00:35: 52,864
They're crying to me, saying:
“Coach, don't tell my mother,

683
00:35: 52,899 --> 00:35: 55,124
“I need to go to the clinic..”

684
00:35: 55,524 --> 00:35: 57,592
You must be the new
athletic director.

685
00:35: 57,627 --> 00:36: 00,547
Funny, you look a lot like
football coach Eric Taylor.

686
00:36: 00,580 --> 00:36: 02,099
How are you doing?

687
00:36: 02,134 --> 00:36: 04,343
Do you know my name?
“No, I don't.”

688
00:36: 04,378 --> 00:36: 07,665
Do you know what this is?
Rhymes with ***ball.

689
00:36: 07,700 --> 00:36: 10,702
It's soccer ball, okay?
Actually, this isn't one.

690
00:36: 10,737 --> 00:36: 12,614
This here is a rubber
carcass. You see that?

691
00:36: 12,647 --> 00:36: 15,447
A soccer ball is something,
with air in it.

692
00:36: 15,480 --> 00:36: 18,595
How many footballs, do
the football team have?

693
00:36: 18,630 --> 00:36: 22,702
Thirty-six. And not
one of them is dead.

694
00:36: 22,737 --> 00:36: 25,334
What are you going
to do about this?

695
00:36: 25,369 --> 00:36: 27,209
What are you going
to do about that, man?

696
00:36: 27,244 --> 00:36: 31,195
You're going to give me some
more? My God. Is this new?

697
00:36: 31,230 --> 00:36: 34,676
- We all got them.
- Wow! It's so beautiful, look at this.

698
00:36: 34,711 --> 00:36: 37,609
It's a fine computer. I would have
called you to have this conversation,

699
00:36: 37,644 --> 00:36: 39,580
but I don't even have
a freakin' phone.

700
00:36: 39,613 --> 00:36: 41,500
You see the disperity
here, big guy?

701
00:36: 41,535 --> 00:36: 45,514
Save it. My name is Bobbie Roberts and
I'm going to be in here every day,

702
00:36: 45,547 --> 00:36: 48,766
until my girls get exactly what
the hell they need, okay? 

703
00:36: 48,801 --> 00:36: 51,804
Thank you.

704
00:36: 53,980 --> 00:36: 56,802
I hope they're paying
you a ton of money.

705
00:36: 56,837 --> 00:36: 58,940
I'm going to kill Buddy.

706
00:36: 58,975 --> 00:37: 01,077
I going to kill him.

707
00:37: 05,247 --> 00:37: 07,229
Where is everybody?

708
00:37: 07,264 --> 00:37: 10,380
Well, let's see.
Gracie is asleep,

709
00:37: 10,413 --> 00:37: 14,233
Julie's with Lois and Eric's
not got home from work yet.

710
00:37: 14,268 --> 00:37: 17,355
- What's that?
- This?

711
00:37: 17,390 --> 00:37: 19,246
It's an environmentally
responsible bag.

712
00:37: 19,280 --> 00:37: 21,688
- Not that. That.
- Ah, this.

713
00:37: 21,723 --> 00:37: 23,137
This is bottle of wine.

714
00:37: 23,172 --> 00:37: 25,316
I'm not heading on drinking,
because I'm nursing.

715
00:37: 25,351 --> 00:37: 27,002
No, you can.

716
00:37: 27,037 --> 00:37: 30,995
You can have little bit, just as
long as you drink a lot of water,

717
00:37: 31,030 --> 00:37: 34,287
and you have to eat foods that
are rich in B9, like asparagus.

718
00:37: 34,322 --> 00:37: 36,847
You just got to wait couple
of hours before you nurse.

719
00:37: 36,880 --> 00:37: 41,187
Aren't you clever, Dr. “I never had a
baby before, but I know all the answers.”

720
00:37: 41,222 --> 00:37: 45,012
Just little something called
reading. You do it much?

721
00:37: 45,747 --> 00:37: 47,641
When I have time, yeah.

722
00:37: 47,676 --> 00:37: 52,080
What, like a Dillon Gazette
and those baby books?

723
00:37: 53,220 --> 00:37: 55,061
What's your point?

724
00:37: 55,096 --> 00:37: 58,980
All I'm saying, just because you live in
Dillon, you don't have to stop thinking.

725
00:38: 01,347 --> 00:38: 04,808
Interesting. Didn't realize
I stopped thinking.

726
00:38: 04,843 --> 00:38: 07,442
- I'm just saying that..
- Okay!

727
00:38: 07,477 --> 00:38: 10,372
You know what, I don't really need
a lecture by my sister, right now.

728
00:38: 10,407 --> 00:38: 12,080
I'm not lecturing you.

729
00:38: 12,113 --> 00:38: 14,513
Really? Because that's what it
sounds like. You are lecturing me.

730
00:38: 14,547 --> 00:38: 17,218
And you know what? Sorry,
I don't have time

731
00:38: 17,253 --> 00:38: 20,371
to read 24 hours per day,
or to jet off to Brazil,

732
00:38: 20,406 --> 00:38: 22,586
or to go to the damned
Dixie Chicks concert!

733
00:38: 22,621 --> 00:38: 25,200
I'm cooking, working
and breast feeding.

734
00:38: 25,235 --> 00:38: 27,580
- That's what I'm doing!
- Okay.

735
00:38: 29,897 --> 00:38: 32,694
And it may had just
occured to me

736
00:38: 33,447 --> 00:38: 36,480
that as much as I love
my little Gracie-girl..

737
00:38: 39,513 --> 00:38: 41,681
You knows, now..

738
00:38: 41,716 --> 00:38: 47,513
I got another whole 16 years
plus ahead of me child rearing

739
00:38: 47,547 --> 00:38: 51,332
****** on Julie, and
just be mean to me,

740
00:38: 51,367 --> 00:38: 53,907
and I'm going to be in a walker.

741
00:38: 56,152 --> 00:38: 59,146
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

742
00:38: 59,627 --> 00:39: 01,213
Thank you.

743
00:39: 01,744 --> 00:39: 04,146
I'm sorry I said anything.

744
00:39: 05,118 --> 00:39: 10,755
I'm just compensating for my
lonely and pathetic life.

745
00:39: 14,873 --> 00:39: 16,964
Your life is kind of
lonely and pathetic.

746
00:39: 16,999 --> 00:39: 19,962
You're such an ass, I swear.

747
00:39: 19,997 --> 00:39: 22,520
- You're an ass too.
- I hate you.

748
00:39: 53,547 --> 00:39: 54,931
Hey, wait.

749
00:39: 54,966 --> 00:39: 58,546
Stop, before you just
hurt yourself, alright?

750
00:40: 00,215 --> 00:40: 03,144
You know you're not
in the team, right?

751
00:40: 04,652 --> 00:40: 06,047
I know.

752
00:40: 08,380 --> 00:40: 10,858
Are you trying to break your neck
by keeping your head down like that?

753
00:40: 10,893 --> 00:40: 14,214
Everybody's got to start
somewhere, right?

754
00:40: 17,980 --> 00:40: 20,114
Let me ask you something.

755
00:40: 21,457 --> 00:40: 25,847
Are you in any way shape performing,
trying to screw Lyla Garrity?

756
00:40: 25,880 --> 00:40: 30,380
She's my friend, dog.
Alright? Just my friend.

757
00:40: 36,447 --> 00:40: 40,114
You want a couple of pointers or are
you going to try to break your neck?

758
00:40: 40,789 --> 00:40: 42,686
Move.

759
00:40: 42,721 --> 00:40: 45,169
Okay, you hit with purpose.

760
00:40: 45,204 --> 00:40: 48,152
You lift them up and you snap
them. Keep your head up.

761
00:40: 48,187 --> 00:40: 49,939
Are you ready, watch.

762
00:40: 55,690 --> 00:40: 56,931
Pick him up!

763
00:40: 56,966 --> 00:40: 59,991
You need to hurt.
Keep your head up.

764
00:41: 00,026 --> 00:41: 02,847
That was crap.

765
00:41: 02,880 --> 00:41: 04,555
Only way up from here.
Now, let's go.

766
00:41: 04,590 --> 00:41: 07,347
Push yourself, with purpose!
Let's go. Come on.

767
00:41: 08,516 --> 00:41: 10,446
Way better. Love it.

768
00:41: 10,480 --> 00:41: 13,980
Hey, Riggs. What's up man?
Starting your own team or something?

769
00:41: 14,014 --> 00:41: 16,780
Come on, Williams. He can hit
twice as hard as your ass.

770
00:41: 16,813 --> 00:41: 18,280
Okay.

771
00:41: 18,313 --> 00:41: 20,780
Stick it.

772
00:41: 20,813 --> 00:41: 23,647
Let's see about that. How about
running through some plays?

773
00:41: 23,680 --> 00:41: 26,413
Hey, you're up for that?

774
00:41: 26,882 --> 00:41: 28,088
Alright.

775
00:41: 28,123 --> 00:41: 29,613
Go. Get a ball.

776
00:41: 29,647 --> 00:41: 31,348
- Why I got to get a ball?
- Because you are the QB.

777
00:41: 31,383 --> 00:41: 33,280
- You're the one wanted to play!
- Just get the ball.

778
00:41: 33,313 --> 00:41: 37,129
Set! White, 8!
White, 8! Hut!

779
00:41: 42,213 --> 00:41: 43,980
What just happened,
Williams?

780
00:41: 44,013 --> 00:41: 46,213
You need to stay low

781
00:41: 46,247 --> 00:41: 48,513
and push Riggins inside,
so I can break free.

782
00:41: 48,547 --> 00:41: 52,747
Bottom line, you don't have
time to second guess yourself.

783
00:41: 52,780 --> 00:41: 55,760
Set! Blue, 8! Hut!

784
00:41: 59,383 --> 00:42: 01,316
- Sorry.
- Alright, Riggs?

785
00:42: 01,351 --> 00:42: 02,884
Don't apologize.

786
00:42: 02,919 --> 00:42: 04,982
You're allright?

787
00:42: 05,914 --> 00:42: 08,475
You're going to knock him on his
ass, don't stop, keep driving,

788
00:42: 08,510 --> 00:42: 10,479
keep moving.

789
00:42: 10,514 --> 00:42: 11,914
Yes, Sir.

790
00:42: 12,761 --> 00:42: 15,657
You want to come by tomorrow?
To practice with us?

791
00:42: 16,292 --> 00:42: 18,680
- Yes, sir.
- You be in my office, at 7:00.

792
00:42: 18,715 --> 00:42: 21,718
Not 7:01, seven o'clock
sharp. We'll fit you up.

793
00:42: 21,753 --> 00:42: 24,618
- Alright.
- Alright then.

794
00:42: 24,653 --> 00:42: 26,596
Thank you, sir.

795
00:42: 29,076 --> 00:42: 33,044
- Am I showing you something, Sir?
- Ah, yeah.

796
00:42: 34,314 --> 00:42: 37,433
Does that mean I'm
back on squad, coach?

797
00:42: 38,961 --> 00:42: 41,049
Not even close.

798
00:42: 41,850 --> 00:42: 44,369
Not even close!

799
00:42: 44,404 --> 00:42: 46,997
You gentleman have a good night.

800
00:42: 48,687 --> 00:42: 50,359
It's all game.

801
00:42: 50,394 --> 00:42: 52,992
Set! Blue, 8!

802
00:42: 53,027 --> 00:42: 55,513
Blue, 8! Hut!

803
00:42: 56,114 --> 00:42: 59,183
