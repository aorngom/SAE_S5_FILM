1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,236
<i>(man) Even all these months</i>
<i>after Katrina ravaged New Orleans,</i>

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,916
<i>human remains are still being found in</i>
<i>devastated neighbourhoods across the city.</i>

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,630
<i>Cadaver dogs are being used to search</i>
<i>for 2300 people still unaccounted for.</i>

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,236
<i>Makeshift morgues still exist in warehouses,</i>
<i>schools, and churches throughout the area.</i>

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,356
<i>Officials are finally beginning to admit</i>

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,876
<i>what many people have known</i>
<i>since the levees broke long ago.</i>

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,951
<i>Many of these people will never be found.</i>

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,589
- You look tired, Mike. Late night?
- Oh, yeah. Late and nasty.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,879
- Same kinky creature?
- Doc, the girl carries a serious perv swerve.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,349
Feeling wrong feels so good.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,151
- Sorry, Dr Brennan.
- No, it's fine.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,596
Males often bond
by exaggerating sexual conquests.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,755
Mike's not exaggerating. This girl is turned on
by coffins. Mike'll take her into the cooler...

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,469
<i>(Zack) Some libidos</i>
<i>are inflamed by proximity to death.</i>

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,348
- Who's that?
- My assistant Zack, back in DC.

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,557
<i>Congratulations on your coffin sex.</i>

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,595
I've got work to do.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,754
<i>Some of the information you've sent seems to</i>
<i>have come from remains already embalmed.</i>

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,196
Bodies were unearthed by the flooding.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,238
<i>They have to be ID'd and reburied.</i>

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,436
I could fly down there to help.

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,034
<i>A, tomorrow's my last day,</i>

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,954
<i>and B, the sex-on-the-coffin thing</i>
<i>is not guaranteed.</i>

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,233
You know, there are reasons they call this
the Big Easy. Even after Hurricane Katrina.

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,349
Dr Brennan... meet John Doe 361.

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,874
Found him in the Ninth Ward,
sticking out of the mud.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,793
Good afternoon, Detective Harding.
Male, 40s.

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,236
- Badly decomposed, looks pretty banged up.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,995
Be nice to know if it was hurricane, flood,
or foul play that killed him.

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,548
Detective, have you been
into the cooler lately?

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,155
Apparently some libidos are inflamed
by the proximity to death.

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,270
God, Graham, thinking about sex in this place
should be illegal - If it ain't already.

33
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,313
<i>(Bones)</i> Oh, Sam,
I'm going to need x-rays on this one.

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,557
Looks like there's something
lodged behind his teeth.

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,076
You've been working 48 hours straight.
You need the evening off.

36
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,151
I only have one vacation day left.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,550
Are you doing penance for FEMA?
Let me cook you dinner tonight.

38
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,076
- I don't know.
- Come on. I'm a Southern gentleman, ma'am.

39
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,958
- Your honour will be respected.
- Yeah.

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,876
Tell you what, Graham. We'll see what the
x-rays tell us about this one and then, <i>maybe</i>,

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,269
we'll get a bite to eat.

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,673
All right.

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,392
Agh!

44
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,711
<i>(phone rings)</i>

45
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,311
<i>(phone still ringing)</i>

46
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,514
<i>(woman) Dr Brennan,</i>
<i>your airport shuttle is here.</i>

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,397
What?

48
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,671
No. Um...

49
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,230
My flight isn't until Thursday.

50
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,312
<i>Today is Thursday, Dr Brennan.</i>

51
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,035
What happened to Wednesday?

52
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,829
<i>Dr Brennan? Hello?</i>
<i>Are you there, Dr Brennan?</i>

53
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,548
Looks like someone stole your earring.
Ripped it right out of the lobe.

54
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,677
- I don't know what happened to me.
- It's a tough town.

55
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,072
We don't have many cops any more, and...
they were never that good to begin with.

56
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,439
- Shouldrt insult the ones that stuck around.
- Detective, I didn't... know who else to call.

57
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,715
I need blood samples on this clothing.

58
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,191
Maybe we'll get lucky and they won't all
come from you. Still hazy on the details?

59
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,748
I'm not hazy on the details, I...

60
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,149
- I don't remember anything.
- Nothing?

61
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,078
Dr Leger knocking over a tray of instruments
at the morgue, then... nothing.

62
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,596
- That was the day before yesterday.
- I requested a rape kit.

63
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,638
No sign of sexual activity,
forced or otherwise.

64
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,358
- You can't go in!
- Are you OK?

65
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,749
- Booth, I told you not to come.
- Who's this?

66
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,595
- He's FBI. We're sort of partners.
- Guy flies from DC, you're more than sort of.

67
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,717
- Yeah, that's great. You remember anything?
- <i>(sighs)</i>

68
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,712
- Tray falling over.
- Why can't she remember anything?

69
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,759
- It could be the head injury.
- Hairline fracture on my right distal radius.

70
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,868
Concussion. Slight fever. Torn earlobe.
I lost one of my favourite earrings.

71
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,111
You should really be worried
about losing a whole day.

72
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,192
I know. It's stupid.
But these earrings were my mother's.

73
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,558
Amnesia caused by any traumatic event -
injury or drug -

74
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,949
can erase memories before the event,
notjust after.

75
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,998
- We'll wait for a tox screen.
- It'll be at least 24 hours.

76
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,709
- 24 hours?
- Most labs were destroyed by the hurricane.

77
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,157
We'll find out what happened.
You just take care of your, uh... partner.

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,672
Another present from the bayou.

79
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,513
I keep asking for a baby tee
that says "the Big Easy".

80
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,556
We're all hoping for that.

81
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,313
For you, I mean.

82
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,517
Does our funding allow us to do
Dr Brennars vacation work?

83
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,752
We're just doing what the feds didn't.
It's the yin-yang of government spending.

84
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,719
- So we're sneaking?
- That's what makes it fun.

85
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,392
John Doe 361.

86
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,754
Wow.

87
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,229
Bad things happened to Mr Doe.

88
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,796
<i>(Booth)</i> It'll come back, Bones.

89
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,792
<i>(Bones)</i> You don't know that.
Head injuries are unpredictable.

90
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,269
- I'm just being reassuring.
- <i>(phone rings)</i>

91
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,349
Brennan.

92
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,796
Regarding the x-rays of John Doe 361.

93
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,030
John Doe 361?

94
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,997
Yes. You sent his x-rays.

95
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,753
- <i>I don't remember that.</i>
- You don't remember?

96
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,199
- What about the x-ray, Zack?
- Male, late 40s, mixed-race.

97
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,671
Anomalies on his spine, which I'm
looking into. His death was not accidental.

98
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,639
- I sent you the x-rays of a murder victim?
- <i>(Booth) How'd he die?</i>

99
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,473
- Is that Booth?
- <i>(Bones) Yes.</i>

100
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,951
You're hopping the streetcar named Desire
with Booth? Oh, I love this.

101
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,794
Obviously they're working
the murder of John Doe 361 together.

102
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,678
Precisely. How did 361 die?

103
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,911
The pelvis shows crush fractures.

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,959
There's what appears to be a bullet hole
in the skull, but there's no exit wound.

105
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,270
<i>(Bones) OK, keep working on it.</i>

106
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,874
- You don't remember the case?
- No.

107
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,157
And it's a murder.
Oh, I'm hungry.

108
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,030
When was the last time you ate?
My bad. You have amnesia.

109
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,157
Booth. I think I know a place.

110
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,470
What is the last thing you do remember?

111
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,395
I told you. Graham - Dr Leger -
knocked over a tray of surgical instruments.

112
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,076
- I want to talk to Leger.
- He was about to examine John Doe 361.

113
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,799
Dr Brennan!
I thought you were leaving today.

114
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,872
Peter, this is my friend Seeley Booth.

115
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,394
- My God, what happened to you?
- I'm not certain,

116
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,597
but the bruising suggests Tuesday night.

117
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,240
- After you left here?
- I was here Tuesday?

118
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,357
- What time?
- In at eight, left at nine.

119
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,831
Don't you remember?
You had dinner with Sam Potter.

120
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,352
Bones. Bones.

121
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,795
- We have to go to the morgue, talk to Sam.
- Who's Sam?

122
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,031
- He's an orderly. He practises voodoo.
- Bones, wait up.

123
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,514
- <i>(Sam) You invited me to dinner.</i>
- <i>(Bones) Why?</i>

124
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,598
You found this in the mouth of a John Doe.

125
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,318
<i>(Booth)</i> Let me see that.

126
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,312
- That's voodoo?
- It's a grigri bag. It's a mojo.

127
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,630
This one is meant to silence the dead.

128
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,870
Usually dead people are silent on their own.

129
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,033
Voodoo embraces the premise that spirits
can speak to us from beyond the grave.

130
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,237
Voodoo is all about the balance of the forces.

131
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,314
That wind, the flood, this death -
it's all out of balance now.

132
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,153
Katrina was Armageddon
for the ones who love balance.

133
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,800
Some think it was Secte Rouge
that brought it on.

134
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,077
- What's that? Some kind of a gang?
- The ones who follow evil.

135
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,517
Some believe they angered the sirens
who sent the flood. This is Secte Rouge.

136
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,909
So that's literally bad voodoo?

137
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,473
It's black gum root.
There's only one place you can find it -

138
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,190
a voodoo shop on Pontchartrain Avenue
run by Richard Benoit.

139
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,317
He's a good man. Maybe he can help you.

140
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,868
OK. Thanks.

141
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,520
Dr Brennan, a lost day?

142
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,630
Perhaps a spell was cast on you as well.

143
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,713
No disrespect, Sam,
but... it's not my religion.

144
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,514
Come on, Booth.

145
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,912
- <i>(Booth)</i> Voodoo? Who's gonna believe that?
- <i>(Bones)</i> It's a religion, no crazier than...

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,468
- Well, what are you?
- Catholic.

147
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,438
They believe in the same saints you do,
and prayer.

148
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,318
What they call spells, you call miracles.

149
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,075
- We don't make zombies.
- Jesus rose from the dead after three days.

150
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,515
- <i>(phone rings)</i>
- Brennan.

151
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,114
Jesus is not a zombie.

152
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,078
All right? Man, I shouldn't
have to tell you that.

153
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,439
On John Doe 361 there's a narrowing
of the disc space on L2 and L3.

154
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,110
- Congenital?
- Unclear.

155
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,398
Extensive injuries consistent with
a body being thrown around by a flood.

156
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,268
Cross-reference what you know
with the records of missing Katrina victims.

157
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,318
Hey, Brennan.
Why haven't you come home?

158
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,391
<i>Pretty soon, Ange.</i>

159
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,278
- Is Booth there socially?
- Of course not.

160
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,749
- What's going on?
- Bones has amnesia.

161
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,150
A man put a spell on her to stop her
solving the murder of John Doe 361.

162
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,631
- That's a huge supposition.
- That's fine if you don't want to tell me.

163
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,830
Ha. Voodoo amnesia.

164
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,753
- It's a good one. Mm-hm.
- Hm. Yeah. It's great.

165
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,230
Brennars fighting zombies in New Orleans
and we're stuck here.

166
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,115
- Whoa. What's that smell?
- I imagine everything smells in here.

167
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,679
Whoa.

168
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,919
Please just tell me that that car
survived Katrina. <i>(whistles)</i>

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,073
- We used it to evacuate.
- Did you restore it or did you use voodoo?

170
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,593
Ah. <i>(laughs)</i>

171
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,910
An unbeliever.

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,154
- What can I do for you?
- Do you, uh... do you know what that is?

173
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,437
<i>(Benoit)</i> This is a dark spell, forbidden magic.
Very strong.

174
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,117
This is Secte Rouge.
I certainly wouldn't make anything like this.

175
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,228
- But you have the ingredients here?
- The individual ingredients aren't malignant.

176
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,916
It is how they are combined and what they
are used for that makes a spell good or bad.

177
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,197
- Do you recognise me?
- No. Should I?

178
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,189
- Anyone else work here?
- My daughter. Eva.

179
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,238
- What is this about?
- We're conducting an investigation.

180
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,232
Eva!
What kind of investigation?

181
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,153
Is this the only place
a person can buy black gum root?

182
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,835
Yes. Most places like this are all gone now.

183
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,588
It's not a coincidence.

184
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,557
Yes, Daddy?

185
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,518
Have you ever seen this lady before?

186
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,319
- No. Why?
- We need to know who's bought this lately.

187
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,994
Don't they need a warrant?

188
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,153
Eva will pull up what you need
on the computer. Eva.

189
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,800
What you said - what did you mean,
"a coincidence"?

190
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,032
Most places like this,
where a houngan, a priest,

191
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,352
can get what he needs...
they are all gone now.

192
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,150
- Because of the hurricane and flood.
- Which occurred through a lack of balance.

193
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,439
Mr Benoit, are you suggesting that Secte
Rouge somehow conjured up a hurricane?

194
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,034
Secte Rouge voodoo
is more powerful than ours.

195
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,112
No, Eva, not more powerful.

196
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,036
Destruction is easier than harmony,
but not more powerful.

197
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,918
There are a lot of misunderstandings
about voodoo.

198
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,472
Yeah, that whole zombie stuff
puts a crimp in your public relations, I bet.

199
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,237
These are the people who have bought
black gum root in the past month.

200
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,788
Graham Leger, the medical examiner.

201
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,439
- <i>(Booth)</i> I tried to get in touch with him.
- <i>(Bones)</i> He was scheduled to be in the field.

202
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,393
Graham.

203
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,950
- It's Temperance!
- What if he's not here?

204
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,473
He's probably asleep.
He's been working nights. Graham!

205
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,198
- Graham?
- Cracker.

206
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,559
Hey, that's not funny. I think he invited me to
dinner that night, or drinks. I can't remember.

207
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,359
You know what? Maybe he roofied you.

208
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,116
I'm sure he bought the black gum root
to look into its medicinal qualities.

209
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,475
Because we all know how effective that is.

210
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,714
Voodoo healing is quite effective,
no crazier than acupuncture or exorcism.

211
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,429
Hey, hey. Easy on the Catholics, OK?
Just easy.

212
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,556
Bones.

213
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,990
Here we go again.

214
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,877
Bones!

215
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,390
You OK?

216
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,075
<i>(Bones)</i> Something bad happened here, and...

217
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,151
I got away.

218
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,910
Oh, yeah. Something bad.

219
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,873
<i>(police sirens)</i>

220
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,437
- What exactly were you doing here?
- It's Graham, isn't it?

221
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,239
Tell you what. I'm going to ask the questions.

222
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,392
- Come on. She was working with the guy.
- How closely?

223
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,314
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Answer my question, <i>please</i>.

224
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,190
What brought you here? Was it a social call?
Business? Revenge killing?

225
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,114
Leger bought black gum root from
the voodoo store. We stopped by to ask why.

226
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,953
- Why?
- That's what we came here to ask.

227
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,919
Want to look behind me and remind
yourselves why I'm a little low on humour?

228
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,434
- That wasrt ajoke.
- She's not wisecracking.

229
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,670
She just tends to be a bit literal.

230
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,513
The day before yesterday
I showed a voodoo expert a mojo

231
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,478
that Graham found lodged
in the mouth of John Doe 361.

232
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,792
This voodoo consultation,
did it occur before or after amnesia?

233
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,077
- The amnesia's real.
- Graham purchased a rare ingredient

234
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,230
at a voodoo shop on Pontchartrain Ave.

235
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,356
So Graham made voodoo spells,

236
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,955
shoved them into corpses' mouths
and acted surprised when he found them?

237
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,189
What's that?

238
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,874
Split cast, huh? More voodoo.

239
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,520
Just like the symbol on the wall.

240
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,954
- Bag it as evidence.
- Secte Rouge?

241
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,838
- What do you know about Secte Rouge?
- We're gonna go.

242
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,869
I'm gonna tear this place apart. If I find one
piece of evidence that ties you to the scene,

243
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,916
I will take you into custody.

244
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,278
Do you really think someone could go into a
trance, commit a murder, and not remember?

245
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,035
No, I don't. But I sure as hell
think someone can fake amnesia.

246
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,872
Great. Thank you, Detective.

247
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,951
These are what you and Graham
worked on the day before yesterday.

248
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,353
James, meet Agent Seeley Booth.
Dr Embry is Graham's second in command.

249
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,672
- Condolences on your sudden promotion.
- Um... um...

250
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,991
Why do you think the job had
anything to do with Graham being killed?

251
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,117
Bones has voodoo amnesia,
Leger is voodoo dead,

252
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,636
and the last thing they worked on
was a voodoo ritual murder,

253
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,678
so I'm thinking there might be
some kind of a connection.

254
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,751
Leger's body...

255
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,150
- Is it as bad as they say?
- How bad are they saying it is?

256
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,073
No matter how bad they're saying it is,
it's worse.

257
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,118
I just want to mentally prepare myself.

258
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,839
I start his autopsy in a few minutes.

259
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,514
The file I need is John Doe 361.

260
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,195
According to records, these are
the only cases you worked on that day.

261
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,910
Four sets of remains. Two were easy IDs -
drown victims, processed for burial.

262
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,470
The other two were both males -
John Does 349 and 350.

263
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,313
I sent 361's x-rays to the Jeffersonian.

264
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,112
I'll check again.

265
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,029
- Can I make a lifestyle suggestion?
- Go ahead.

266
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,032
You know, "vacation",
it's from the Latin <i>vacatio</i>.

267
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,271
It means "freedom". You might
want to consider that next time.

268
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,558
- Learning Latin?
- This is the opposite of vacation.

269
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,837
No wonder you snapped,
went insane and totally lost your mind.

270
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,993
- Oh, thanks for your understanding.
- Dr Brennan, there's no John Doe 361.

271
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,674
Then whose x-rays did I send to DC?

272
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,751
No, I mean the file is gone.

273
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,715
<i>(chants)</i>

274
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,638
- OK. Hold that.
- Got it.

275
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,679
- <i>Zack Addy.</i>
- It's me. Anything else on John Doe 361?

276
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,958
Yes, Dr Brennan. We found some damage
to the pubic bone - some kind of strike marks.

277
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,511
- Did Angela reconstruct the pattern?
- <i>(Angela) Yeah, hi, sweetie. I'm here.</i>

278
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,195
I tried to make a digital positive,
but it didn't work.

279
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,191
- Why?
- Voodoo, probably.

280
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,432
<i>The extrapolation protocols can't resolve</i>
<i>the gradient fluxes in the bone shadings.</i>

281
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,875
- What's that?
- Mumbo jumbo. Scientific voodoo.

282
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,315
- Can you do it manually?
- <i>Off an x-ray?</i>

283
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,472
- Mm, not really.
- Can't you send the actual remains?

284
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,835
- They don't exist.
- <i>That makes no sense.</i>

285
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,354
- Voodoo. It's probably voodoo.
- Voodoo?

286
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,228
- OK, quit saying "voodoo".
- Yeah, because, you know, it's not a factor.

287
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,955
OK, let me know what you find. Bye.

288
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,510
How do we know this is not the guy
shoving mojo bags into dead people?

289
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,592
Those spells are the work of a sorcerer.

290
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,638
Priests, houngans, can make healing mojos,
but I won't.

291
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,199
But snake shaking is fine?

292
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,955
The snake pulls the evil out of the soul,
freeing the spirit, the loa.

293
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,636
I must do what small things I can. The floods
washed away too much of what was good.

294
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,314
Bones, how about
while you're a murder suspect,

295
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,996
you act more like a normal woman
and less like Lily Munster, OK?

296
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,550
Bye-bye. Good snake. Bye-bye.

297
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,677
Call me crazy,
but I'm suspicious of snake man.

298
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,320
You've been inculcated
by the mainstream culture's

299
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,599
prevailing Judeo-Christian tradition into
instinctive scepticism of alternative mores.

300
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,672
Yeah. Thanks for that explanation.

301
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,076
- I've been over every inch of these x-rays.
- Me too.

302
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,914
There's evidence of particles on the bones,
but no way of knowing what they are.

303
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,310
- Probably dirt.
- Yes, thank you, Zack.

304
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,994
But "dirt" is a meaningless word.

305
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,199
- You can't see air on an x-ray.
- What?

306
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,477
I never said you could.
I'm not even talking about air.

307
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,076
You can see a space where air might be,
like a cavity, but not the air itself.

308
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,075
What I'm saying is that yes, there are flecks
on the x-ray that might be dirt,

309
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,435
but that doesn't tell us anything.

310
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,036
Is it sandy? Silty? Humusy? Is it clay?
Is it more organic than mineral?

311
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,875
Is it soil? Is it pulverised gravel? What
minerals are in it? Are they crystalline?

312
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,636
These are all details a person cannot get off
an x-ray, no matter how long he stares at it.

313
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,713
Sometimes a person should look for things
that aren't there instead of things that are.

314
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,791
You mean me? In dirt?

315
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,348
No. Me, on the x-ray.

316
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,513
I've been looking for anomalies which exist
instead of anomalies which don't.

317
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,071
Zack, if you are ever going to
successfully mimic being human,

318
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,553
you have to stop making everything about
you and feign interest in the other guy.

319
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,110
- Zack!
- I've noticed that you try to look taller.

320
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,077
- When?
- Around Dr Brennan.

321
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,993
- I do not.
- And Angela.

322
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,275
Because they're both taller than you.

323
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,273
You know what? I take it back.
Don't take any interest in the other guy.

324
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,351
Thank you for your help.

325
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,157
<i>(Booth)</i> So do you remember anything else
that could help us out?

326
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,355
- It could have been me.
- You remember that?

327
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,271
Look at it objectively.

328
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,117
Graham Leger was killed between
11pm Tuesday and 3am Wednesday.

329
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,992
Not only do I not have an alibi, I...
I can't even explain to myself where I was.

330
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,754
It could have been me.

331
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,479
- No, it couldn't.
- Yes... How do you know?

332
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,597
I'd bet my professional career on it.

333
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,478
- I already did.
- What? What did you do?

334
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,792
Bones, stop! This is the last time
and place that you want to be rational.

335
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,555
Let's be wildly emotional and assume
you didn't murder a co-worker

336
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,313
who invited you over for dinner.

337
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,588
- What's that?
- What?

338
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,636
That.

339
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,474
Ew!

340
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,790
It's another voodoo dumpling?

341
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,998
It's some kind of flesh...
and these are sea shells.

342
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,071
And leather, I think.

343
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,517
- Is that a human tooth?
- Yes. A canine.

344
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,711
- Put down your weapon.
- Put down yours. There's no threat from us.

345
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,315
- You're holding a gun on me.
- My finger is not on the trigger.

346
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,871
It's the best I can do under the circumstances.

347
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,556
Holster your weapons. I'm here to arrest
Dr Brennan for the murder of Graham Leger.

348
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,710
- That's not gonna happen.
- It is.

349
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,920
- I told you, Booth.
- Please! Just once in your life be quiet!

350
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,551
That's good advice as everything you say can
and will be held against you in a court of law.

351
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,108
- What is that?
- I... I found it on my pillow.

352
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,475
Bones! <i>(sighs)</i>

353
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,109
- Thank you, Dr Brennan.
- What's the probable cause?

354
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,069
Traces of Dr Brennars blood in Leger's
home, Leger's blood on her clothing.

355
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,152
- Is that it?
- All I'm prepared to share.

356
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,799
- Now, please, step away from my collar.
- I'm afraid I can't let that happen.

357
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,431
- Bones! Jeez!
- It's better if nobody else dies.

358
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,750
You know what? I wasrt planning on dying.

359
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,310
Agh! It's not you I worry about. Ow!

360
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,870
You're welcome to the room. It's paid for.

361
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,078
Were you sleeping with Graham Leger?

362
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,549
I don't... I don't think so.

363
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,551
You don't think so?

364
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,351
I don't remember doing so, and at the clinic
they said there was no sign of sexual activity.

365
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,319
- I hope you've kept your mouth shut.
- Temperance Brennan, Caroline Julian.

366
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,551
She's your lawyer.
She's from the US Attorney's office.

367
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,315
You found a prosecutor to defend her?
Interesting tactic.

368
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,834
I've told Detective Harding everything I know.

369
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,469
- You didn't tell me she's a fool.
- She's a forensic anthropologist.

370
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,632
I have three degrees,
I've pioneered research...

371
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,396
- What's that?
- A grigri bag. I found it in my hotel room.

372
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,600
I assume the person who left it is trying to
frame me, so the tooth is probably Graham's.

373
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,434
Three degrees and still a fool.
This interview is over, Rose.

374
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,433
I need to speak with my client alone
before she gives herself a lethal injection.

375
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,829
Of course. Of course.

376
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,434
It's nice seeing you again, Caroline.

377
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,433
- What the hell were you talking to her for?
- I was just trying to help.

378
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,435
Sew those lips together, because there is no
such thing as helping the New Orleans police.

379
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,557
They just want to close the case
as quickly as they can.

380
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,997
- You are making it Christmas time for them.
- There's no way that Bones killed Leger.

381
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,154
- It's just not her. Look at her!
- I am doing you a favour taking this case.

382
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,677
But as the lady cop says,
I'm a prosecutor, and as it stands now,

383
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,513
I could try this case in my PJs
and still get a conviction.

384
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,149
Shouldrt you get to know your clients
before you make snap judgements?

385
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,392
- Bones!
- Fine. Stop me when I get something wrong.

386
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,553
"Trained in three types of martial arts,
two assault charges."

387
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,108
"Registered marksman with the NRA."

388
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,078
- "Hunting licences in four states."
- You hunt?

389
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,196
- Only for food.
- "Shot an unarmed man."

390
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,078
He was trying to set me on fire.

391
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,754
Just arrange bail for us
so we can get out of here.

392
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,912
Sure, sure.
Don't wanna get this one mad at me.

393
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,157
You couldn't keep your mouth shut,
could you?

394
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,711
- I can identify this guy.
- Angela isn't that much taller than me.

395
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,998
Spina bifida. He had a shunt
from his brain stem down to his heart.

396
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,355
It was removed more than a decade ago.

397
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,637
- We both like Brussels sprouts.
- You don't like Brussels sprouts.

398
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,280
A man can change, Zack.

399
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,834
<i>(Potter)</i> A human tooth?

400
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:14,517
Yeah. Some kind of flesh, some fabric.
It looked like some kind of shell.

401
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,990
Yeah, sounds like... to make you forget.

402
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,799
Somebody doesn't want you
to know what happened.

403
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,997
- Booth, I'm not under a spell.
- Well, you forgot a whole day.

404
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:30,394
The spirits don't need you to believe in them,
Dr Brennan. They believe in you.

405
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,074
See you back at work, huh?

406
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,070
How did I get away?

407
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,440
Graham got killed, I got away.
How did I do that?

408
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,398
Bones, all those things
that Caroline mentioned,

409
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,632
the martial arts, the shooting, the assaults.

410
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,871
You're the type of woman that fights.
Maybe they didn't expect it.

411
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,235
Maybe they thought magic could hold you.

412
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,675
- I don't believe in magic.
- Exactly.

413
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,276
You're a surprising woman.
Sometimes that's enough for getting away.

414
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,235
Why are you nice to me?

415
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,194
- Because they think they get away with it.
- What?

416
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,478
They burn their victim, blow 'em up, toss 'em
in the ocean, bury them in the desert.

417
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,269
They throw 'em into wood chippers.
Sometimes years go by.

418
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,875
They relax and start living their lives
like they did nothing wrong.

419
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,316
Like they didn't spend somebody else's life
to get what they got.

420
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,676
They think they're safe from retribution, but...

421
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,515
You make those bastards unsafe.
That's why I'm nice to you.

422
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,591
I couldn't do that without you, Booth.

423
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,389
Yeah. So you should be
a little nicer to me, huh?

424
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,797
I really should.

425
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,475
I walk in on something?
Beignet and a café, <i>chérie.</i>

426
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,677
- <i>(man)</i> Yes, ma'am.
- Hospital records.

427
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,389
- The tox screen was negative.
- What? That's impossible.

428
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,392
- No Rohypnol or ketamine?
- Nothing but a touch of alcohol.

429
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,835
Not enough to affect a baby.

430
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,151
Ajury is never gonna believe
this amnesia story.

431
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,959
- But it's true.
- Maybe this is true too.

432
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,953
Leger tried to rape you.
He was a notorious horn dog.

433
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,077
We claim self-defence, cop a plea,
you're out in three years.

434
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,914
I don't care what it looks like or how
you read the evidence. She didn't do it.

435
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,278
Could be that's true, Seeley.
You vouch for her, that's good enough for me.

436
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,351
But, <i>chérie,</i> this looks bad.

437
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,671
All you've got on your side
is proof you got roughed up.

438
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,912
These pictures from the clinic, these x-rays.

439
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,835
My wrist. The doctor was wrong.
He said this was a Colles' fracture from a fall.

440
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,559
This break shows surface trauma on the bone.

441
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,315
This was either defensive or someone
slammed my wrist into something.

442
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,358
Maybe cos you tried
to stab him in the heart with a knife?

443
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,709
No, if I'd already stabbed the attacker,
he wouldn't have been able to break my wrist.

444
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,758
- I like this story. What else?
- There's the mojo bag.

445
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,638
- Someone tried to put a spell on her.
- Booth!

446
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,474
I can work with that. This is New Orleans.
And where is my beignet?

447
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,996
- Brennan.
- John Doe 361 is named Rene Mouton.

448
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,308
<i>How can you be sure?</i>

449
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,437
I looked for something that wasrt there -
a shunt channel.

450
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,511
<i>- Good work.</i>
- You understood that?

451
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,398
<i>All Zack had to do</i>
<i>was cross-check with DMORT.</i>

452
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,630
I only thought of it because of Hodgins.

453
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,871
I can discern particulates on the x-ray,
but don't know what they are.

454
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,269
- Some kind of dirt?
- OK, everybody,

455
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,035
the word "dirt" means nothing
here in the lab, scientifically.

456
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,839
Any progress on the design
in the pelvic bone?

457
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,673
<i>(Angela)</i> I've tried
three different computer programs.

458
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,232
I fed in the information into multiple impact
scenarios, but this won't work on x-rays.

459
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,393
- I need the actual remains.
- <i>Booth and I are looking for them.</i>

460
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,472
Or better, you could forget
the whole thing and come home.

461
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,357
Don't worry. I made bail.

462
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,031
Bail?

463
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,917
Bail? For what?

464
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,231
I told you, don't worry.
The murder charge won't stick.

465
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,914
Whoa! Murder charge?!

466
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,472
Brennan. The next plane. The next plane
or I'm coming down there to get you myself.

467
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,872
Everything's fine.
I'm healing up satisfactorily. Bye for now.

468
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,599
<i>(Hodgins)</i> Healing up?

469
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,596
You know what? This whole state of affairs
where Brennan runs around fighting crime,

470
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,433
it's stupid, it's nuts.

471
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,829
Don't you agree?

472
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,798
Go, go. I'll be fine.

473
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,678
Brennan will be fine, Angela. She got bail
and the murder charge won't stick.

474
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,116
- What is going on with her?
- Angela.

475
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,158
- She started to change the day she met you.
- What?

476
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,713
Well, she sees how you do it.
All fun and involvement and pizzazz.

477
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,156
Big, you know. A big life.

478
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,473
Booth came along and gave her the
opportunity, but she got the idea from you.

479
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,950
Brennan wants a big life, like yours.

480
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,589
That's how it looks to me anyway, but what
do I know? I'm a bug guy. Bug and slime.

481
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,671
And, you know... dirt.

482
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,551
- Yeah.
- So...

483
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,231
OK.

484
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,390
According to bureau files, Rene Mouton
headed a small voodoo church.

485
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,948
By all accounts, he was a very good man.

486
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,272
He rescued scores of people during Katrina,
then he just disappeared.

487
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,238
Some thought he was just swept away
when the levee broke.

488
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,949
- Why would anyone murder him?
- Chaos during the evacuation.

489
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:46,160
- It could even have been for a bottle of water.
- Or... because he was a priest.

490
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,153
The grigri bags,
the murder of Dr Leger, your amnesia.

491
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,949
This is the work of a bokor,
a Secte Rouge sorcerer.

492
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,828
Rene Mouton was a houngan,
a powerful and well-Ioved priest.

493
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,038
For Secte Rouge to claim his soul, it'd give
them influence on the people he influenced.

494
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,476
- Like a chain letter?
- Or somebody who wanted his shoes.

495
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,551
- No, Booth, it makes sense.
- What does?

496
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,871
- Graham and I were on the trail of a broker.
- Bokor.

497
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,679
And he found out. Or Secte Rouge did.

498
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,038
Great. Then we just toss the ring
into the molten river and blah, blah, right?

499
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:23,035
In the meantime, somebody here had
the ability to hide Moutors body and files.

500
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,588
- James Embry? Mike Doyle?
- Me?

501
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,434
Say you wanted to hide a body and didn't
want it found, where would you put it?

502
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,795
If I wanted to hide a body,
I'd change the name tag on the coffin.

503
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,476
- Not Mouton. Too young.
- He's buried and the evidence is gone.

504
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:45,192
Female. I find it hard to believe that
horny little Mike Doyle is a voodoo sorcerer.

505
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,918
Whoa!

506
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,629
- Me too.
- Speak of the devil. It's Mike Doyle.

507
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,109
And he's not alone.

508
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,158
- You said to avoid the police.
- Not cooperating is one thing.

509
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,835
Concealing a double homicide? We might
as well give them an excuse to hang us.

510
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,388
Dr Embry says that
you can identify the bag of bones.

511
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,473
The skeletal remains belong to a man
named Rene Mouton. His skull is missing.

512
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,757
Looks like Doyle was drugged,
a spike driven through his head,

513
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,559
during or immediately after
sexual intercourse.

514
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,033
It appears that Dr Brennan, Dr Embry
and Sam Potter could have pulled this off.

515
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,353
Sam Potter brought us to the body.
We called you in. Who does that leave?

516
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,035
There's no security in this place.
Anyone could have gotten in here.

517
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,636
You said Mike was having sex when he died.
He must have been killed by the coffin girl.

518
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,948
- What?
- What's her name?

519
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,112
- I never got her name.
- Is there a mojo in Doyle's mouth?

520
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,318
- I don't feel comfortable releasing...
- She's a sorcerer. She works for Secte Rouge.

521
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,109
Detective Harding, I know this,
you know, sounds superstitious, but...

522
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,873
Three murders
and a world-renowned anthropologist

523
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,430
who can't remember how she ended up
smeared with the blood of a skinned man

524
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,638
crucified to a wall with spikes?
Call me superstitious.

525
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,392
Excuse me.

526
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,669
May I scatter fwan ginea over Mr Mouton?
To purify his remains?

527
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,797
No more voodoo crap!
I don't want you contaminating the body.

528
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,792
- What is it?
- Ashes from a ritual fire pit.

529
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,270
Ashes from a dove's feather.
Salt mixed with holy water.

530
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,990
- OK, we get the idea.
- It should have no effect on the bones.

531
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,271
Fine. Fine, go ahead.

532
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,237
<i>(chants)</i>

533
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,954
- <i>(Booth)</i> Whoa! Did you see that?
- <i>(Bones)</i> Very interesting phenomenon.

534
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,555
The electrostatic charge of the particles
reacted with the bone.

535
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:48,031
Angela was unable to recreate that pattern
from the x-rays using top technology.

536
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,671
Electrostatic my ass. That was part
of an emblem of a 1959 Caddy... Oh, boy!

537
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,036
- What?!
- The voodoo shop guy owns a 1959 Cadillac.

538
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,997
He's got a voodoo daughter.

539
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,279
- You're taking my Caddy?
- We have reason to believe

540
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,397
that your Caddy was used
in the wrongful death of Rene Mouton.

541
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,677
You think someone did a hit and run
on Rene Mouton in my Caddy?

542
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,990
- Yes.
- Does your daughter have a boyfriend?

543
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,230
Yeah.

544
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,311
This him?

545
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,069
- Mike Doyle. Yeah. Why?
- We need to speak to...

546
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,072
I mean Detective Harding
needs to speak to your daughter.

547
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,553
- I don't know where she is.
- She's a suspect in the murder of Mike Doyle.

548
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,030
- Why would Eva kill her boyfriend?
- It's hard to explain.

549
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,795
She was involved in a hit and run.
When the body surfaced at the morgue,

550
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,156
she asked her boyfriend to help hide it.
He refused so she killed him.

551
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,516
- Also, she's a member of Secte Rouge.
- No. No.

552
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,709
I bet there are drugs in the shop
that could knock me out, make me forget.

553
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,755
Eva is downstairs praying.

554
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,879
Eva.

555
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,951
Eva, open the door.

556
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,512
No... No!

557
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,750
Eva! Eva!

558
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,230
Oh, no! No!

559
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,311
Booth.

560
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,678
- <i>(Booth)</i> Could that be Moutors skull?
- Yes.

561
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,073
And this could be the spike that she used
on Mouton and Mike Doyle.

562
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,553
This is the lair of a bokor,
someone who can call the dark spirits.

563
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,075
This is used for ritual animal sacrifice.

564
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,709
It's heated to red hot
to cauterise the wound so it wouldn't bleed.

565
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,394
She killed herself
because she knew we were coming?

566
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,598
- No. No, not my Eva.
- She drove the spike through her sternum?

567
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,911
Sternum, heart, through the chest cavity,
through the spine.

568
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,195
- Can I open this?
- Why?

569
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,271
This holds the soul of Mr Rene Mouton.

570
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,272
- I believe this holds the soul of the bokor.
- Shut up!

571
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,557
I'd like to release Mr Moutors soul
so no other bokor can use it.

572
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,714
- No. It's evidence. Don't touch it.
- I raised my Eva to be a houngan, a healer.

573
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,634
- How could this happen under my nose?
- Rebellious adolescent?

574
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,349
Do you remember how much of the spike
was protruding through her back?

575
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,953
Six, eight inches?

576
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,635
Would the fact the spike was red hot
cause it to go through the body easier?

577
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,439
No. It might even make it harder.

578
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,478
- Eva Benoit did not commit suicide.
- Based on what?

579
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,120
This room isn't even 12 feet wide.

580
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,636
Even if she ran at full speed
and her aim was perfect,

581
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:52,034
no way the spike would go through her spine,
unless she was pushed onto it.

582
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,876
He is the sorcerer.

583
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,509
He believes he can bring her back to life.

584
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,510
OK, everyone just simmer down, OK?

585
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,910
You say he murdered his daughter
so he could bring her back to life?

586
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,150
Then you stop looking
for Moutors murderer.

587
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,949
An inch or two to the left or right,
we would never have known it was murder.

588
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,477
It would have been hard pushing her onto
the spike, especially if she were resisting.

589
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,552
You'd have some wounds of your own.

590
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,349
There's your killer.

591
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,908
- I'd really like to go home now.
- Yeah, me too.

592
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,037
My advice, cuff Mr Wizard here
before he puts a spell on you.

593
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,678
No written confession?

594
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,797
Threaten to release his daughter's soul
and he'll confess.

595
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,476
Dr Temperance Brennan, you leave here,
you go home, it does not matter.

596
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:47,669
There are powers. Dark powers,
to whom distance makes no difference.

597
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,352
- Easy, buddy.
- <i>(chants)</i>

598
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,873
Hey!

599
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,197
I've noticed that very few people are scary
once they've been poked in the eye.

600
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,192
I got in the middle of a battle
between two religious sects.

601
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,274
Benoit used Hurricane Katrina as a diversion
to take the soul of a voodoo priest.

602
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,875
- And he killed his own daughter?
- Dark sorcerers suck, man.

603
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,269
Oh, but he intended to bring her back to life.

604
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,477
There's not really any such thing
as spells and magic.

605
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,711
What? He put a forgetting hex on Dr Brennan.

606
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,679
It wasrt the spell that made me forget.
It was the drugs - Rohypnol.

607
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,638
- Blood test didn't find any.
- Gamma hydroxybutyrate?

608
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,676
- Not a trace.
- Sodium pentothal?

609
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,115
- Nope.
- Severe emotional trauma?

610
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,033
Honey, even I think
you're too strong-minded for that.

611
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,908
There were too many delays in my blood test.
That, plus the adrenaline,

612
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,070
the drugs were out of my system.

613
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,720
They put the voodoo on you, baby.

614
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,273
- I didn't really mean to call you "baby".
- You guys, stop. Now. I mean it.

615
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,036
Do you believe in voodoo? Even if a small
part of you believes in it, then it has a grip.

616
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,839
- I do not believe.
- Maybe just a little?

617
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,353
- No.
- If you have any doubts,

618
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,877
we'll get Benoit to send you back one of those
little satanic mojo pouches from prison.

619
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:18,877
Objects have no intrinsic power. A persors
future does not depend on some thing.

620
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,080
Things are just things. They do not have
magical meaning or powers.

621
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,112
- Where did you get that?
- What does it matter?

622
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,873
It's just a thing, right?

623
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,512
- My mother's earring.
- No magical power over your future.

624
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,155
Does that prove something?

625
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,111
Yeah.

626
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,630
It proves something.
