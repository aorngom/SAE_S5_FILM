1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,600
Oxford University, England

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,800
In closing my lecture on interstitial
lammellae remodeling,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,100
I'd like to address some issues that are not
strictly confinedto forensic anthropology.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,500
If it's all right with my host,
Dr. Wexler.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,700
I should think that all
but the most joyless wonks--

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,700
and yes, I do refer to you,
Cyril Bibby--

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,100
would embrace a diversion
from haversian systems.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,100
My partner, FBI Special Agent
Seeley Booth,

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,400
gave his lecture
at Scotland Yard last night.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
Agent Booth, could you please
stand up?

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,400
Hey, Booth!

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,800
Yeah, I'm here. What's up?

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,400
Agent Booth is
the intuitive humanist,

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,700
while I am
the logical empiricist,

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:48,400
although recently I have seen how
destructive pure logic can be.

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,500
My own assistant,

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
the most brilliant young man
I've ever met...

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,800
...ended up a sidekick to a 
annibalistic serial killer.

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,900
I-I haven't invited you
to join me, Booth,

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,000
so you could take your seat.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What I've learned
from Agent Booth

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,900
is that we scientists must arm ourselves
with something other than pure logic.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,800
A quality which deflects us from an
irrational enamoration for the rational.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
Exactly.

25
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,400
How old is that guy?

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
What, Ian?

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,900
He's a year younger
than I am,

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,400
and almost as brilliant.

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,700
What do you think of my speech?

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,100
Yeah, it got, you know,
better toward the end.

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,200
You mean,
after you interrupted me?

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,900
I'm sorry. Look.

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,600
It wasn't that
I was bored.

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,900
Mostly, it was just
that I was tired, okay?

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,700
The boobies took me out
for a beer last night.

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,900
"Bobbies."
They're called "bobbies."

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm pretty sure that Sarah,
Pauline and Jacqueline are,

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,000
you know, boobies.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Dr. Brennan!
Dr. Brennan!

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,300
What a wonderful lecture.
Fantastic, sublime, great.

41
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,500
Thank you, Dr. Wexler.

42
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,400
Who knew such a shapeless robe
could be so evocative?

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,500
Of academia, I mean,
of course.

44
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,100
Just one moment with my
colleague, please, Agent Booth.

45
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,200
Over the last few days, I have been
warned many times to watch out for you.

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,600
Warned?

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,100
That sounds dangerous.

48
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,900
Is it something along the lines of,
"Oh, look out for Ian Wexler.

49
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,000
He's a young genius
on the rise"?

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,400
How can you flirt with me
while ignoring your phone?

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,100
Well, I am a man of perspective.

52
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,300
Besides, I find if one ignores
the thing long enough,

53
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,800
generally, it stops ringing.

54
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,300
And then later,
at my leisure,

55
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,800
it will tell me
what it wanted.

56
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,000
Dr. Ian Wexler.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
Oh, don't leave.
This is nothing.

58
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,800
Murder? What kind
of murder?

59
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,600
Well, is it a boring one
or is it a violent one?

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,000
Is your interest piqued?

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,300
Are you being serious?

62
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,300
I'm going to pass you over
to a colleague of mine.

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,600
I'd simply like you to state
the origin of this call.

64
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,400
Thank you.

65
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,000
Scotland Yard?
Homicide.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,400
Cheers.

67
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Well, would you like
to tag along? It is murder.

68
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,200
Can't promise anything,

69
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,500
but it is possible
a famous heiress is involved.

70
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,600
I'm keen as ketchup.

71
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,300
Mustard. Keen as mustard.

72
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,900
Excellent effort
at the colloquialism, though.

73
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,400
Very impressive.

74
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,100
Does your cowboy
want to tag along?

75
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,400
Oh, please, don't
call him that.

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,500
He'd find it insulting?

77
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,600
No.

78
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,000
He'd love it.

79
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,500
Stand back,
please.

80
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,600
Inspector Kate Pritchard

81
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,400
of Scotland Yard,
I'd like you to meet...

82
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,300
Ah, Agent Booth!

83
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,100
Yes.
Hello.

84
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,400
I very much enjoyed
your presentation last night.

85
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,300
He's very active.

86
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,900
Sound effects, visual aids,
all sorts of props.

87
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,000
Although he complained at
great length about he had to check

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Well, you know, without a gun,
I'm practically naked.

89
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,200
Isn't that right, Bones?

90
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,300
Inspector Pritchard,
meet Dr. Brennan.

91
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,800
Charming.

92
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,100
She's exactly like me.

93
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,000
Charming, tenacious, salacious,

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
sophomoric, euphoric,

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,800
noble, ignoble,

96
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,300
fatuous, horrid, morbid,

97
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,700
torpid and tedious.

98
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,400
Flattery will get you
absolutely nowhere, Kate.

99
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,500
So you found
Portia Frampton?

100
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,900
Well, the way
we usually work, Ian,

101
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,600
is I drag the bodies
out of the Thames,

102
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,100
and you use your extraordinary
capabilities to identify them.

103
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Bones, they're like the
English version of me and you.

104
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,300
But ??? might be her?

105
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,500
Well, this certainly
is her car.

106
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,000
Portia Frampton, she's an
American, as is her father.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Do you know him?

108
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,000
Not all Americans
know each other, Kate.

109
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There are quite
a lot of them.

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Roger Frampton: airlines,Internet ventures,
luxury construction.

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,400
Full disclosure, Kate:

112
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,700
I'm currently analyzing
one of his construction sites.

113
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,700
Frampton wishes
to build skyscrapers

114
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,500
over what may prove to be
a Bronze Age treasure trove

115
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,100
or maybe just a rubbish tip.

116
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,700
Well, they aren't
mutually exclusive.

117
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,300
Exactly.

118
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,500
This vehicle's number plate
matches Miss Frampton's.

119
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,100
Obviously, this vehicle
entered the Thames

120
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,100
at some distance upstream
before coming to ground here.

121
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,600
What do you think,
Dr. Brennan,

122
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,300
female or transvestite?

123
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,400
Female.

124
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,700
Late teens, early 20s.

125
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,000
Penetrating trauma
to the parietal bone.

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,700
Someone hit her on the head

127
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,200
with a sharp object.

128
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,300
You have to do that
as well, do you?

129
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,600
Translate for them?

130
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you have
to deal with that, too?

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Is it murder?

132
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,100
Yes.
Yes.

133
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,300
If this is
Portia Frampton,

134
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,800
then her father will no doubt
demand FBI involvement.

135
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,400
Why?

136
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
They're American.

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,800
Well, you won't have any real jurisdiction,
you understand.

138
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,400
Well, not beyond what
I grant you out of courtesy.

139
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,900
Well, that whole
"no jurisdiction" thing--

140
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,100
that really doesn't fly
in the FBI.

141
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Just tell him he can have a gun.

142
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,000
But he can't.

143
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,300
Well, as they say
in America,

144
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,700
"Hasta la vista, baby."

145
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Agent Booth, I will, I will do
my utmost to get you a gun.

146
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,300
In that case--

147
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,300
excuse me--

148
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,900
Bones and I are the best crime-solving
team in America.

149
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,100
Well, we're in England.

150
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,400
Let's all just try
and pull together, shall we?

151
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,100
One nice little happy
transnational unit of inquiry.

152
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,900
Well, we should have these remains
sent back to the Jeffersonian

153
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,300
and parts of vehicle
that may contain trace evidence.

154
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,200
How do you feel
about that, Dr. Wexler?

155
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,500
Oh, I'm looking forward to completely
surrendering myself to Dr. Brennan.

156
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,700
You heard her: Back to the
Jeffersonian, all of it.

157
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,000
Put it in the overhead.

158

bones 第?季第1集</font>

161
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,600
Brennan sent
all this evidence from England?

162
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,200
Not just evidence,
but actual human remains.

163
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,700
The Brits used
dental records--

164
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,200
no jokes, please--
to identify the daughter

165
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,000
of a wealthy ex-pat.
Typical American billionaire.

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,300
He thinks we can do it better.

167
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,700
Because we can do it better.

168
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,700
X rays for you, Clark.

169
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,500
Thank you.

170
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,200
I'll take the body.

171
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,300
See if there's any soft tissue
worth looking at.

172
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,200
And these crime scene photos
are mine.

173
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,300
Check it out.

174
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,000
British slime.

175
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,700
So much more proper than
American slime.

176
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,800
Some kind of paper. I'll see
if there's anything on it.

177
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,200
Okay, as usual,

178
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll need
constant progress reports.

179
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,000
Angela.

180
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,400
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

181
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,400
Grayson...

182
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,700
Angela.

183
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,900
That's the last bit of sugar
you're ever gonna get from me.

184
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,900
I want my divorce.

185
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,600
Portia Frampton, only daughter
of Roger Frampton, 47,

186
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
formerly of Ringwood,
New Jersey; and Sarah Frampton,

187
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,000
nee Burroughs, deceased 1994
of Cheltenham, England.

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
God, you wouldn't believe
what my hotel gave me

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,500
It was like this brown goo,
and some kind of meat.

190
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,800
I think it was a sausage
about the size of my finger.

191
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,100
I had an entire buffet.

192
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,900
Well, you're staying at the Duke
of something, all right?

193
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,800
I'm at the Beefeater
Hotel Motel.

194
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,700
You ate
in a beefeater.

195
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,900
That's brave.

196
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,300
Yeah, brave is right.

197
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,000
It's the weakest coffee
I've ever had.

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,500
Booth, that's tea.

199
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,400
Two weeks ago, Miss Frampton
was last seen

200
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,700
the morning after
her 21st birthday party.

201
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,000
It's quite a coincidence that Dr. Wexler
is working for the victim's father.

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,900
Well, not working for him,
actually.

203
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,400
Working for the city.

204
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,500
But I shall check my diary
to see if I killed her.

205
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,900
Portia's party broke up
around 2:00 a.m.

206
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,300
and she was reported missing
the following afternoon.

207
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,200
Mm, the question is why?

208
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,400
She was probably
reported missing

209
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,200
because nobody could find her.

210
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,600
Ian...

211
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,400
I suspect the reason

212
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,000
why nobody could find her was
because Portia was in a car on the bottom

213
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,500
Just a theory,
mind you.

214
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,000
Right. It's a great theory.

215
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,700
Can you hold onto that
for one second? Thanks.

216
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,000
Me and Dr. Brennan will go
talk to the family.

217
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,200
Together?

218
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,400
That's what we do.
That's what we do.

219
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,100
You and a inspector.

220
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,400
That's extraordinary.

221
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,300
Sweet.

222
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,000
Portia Frampton was struck
from behind.

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,700
Trauma to the zygomata suggests
that she fell to the ground

224
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,900
and then was struck again
at least two more times.

225
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,400
Weapon?

226
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,300
The Brits weren't able to
recover all the skull fragments

227
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,000
so it's nearly
impossible to tell.

228
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,900
Excuse me.

229
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,400
I'd like you
to meet my husband.

230
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,200
My soon-to-be ex-husband.

231
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,700
We must talk.

232
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,900
This is Birimbau?

233
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,700
I prefer my real name:
Grayson Barasa.

234
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,200
Very nice to meet
you all.

235
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,100
Listen, uh,

236
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,500
I realize
that Grayson is

237
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,400
very lovely.

238
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,600
He certainly is.

239
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,300
Thank you.

240
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,400
He's a big dude.

241
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,200
But until Grayson hands over
signed divorce papers,

242
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,900
I don't really need Hodgins
seeing everybody

243
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,600
gawking at him like
he's some kind of god.

244
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,400
Yeah, but he is some kind
of god.

245
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
The best kind.

246
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,000
Cam...

247
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,100
a little help here.

248
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah.

249
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,500
Oh, my God.

250
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,400
Poor Hodgins. Wow.

251
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,100
Look at that guy. He's just...

252
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
Look at him!

253
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,300
I'm sorry. 

254
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,500
Hodgins?

255
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,600
Hey, Angie.

256
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,700
This is Grayson Barasa...
Birimbau.

257
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,800
Please tell me you are here to
sign the divorce papers.

258
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,800
I can't do that.

259
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
I am still in love with Angela.

260
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,300
Of course you are.

261
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,100
I understand, but Angela
is in love with me.

262
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,300
I told you, Grayson.

263
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,100
Angela,

264
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,100
do you remember
the night we met?

265
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,100
Vaguely.

266
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,700
Ah, the waves were
phosphorescent,

267
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,400
like the world
was upside down

268
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,900
and we were swimming naked
through the Milky Way.

269
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,500
Bioluminescent phytoplankton.
Nothing mystic.

270
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,100
We talked about how
the universe speaks to us.

271
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,700
And when our lips met...

272
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,700
I apologize.

273
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,700
Hm? No worries.

274
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,400
Our lips meet all the time.

275
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,500
Bells.

276
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,300
What?
No, Hodgins.

277
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,900
Literally,
bells started ringing.

278
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,100
It was nothing cosmic.

279
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
Every bell
on the island rang out.

280
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,000
It was during
the Shark Festival of Bells.

281
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,700
What did you expect to happen?

282
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,200
A 21-gun salute?

283
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,100
so-so-so... what
about the divorce papers?

284
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,300
You need time to talk.

285
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
Yuck it up, laughing boy.

286
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Wait until one of your
ex-girlfriends comes to visit.

287
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,700
Yeah.

288
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,400
Back to work.

289
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,300
Yeah.

290
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,500
One of the reasons we moved away
from the States was to get away

291
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Now look what happened.

292
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,500
All right, Mr. Frampton,
look, we're very sorry for the loss

293
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,300
Was it a robbery?

294
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,000
We don't know yet.

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
I'm gonna need
a list of your enemies.

296
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,000
What enemies?
Well,

297
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,600
you're a very aggressive
American businessman

298
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,700
living here in England;
you must have enemies.

299
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,600
My daughter was a very sweet,
innocentgirl.

300
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,400
Not always...

301
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,900
Mr. Frampton.

302
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,000
What the hell are you
asking for anyway?

303
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So you can put that picture
away, Dr. Brennan.

304
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,400
Miss Miller, how close were you
to the stepdaughter?

305
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,100
Heather and I are not married yet.

306
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,900
Portia was like a
younger sister to me.

307
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,900
We talked about everything:
clothes, school, Harry...

308
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,200
Who's-who's Harry?
Lord Henry

309
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,800
Albert Bonham.

310
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,000
Right. Is that some kind
of a crusty old politician or something?

311
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,100
Lord Bonham is a very
un-crusty young man,

312
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,800
heir to the Duke
of Innesford.

313
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,400
Right. Harry, Henry,
Bonham, whatever.

314
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,300
I read the tabloids.

315
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,200
There was no mention of Portia
dating any kind of royalty.

316
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,500
The duke
wanted it kept a secret.

317
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,200
The duke would be
the lord's father.

318
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,900
I got it, Bones.
I understand, okay?

319
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,300
I'm just trying to help. I... All right,
so the duke says something,

320
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,200
and all of a sudden,
magically, it happens.

321
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Welcome to England.

322
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
A murderer is a murderer,

323
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,600
no matter how close
he is to the throne.

324
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,300
Please, help me find out
who did this

325
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,800
Why did you rent this?

326
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,000
I didn't rent this, okay?

327
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,600
They screwed up
at the rent-a-car place.

328
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,700
I ordered an Aston--
you know, James Bond?--

329
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,600
but they gave me...
Yeah, they gave you an Austin.

330
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,700
It could happen
to anyone. Um...

331
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,200
we drive on the left here,
as you may recall.

332
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,100
Driving here requires
a different skill set--

333
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,600
I could take the wheel, if you like
-- I'm an excellent driver.

334
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,700
Thank you, Rain Man.

335
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,000
No, I'm fine.

336
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,300
Tell you what, back home,
we'd drag the whole Royal Family

337
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,200
into interrogation,
separately, let 'em stew,

338
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,900
catch 'em in a lie.
We could do that,

339
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,900
if you like, but it'll
give them time to close up.

340
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,200
Do stay
to the left here, please.

341
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Close up?

342
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,300
Tighten ranks.

343
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,500
Nothing is as impenetrable as the
aristocracy freezing out hoi polloi

344
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,300
I must say, I'm rather
looking forward to two Americans

345
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,500
Oh, the light is red.

346
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,700
It's okay. I'm turning right.

347
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,500
No, no, turning right on a red here
is the equivalent of turning left

348
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,300
on a red at home.
That makes no sense.

349
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,800
No, the point is it's against
the law to turn on a red!

350
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,000
Brake! Brake!
Whoa!

351
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,500
Brake!

352
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,500
Get out of the way, wanker!

353
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,200
Okay, I think we should wait here
until the traffic thins out.

354
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,800
God, I hate London!

355
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,500
I hate England!

356
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,300
I'm glad we had a revolution!

357
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Brennan.

358
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,900
And the weather--
it changes, it's cloudy...

359
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,600
The fatty acid composition
of the victim's cervical fluid

360
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,500
caught my attention,
so I ran some more tests.

361
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,700
Turns out Portia Frampton
was pregnant.

362
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,200
Pregnant? How far along?

363
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,800
And coffee!

364
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,000
What is so hard about making
a cup of black coffee...

365
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,300
About two months.

366
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,000
Okay. Thanks, Kim.

367
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,400
God...

368
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,300
Okay, I feel much better.
What'd I miss?

369
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,500
Lord Henry Bonham,
heir to the Duke of Innesford,

370
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,900
knocked up the victim.

371
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,800
Right. The Royals hate bastards.

372
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,200
Only the ones that
don't make king.

373
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Hang on, girls.
Let me get out

374
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,500
nice castle

375
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,600
castle ???

376
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,400
This... is more properly
called a "palace."

377
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,900
Bones, a little help
getting out, Bones?

378
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,800
Geez, oh...

379
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,300
God.

380
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,800
Geez. Heads up.

381
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,200
Getting out of this thing
is like being born.

382
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,200
Ooh. That the duke?

383
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,500
It's his
gentleman's gentleman.

384
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
It's a butler.

385
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,600
How you doing
there, sport?

386
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,300
Right. FBI.

387
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,300
You might as well put
this one away; it's worthless.

388
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,500
And yet here I am.

389
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,200
You mind waiting outside?
Why?

390
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,200
It's because Agent Booth
not only wants

391
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
he wants them upside down.

392
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,300
He'll annoy them,
you mean.

393
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's say the duke and duchess
won't be used to your approach.

394
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,700
Word of advice: when
they start commenting

395
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,000
on you to each other,
you've got them on the run.

396
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,200
Right.

397
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,100
I noticed in the crime scene
photos that the backseats of

398
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,500
which started me thinking that maybe
the victim was transporting something,

399
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,500
So Brennan had strips of material sent
from the vehicle,

400
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,000
ST-90 transmission oil,
made with poly-alpha-olefin,

401
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,600
leaded, acidic H2O residue,

402
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,200
and plenty of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons.

403
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,900
Don't make her ask.
Thank you, Angela.

404
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,200
A motorcycle was transported
in the back of the SUV.

405
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,800
More likely a scooter,
given the size.

406
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,800
The killer kills, loads
the body and his scooter.

407
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,600
Or moped.

408
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
Drives to the Thames...

409
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,400
Dumps the car, body and all, in the
river, and rides his scooter home.

410
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,700
Through the teeming streets
of London.

411
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,600
So you're an honest-
to-God real butler?

412
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
My family has served His Grace's family
for eight generations.

413
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,100
Yeah, well, a real butler
would offer to take my hat.

414
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,900
A real gentleman
would be wearing a hat.

415
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,500
Whoa, look at this guy.

416
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Uh, yes, sir.

417
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,400
It dates to...

418
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,800
please don't touch that,
Agent Booth.

419
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,500
Late 1490s
or early 1500s.

420
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,300
German design?

421
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,500
His Grace's ancestors fought
for Henry VIII in France.

422
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,700
Oh, geez,
look at the size of this.

423
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,100
That's one large cup--

424
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,800
probably to scare
the sissy French.

425
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,300
Actually, Henry VIII started
the trend of large codpieces

426
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,100
because he had syphilis

427
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,800
so his penis was extremely
sensitive to anything

428
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,000
His Grace favors the
"intimidate the enemy" version,

429
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,600
should the topic arise.

430
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,100
His Grace, Her Ladyship,
and Lord Henry will meet you

431
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,800
Two weeks and I'd heard nothing
from Portia.

432
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,200
I knew it'd turn out
to be something terrible.

433
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,100
You kept your relationship
with Portia Frampton a secret.

434
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,500
It didn't mean I didn't love her.
Well,

435
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,900
where we come from,
that's exactly what it means.

436
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,500
in this American has the right
to pose these questions?

437
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,100
Tell you what, you call Scotland Yard
and the answer is always

438
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,100
So, Portia ever
come to visit this, uh, palace?

439
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,800
This house? No.

440
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,600
Why? I mean,

441
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,800
you were in love with her.
Right, lord?

442
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,300
Well, it's my understanding
that the class system

443
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,700
though very much relaxed since
the Second World War,

444
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,500
still exists at the highest levels
of society.

445
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
That's you, right?

446
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,200
One prefers not to make
such an assertion.

447
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,300
How long did yo and Portia Frampton
carry on a sexual relationship?

448
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,200
Did I ever say I was sleeping with her?
Of course

449
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,800
you had sex with her, Harry,

450
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,600
and I'm sure
she rather enjoyed it.

451
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,400
You're a well-formed,
athletic boy.

452
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,300
Did you offer refreshments?

453
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,300
I had no intention of encouraging them
to stay longer, Mother.

454
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,500
Tea, please.

455
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,400
Harry kept his relationship
with the Frampton girl secret

456
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,800
because her father
is a rapacious crook

457
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,700
who uses intimidation and
bribery to get what he wants.

458
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,200
So...

459
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,200
it had nothing
to do with this?

460
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,100
They brought that wretched rag
into the house.

461
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,400
I was there.

462
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,000
It was the afternoon
before Portia's birthday party.

463
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,200
So you saw the photographer?

464
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,300
Of course not.

465
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,700
I'd have thrashed him.

466
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,800
The lord was going
to go all medieval.

467
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,600
Portia's party
was lovely.

468
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,100
She left before I awoke
the next morning.

469
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,400
That's the last time I saw her.

470
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,900
But you did hear from her.
Right, because, uh,

471
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,900
cell phone records indicate
that you talked that morning.

472
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,900
It was a very personal conversation.

473
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,700
Did you discuss her pregnancy?

474
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,400
I got it.

475
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,600
I'll tell you what:
there was an argument.

476
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,800
Portia wanted to keep
the baby; you didn't.

477
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
I-I assure you

478
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,500
I had absolutely no idea that...

479
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,300
Could he possibly be suggesting that
pregnancy is a motive for murder?

480
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,000
Nonsense.

481
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,300
Arrangements
would have been made.

482
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,000
Right, and you're positive
that you're the father?

483
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,400
Harry.
Look at that.

484
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,400
I'm being intimidated
by royalty.

485
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,200
If you must know,
Portia broke up with me.

486
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,000
She said there was
to be no discussion.

487
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,300
Ah! There you go:
motive for murder, no matter

488
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,200
what country we're in, hmm?

489
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,900
What is this?

490
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,000
It's Assam black tea--
very strong.

491
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Call it the upper class version
of a cuppa joe.

492
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,300
Cheers.

493
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,700
Hey, I've been looking at those
tabloid photos of the victim.

494
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,400
Now, in a telephoto shot,

495
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,100
most of the frame is blurry.

496
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,500
Only the main subject is in focus.
What is this place

497
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,100
A dungeon?

498
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,900
You see here?

499
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,000
These pixels loo like they've
been altered to appear fuzzy.

500
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,700
So it wasn't really
a telephoto lens?

501
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,600
You light it with
torches, right?

502
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,400
It was a telephoto lens, but it's
been doctored to look as though

503
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,200
When ???

504
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Well, why would
anyone do that?

505
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,400
You see that white sliver?

506
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,100
You mean the white blob?

507
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,100
Yeah, it's a reflection of light,
almost as though the

508
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,400
And... in Portia's eyes,
do you see that?

509
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,700
No.
No.

510
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,700
It's a reflection of a house.

511
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,900
Do you see where I'm going?

512
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,000
No.
No.

513
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,500
Someone took the picture
inside the house.

514
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,200
Right.
With an 80-millimeter lens.

515
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,900
Sweetie...my ex-husband is here
with the divorce papers,

516
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,800
so I'll fill you in
when you get back.

517
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,700
I love the mix of personal and professional
you people seem to manage.

518
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,800
Harry could have taken
the photograph.

519
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,500
Yes, that's certainly
a possibility,

520
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,900
but Harry had no motive
to take the photo.

521
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,500
We're most likely searching
for a disgruntled servant

522
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,900
I apologize
for eating without you,

523
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,800
but, apparently,
to hold the table,

524
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,100
you have to order.

525
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,300
Yeah. I'm not
here for food.

526
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,800
I'm here to get you
to sign the divorce papers.

527
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,200
In my place,
would you do that?

528
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
I'm not in your place.

529
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,100
I've been searching for Angela
for five years.

530
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,700
I know. I know.

531
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,100
Our private investigator
told us everything.

532
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,600
You built Angela a home
with your bare hands

533
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,600
while simultaneously smuggling medicine to
children in Cuba and supporting an orphanage.

534
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,800
You're a saint.
I get it.

535
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,900
If you believe that to be true,
then you should want

536
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,400
I do. And guess what.

537
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,800
It's me.

538
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,900
Why are you better than me?

539
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,500
Obviously, I'm not.

540
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,100
But I do love her more than you.

541
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,500
Oh, you cannot
possibly know that.

542
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,000
And yet, I do.

543
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,800
We are at an impasse.

544
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,300
You have no sense
of dignity.

545
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,400
Yeah. I'd give up
my life for Angela,

546
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,200
so what's a
little dignity?

547
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,600
She kissed me, you know.

548
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,800
On the cheek or...?

549
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,600
What's going on?

550
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,800
Oh, man.

551
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,200
He says you kissed him.

552
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,000
I did.
Whoa.

553
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,600
It was a
good-bye kiss.

554
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,000
There's nothing
you can do.

555
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You must accept...
Hodgins!

556
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,800
Here. Can you
take this, please?

557
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:40,700
Nice, Grayson.

558
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,300
Angela...

559
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,400
We've been working on
identifying the photographer

560
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,000
Well, surely, identifying
her murderer is more important.

561
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,200
These are paparazzi.
They follow people.

562
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
So maybe he saw something.

563
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,800
I don't know,
maybe the actual killer.

564
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,500
The photo was taken from
a bedroom in Portia's home.

565
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,900
You're suggesting the help let
a paparazzo into the house.

566
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,800
Actually, the hel told Inspector
Pritchard that you were

567
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,400
Look. Maybe you want to tell us
why you did it

568
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,000
Roger and I have set five
wedding dates over the years.

569
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,200
And, each time, Portia found a way
to make him postpone.

570
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,700
She had her father wrapped
around her little finger.

571
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,800
So you killed her?

572
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,200
Don't be ridiculous.

573
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:32,600
I... I merely wanted Roger to regard Portia
as a sexually mature adult with her own agenda

574
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,300
instead of as an innocent child.

575
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,100
Sorry I'm late.

576
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
Court went rather
longer than expected.

577
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,700
Heather, I trust
you've said nothing.

578
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,300
Too late.
Too late why?

579
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,700
Your girlfriend sent the
naked picture of your daughter

580
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,300
to the tabloids
so you'd stop thinking

581
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,200
that she was perfect,
and finally get married.

582
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,400
What Americans lack in subtlety,
they make up with clarity.

583
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,600
Roger, I'm so sorry.

584
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,200
Why the hell
would you do that?

585
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,300
Please believe me.
I would never do anything

586
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,600
I simply made
a terrible mistake.

587
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,000
Roger! Oh, Roger!

588
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,500
I trust this
interview is over.

589
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,700
Actually, I just have
one more question.

590
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,100
Who the hell would
want to wear this?

591
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,700
It's so nice to see you relaxing,
enjoying some good

592
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,000
Cheers.
Cheers.

593
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,400
Tell you what.

594
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,900
I'd like to see that open.

595
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Really?

596
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,400
Why?

597
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,000
Luck.

598
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,500
Well, you'd have to be ridiculously lucky
to see something like that,wouldn't you?

599
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,300
That's my point.

600
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,500
Well, you did get a
little lucky today.

601
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,600
Yeah.

602
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,700
That's a Walther PPK.

603
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,700
It's a James Bond gun.

604
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,700
Booth-- Seeley Booth.

605
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,200
No, that's terrible.

606
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,700
Thanks, Pritch.

607
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,900
But, please, um,
just remember, though,

608
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,900
that if you do use it,
I'm the one they'll hang.

609
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,100
Hey, I'm a good shot.

610
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,500
Oh.

611
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,700
Uh-oh,
it's the American squints.

612
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,400
You'll love these people.

613
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,200
Booth-- Seeley Booth.

614
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:18,500
Hey, uh, the paper you sent me turns out to
be a letter to Portia Frampton from her mother.

615
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,100
A keepsake
from her childhood, perhaps?

616
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,300
No, it's dated this year.

617
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,800
What does the letter say?

618
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,900
Uh, the entire body
of the letter is indecipherable.

619
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,600
The date and the salutation
and the signature are clear, though.

620
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,500
Thanks, Ange.

621
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,300
So, Portia Frampton's mother
is still alive?

622
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,400


623
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,400
Visible on the L2 is an area
of radiolucency.

624
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Can't see a damn thing.

625
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Give us a moment, Clark.

626
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
We found a few more bone
fragments today, Dr. Wexler.

627
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Good. How old?

628
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,700
No more than 100 years.

629
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,600
To prevent Frampton from building
his beloved skyscrapers

630
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,800
we need to find something
from the Bronze Age or older.

631
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,600
There is evidence of reabsorption
of the surrounding bone.

632
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,000
Ah, here, yes, I see.

633
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Very interesting.

634
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Cyril, you're
being impertinent.

635
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,800
Please stop speaking.

636
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,900
Well, could the anomalybe a hemangioblastoma?
Okay, off you go.

637
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,500
And don't come back
until you find at least one

638
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,100
Have Cam do
a histology, Clark.

639
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,400
Will do, Dr. Brennan.

640
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,100
So... what now?

641
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,800
Well, I thought quick drink,
back to yours for some sex,

642
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,700
and then out for a late supper.

643
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm inclined to accept.

644
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,400
I'm ever so pleased.

645
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,300
But Booth says
I shouldn't trust you.

646
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,400
And why is that?

647
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,200
Well, he says you like
to rack them up.

648
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,800
Rack them up? How vulgar.

649
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,200
Booth is very good at reading people.
Hmm.

650
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,300
Well, in that case, how about
we start with the supper,

651
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,200
and then let the chips fall
where they may?

652
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,000
That would be
an acceptable compromise.

653
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,300
I checked out the skull fragments
for microscopic traces.

654
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,000
How shiny and pretty--
what is it?

655
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,900
Mother-of-pearl.

656
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,700
Have you talked
to Angela today?

657
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,600
Yes... are you
saying our victim

658
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,100
was attacked by an abalone?
How mad is she?

659
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,700
Mad, mad, mad.

660
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,700
I thought women secretly liked it
when we fought over them.

661
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,900
"Women" is an unacceptable
generalization.

662
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,800
Well, you should look
over your other shoulder.

663
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,600
Bones, I've been driving
since I was 12, okay?

664
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,400
Would it make you less agitated
if I told you that I didn't sleep with

665
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,600
I'm not agitated, okay?

666
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,500
I'm agitated because of driving
this little car,

667
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,800
Look, Dr. Wexler
is just... 

668
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm not agitated because
of you and Dr. Wexler.

669
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,100
Wexler's just
another guy looking

670
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,700
for a one-night stand.
That's it... whoa.

671
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,200
So?
So, he doesn't take it seriously.

672
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,300
Seriously?
What do you mean?

673
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,500
You never laugh
during sex?

674
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,700
Because I do.

675
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,400
Whoa, do you see that lorry?
I see that lorry.

676
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,800
It's a truck, okay?
We're an American, and that is a truck.

677
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,900
I laugh during sex.

678
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,500
It's... just...

679
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,200
it's not that kind
of serious.

680
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,300
Well, I think Dr. Wexler is
serious about having sex with me.

681
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:02,900
Very interested.

682
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,300
Okay, news bulletin for you.

683
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,500
Bones, there's not a guy
in this country

684
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,400
who wouldn't
have sex with you.

685
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Probably half the gay men...
whoa, easy.

686
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,500
Are you being nice
about me or awful about

687
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,700
Wexler is not special;
you are.

688
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,100
Brennan.

689
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,600
Am I interrupting anything?

690
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,800
No, I... I'm just
helping Booth drive.

691
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,200
Ooh, Booth shouldn't
be behind the wheel.

692
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,300
He isn't adaptable.

693
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,900
I'm Mr. Adaptable, okay?

694
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,800
And the mirror is the size
of a thumbnail.

695
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,200
Well, what do you expect when you
rent a car the size of your thumb?

696
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,300
I don't think there's enough
fetal tissue to get a DNA reading, but...

697
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,800
Cam, can we just be quiet until we get
into the flow of traffic here?

698
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,500
You think I'm special?

699
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,900
Of course I think
that you're special, yes.

700
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,300
Thank you.

701
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,700
I will take your romantic advice
under advisement.

702
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,600
Now you're too far to the left.

703
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,200
You're gonna hit the curb!

704
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,900
We're good.

705
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,900
Yeah,
unless we get a flat tire.

706
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
No, we're good.

707
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,700
If I could speak again,

708
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,300
I had better luck
with the tumor.

709
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,700
Our victim suffered
from Von-Hippel Lindau disease.

710
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,200
We got a flat tire.

711
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,400
How did that happen?

712
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Uh, it... there wasn't
any evidence of VHL

713
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,700
in either the mother's medical
records or the autopsy report.

714
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,300
But it's hereditary,
so her father must have it.

715
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,300
Roger Frampton worked
for the NHL?

716
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,200
He... he may have VHL disease.

717
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,400
What if he doesn't have it?

718
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,300
Then Roger Frampton is not
Portia Frampton's biological father.

719
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,100
Oh, God.

720
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,400
Great.

721
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,300
That's just great.
I ???

722
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,900
My wife is not alive.

723
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,700
Your daughter was carrying
a letter from her mother

724
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,700
It was dated
Portia's 21st birthday.

725
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,400
That's impossible.

726
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,800
Tell your lab boys
they got it wrong.

727
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Roger, the lab is,
in fact, correct.

728
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,600
Portia was indeed carrying
a letter from Sarah,

729
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,400
dated her 21st birthday.

730
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,600
Portia and I met
at a caf?

731
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,000
in Knightsbridge,
the day after her party.

732
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,500
I gave her the
letter personally.

733
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,700
I think you'll find
Sarah knew she was dying

734
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,300
and entrusted Mr. Curry
with letters,

735
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,400
which he delivered
on Portia's important birthdays.

736
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,100
How do you know?
Well, it's exactly what I'd have done

737
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,000
if I were dying and leaving
behind a young daughter.

738
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,200
That's all very
touching and all,

739
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,900
but it still makes
Wig-wearing Willy here

740
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,600
the last person
that saw Portia alive.

741
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,100
For God's sake,
now I'm a suspect?

742
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,700
You should've told me, William.

743
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,700
You're not the only person

744
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,800
who engages me
for my discretion, Roger.

745
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,100
What did the letter say?

746
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,800
I'm sure I couldn't
possibly tell you.

747
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,900
Uh, Mr. Frampton,
how is your health?

748
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,300
What the hell has that got
to do with anything?

749
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,400
Any nerve pain,
dizziness, headaches?

750
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,700
No, I'm healthy as an ox.

751
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,300
Are you aware that Portia
is not your biological daughter?

752
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,700
Perhaps I should conduct
the rest of this interview.

753
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,100
Angela...

754
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,100
Here we go.

755
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,200
Angela, men are idiots.

756
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Seriously.

757
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,400
Just to be clear,

758
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,400
are you a man or a boy for the purposes
of this conversation?

759
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,200
When I was ten,

760
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,900
the kid next door
had a turtle party wagon.

761
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:20,000
It's an accessory for the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures.

762
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,800
It's a toy.

763
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,400
No?

764
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,300
Anyway, I loved
that party wagon.

765
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,100
I wanted that
party wagon.

766
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,900
So I climbed the tree
outside his bedroom window.

767
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,700
But the tree had a fungus and his dad
was too cheap to hire an arborist.

768
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,500
So unbeknownst to me,
some of the branches were dead.

769
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,400
Lucky for you,

770
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,200
I enjoy a convoluted story
with my hot beverage.

771
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,600
I'm in the hospital--

772
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,800
broken arm, concussion...

773
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,500
and the kid with the party wagon
comes in.

774
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,000
I confess everything.

775
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You know what he says?

776
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,900
I would've given it to you.

777
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,200
He had a little
gay crush on you.

778
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,300
He did?

779
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,000
Oh, man, that explains a lot.

780
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
But I'm guessing that you have a
different point to the story, like maybe...

781
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,800
I'm the party wagon.

782
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,100
No, you're the gay neighbor boy.

783
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,700
Your love is the party wagon.

784
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,600
Grayson is the tree.

785
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,900
I'm Hodgins.
Think about it.

786
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:23,200
Which brings us back to the point
that all men are idiots.

787
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,400
See how I worked that?

788
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,700
It's because I'm so good.

789
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,600
The treads in the victim's tires
were mostly full of river silt.

790
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,600
But... I did find
a few more materials.

791
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,500
Crushed scleractinian coral.

792
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,700
Possibly from
Australia.

793
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,000
She was killed
in Australia?

794
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,600
It's used as a surface for
private roadways in England.

795
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,800
How does that help us?

796
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,100
Well, it's been illegal to
harvest this stuff for years,

797
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,200
so the roadway in question
is fairly old.

798
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,800
And even when this
stuff was available,

799
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,000
it was incredibly
expensive.

800
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And the organic material?

801
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,900
Deciduous pinnate leaflets,
medium pink petals.

802
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,800
It's a rosa damascena.

803
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,700
An antique rose bush.

804
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,100
Hey, Hodgins...

805
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,200
Yeah. Hey.
Hi, Angela.

806
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,100
Fine, I'll just pass this along
to Booth and Dr. Brennan

807
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,300
You guys go ahead and...

808
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,300
Security cameras, people.

809
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,700
The building's filled
with security cameras.

810
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,700
Can't have you punching
my ex-husbands.

811
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:31,200
Deal. So long as you don't
kiss your ex-husbands

812
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,900
On the lips.

813
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Deal.

814
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,300
Look, it's simple.

815
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,500
My heart isn't
yours to claim.

816
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,400
It's mine to give away.
I get that.

817
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,900
I mean what you're saying,
not your heart.

818
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,700
Well, idiot...

819
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,500
you do get my heart.

820
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,800
Because you're
giving it to me?

821
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,100
At last.

822
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,700
A glimmer of
understanding.

823
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,100
Wow, that is so...

824
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,400
flaky and New Age
and...

825
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,600
Yeah....wonderful.

826
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,000
Okay! Okay!

827
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,200
I get it.

828
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,500
The universe speaks.

829
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,100
I hear.

830
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,100
Guy said he was going to fix
the flat tire.

831
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,600
What's it doing up
on the truck?

832
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,200
Crushed coral
and rose petals.

833
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,300
Hodgins found coral and roses
in Portia Frampton's tires.

834
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,100
Who takes a car with a flat tire
and puts it up on a truck, all right?

835
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,400
You fix it.
That's what you do.

836
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,900
If there was a spare tire,
I'd have fixed it.

837
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,800
Probably you cracked an axle
or something.

838
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,100
Thanks, Cam.
That was very useful.

839
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
All right, great, now I got
to call Agent Pritchard

840
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,800
and I'm gonna have
to ask her for a ride.

841
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,900
You know, England is not good
for my personal dignity,

842
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,700
all because of a f... flat tire.

843
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,300
Wait.

844
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,600
Whoa, whoa, Bones,
don't smell that.

845
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,200
You don't know where that's been.
Yes, I do.

846
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,900
This is crushed coral
and it... smells like roses.

847
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,500
Where did we pick up
crushed coral?

848
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,900
The private road and driveway
at the Bonham Estate.

849
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,500
Portia Frampton drove to the Bonham Estate
just before she died.

850
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,500
And the royals said
she never came to the house.

851
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,000
He ???

852
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,800
You honestly believe the Duke of Innesford
is Portia Frampton's

853
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,400
Both he and his mother
show symptoms of VHL disease.

854
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,700
Well, we're standing
on coral;

855
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,500
those are
rose bushes,

856
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,600
and that is a scooter that could
fit very nicely into the back of an SUV.

857
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
That's great.
Okay, what's taking our backup so long?

858
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,300
I didn't request backup.

859
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,400
Well, great. In that case...

860
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,300
I want a gun.

861
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,100
I'm a very good shot
and I've killed before.

862
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,500
It didn't bother me
as much as I thought.

863
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,700
It bothered you a little.

864
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,200
Yes, but not as much
as I thought.

865
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
If there's gonna be gunplay,
I think I'll wait in the car.

866
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,300
Nonsense, Ian,
there won't be any gunplay.

867
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,600
Why not?
We won't need guns

868
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,100
because we have the letter
from Portia's mother.

869
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,600
We don't know what it says.

870
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,900
Ah, but they don't know that.

871
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,800
Good one, Pritch.

872
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,900
What'd you just call her?

873
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,700
"Pritch," Ian.
He called me,

874
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,800
"Pritch." Short for "Pritchard."

875
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,200
Will you please
put that weapon away.

876
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,700
Fine. It just feels wrong.

877
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,200
I have a letter addressed to Portia
from her mother.

878
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,800
Portia's mother died 14 years ago.

879
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,300
She wrote it on her deathbed.

880
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,700
On her deathbed?

881
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,900
Well, you know
what this means.

882
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,000
Big doings.
Big doings.

883
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,800
I'm going to have
Dr. Brennan

884
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,600
read it out loud.

885
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
What?

886
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:55,900
"My dearest daughter
Portia..."

887
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,700
Did we mention it's dated
Portia Frampton's 21st birthday?

888
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,900
Start at the
beginning, Bones.

889
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,900
"My dearest daughter
Portia..."

890
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,800
Skip to the part
about her father.

891
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,900
Wait. A moment.

892
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,300
Please.

893
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,600
Would you leave us, Harry?

894
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:11,800
Why?

895
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,500
What's happening, Gerard?
Please, trust me.

896
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,700
This is not the way for Harry to
discover certain harsh truths.

897
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,200
Please, Harry.
A little trust.

898
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,500
That must be one hell
of a letter.

899
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,700
You must believe me when I tell you
that I had no idea

900
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,000
before Portia read
the letter to me.

901
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,700
What? You met with Portia
here?

902
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,600
What did it say?

903
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,400
It says that the Duke was
Portia's biological father.

904
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,400
How remarkably unsavory.

905
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,800
Well, you couldn't possibly think
that Gerard

906
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,500
Why not?

907
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,200
Portia asked me
if I were her father.

908
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,200
I admitted that it was more
than possible.

909
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:56,900
Mother-of-pearl.

910
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,500
This is very possibly
the murder weapon.

911
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,800
Isn't this the part
where we call for legal counsel?

912
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,500
I did not kill
Portia Frampton, Mother.

913
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,100
Thank you
for your faith.

914
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,300
I believe I'm going to have to
request you to accompany me

915
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,400
Your Grace.

916
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,700
They request?

917
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,100
It's a polite country.

918
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,400
That will not
be necessary.

919
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,800
It was I.

920
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,600
Jamison!

921
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
The butler?

922
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,200
You ordered your butler
to kill Portia Frampton?

923
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,400
The duke had absolutely nothing
to do with it.

924
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,200
If Jamison confesses,

925
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Harry need never know
that Portia was his sister.

926
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,700
We'll provide you with
the finest representation.

927
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,400
Thank you, ma'am.

928
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:44,800
Come on,

929
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,200
you mean to tell me that neither
one of you get the weirdness

930
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,700
All right, the butler did it.

931
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,800
It was the butler!

932
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,500
Inspector Pritchard will
be hours in the interrogation room

933
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,600
but the fact is we'll never
really know for certain.

934
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,800
You mean he might just
be protecting the duke?

935
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,300
It's utterly conceivable, yes.

936
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,900
Well, I thought I might try
and entice you back

937
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,400
You know I do have a gun
in England,

938
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,700
and I really have been dying
to use it.

939
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,400
I'll handle this.

940
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,700
You know, it's a
James Bond gun.

941
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,800
It's a Walther PPK,
by the way.

942
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,700
Ian, I think you're
a lot of fun.

943
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,100
Oh, hell's bells and buckets.

944
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,600
I think I know
where this is going.

945
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,400
It would upset Booth
if I slept with you.

946
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,500
You see, rationally speaking,

947
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,200
if you were to have someone operate
on your brain, for example,

948
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,000
you would want a surgeon
who's done the procedure many hundreds

949
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,400
You know, someone who's absolutely
at the top of their game.

950
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,900
I don't really see why sex
should be any different.

951
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,800
Rationally speaking,
you're absolutely right.

952
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,700
Good. Then, we're settled.

953
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,300
Off we go. Look out
for the bridge
opening.

954
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,900
They say
it's good luck.

955
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,100
That should keep him occupied
for hours.

956
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,900
Common sense says you don't offend
your partner for an hour of fun.

957
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,800
What? One hour?

958
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,000
You underestimate me,
Dr. Brennan.

959
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,500
Oh, this is absolutely
the dregs, isn't it?

960
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,900
I'll call you again
before you leave.

961
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,000
Who knows? You could be in
a more rational frame of mind.

962
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,400
* What is there missing
from me *

963
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,400
* That I see in you? *

964
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,900
* What can I say? *

965
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,500
* What can I do? *

966
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,700
Why are you
looking at me like that?

967
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,600
I'm just here to help you
pick out a guy,

968
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,700
you know.

969
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,300
Never mind.

970
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,500
I'm just here
to bring a little luck.

971
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,800
I don't believe
in luck.

972
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,000
you don't believe in luck?

973
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,900
Okay, well, how do you explain
when good things happen

974
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,300
Define "good things."

975
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,300
You know,
good things.

976
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,400
Money in the bank.

977
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,300
Uh, hey,
Doris Day parking.

978
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,400
What's Doris Day
parking?

979
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,300
A big piece...a big piece of the pie,
that's good luck.

980
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,100
I call that a solipsistic
perceptual response to the random nature

981
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,100
Well, tomato, potato.
Call it what you want.

982
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,200
You know what?
It's still luck.

983
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,800
You are lucky
I understand you

984
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,600
when you say things
that make no sense.

985
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,500
See, you just agreed with me
that is was luck.

986
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,700
You just agreed,
right there.

987
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,100
I did not!

988
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,900
* ...the pictures we took *

989
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,000
* Together in the park... *

990
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,900
* 'Cause everything's
dancing around *

991
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,500
* Just trying to stay
on the ground... *

992
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,800
Clark,

993
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,500
some lunch?

994
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,900
I was told to catalogue all unidentified
remains while Dr. Brennan was away.

995
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,100
And you were told to do this
without eating?

996
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,800
Dr. Brennan was quite adamant
they all be done

997
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,300
Oh, come on,
Clark.

998
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,500
The divorce papers
are signed,

999
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,500
and the wedding
is on again,

1000
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,200
and we were all going
to celebrate.

1001
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,700
Yeah, I'm sure he feels
that your invitation is a polite

1002
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,400
but insincere attempt
not to exclude him.

1003
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,800
Ah, we were just trying to
spread the sunshine here, Clark.

1004
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,700
I just wanted to say
good-bye, Angela.

1005
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,100
I'm off to
the airport.

1006
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,100
Oh, thanks.

1007
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,700
That's nice.

1008
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,300
And thanks
for the divorce.

1009
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,800
I really appreciate it.

1010
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,000
Your happiness is
all that matters to me.

1011
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,900
And if, in a day,or week or a year,
you want me back in your life, I'll be there.

1012
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,500
Right. Well, we've got your number,

1013
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,000
so have a good trip.

1014
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Cherish her.

1015
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,700
Done.

1016
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,500
Isn't this all extremely awkward?

1017
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,700
That's sad.

1018
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,200
It's actually a display
of conflicting emotions.

1019
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,300
What Reich called "the battle
 for orgastic potency," which...

1020
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,600
Maybe later.

1021
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,100
sure.

1022
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,200
Would you like a ride to the airport?

1023
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,300
That would be very kind.

1024
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,500
Well, thanks, Cam.

1025
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,000
sure.

1026
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,700
Honestly, guys,

1027
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,000
I don't have to be included in everything.

1028
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,040
So Wexler still hasn't called you,right?

1029
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,750
Ian is the top forensic
anthropologist in England.

1030
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,750
He's a very busy man,Booth.

1031
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,270
Busy trying to get you into
bed for the past two weeks.

1032
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:05,210
Least he could do is call.

1033
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,230
God,we're gonna need another
cab just for all your stuff.

1034
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,510
I was given lots of presents
by the students at Oxford.

1035
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,770
Oh,no,no,no,no,no,no.
Don't touch that one.

1036
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:14,090
Whoa. Why?

1037
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,200
What is it? Why?

1038
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,780
Because your students
gave you your gifts,

1039
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:21,280
and the cops at Scotland Yard gave me a little
something something for their appreciation.

1040
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:23,390
What is that?

1041
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,970
It's a bobblehead bobby.

1042
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,200
That's all you got?

1043
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,770
It's a real nice one. Look.

1044
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,310
Oh,what is this now, the queen's jewels?

1045
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,800
Well,the bellman will help.

1046
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,220
No,he's better dressed than I've
ever been; he'll get all dirty.

1047
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:35,180
Got to tell you,know what?

1048
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,540
There's no rule saying
you can't call him.

1049
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,070
Although I got to tell you, a guy who doesn't want to talk
to you just because you decide not to have sex with him,

1050
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,200
he can't be that great.

1051
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,020
What,in bed?

1052
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,660
No,great guy. Oh,because

1053
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,200
I think Ian would be great in bed.

1054
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,060
Okay,next. All right.

1055
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,040
Hey,pal,how about a little help?

1056
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,630
I got to get to the airport. Come on.

1057
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,630
I'm sorry they canceled your flight.

1058
00:45:58,650 --> 00:45:59,960
I'm not.

1059
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:00,990
Neither am I.

1060
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,790
I was just trying to be polite.

1061
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,100
You know,it's getting late.

1062
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,290
Let me order you some
breakfast before you go to work.

1063
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,880
<i>Earth-shattering sex and breakfast?</i>

1064
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,920
I can die a happy woman.

1065
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,900
You know,I'm glad to be
heading home,but I think America

1066
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,700
dropped too much of the,uh,
English stuff back in 1776.

1067
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:28,750
Like what?

1068
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,960
Well,you know, like,uh,royalty.

1069
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,880
Meaningless title, no real power.

1070
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,130
What,you never wanted to be a princess

1071
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,270
when you were a kid? No.

1072
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,070
Even now? A castle,a moat,

1073
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,870
knights in shining armor.

1074
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:41,500
You know what?

1075
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,400
I risk my life for the United
States government every day.

1076
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,220
I wonder if I can get Congress to pass

1077
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,470
something like,uh,

1078
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:48,610
knighthood?

1079
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,050
Sir Seeley Booth.

1080
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,580
Just sounds right. Booth.

1081
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,100
I get my worth from my
intelligence and accomplishments,

1082
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,080
from actual achievement.

1083
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:56,480
I don't need a title.

1084
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:57,620
What-what's wrong?

1085
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,050
It's Dr. Wexler.

1086
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:06,290
Remodeling and analysis
of the marrow indicates

1087
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:08,980
the subject lived in or around
the coast of North Carolina.

1088
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,600
We should look at Jamaica.

1089
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,930
No evidence suggests the Caribbean.

1090
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,770
For our wedding.

1091
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:15,330
Right.

1092
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,480
What was I thinking?

1093
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,260
Oh,I was focusing on my work.

1094
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:19,840
You'll be in love one day,too,Clark.

1095
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:23,390
Yes,but today I am alone and
happily dating multiple women

1096
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,100
so I can concentrate on
my work and not get fired.

1097
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,680
I also know this little island
off the coast of Maine...

1098
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:29,720
Of course you do.

1099
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,760
Sorry I'm late.

1100
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:31,440
What'd I miss?

1101
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,080
Uh,we're deciding between Maine
and Jamaica for the wedding.

1102
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,780
Did Angela's ex get off okay?

1103
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:37,000
Whoa,sorry?

1104
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,580
You took him to the airport.

1105
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,280
Oh,off.

1106
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,410
Of-of course.

1107
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,730
Yes,he's off and gone.

1108
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,360
All gone. Great.

1109
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,880
Thank you for doing that.

1110
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,890
Anytime.

1111
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,300
Either Maine or Jamaica,

1112
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,590
you can't really go wrong.

1113
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,660
I should...

1114
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:56,250
Bye.

1115
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,310
Ian said you were the best.

1116
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,180
What happened?

1117
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,540
Why are you giving him
a gun? We're leaving.

1118
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,540
I think Inspector Pritchard
is asking us to stay,Bones.

1119
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,280
You want me to look at some remains?

1120
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,150
Do you think they're Ian's?

1121
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,590
Are you ready for this?

1122
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,620
This is Ian Wexler's flat.

1123
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,900
This is Ian Wexler's bed.

1124
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,440
Markers are consistent
with Ian's build and age.

1125
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:16,080
Of course I'll need access to a
lab to make a definitive conclusion.

1126
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:16,900
I'm sorry,Bones.

1127
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:20,240
And Pritchard, I can only imagine how
difficult this is, losing a partner.

1128
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,380
CID is saying that there appears
to have been a gas explosion.

1129
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:26,870
Right,looks like,uh, he was drinking.

1130
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,600
He did enjoy a glass or two.

1131
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:31,170
Bones,cigarette.

1132
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,770
Did Ian smoke?

1133
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,790
Not that I'm aware of.

1134
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:43,510
Looks as though he put the kettle on,

1135
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,120
and,uh,lit the cigarette.

1136
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,530
Pilot goes out. There's a gas leak,

1137
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,350
and whoosh,place goes up.

1138
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,260
No water in the kettle.

1139
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,720
Water on the boil does tend
to evaporate,Agent Booth.

1140
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,010
Look,we don't suspect foul play.

1141
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:03,110
We just want Dr. Brennan to give
us a definitive identification.

1142
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,740
Water doesn't evaporate
if the stove wasn't lit.

1143
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:12,060
Oh,perhaps even British resolve takes
a knock when one loses one's partner.

1144
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,200
There's evidence of
trauma to the frontal bone.

1145
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,180
That's gonna happen when the
ceiling collapses on you,Bones.

1146
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,860
No,this was before the fire.

1147
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,240
This was not an accident, Inspector.

1148
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:41,980
You wanted to see me?

1149
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,670
Oh,man,that is cool.

1150
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,680
Not why you're here,Dr. Sweets.

1151
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:46,300
Sure.

1152
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,520
But it's amazing that all of our
hopes and desires and fantasies,

1153
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:53,580
pain and pleasure all reside
in three pounds of tissue.

1154
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:54,510
Yeah,great.

1155
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,660
Well,some part of this little devil
made me sleep with Angela's ex.

1156
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,170
You slept with Angela's ex?!

1157
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,330
Shh. A little discretion, please.

1158
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,250
I might say the same to you.

1159
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,670
It just happened. I...

1160
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,790
His flight was canceled; I was parked
at the airport hotel; he checked in,

1161
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:12,370
and I figured I'd see what
all the fuss was about.

1162
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,840
And was there fuss? Yes.

1163
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,060
Well-deserved fuss.

1164
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,060
Why exactly?

1165
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:18,800
You're here as a shrink,

1166
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,400
<i>Dr. Sweets,not as a guest on Loveline.</i>

1167
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,720
Yes. Fine. Sorry.

1168
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,720
Should I tell Angela?
I mean,we're friends,

1169
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,540
and I don't want her to
find out some other way

1170
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,160
'cause then it'll seem
like I'm hiding it.

1171
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,200
Which you'd like to do
because you're feeling guilty.

1172
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,910
Yes. Good. Keep going.

1173
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,740
But he's gone now. Almost.

1174
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,190
Almost? Well,there aren't as many
flights to Fiji as you'd think.

1175
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,190
So it might come up again.

1176
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:39,380
Oh,yes. I'm seeing him again tonight.

1177
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,200
I didn't mean it like that.

1178
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,160
Neither did I.

1179
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:43,970
Right.

1180
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:46,380
Okay,well,uh, it's understandable

1181
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,300
for you to feel some guilt and anxiety,

1182
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:49,670
which,by the way, is centered here.

1183
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,810
Dr. Sweets.

1184
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,210
Right. Um,

1185
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:56,580
you feel you have no right to pleasure because
it comes at the expense of your friends.

1186
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,140
Yes. You're good.

1187
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,720
But he's leaving soon, so I could say
nothing and hope it all goes away. Mm-mm.

1188
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:05,860
But you'd still have to carry that
anxiety every time you saw Angela.

1189
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,660
Angela is open-minded by nature.

1190
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,850
She's happy with Hodgins.

1191
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,580
I think clearing the air
would be good for both of you.

1192
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,230
Right.

1193
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,020
Of course. Thank you.

1194
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:18,180
Yeah. Can I touch the
brain just once,as a reward?

1195
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:20,950
Just once.

1196
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:24,440
Squishy.

1197
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:25,930
Hey.

1198
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,130
I just got off the phone with Brennan.

1199
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:30,060
Her friend Wexler has
been killed in a fire.

1200
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:34,190
Scotland Yard wants her to
help in the investigation.

1201
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,770
They're sending the remains
to Wexler's lab at Oxford.

1202
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:41,020
Brennan's gonna use the video link and the
Web to send us crime scene photos and X-rays,

1203
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:41,870
whatever we need to help.

1204
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,220
I'll tell Hodgins and Clark.

1205
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:43,840
Yeah.

1206
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:45,700
Yeah.

1207
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:53,810
We have not yet confirmed
beyond a shadow of a doubt...

1208
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:59,120
that the... human remains found
in Dr. Ian Wexler's flat...

1209
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,650
But,um, there's always a chance.

1210
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:04,860
You see,in cases like this,the...

1211
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:11,710
My preliminary findings are that the
remains in question are those of Ian Wexler.

1212
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,640
I'm confident that this suspicion
will be confirmed later today.

1213
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,330
Cause of death has not been determined,

1214
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,240
but we have not ruled out foul play.

1215
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,860
Uh,many of you were close,
very close,to Dr. Wexler,

1216
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:27,400
and we'd appreciate any
information you can provide.

1217
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:28,290
Thank you.

1218
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,620
I think we should talk
to Sid and Nancy first.

1219
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,130
A reminder,Agent Booth,there
is a proper chain of command,

1220
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,140
and I'm the lead on this investigation.

1221
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:42,460
Why are you talking to him like that?

1222
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,520
You asked us to stay.

1223
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,860
I feel it's importantto be clear.
You gave him a gun and everything.

1224
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,240
Bones,it's okay.

1225
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,360
Understand,Pritch,

1226
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:52,300
we're just here to
help-- whatever you need.

1227
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:54,310
Thank you.

1228
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,330
We saw Dr. Wexler night before last.

1229
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,220
He seemed fine. He was going out...

1230
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,870
He was going out for a drink.

1231
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:05,320
Frampton was driving him mad.

1232
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:05,910
Why?

1233
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,490
He was trying to shut down the dig.

1234
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,770
So he could build one of
his condo developments on it.

1235
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:11,450
What's to become of the dig now?

1236
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:12,960
The bloody dig can wait,Cyril.

1237
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,870
Dr. Wexler is dead.

1238
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:16,020
Dr. Wexler would want the job finished.

1239
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:16,990
You know it's true.

1240
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,120
Well,we're gonna have to
talk to the two of you again,

1241
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:22,280
after Dr. Brennan confirms
the cause of death.

1242
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,450
Legally,the remains have to stay here,

1243
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,580
but we've uploaded all of the X-rays.

1244
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,620
I'll have casts of the bones made and
ship them to you as they are finished.

1245
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,470
The fire substantially occludes
what we can glean from these images.

1246
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,110
Can you focus on his feet?

1247
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:37,860
Sure.

1248
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:45,740
?????????????Can I have any
direct access to particulates?

1249
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,480
As soon as Inspector Pritchard
gets the okay from Scotland Yard.

1250
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,280
How you doing, sweetie?

1251
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,640
I'm focused on finding
out what happened to Ian.

1252
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,580
The X rays are starting to arrive.

1253
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:59,470
I can see the depression fracture
you mentioned on the frontal bone.

1254
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,950
Looks like it was made by a small
object,like a... ball-peen hammer.

1255
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,870
Was there enough
tissue for a tox screen?

1256
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:07,070
It's being run now. We'll
e-mail you the results.

1257
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,840
What is that on the
top of his left femur?

1258
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:12,760
Some kind of plastic which
may have been in his pocket.

1259
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,360
Send me some high-res photos.

1260
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,160
I'll see if I can speed things along.

1261
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,820
Thanks. Call if you find anything.

1262
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,670
Hey,Brennan,wait.

1263
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,250
Grayson signed the divorce papers,

1264
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:22,960
so the wedding is on again.

1265
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:24,380
Congratulations.

1266
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,730
Oh,is that bad,to congratulate
someone on a divorce?

1267
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,020
Hard to believe it's over, right?

1268
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,000
Yeah,hard to believe.
Well,we'll talk soon.

1269
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:36,810
Dr. Temperance Brennan,
resuming analysis.

1270
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:45,030
The material fused into the anterior ventral
femur appears to be plastic,partially melted.

1271
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,180
Booth.

1272
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,710
I found something.

1273
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:55,670
What is it?

1274
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,800
Where would Ian get a
poker chip marked HGC?

1275
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:04,130
My God.

1276
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:07,870
Two nights ago,Dr. Wexler was
buying drinks for his friends

1277
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:09,840
and playing the tables as if
he hadn't a care in the world.

1278
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,810
Was he with a woman?

1279
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,900
This is a gentlemen's club, Agent Booth.

1280
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,460
I didn't see a stage or pole
or dancers or anything...

1281
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:19,950
No,a-an English gentlemen's club
is for actual English gentlemen.

1282
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:21,990
How did Dr. Wexler strike you?

1283
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:22,790
Flush.

1284
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:23,720
What's that mean?

1285
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,420
I believe you'd say "rolling in dough"?

1286
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:27,610
That's right. He,uh,

1287
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,010
he paid off his tab.
How much did he owe?

1288
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:33,570
We're getting into ticklish
areas of confidentiality now.

1289
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:38,520
This is a gentlemen's club,after all. Scotland
Yard will guarantee the FBI's discretion.

1290
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,040
Isn't that right, Agent Booth?

1291
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,580
Hmm? Yeah,right.

1292
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,140
Over ?,000.

1293
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,390
He paid it off in cash.

1294
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:48,160
Where'd he get that kind of
money? I'm sure I have no idea.

1295
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:49,240
Please.

1296
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:52,670
Look,I,um,took this,

1297
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:54,410
you might say,as a
precaution,even though

1298
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,190
Dr. Wexler told us that he knew the
gentlemen and... everything was fine.

1299
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:02,200
This was taken from the security camera.

1300
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,140
Nice tattoo.

1301
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,390
And the guy with the
tattoo is taking him away.

1302
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,200
Well,if I thought they
were going to kill him,

1303
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,000
then I'd have done something.

1304
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,350
Don't beat yourself up,pal.

1305
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,200
You know,I'm sure you
did the best you could.

1306
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:31,240
Tox screen showed he had quite a night
with his friends Mr. Scotch and Mr. Merlot.

1307
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,720
Blood alcohol level was .18.

1308
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,440
No drugs, recreational or otherwise,

1309
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:38,870
and no evidence of nicotine.

1310
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,980
So what was the cigarette
doing in his hand?

1311
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,340
Put there to justify the
explosion,I would imagine.

1312
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,730
What have you found, Mr. Edison?

1313
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,860
Well,if the casts are accurate,

1314
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:54,550
new bone growth formed a craggy surface on the scapulas
and both the left and right lateral epicondyles.

1315
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:55,190
Meaning?

1316
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,770
The victim had bursitis caused
by strenuous repetitive motion.

1317
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,320
The only time I've seen this
was on an autoy of a sculler.

1318
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,800
What is that,like a fish?

1319
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,000
A sculler is someone who
crews on a rowing team.

1320
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:07,870
I also examined the
fracture to his frontal bone.

1321
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,450
It was the result of a head-butt.

1322
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,450
Ouch. I concur.

1323
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,860
I'll send your findings to Dr. Brennan.

1324
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,530
Thank you.

1325
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,500
What are you working on,Angela?

1326
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:21,830
Uh,blowing up all the photos of the remains for
Clark and Hodgins, trying not to lose quality.

1327
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:22,620
Excellent.

1328
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,010
Oh,one other thing.

1329
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,920
I slept with your
husband-- ex-husband.

1330
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:30,370
What?

1331
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:31,760
Good-bye. Don't leave.

1332
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,970
Mr. Edison, I need a witness.

1333
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:35,480
I'm sure you can find somebody
who's been here longer than h Ie.

1334
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,030
Are you one of us or not?

1335
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,710
Uh,no,I'm not one of us.

1336
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,160
Well,you'll do anyway.

1337
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:45,640
Angela,I slept with him, and
I feel really weird about it.

1338
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:46,820
W-Wait,how?

1339
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,550
D... I mean,when? Oh,God.

1340
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:52,610
Grayson's flight was canceled,
and one thing led to another.

1341
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,010
He's very attractive,

1342
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,420
so... we spent the night together.

1343
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,300
I'm sorry.

1344
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:01,430
It's okay.

1345
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:04,570
Really?

1346
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,150
Yeah,of course.

1347
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:07,160
Why not?

1348
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,140
We're divorced,so...

1349
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:12,240
I mean,I got what I
wanted from him,so...

1350
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,950
...now I guess you did,too.

1351
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:16,070
Well... yeah.

1352
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:19,030
Can I go now,please?

1353
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,040
Angela,I...

1354
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:22,470
You are an amazing person.

1355
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,860
Why are you amazing now?

1356
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:26,960
I slept with Grayson,
and Angela's okay with it.

1357
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,860
Of course. Yeah.

1358
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:29,980
Why should I care?

1359
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:31,990
I'm going to marry you.

1360
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:34,020
Well,I see no holes in your logic.

1361
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,100
And he'll be gone in a day.

1362
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,120
He's... still here?

1363
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,760
Wow,that must have gone well.

1364
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,210
Is that something for me?

1365
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:46,240
it's preliminary results of
particulate and bug analysis.

1366
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,010
Now,I found microphytobenthos algae,

1367
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,260
epipsammic and epipelic diatoms,

1368
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:53,950
<i>as well as a Chironomus
riparius,or midge fly,</i>

1369
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,080
all of which were on the
clothing shreds they sent me.

1370
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:58,470
Well,you're excited, so
it must mean something.

1371
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:05,410
The levels and sediment on the algae indicate that the
victim was near Henley-on-Thames within 24 hours of his death.

1372
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,490
The Henley Royal Regatta
takes place there.

1373
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:09,530
Rowing.

1374
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,600
Why are you doing this with
me and not Inspector Pritchard?

1375
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,690
Come on,Bones,you and
me, we're the real deal.

1376
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:17,740
All right,look,you know,

1377
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,040
she's having a tough time with this.

1378
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:20,740
I would,too,you know,
if you were killed.

1379
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,770
Well,yeah,you're sentimental that way.

1380
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:27,830
Excuse me,the guy at the main boathouse told
me that Dr. Wexler was a teammate of you blokes.

1381
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:28,780
Blokes?

1382
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:31,950
Yeah,you know, I'm
kind of feeling at home.

1383
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,490
FBI. Special Agent Booth.

1384
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:36,800
I have a few questions abo...

1385
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,210
Hey,I'm talking here.

1386
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:40,450
I think you're a bit lost,mate.

1387
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,450
You're looking for America.

1388
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:43,330
Head for the coast, cross the pond,

1389
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,300
and you'll find a bunch of Yanks

1390
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,100
you can ask whatever you want.

1391
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,490
All right. Is that right?

1392
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,440
Excuse me,buddy.

1393
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,490
We're working with Scotland Ya.

1394
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,100
I-I'm Dr. Brennan.

1395
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:55,510
Ian was a friend of mine.

1396
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:57,290
God,the man's got a head like a boulder.

1397
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,620
You're the American bird Wexler
was talking about, aren't you?

1398
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,190
I'm surprised that lady cop of
his isn't looking out for him.

1399
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,350
Yeah,the two of them
seemed... more than colleagues.

1400
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:09,590
Inspector Pritchard and Dr. Wexler had
a sexual relationship? y,listen,love,

1401
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:11,060
Ian isn't exactly the faithful type,

1402
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,420
so if he's promised you something...

1403
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:13,120
He's dead.

1404
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:13,950
He was murdered.

1405
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,820
No. What?

1406
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,030
We had a race this afternoon.

1407
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:19,350
I... thought we'd be seeing him.

1408
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,460
That's a pretty distinctive
tattoo you got there.

1409
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,420
Any chance you were at the
Highgate Club night before last?

1410
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:26,950
Oh,w-whoa,w-wait. You
think we killed Wex?

1411
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,760
Well,you dragged him out
of the club,didn't you?

1412
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,460
This is bollocks.

1413
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:31,710
We had a race.

1414
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,370
If we don't sober Wex up
in time,he's no good to us.

1415
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:37,110
His timing is completely
discombobulated from the alcohol.

1416
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:37,990
So you beat him up?

1417
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,490
No,we dragged him into
a bed in the boathouse

1418
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:42,070
and we poured coffee
into him in the morning.

1419
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,000
His frontal bone was bruised.

1420
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:45,030
His forehead.

1421
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,040
Maybe you gave him a good
crack like you just gave me?

1422
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,340
No,he didn't head-butt Wex.

1423
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:50,680
Tell you
who did--

1424
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,380
a coxswain for the Queen's Light Guards.

1425
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,120
What's his name?

1426
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:55,210
Jasper Ferry.

1427
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,710
Booth,he's not going to talk to you.

1428
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,610
It's a tradition.

1429
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:12,060
I know that,Bones,but I
think I almost got him.

1430
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,760
There's a little sweat coming
off the side of his face.

1431
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:16,920
If you interfere with
one of the queen's guards,

1432
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:19,060
I'm afraid I shall have
to arrest yo Agent Booth.

1433
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,640
Simmer down; I'm not
doing anything wrong here.

1434
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,350
I'm just waiting for Lieutenant
Ferry to go off duty, that's all.

1435
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:25,150
He did not murder Ian.

1436
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,220
How do you know that?

1437
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,740
My colleagues at the Jeffersonian have
discovered some very compelling evidence.

1438
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:33,030
I imagine that you learned that two of
Wexler's teammates  from Henley-on-Thames

1439
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:36,330
abducted him from the club in
order to sober him up before a race.

1440
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,820
Then they told you about his argument

1441
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,050
and subsequent fight with
Lieutenant Jasper Ferry here,

1442
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:42,690
which Wexler lost after
a well-deserved head-butt.

1443
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:44,960
Why is everybody head-butting
everybody around here?

1444
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,650
What's wrong with a
good sock to the jaw?

1445
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:48,660
Well-deserved?
Why well-deserved?

1446
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:52,240
Ian was shagging Lieutenant
Jasper Ferry's sister.

1447
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,530
How did you figure that out?

1448
01:02:55,750 --> 01:03:00,470
A revolutionary technique which consists of asking
a series of questions to a murder victim's friends.

1449
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:06,220
Nonetheless, I am terribly impressed that your scientists
can deduce almost as much from a few particulates.

1450
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:07,820
Almost as much.

1451
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,870
Almost as much?

1452
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,800
Look,I'm sorry about your sister.

1453
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,370
I really have to thank you.

1454
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:18,890
That was excellent advice.

1455
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:19,670
You're welcome.

1456
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,040
It's always best to be honest.

1457
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,020
Good,then I can tell you

1458
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:24,260
it was tough to take
you seriously at first.

1459
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,220
I mean,you don't even
look old enough to drive,

1460
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:29,010
so I thought how could you
possibly have any valid insights?

1461
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:29,700
I have two doctorates...

1462
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,140
I know,but doctorates don't
teach you about sexual matters,

1463
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,450
and being so young, I thou...

1464
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:34,500
I get it,Dr. Saroyan.

1465
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,310
I'm just... Being honest,I know.

1466
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,760
I... I'm just very
grateful to you,Dr. Sweets.

1467
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,760
That's all.

1468
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,730
Dr. Hodgins, Scotland Yard was interested
in those other particulates you had found

1469
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,270
that did not indicate Henley.

1470
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,460
Okay,just... okay.

1471
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,410
Okay,

1472
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:52,400
and Angela,I was wondering when you
might finish enhancing those photos.

1473
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:53,340
Clark needs them.

1474
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,000
You'll have them when they're done.

1475
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,310
What do you think we're doing?

1476
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,380
Shirking our
responsibility or something?

1477
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:03,920
You know,we've been doing an excellent
job around here even before you showed up,

1478
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,330
so regulate yourself,okay?

1479
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,250
I think maybe there are
still a few unresolved issues.

1480
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:19,770
We're still questioning
the female students.

1481
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,950
It seems that they're
all accusing each other,

1482
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:24,990
you know,each one thinking
that they were special to Ian.

1483
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,700
Hmm,is that what you think,too?

1484
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,980
You've been asking
questions of your own,I see.

1485
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:33,130
Apparently,you were
sleeping with Dr. Wexler.

1486
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,510
Don'yot think that was something you,uh,

1487
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,060
should have told us,Inspector?

1488
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:38,290
Oh,please.

1489
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,360
I'm British first,a cop
second, and a woman third.

1490
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:42,630
It's a miracle

1491
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:43,860
it ever came to light.

1492
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:44,910
For how long?

1493
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,350
Irrelevant.

1494
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,110
What you really want to
know is if sharing Ian

1495
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:50,450
with other women made
me want to kill him.

1496
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,160
Did it? All those pretty young students.

1497
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:58,100
The thing that made Ian so very,very
good in bed was all that practice.

1498
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:00,000
Sorry.

1499
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,620
Was that indiscreet?

1500
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:03,730
I thought Americans were
all brash and forthright.

1501
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,080
And here I thought the Brits were
all frustrated sexually and repressed.

1502
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:08,940
Brennan.

1503
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,680
We found something. Are you busy?

1504
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,200
No,no,this is a fine time.

1505
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:13,840
Assuming the casts are accurate,

1506
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:16,410
I've isolated a stab wound that
originates between the sixth

1507
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,030
and seventh thoracic vertebra.

1508
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:20,160
Which would have pierced
the lung and heart.

1509
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:20,970
Most definitely.

1510
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:22,540
That's a very deep wound.

1511
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:25,690
Bones,what is it? Ian
was stabbed to death.

1512
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,190
And the weapon? Don't know.

1513
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,920
Maybe they found something at the scene.

1514
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,580
Nice work,Clark. Thanks.

1515
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,060
Did you find any weapon
at Ian's apartment

1516
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,620
that could have been used to stab him?

1517
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,510
No,and I was there the whole time.

1518
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:43,680
You're doubting me.

1519
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:47,700
Yes.

1520
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:57,360
Inspector Pritchard, I just wanted...

1521
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:59,320
<i>Oh,I am not the jealous sort,</i>

1522
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:00,980
and you're painfully naive if you think

1523
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:04,450
my sex life was limited to
Ian, as I'm sure yours was not.

1524
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:05,980
But I didn't sleep with Ian.

1525
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,190
You didn't?

1526
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,180
No.

1527
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:10,300
Why not? You obviously
fancied each other.

1528
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:13,430
Yes,I noted several physiological
responses to his presence,

1529
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:16,470
which can only be explained
by sexual attraction.

1530
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,330
So why didn't you sleep with
him then? Because of Booth.

1531
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,150
Oh... You know,

1532
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,710
I suspected that you two might
be more than just partners.

1533
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,930
Oh,no,that's incorrect.

1534
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,890
Booth advised me not to sleep with Ia

1535
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:28,330
because Booth didn't want me to
be another notch on Ian's bedpost.

1536
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,660
See,I rather saw it as climbing Everest.

1537
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:31,930
Of course it's been done before,

1538
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:34,450
but the experience
is still breathtaking.

1539
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,410
You have a strong sexual appetite,

1540
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,750
and you're not hamstrung
by social moralizing.

1541
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:42,070
I can empathize with that.

1542
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,000
Thank you.

1543
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:45,340
Well,why didn't you tell us that
you had a relationship with Wexler?

1544
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,420
Because I thought I'd
be taken off the case.

1545
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,600
I mean,if Agent Booth was murdered,

1546
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:53,740
wouldn't you do everything in your powers
to make sure that you found the killer?

1547
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:56,600
Yes. But I don't sleep with Booth.

1548
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,500
Have you withheld any other information?

1549
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:01,380
Why on earth would I do that?

1550
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:03,660
Because you called a
meeting to talk to us,

1551
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,780
and then Clark called to
give us cause of death,

1552
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:07,690
and then we basically
accused you of murder.

1553
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,290
So while Booth went to get our
car,I followed you to your car,

1554
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:15,400
and we began discussing mountain
climbing and sex with Ian and...

1555
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:18,020
Thank you,Dr. Brennan. I
believe I'm up to date now

1556
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:22,760
Oh. You're absolutely right.

1557
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,240
I did forget to give you this.

1558
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:32,810
It's a writ of release on
Frampton's building site.

1559
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:36,310
The site has been certified as having
no historical importance whatsoever.

1560
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:41,220
Signed and dated "Dr. Ian
Wexler" shortly before his death.

1561
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:45,510
This document would be worth
millions of dollars to Frampton.

1562
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:48,190
Well,I suggest that you and
Agent Booth ask Mr. Frampton

1563
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,070
if he forced Ian to sign
that before killing him.

1564
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:51,820
Okay.

1565
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,770
word to the wise,Dr. Brennan.

1566
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:59,050
I'd encourage you not to forego Everest.

1567
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,340
But it's too late.

1568
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,450
Ian's dead.

1569
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:04,550
Oh,yes,of course.

1570
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:07,590
To whom else would I be
referring other than Ian?

1571
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:14,100
<i>FRAMPTON: Me kill Wexler?</i>

1572
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:16,810
According to the papers, the
poor bastard died in a fire.

1573
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:18,220
That wasn't cause of death.

1574
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,290
He was stabbed.

1575
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:22,420
We do know that Dr. Wexler stood
in the way of your latest project.

1576
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,450
He was checking the site
for historical value.

1577
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:26,580
It's the law.

1578
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,080
Nothing stands in your way.

1579
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,220
Everything stands in
my way, Agent Booth.

1580
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,720
Environmental groups,
historical societies.

1581
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:35,950
You know,there's even a
radical preservationist group.

1582
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:39,460
They threatened me because
I want to improve the city.

1583
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:43,310
Saviours of Antiquity.

1584
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,920
I'd like to build a time machine,

1585
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:47,830
take all these lunatics,
and send them back

1586
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,340
where there's no air conditioning or TV,

1587
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:55,010
and they can watch their loved ones die from the
flu and the plague because there's no medicine,

1588
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,850
then see how they
like the good old days.

1589
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:02,460
Right. Um,Dr. Wexler, uh,signed
the writ for you to start building.

1590
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:03,230
Correct?

1591
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:05,720
Of course he did.

1592
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,620
Spent two years rooting
around in the dirt,

1593
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,180
and all he got was dirty.

1594
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,120
We couldn't help but notice how recently

1595
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,130
Dr. Wexler gave his
okay for you to build.

1596
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:15,780
So I guess the only question is:

1597
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,470
how forceful did you
have to get with him?

1598
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,260
I see.

1599
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:28,870
Yeah,so I was so inspired by the
sadistic murder of my daughter

1600
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,240
that I thought that I
would try one myself.

1601
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,340
If the'sreothing further,
I'm gonna get blind drunk.

1602
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:44,050
So I found something very
odd that was on the victim:

1603
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,740
mercury fulminate.

1604
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,340
I thought Cam was going to
be sending us all the results.

1605
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,590
I'm a grown-up. I
don't need a middle man.

1606
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:51,950
Now,with this amount of mercury,

1607
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,980
I'd think he'd been poisoned,but
tox results say otherwise.

1608
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,480
And it didn't come from Henley?

1609
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:57,200
Nope.

1610
01:09:57,220 --> 01:10:00,880
I also found phyllosilicate
minerals and carbonic acid.

1611
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:02,480
But I'm not sure where
they came from either.

1612
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:05,010
Hey,can you have them send me
more samples from the remains

1613
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:07,070
and the locations from
which they came on the body?

1614
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:08,110
Of course.

1615
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:12,400
But Scotland Yard says that all requests
have to come through Dr. Saroyan.

1616
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:13,530
Right.

1617
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:15,970
'Cause nothing could
possibly happen without her.

1618
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,870
Is everything okay,Hodgins?

1619
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,170
Yep. Sure. Fine.

1620
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:22,180
I'll have our all-powerful
leader send the request.

1621
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:28,060
Thank you all for coming.

1622
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:29,780
Cam said we had to.

1623
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,910
Or lose our jobs.

1624
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,180
For insubordination.

1625
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:33,430
Oh,I was kind of hoping

1626
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:37,920
that you all came of your own volition with
an eye toward ameliorating a tense situation.

1627
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:39,680
Can't you just tell
her not to be so bossy?

1628
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:40,870
I'm your boss.

1629
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,260
It's very important to realize that Dr.
Saroyan has done nothing to merit your anger.

1630
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:46,210
Thank you.

1631
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,540
As a boss.

1632
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:50,790
But by sexualizing her
relationship with Mr. Barasa...

1633
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:52,640
Is there no better way to put that?

1634
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,250
Everything else sounds worse.

1635
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:59,750
She's made you both confront unresolved
feelings about Mr. Barasa's impact on your lis

1636
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:01,460
and how he affects your relationship.

1637
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,900
Angela and I love each other
and are getting married.

1638
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:06,470
I know.

1639
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,140
Why did you think I
was questioning that?

1640
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:09,340
Look,Shrinky,

1641
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:11,420
don't go making problems
where there aren't any,okay?

1642
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,150
Although,the next time that you
drive somebody to the airport,

1643
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,000
ju tsthem fly the
hell out of Dodge,okay?

1644
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,520
This all would have been a lot easier

1645
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,850
if I'd kept my mouth shut.

1646
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,500
No,nonsense.

1647
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:22,620
You're all friends.

1648
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:25,600
I'm sure now that you see
the situation for what it is,

1649
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:26,680
you'll know how to move through it.

1650
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:27,730
Am I right?

1651
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,620
I think Dad wants us to apologize.

1652
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:36,300
I apologize for... sleeping with people.

1653
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:42,400
I apologize for snapping at you after basically
giving you permission to sleep with people.

1654
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,780
Oh,God.

1655
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:46,330
So now everything is fine?

1656
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:52,120
That is the result of open and honest
communication with a highly trained mediator.

1657
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:54,360
Fine.

1658
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:59,450
I am sorry for being so cranky,
which is my basic personality,

1659
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:01,180
so it seems stupid to apologize...

1660
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:02,270
Hodgins, would you just...

1661
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:03,490
I apologize.

1662
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:18,050
Dr. Wexler never said one word about giving
Frampton the okay to build condos here.

1663
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:21,080
Well,he signed a writ saying this
place had no historical value.

1664
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:23,650
I'm stunned, I tell you.

1665
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:24,900
The writ must be a forgery.

1666
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,890
After two years,you
hadn't found anything.

1667
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,690
I think that's a reasonable time line.

1668
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,870
This says we have to
vacate the dig in two days.

1669
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,490
But Dr. Wexler felt
certain we were close.

1670
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,350
There was a previous Bronze
Age find about 600 meters south.

1671
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,530
That's his signature,right?

1672
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,570
I don't care; he wouldn't do it.

1673
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,420
Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan.

1674
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:43,390
Yeah? Got these from
our forensic accountant.

1675
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:45,030
Wow,look at that.

1676
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:46,300
These are checks made out to Wexler.

1677
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,160
Ten of them from a shell
company owned by Frampton.

1678
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:54,190
Seems that 25,000 pounds was the going rate
for a piss-broke forensic anthropologist.

1679
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:55,480
That's how he paid off his debts.

1680
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:58,200
Frampton bribed Ian to vacate the dig.

1681
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:06,400
ercury fulminate

1682
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:07,760
the lower extremities,

1683
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:10,010
higher concentration on the patellas,

1684
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:12,560
and the greatest was
where he was stabbed.

1685
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:13,990
So it was on the murder weapon.

1686
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:15,190
Yeah,looks that way.

1687
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:16,840
Any idea what kind of weapon it was?

1688
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:17,980
Not yet.

1689
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:20,700
Whatever punctured the
bone was rough,like a stick.

1690
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:23,770
And I've tried knives,
awls,picks, but nothing matches.

1691
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:26,450
Who would use mercury fulminate?

1692
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:30,970
It's used in neon lights, batteries,
by taxidermists and at tanneries,

1693
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,160
<i>and in the manufacture of explosives.</i>

1694
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,160
Frampton has different companies.

1695
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,870
Maybe one of them
uses mercury fulminate.

1696
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:36,970
Yeah,I'll see what he owns.

1697
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:40,390
Yeah,and I'll look for any instruments found
in those fields that could be used as a weapon.

1698
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,960
Ah,look at that, Bones,huh?

1699
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:49,450
I'm not saying that we should have a king
or a queen or beheadings and all that jazz.

1700
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:52,730
I'm just saying,you know,
calling someone like,uh,

1701
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:55,900
hey,Sir Seeley Booth,
now that is civilized.

1702
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:57,850
What makes you think that
you would be knighted?

1703
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,820
Comen. You're serious,right?

1704
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:00,600
Please.

1705
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:02,700
Well,look at this. You
two seem to be relaxing.

1706
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,590
Yeah,I got to tell you, I'm
getting into it,you know?

1707
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:06,510
My head is feeling a little bit clearer,

1708
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:08,420
as chaotic as the English can be.

1709
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:11,510
So,Pritch,tell me, you think I got
what it takes to be a knight,right?

1710
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,120
That's not your first pint,is it?

1711
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:13,820
No.

1712
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:15,800
Did you bring information on the case?

1713
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:18,090
I ran some checks on
Saviours of Antiquity.

1714
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,810
Last year,they were suspects in
the bombing of a new construction

1715
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:25,180
built on the site of a 13th century church
in Bayswater; burned it to the ground.

1716
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:26,920
Mercury fulminate.

1717
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:27,450
I'm sorry?

1718
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:29,800
Used to manufacture explosives.

1719
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:33,990
The residue would be on the bomb-makers and
could have been transferred to Ian's stab wound.

1720
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:36,750
Well,only two of the members
of the group were charged;

1721
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,520
others were released.

1722
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:39,700
Look who they let go.

1723
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,180
Cyril. Yeah.

1724
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:45,390
Who would be very angry
that Wexler sold out the dig.

1725
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:47,860
<i>CYRIL: I'm telling you,Vera.</i>

1726
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:49,320
There's nothing more to be done there.

1727
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:52,050
It's shut down. A week,maybe ten
days to clean up, and it's over.

1728
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,920
So suddenly, after two years.

1729
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:56,450
Hey,Vera,Dr. Brennan wants
to see you in the lab.

1730
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:57,700
What,not me? No,Cyril.

1731
01:14:57,710 --> 01:15:02,270
Dr. Brennan wants you to tell us about
this. Saviours of Antiquity. Oh,please.

1732
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:04,570
Where were you on the night
that Dr. Ian Wexler died?

1733
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,760
You can't be serious.

1734
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:08,600
Cyril finds out his profr's
on the take, and he kills him.

1735
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,300
I was in Wales, visiting my parents.

1736
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:11,820
Cyril quit the Saviours years ago.

1737
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:13,830
I joined mostly to meet women.

1738
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,170
I'm not a fanatic.

1739
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,630
Call my mum, ask her.

1740
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:20,260
We ate eel; it's my favorite dish.

1741
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,220
You think they ever made a
Frankenstein in this place?

1742
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,250
Frankenstein was the
doctor, not the monster.

1743
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,660
Yeah,'cause the other way around,

1744
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:38,900
that would make no sense.

1745
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:40,850
Bones,I know that look.

1746
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:41,840
Me,too.

1747
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:42,990
Whenever Ian had that look,

1748
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:45,680
it meant that things had
just gotten more complicated.

1749
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:47,600
Clark just got the last of the casts.

1750
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:51,000
And while he was finishing
reconstructing the skeleton,

1751
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,790
he found an extra bone.

1752
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:53,720
Wexler had an extra bone?

1753
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:54,290
No,no,no.

1754
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:58,330
It's a shattered section of a femur
from someone else that the interns here

1755
01:15:58,350 --> 01:15:59,970
didn't identify.

1756
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:03,640
Every piece of bone you have here
was found and catalogued at the scene.

1757
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:04,720
Well,maybe he held onto it.

1758
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,510
You know,bone people
like to hold onto bones.

1759
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,010
I think it's a murder weapon.

1760
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:10,800
Seriously?

1761
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:15,860
The entry point of the stab wound is
between T-6 and T-7,extending approximately

1762
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,580
22 centimeters through
the heart and lungs.

1763
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:21,380
The killer used a bone to stab Ian?

1764
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:24,350
Live by the bone, die
by the bone,it's...

1765
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:25,770
Sorry.

1766
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,420
It occurs to me that if we
find the origin of the bone,

1767
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:30,290
then,well, we find the murderer.

1768
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:31,730
That's where the mercury comes in.

1769
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:35,540
This bone displays very highlevels of m

1770
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:36,620
What does that mean,Bones?

1771
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:38,290
Nothing. That's very useful.

1772
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,680
Well,I'm more interested in
the fact that it's ossified.

1773
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,630
That basically means
that it's turned to stone.

1774
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:44,930
No,no,no, don't you start
explaining things to me now.

1775
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:47,360
Okay,what is the significance of that?

1776
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:50,120
It means it's over 2,000 years old.

1777
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:53,150
I was already working at the top
of my game knowing "ossified."

1778
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:57,010
2,000 years old puts this
bone firmly in the Bronze Age.

1779
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:57,800
The site.

1780
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:00,320
Oh,my God,what... so this bone alone

1781
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:03,810
would have prevented Frampton
from building his skyscrapers. Yes.

1782
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,980
Perhaps the murderer used
it to kill Ian as a...

1783
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:09,480
as a kinymd bolic revenge
for signing the writ.

1784
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:10,940
That makes sense. No,it
doesn't make sense.

1785
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,740
Nobody just kills somebody with a
bone symbolically, not even in England.

1786
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,340
So,what then,Agent Booth?

1787
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:17,800
Well,you have the fire, the cigarette.

1788
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:19,170
It was all set out of panic.

1789
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:21,550
The killer didn't act symbolically.

1790
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,210
He acted out of rage.

1791
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,780
Sweets is actually good at his job.

1792
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:33,790
I know,right?

1793
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,360
I mean,did you understand you
weren't actually mad at Cam?

1794
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:40,570
No,actually,I was mad at her.

1795
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:44,100
I mean,you don't ve sex with someone,
and then expect everything to be fine.

1796
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:47,500
Yeah,not when they're supposed to be gone
and out of our lives; that is not fine.

1797
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:48,980
No,it definitely is not.

1798
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:50,310
Why?

1799
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:51,810
You're divorced.

1800
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:53,710
Why aren't you fine with
Cam sleeping with him?

1801
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,900
Well,for the same reason you aren't
fine with him still being in town.

1802
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:59,440
Buif everything's over with him,what...

1803
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:02,350
why do you care who he sleeps with?

1804
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:05,390
Why do you care that he's still in town?

1805
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,550
I don't care.

1806
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:07,950
Obviously,you do.

1807
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:13,030
If you were 100% certain of me,
you wouldn't care, but you do.

1808
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,500
If you were 100% certain
you didn't want him,

1809
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:18,630
you wouldn't care that
Cam slept with him.

1810
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:26,030
You don't trust me.

1811
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:33,230
<i>Saying that means you don't trust me.</i>

1812
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:36,420
How can two people who
don't trust each get married?

1813
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:38,660
I thought we did trust each other.

1814
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:39,990
Yeah,I did,too.

1815
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,940
Two people who don't trust each
other shouldn't be together at all.

1816
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:47,600
You really think that?

1817
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:49,230
Don't you?

1818
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,220
I mean,yeah,I... I do.

1819
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:54,300
I mean,I actually do think that,but...

1820
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,130
Oh,my God.

1821
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:02,410
Yeah.

1822
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,630
I don't know what happened.

1823
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:07,560
I don't either.

1824
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:12,140
But I know it did happen.

1825
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,810
I'm gonna...

1826
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:17,180
I'm gonna go.

1827
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:22,740
You know,all you had to do was trust me.

1828
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:26,190
Hey... you're the one that's leaving.

1829
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:29,310
You're the one who isn't stopping me.

1830
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,410
Dr. Wexler would have told us
about a find this important.

1831
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:50,920
Yeah,unless he wanted to keep the money.

1832
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,190
Brennan, why are we here?

1833
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,670
This was farmland,a
stable, for over 200 years.

1834
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:59,220
the 18th and 19th centuries. So?

1835
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:06,380
No mercury, but in the 17th century, there was
an inn over there and a tannery right there.

1836
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:08,200
One of the oldest
tanneries in Kensington.

1837
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:09,700
Oh,my God.

1838
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,240
What? That's right.

1839
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:13,590
Mercury fulminate is used in tanning.

1840
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:15,170
The tannery was here for over 100 yea

1841
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,610
Mercury would have seeped into the soil

1842
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,080
and contaminated whatever it touched.

1843
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,510
Why is this area covered?

1844
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:21,480
Vera,you supervised
that part of the dig.

1845
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,300
Nothing was found there.

1846
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,080
Dr. Wexler told us to move on.

1847
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:25,220
Booth,will you help me?

1848
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:25,990
Yeah,I got it.

1849
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:35,750
This soil should be
loose from the excavation.

1850
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:36,600
It's been packed down.

1851
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,690
And covered by wooden pallets.

1852
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,890
Vera,what's going on?

1853
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:41,370
Nothing,I told you.

1854
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:43,500
Dr. Wexler instructed me to move on.

1855
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,130
Another ossified bone chip.

1856
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:47,320
This is a Bronze Age site.

1857
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:48,790
You live for this.
Why'd you cover it up?

1858
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,170
I didn't do anything.

1859
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:51,940
Cyril,tell them.

1860
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:55,040
We've been working together two
years trying to make this find.

1861
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:57,210
The bone had no hilt.

1862
01:20:57,230 --> 01:21:00,020
She would have scraped her
palm if she stabbed him.

1863
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:04,070
You two are very,very good.

1864
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:05,700
Wethe best.

1865
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:07,490
Good job,Bones.

1866
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:08,420
Come on,up you go,Vera.

1867
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:10,510
Can I have some cuffs,please?
You don't understand.

1868
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:12,830
You don't understand
what Ian wanted to do.

1869
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,810
Kill Wexler so you could
keep the money for yourself?

1870
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:16,030
Ian wanted to give the money back.

1871
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:17,150
Don't you understand?

1872
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:18,170
Not at all.

1873
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:19,050
I'm afraid I do.

1874
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:20,790
It was Ian through and through.

1875
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:24,630
He happily accepdtethe bribe money
when there was no reason to be bribed,

1876
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:26,080
but the minute they found something,

1877
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,310
he got all noble and principled and...

1878
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:30,190
and wanted to return the money.

1879
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:34,170
It would have ruined his career.

1880
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:36,160
Yeah,and mine,too, don't you see?

1881
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:37,650
He never thought of that.

1882
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:40,400
So,Ian was a good man,really?

1883
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:45,610
A relatively good man... which
was good enough for some of us.

1884
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:56,210
Technically,you have not
reached Temperance Brennan,

1885
01:21:56,230 --> 01:22:00,830
but if you leave a message, it
wilreach her... me,Temperance Brennan.

1886
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:03,240
Hey,sweetie,it's me.

1887
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,270
Hodgins and I broke up, and,uh...

1888
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:09,560
I won't really know why
until I speak to you,so...

1889
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,820
I'm just gonna crawl into bed until
you get home, and then we can...

1890
01:22:20,490 --> 01:22:21,440
Angela?

1891
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:23,540
Oh,God.

1892
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:25,450
You again.

1893
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,560
I heard you broke up
with the small,angry man,

1894
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:33,530
so before I leave,I want
to ask you one more time.

1895
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:34,910
No.

1896
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,840
No one gets me.

1897
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:39,580
I'm nobody's.

1898
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,180
I understand.

1899
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:46,200
Perhaps you can drive me to the airport?

1900
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:48,770
That's some kind of
code for you,isn't it?

1901
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,610
Maybe I should take him.

1902
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:53,890
No,I'll take him.

1903
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,400
What's this?

1904
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:57,430
Look,it's been...

1905
01:22:57,970 --> 01:22:59,860
very interesting working here,but...

1906
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:02,560
I'm a man of science,
and this place is just...

1907
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,360
It's very dramatic.

1908
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:05,440
Well said.

1909
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,230
I just want to work in
a regular lab,you know?

1910
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
So,you want that ride or not?

1911
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:13,560
Yes,he does.

1912
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:33,430
You know,Wexler was kind of like
a Robin Hood kind of a character.

1913
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,590
Steal from the rich.

1914
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,890
I turned down my chance
to sleep with Robin Hood?

1915
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:40,160
Sometimes you just take the oddest leap.

1916
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:42,450
Hey,Pritch.

1917
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:44,160
Cheerio,mate.

1918
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,420
"Hello" is fine.

1919
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:48,800
On behalf of Her Majesty,

1920
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:50,370
the Queen of England,

1921
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:52,700
I dub you Sir Seeley Booth...

1922
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:56,450
Knight of the Realm.

1923
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,360
"Official Junior Knight."

1924
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:06,120
Hey,look at that.

1925
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:08,600
Wait a second. That's from a toy store.

1926
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,570
Doesn't mean you're not Sir Galahad.

1927
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:13,420
Thanks.

1928
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,030
I'm sorry about Ian.

1929
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:19,850
Me,too.

1930
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:23,040
It was a real honor
working with you both.

1931
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:25,870
Same here.

1932
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:31,170
If you need a lift to the airport...

1933
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:33,410
Bones-- she
got us a limo.

1934
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:34,130
Of course.

1935
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,350
But if you're ever in the colonies...

1936
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,220
That would be lovely.

1937
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:47,190
She likes you.

1938
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,020
No.

1939
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:48,910
Yes.

1940
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:51,360
<i>And she's very sexual.</i>

1941
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:52,650
Enough with this...

1942
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:54,240
Stop.

1943
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,290
I'm gonna miss this place.

1944
01:24:56,310 --> 01:25:00,250
* The birds begin to
sing the song of love... *

1945
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:01,650
This is definitely not a diner.

1946
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:05,160
* And make their happy sound... *

1947
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:05,930
Come on. Yeah.

1948
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:07,270
We should go before
someone else gets killed.

1949
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,210
Yeah,you're right.

1950
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:09,330
Here we go.

1951
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:12,830
My arm?

1952
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:14,960
Thank you.

1953
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,890
Thank you,Sir Seeley. Yes.

1954
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:20,820
Pleasure,Lady Temperance.

1955
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,440
You sound Australian.

1956
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,560
That didn't sound Australian.

1957
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:33,740
