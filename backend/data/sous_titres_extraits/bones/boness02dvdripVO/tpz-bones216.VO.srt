00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:04,169
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>I'm supposed to be on vacation.</i>

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,171
<i>You know,</i>
<i>spending time with Sully.</i>

3
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,298
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Oh, that's a good lesson for Sully then, huh?</i>

4
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:12,106
Next time he actually takes you <i>away</i>
on vacation, you should go away.

5
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,147
- You know, leave town.
- Uh-uh! You had a vacation and never left town.

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,149
It wasn't a vacation.
It was a suspension.

7
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,983
- Plus compulsory therapy.
- Hey, dude, don't knock therapy, okay?

8
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:24,990
Dr. Wyatt has helped me realize that there
are certain pressures that build up on the job...

9
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,992
and I need creative ways...

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,994
- We do everything together.
- of dealing with them.

11
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,895
What exactly do you have to contend with
on the job that I don't?

12
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,229
[Laughs]
You, Bones. You don't have to contend with you.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,292
So we got a trunk. Looks like
it's been wrapped with chains.

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,397
Battered up pretty good. Most likely came
through the sluiceways upstream in Maryland.

15
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,999
- Is it locked?
- Not anymore, it isn't.

16
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,443
- Is there a body in there?
- Sort of.

17
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,879
<i>[Siren Approaching]</i>

18
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,010
<i>Beats the hell out of me what</i>
<i>the deal is with this one.</i>

19
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:59,457
The head looks flat,
as if the skull's been totally pulverized.

20
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,222
- Maybe she got run over by a steamroller.
- <i>[Booth] What are you saying?</i>

21
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,422
She was killed
by Wile E. Coyote?

22
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,864
<i>Okay. I want the whole "kip and canoodle"</i>
<i>transported to theJeffersonian.</i>

23
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,868
Kit and caboodle.

24
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,063
- <i>[Brennan] Whatever.</i>
- Why don't we just wrap this up fast...

25
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:15,369
- so we can get you back on your vacation?
- Thank you. I'd appreciate that.

26
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:23,782
- You have got to be kidding.
- What's with the tone?

27
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,116
- You want me to take this face
and build a skull for it?
- Can you do it?

28
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:31,282
- No.
- You're always taking skulls and putting on faces.

29
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,848
- Can't you simply reverse the process?
- No.

30
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,555
- Why not?
- Because I am a human being.

31
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,225
<i>She's missing every bone in her body?</i>

32
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:47,000
- Her skeleton was removed.
- Oh. All right.

33
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,007
Leaving the third circle of hell.

34
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:52,533
<i>But before I go, I think she's Asian.</i>

35
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,013
Don't base that on skin tone.
She was boiled...

36
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,175
which is why we can only
get partial fingerprints.

37
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,276
I'm not going off skin tone.

38
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,913
I'm going off her hair.

39
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:08,222
I have an idea for the face... if you can remove
the head from the rest of the skin sack.

40
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,660
Please, God,
I am not out of earshot yet.

41
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:16,398
<i>The victim was boiled. Then a number</i>
<i>of incisions were made from the top of the skull...</i>

42
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,927
around her right ear
and down her right side.

43
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,533
Then from her left foot, along the outside
of the body to her left hip.

44
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,544
- Someone with medical training?
- Definitely not.

45
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,080
An untrained hand
but a very sharp instrument.

46
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,174
- Boiled?
- The entire skeletal structure removed.

47
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,776
Then the skin was sewn back
around the organs.

48
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:37,289
<i>It doesn't fit any kind of ritual killing</i>
<i>I've ever heard or read about.</i>

49
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,588
<i>[Saroyan] The organs are damaged due</i>
<i>to the clumsy cutting, but everything's there.</i>

50
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,788
- Except the brain and the eyes.
- Oh, God.

51
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:47,299
It must have been difficult to remove all those
smaller bones, like the phalanges.

52
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,597
Well, it's all gone.
I didn't even find one bone.

53
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,936
<i>The algae in the trunk is cyanobacteria</i>
<i>called</i> Microcystis aeruginosa.

54
00:02:55,008 --> 00:03:00,571
The size of the... scum colony
indicates eight days submersion.

55
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,276
<i>Dr. Brennan?</i>
<i>Have I offended you in some way?</i>

56
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,252
Dr. Saroyan said no bones,
so you know what that means?

57
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,552
I'm back on vacation.
No bones, no Bones.

58
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:15,219
That...
I was the second "bones."

59
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,287
That's very witty.

60
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,095
<i>[Zack] Essentially, all we have to do</i>
<i>is refill the empty head.</i>

61
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,036
Like a balloon.

62
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,130
- Which is literally what we did.
- Oh, no. You did not.

63
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,770
<i>Put a bladder inside the head</i>

- Brilliant?
- Useless.

00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,655
Hey! Dr. Brennan!

75
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,025
- Agent Sullivan, I presume.
- [Chuckling]

76
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,326
So, what do you think?

77
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,731
- I think you're very dirty.
- Ooh.

78
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,736
- You got something.
- Oh. Oh.

79
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,602
<i>Uh, come on aboard.</i>
<i>Here.</i>

80
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,938
So I didn't think I'd see you
for a couple days.

81
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,102
Well, I know it's strange,
but I'd actually...

82
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,874
rather spend time
with you than work.

83
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,609
Well, I'm flattered.

84
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,583
So, um, you renting it?

85
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:26,682
Well, uh, I'm thinking
about buying her.

86
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,693
Wow. Can you afford it?

87
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,730
<i>Well, if I liquidate everything</i>
<i>and borrow heavily, not at all.</i>

88
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,131
[Chuckles]
So you'd... you'd live on it?

89
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,295
<i>Her.</i> You know, live on <i>her.</i>

90
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:44,241
<i>But before I commit, I want to</i>
<i>spend the night on her with you.</i>

91
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,905
- Oh, what would that prove?
- Call it sexual feng shui.

92
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,914
[Chuckles]
I don't think that's a real thing.

93
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,507
If it doesn't work for us,
I don't want this boat...

94
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:02,317
Wow. Apparently, you do
think it's a real thing.

95
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,034
<i>I can't find anything on how to estimate</i>
<i>the height of a body without bones.</i>

96
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,509
Does the skin stretch or
contract without a skeleton?

97
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,742
Boiled leather immersed in water would
tend to stretch, then contract as it dries.

98
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,749
Maybe the principle applies.

99
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:28,150
- <i>[Saroyan] I'm finding bruising on the torso.</i>
- <i>[Device Buzzing]</i>

100
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,657
<i>I'll subject the tissue to reflectant</i>
<i>spectroscopy to get a rough idea...</i>

101
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,988
of when the blows were sustained
and whether they were fatal.

102
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,826
Dr. Saroyan, the face debacle
taught me a lesson.

103
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,365
I'm strictly a bone guy
like Dr. Brennan.

104
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,994
Which is exactly why
I called for you, bone boy.

105
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,436
- A patella?
- Yes.

106
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,872
X-rays showed it lodged
in the fatty tissue of the leg.

107
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,205
A bone...
something we can work with.

108
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,337
It's just a kneecap, Zack.
Don't get too excited.

109
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,780
To you, it's just a kneecap.
To Dr. Brennan...

110
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:00,580
- it's the best part of a human being.
- Good to know.

- <i>[Sully] Booth?</i>
- Yeah. I need Bones.

116

Permission to come aboard

117
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:24,809
Hey, man.
Uh, is this important?

118
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,641
- Yeah. We got a bone.
- Tell me about it.

119
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,079
It's from the boneless girl.

120
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,549
What kind of bone?

121
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:40,019
- <i>[Brennan] Here and here.</i>
- Frontal spurring.

122
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,560
- Mm-hmm. What's that mean?
- Zack?

123
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,560
- Mm-hmm. What's that mean?
- Zack?

124
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,653
A lot of time spent on the knees.

125
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,426
Oh, she's either a nun or a prostitute.

126
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,732
No. The tendon attachments on the inside
of the patella also suggest squatting...

127
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,568
<i>which is not nunlike behavior.</i>

128
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,473
- You didn't need to interrupt
my vacation for this, you know.
- Well, you know...

129
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,602
you said to call if a bone showed up...

130
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,613
and this is a bone.

131
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,546
<i>The density of secondary</i>
<i>osteon structures...</i>

132
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,881
suggests the victim was in her early 20s
at the time of her death.

133
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,854
See? Zack is capable.
You don't need me.

134
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,590
- An interesting shape.
- <i>[Zack] Square rather than triangular.</i>

135
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,094
Classic nail-patella syndrome.

136
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,290
It's a genetic defect,
also known as Fong's Disease.

137
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,697
Fong's Disease, right.
What's that?

138
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,065
Angela said the victim's hair
suggested Asian.

139
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:28,300
<i>Our victim may have grown up</i>
<i>in a non-industrialized rural environment.</i>

140
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:32,640
Well, early 20s, Asian, rural area...
I'll... I'll check with immigration.

141
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,646
Zack will do an osteological
profile on the bones...

142
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:39,117
<i>see if we can focus geographically,</i>
<i>while I get back on vacation.</i>

He's a romantic.

<i>Yeah. She's here on a fiancée visa</i>
<i>from mainland China.</i>

161
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:43,004
<i>Yeah, well, the fingerprints...</i>
<i>It's a match. Print this up for me.</i>

162
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:47,883
- Yeah, this is the victim.
- Okay. I'll go visit her fiancé tomorrow.

163
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,514
You know, I...
I live wide too.

164
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,492
[Scoffs]
Far and wide, right?

165
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,495
There's nothing wider
than Seeley Booth.

166
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:01,192
Okay, then. My bad.

167
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,836
Ling Fan is dead?
Are you certain?

168
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,372
When was the last time
you saw your wife, Mr. Harper?

169
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,876
- Fan wasn't my wife.
- Well, [Chuckles]

170
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:15,073
she immigrated here
on a, um, fiancée visa...

171
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:18,412
and you're listed
as the, uh, fiancé.

172
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,351
We called it off.
Mutual thing.

173
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,684
<i>Well, you see,</i> I...
<i>I don't believe that.</i>

174
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,224
<i>I mean, a poor girl</i>
<i>from China travels...</i>

175
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,386
thousands of miles
away from her family...

176
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,829
to be with the man
that she loves.

177
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,889
<i>Not like she has</i>
<i>many options.</i>

178
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,394
- So, uh, when was the last time you saw her?
- <i>About a month ago.</i>

179
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,599
- How did she die?
- <i>Yeah, we're still,</i> uh...

180
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,542
- we're still looking into that.
- Foul play, right?

181
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,012
<i>I mean, the F.B.I. wouldn't be asking</i>
<i>so many questions if it was an accident.</i>

182
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,380
<i>So you,</i> uh...
<i>you get off on all this, uh...</i>

183
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,511
- [Dings]
- Asian stuff, huh?

184
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,783
<i>Martial arts and weapons?</i>

185
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,382
I've dedicated my life to it.

186
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,393
<i>She had some bruising, your fiancée.</i>

187
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,725
I don't know anything about that.

188
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,595
These, uh, weapons here... here...

189
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,227
- <i>Are they, uh, genuine?</i>
- <i>Knock-offs.</i>

190
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,770
- I can't afford the real thing.
- <i>Really?</i>

191
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,774
Since when does a fence
worry about affording things?

192
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:22,212
<i>Details like a criminal record... they tend to,</i>
<i>uh, come up during a murder investigation.</i>

193
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,079
- Murder?
- Homicide.

194
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,779
<i>See, I've, uh,</i>
<i>dedicated my life to it.</i>

195
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,423
Hey!

196
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,755
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

197
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,434
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

198
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,087
<i>Hey!</i>

199
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,786
[Brennan]
I've been on Arab dhows about this size...

200
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,128
but I don't think
I could handle one all by myself.

201
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,603
This is a lot more high tech
than a dhow.

202
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,004
Why... Why didn't you ask me
to go out with you?

203
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,008
I'm a good sailor.

204
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,239
Well, you know, I've gotta be able
to handle her by myself.

205
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,305
I'd much rather have a crew...
you, in fact...

206
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:34,842
but what if you got conked on the head
and ran off with a pirate?

207
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,854
[Chuckles]

208
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,584
- Ahoy, the boat.
- Aw, Booth.

209
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,717
Don't tell me.
You found another bone.

210
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:45,195
Well, I got this, uh,
Chinese book that needs translating.

211
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,631
Maybe you, uh, got somebody
at theJeffersonian we could talk to?

212
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,635
No! I'm on vacation.

213
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,637
Well, he'll just keep showing up.

214
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,230
Might as well pitch in
and get the case solved.

215
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,072
It's a ledger for buying
and selling weapons.

216
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,079
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Illegal weapons.</i>

217
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,081
Mmm.

218
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,083
One entry refers to this.

219
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,143
It's a jian...
a double-edged sword.

220
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,212
A degu... This fellow's
not Chinese, correct?

221
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,522
- How can you tell?
- His characters are labored, overly formal.

222
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:19,325
Professor ShiJon Chen is a highly respected
cultural anthropologist...

223
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,856
- who specializes in...
- Yeah, he's one of you. I get it.

224
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,096
You definitely didn't
get all the weapons.

225
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,334
Including this...
a Qing Chuang.

226
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:32,672
A flying horse...
a very rare, ornate dagger.

227
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,339
<i>So what do you think,</i>
<i>Jon Chen?</i>

228
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,076
Obviously he has a fetishistic
slant towards all things Asian.

229
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,415
A mail-order bride would've been a thing
to him, like these weapons.

230
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,355
What about the ritualistic removal of the bones?
Could it be minghun?

231
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:49,087
- No. Definitely not.
- What's that, huh?

232
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:53,222
It's an ancient belief in rural China
that if a young, unmarried male dies...

233
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,427
his family should rebury
his bones with the bones of a woman.

234
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,700
- A bride for the afterlife.
- Like a "buriage" or a "marrial." [Laughs]

235
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,037
- A "deading"?
- [Laughing]

236
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:10,141
<i>But I've never heard of anyone</i>
<i>committing murder to get these bones.</i>

237
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,151
Well, then we should pursue
this avenue of investigation.

238
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,585
<i>If you come across a minghun...</i>

239
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:19,988
in which the origin of the bride's bones
is unclear, you let us know.

240
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,454
Of course.

241
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,163
<i>All right, Sully, look.</i>
<i>I want you to look into buying...</i>

242
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,730
one of those ancient Chinese
weapons... leaping donkey?

243
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,743
- Flying horse?
- Yeah, whatever. See if Harper surfaces...

244
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,802
long enough to, uh...
to make the sale.

245
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,683
Homeland Security says the fiancée visa
was expedited by a lawyer...

246
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:52,122
on retainer to a smaller bride agency
here in town called The Perfect Wife.

247
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,354
- Oh, that sounds archaic.
- Oh, you know, in therapy I learned...

248
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:59,523
that, uh, superlatives like "perfect"
are, uh, meaningless.

249
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:03,227
Not in science. A perfect number is a number
whose divisors add up to itself...

250
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,463
as in one plus two
plus three equals six.

251
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,506
You know, in therapy I learned
that definitive statements...

252
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,508
are by their
very nature wrong.

253
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,510
Isn't the statement,
"definitive statements...

254
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,843
are by their very nature wrong,"
definitive, and thus, wrong?

255
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,112
- You hate psychology.
- Well, you haven't said anything
to change my mind.

256
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:23,883
You know, this is exactly why, okay, sometimes
I do things like shoot up an ice cream truck.

257
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,322
Oh, it's a good thing you had therapy.

258
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,994
You know, we talked
about you in therapy.

259
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,965
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

260
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,059
What did you say?

261
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,663
Well, you know,
since it was, uh, my therapy...

262
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,003
I don't have to share
the details.

263
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,807
Sorry.

264
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,041
So you specialize
in bringing brides over...

265
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,050
from Russia, Romania,
China and Thailand?

266
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,383
I've had over 500 marriages
since I opened shop.

267
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:01,188
I match the happy couple using an empirical
system of reciprocal attributes.

268
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,524
<i>You can't match humans empirically...</i>

269
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,928
because the variables number
in the tens of thousands.

270
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,867
I never recommend a match with less than
200 points of compatible commonality.

271
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:14,702
Tens of thousands
is way more than 200.

272
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,934
This is great.
Were Drew Harper and Miss Fan...

273
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,410
- Miss Li.
- In Chinese nomenclature, the last name's first.

274
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,915
- And the first name is last.
- Great. Were they a good match?

275
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,451
Sadly, I'm sorry to say,
in the end, no.

276
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,452
They decided not to marry.

277
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,784
What happened
to Miss Li after that?

278
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:34,155
On a fiancée visa,
the couple has 90 days to marry.

279
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,559
And if they don't, the bride is required
to return to her country of origin.

280
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:42,464
So if Ling Fan is missing, it's probably
because she went back home.

281
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,469
- Miss Fan is...
- [Clears Throat]

282
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:52,134
Li Ling Fan is dead, Miss Burrows.

283
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,941
- She was beaten.
- Drew Harper may have killed her.

284
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,915
Did that possibility show up
in your 200 points?

285
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,152
[Exhales]

286
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,248
Um, this is my background check
on Drew Harper.

287
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:11,092
You'll find that my screening process exceeds
the minimum set by the Marriage Broker Act.

288
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,927
Thank you, Miss Burrows.
You... You can leave.

289
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,507
[Whistles] Well, Harper provided
a completely false background.

290
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,569
- Is that possible?
- Oh, career criminal, fence?

291
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,480
I mean, yeah. He could bring himself a whole
identity based on false documents.

292
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,951
This is definitely
not a match made in heaven.

293
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,718
I've been worming my way into observing
the ceremony firsthand for two months...

294
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,125
- through the groom's family.
- That'd be the dead groom.

295
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,130
<i>Yes. Overtures are always made</i>
<i>by the groom's family.</i>

296
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,793
Now, I hear they will pay
$25,000 for a bride.

297
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:53,326
- That would be the dead bride.
- Booth, you're being very judgmental.

298
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,034
I apologize.
I just think it's a little...

299
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,511
<i>Apparently, they found a bride.</i>

300
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,140
Well, who is she... or was she?
You know, because she's dead.

301
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:08,050
- My sources don't know anything about the bride.
- Who got the $25,000?

302
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,816
- Most likely the bride's family.
- "Most likely"?

303
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:14,120
My understanding is that
before the minghun...

304
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:17,321
the bones are spread
throughout the family members...

305
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,024
and then brought together
for the reburial ceremony.

306
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,500
- That's correct.
- If you could get me a sample of one of the bones...

307
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,197
we could check the D.N.A.,
see if it's Li Ling Fan.

308
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,832
- Do you know where any of these
bones are, Professor Shi?
- [Sighs]

309
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,712
I might know where maybe
one bone is being kept.

310
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:40,184
If you could get me to a place
where I could just look at the bone...

311
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,550
your subjects
will never know I was there.

312
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:50,393
All right. But you'll have to pretend
to be... my girlfriend.

313
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,226
[Snickering]

314
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,995
- And her brother.
- [Chuckles] Yeah, right.

315
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,735
[Speaking Chinese]

316
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,710
- What did she say?
- Just hospitality stuff.

317
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:10,043
[Chinese]

<i>She don't think Bones is good for you.</i>

319
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,355
- You just made that up.
- Nail on the head.

320
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,521
- Ha.
- [Chinese]

321
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,588

322
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:34,265

323
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:44,078
- [Chuckles]
- She said your face has character.

324
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,276
Yeah. Well, all the older ladies,
they... they like me.

325
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,047
[Whispering]
Bones, what are you doing? Bones? Bones?

326
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,648
- <i>[Woman Speaking Chinese]</i>
- These are traditional storage pots.

327
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,249
Please, Dr. Brennan, whatever you find,
you promised not to disturb it!

328
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,728
No. I promised not
to disrupt your study. Ooh!

329
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,628
Whoa, what is this?
Is that human?

330
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,724
It's an ilium...
part of the hip bone.

331
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,235
Ah. What am I supposed
to do with this?

332
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,273
- Dr. Brennan, quickly, put it back!

336
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,680

[Exhales]

338
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,751
Definitely human.

339
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:32,456
- No sign of any cut marks.
- Well, is it Li Ling Fan?

340
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,467
- No. It's male.
- So, you got a part of the groom
instead of a piece of the bride?

341
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,936
- Bones stole it.
- Not stole. Swapped.

342
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,700
From an old Chinese lady's mantle.

343
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:47,109
<i>I brought a bunch of chimpanzee bones</i>
<i>and pulled the old, uh, "switchamacallit."</i>

344
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,477
- Switcheroo.
- Whatchamacallit.

345
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:53,780
- Two different things.
- These anomalies...
Whoever this was, died of cancer.

346
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,946
I'll get Zack to find the details,
but this is definitely not Li Ling Fan.

347
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,047
- Maybe it's the groom.
- <i>[Saroyan] Makes sense.</i>

348
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,821
Especially if this
is a "dead people bone marriage" thing.

349

00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,170
Excuse me.

00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,173
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>You bought the boat.</i>

353
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,005
Finalized this morning.

354
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,444
Wait. Sailboats have keys?

355
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,812
Um, no. Not... Not really.

356
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:28,216
These are the keys to the marina.
But, you know, it's symbolic.

357
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,587
Congratulations.
[Chuckles]

358
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,592
So I'm gonna
tell you something.

359
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,390
And I want you to think about it
a while before you answer.

360
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,431
- Okay.
- Well, you say okay...

361
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,593
but it takes you microseconds
to think things through.

362
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:48,504
So this time, I... I'd appreciate it
if you, uh, just took a breath...

363
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,940
because it's... it's big.

364
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,001
Well...

365
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,947
what is it?

366
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:02,512
I'm headed south in the boat
to the Caribbean.

367
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,618
- When?
- When this case is done.

368
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,927
- You quit the F.B. I?
- No. No, not yet.

369
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,263
I'll take a couple of months to get used to
the boat, you know, really check it out.

370
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,271
And then I'll start running charters,
probably for the Turks and Caicos, which is...

371
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,069
You're... You're really
talking a lot.

372
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:27,373
I know. And I haven't
even gotten to the main part.

373
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,706
Which is, uh...

374
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,955
I really, really
want you to come with me.

375
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,560
You do?

376
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,562
I do.

377
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,563
Look, take a sabbatical.

378
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:53,832
There's more to life than...
than corpses and murderers.

379
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:56,635
You know, we do this job
for too long, we get warped.

380
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,337
I can feel it happening already.
Maybe you can too.

381
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,609
Let... Let's run away together.

382
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,219
Well, you know, think about it.

383
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,656
Want a hug? Okay, no.

384
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:19,459
That's... That's, uh, a lot to process.
So just, you know, I don't know.

385
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:23,126
You know, let me know when you
think that maybe that...

386
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,192
Okay.

387
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,244
- [Beeping]
- <i>[Typing]</i>

388
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:47,948
Stage 3 sarcoma,
M1 metastasis.

389
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,221
Like Brennan said, cancer.

390
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:54,288
<i>Yes. Most likely it spread from</i>
<i>prostate or testicular cancer.</i>

391
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,561
So it's definitely a guy.

392
00:23:56,635 --> 00:24:00,298
If this is the groom, then he's Chinese,
and according to Dr. Shi...

393
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:04,900
most likely related in some way
to the old lady who kept him in a pot.

394
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,809
Which should be enough to <i>identify</i> him
through hospital records.

395
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:13,211
None of Harper's weapons show any sign
of being used to dissect a human being.

396
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,412
No protein residue,
even under A.L.S.

397
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,718
Is there any way to tell what kind of blade
was used on the skin?

398
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,690
Only that it was sharp
and straight edged.

399
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,489
But I did find evidence of
toxicity damage to the kidney.

400
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:27,658
Wait. The victim was poisoned?
I thought she was beaten to death.

401
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,394
Well, the bruising could've
been a result of Fong's Disease.

402
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,963
Toxicology identified the toxin
as a root called lei gong teng.

403
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,065
In small doses,
it's an anti-inflammatory.

404
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,076
In large, it has another name.

405
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:43,046
Loosely translates
as "walk seven steps and die."

406
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,912
I'll have Booth check out
Chinese herbalists.

407
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,722
- You want me to bring you up to date?
- No.

408
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,021
- [Beeping]
- I want you to tell me what to do.

409
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,186
About what?

410
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:00,459
- Sully wants me to run off with him.
- Go.

411
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,432
- For a year.
- Go.

412
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,731
He wants to run a charter boat
around the Caribbean.

413
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,237
- Go.
- He says I should take a sabbatical.

414
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:11,969
Go. What is the downside?
He's a great guy.

415
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:15,274
- This is a great idea.
- I'll miss you guys.

416
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,474
Oh, we'll meet you in Barbados.

417
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,677
Look, you have been working
every day since I met you.

418
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,744
It's time to let another part of yourself
out into the sun...

419
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:28,816
- with a bare-chested man and a tropical breeze.

00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,975
try to find out where they got
the female bones, in case it's Li Ling Fan.

425
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,977
Listen to me, Brennan. Go.

426
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:53,817
There'll still be murder
and mayhem when you get back.

427
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,252
They're going to know this information
came from me. You've ruined my study.

428
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,297
They won't know for sure
it was you.

429
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,298
Their son's bones are spread
all over the city.

430
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:11,699
They let me in on something
very precious to them, and now this.

431
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,603
I broke the first rule
of anthropology...

432
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,538
minimize your effect on the study.

433
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:20,806
Do you really believe that your study is more
important than catching a murderer?

434
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:26,206
You used to be dedicated
to a much larger, timeless truth.

to provide him loving company

00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,067
I contend he was dug up
lastJuly or August...

481
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,901
<i>which allowed maggots</i>
<i>to be laid in the casket to feast</i> on...

482
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:38,374
- Okay, yeah, I got it.
- Oh, I can be a lot more specific.

483
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,207
No, no. You know, dug up last summer
and distributed to the family.

484
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,213
Specific enough
for the F.B.I.

485
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,249
He would've
decomposed quickly.

486
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,183
Buried in a pine box,
improperly sealed...

487
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,244
<i>buried only two feet</i>
<i>below the surface.</i>

488
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:54,314
- The Changs should sue their mortuary.
- Because of the shallow burial?

489
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:58,351
Yeah, and the decomp seepage
into the fake money is au naturel.

490
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:02,559
- What does that mean?
- The body was not embalmed.

491
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,035
None of this is helping us solve the mystery
of what happened to Li Ling Fan.

492
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,163
The funeral home was in on it.

493
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:11,731
They wanted the body
to decompose as quickly as possible.

494
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:17,009
<i>Full-service mortuary. They perform funerals</i>
<i>and weddings for dead people.</i>

495
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,253
Mortuary records show that we buried
William Chang in a lead-lined casket.

496
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,688
- And if you found another casket...
- Pine box. It was a pine box.

497
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:31,752
- It is obvious that Mr. Chang
was dug up and reburied.
- Who embalmed William Chang?

498
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,789
The records show that my
grandson and I had that honor.

499
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:39,359
- You're lying.
- William Chang was never embalmed.

500
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:43,100
<i>But you yourself said there was nothing</i>
<i>but fake money in the casket.</i>

501
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:47,702
- So how can you tell?
- We can tell from the residue
left in the empty casket.

502
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,377
[Speaking Chinese]
I'm sorry, but we cannot help you.

503
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,251
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mr. Han, please, just sit down. Please? Just...

504
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,450
<i>Here's what I think, okay?</i>
<i>I think that you have...</i>

505
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,585
some old Chinese
traditions alive...

506
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,289
which are illegal
in this country.

507
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,390
- The minghun reburial ceremony.
- <i>[Booth] Well, I'm not concerned about...</i>

508
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:13,597
- What I care about is if the bride was murdered.
- Murdered?

509
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:17,937
<i>Our understanding is that</i>
<i>Mr. Chang's family paid $25,000 for her bones.</i>

510
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,000
<i>And people have killed</i>
<i>for much less.</i>

511
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:24,674
So, uh, what part of that
25 grand came to you?

512
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:27,980
- Did the Changs admit to paying that money?
- No.

513
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,145
We found a cash withdrawal
that they can't explain.

514
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:35,249
But you are not even certain
that William Chang's minghun bride...

515
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,590
- <i>is this murdered woman?</i>
- No, sir.

516
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,290
<i>We can't know for sure it isn't her</i>
<i>without looking at the bones.</i>

517
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:45,029
If the bride were not this murdered woman,
would you allow the ceremony to proceed?

518
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:47,264
- Grandfather!
- [Chinese]

519
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,168
What ceremony?

520
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:56,043
- <i># [Traditional Chinese]</i>
- <i>[Man Chanting In Chinese]</i>

521
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,325
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>We're... We're very sorry to disturb you.</i>

522
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,955
F.B.I. I need
to see the coffin. Sorry.

523
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,556
Sorry. Excuse me.
Take a look, Bones.

524
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,897
- Take a look.
- Okay.

525
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:21,837
<i>[Brennan] Indications of cancer.</i>
<i>I believe this is William Chang.</i>

526
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,807
Here's the chimpanzee ilium
that I left.

527
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,208
What about the girl?

528
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,211
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>There's lots of score marks on the bones...</i>

529
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:35,218
congruent with flesh being removed
from the skeleton with blades.

530
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,982
I believe this is Li Ling Fan.

531
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,714
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

532
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,591
I guess we really
broke up the party, huh?

533
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:56,339
Positive I.D. on both sets of remains.
William Chang and Li Ling Fan.

534
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,808
- Wow. They kinda go together.
- <i>[Saroyan] Because they're deceased?</i>

535
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,278
<i>Yeah. But more than that.</i>
<i>They're exactly the same level ofhotness.</i>

536
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,908
<i>Which is zero</i>
<i>because they're skeletons.</i>

537
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,579
<i>The cuts left on the skeletal structure</i>
<i>by the removal of soft tissue...</i>

538
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:13,420
<i>match the implements the F.B.I.</i>
<i>confiscated from the mortuary.</i>

539
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:18,428
<i>She was ill, and he was ill.</i>
<i>It's really too bad they never actually met.</i>

540
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,761
The mortician's lawyer
advised him to clam up.

541
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:26,270
<i>[Saroyan] The Changs now say the $25,000</i>
<i>was used to pay off a family debt.</i>

542
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,897
<i>You ever think that their</i>
<i>spirits actually did meet...</i>

543
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:33,967
and are working to get their bones together
here on the physical plane?

544
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,536
You mean like we're possessed
and doing their bidding?

545
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,879
[Sighs]
You know what you people lack?

546
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:43,887
Whimsy.
It's a genuine handicap.

547
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,458
There are four morticians working at that
mortuary and a half a dozen assistants.

548
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:53,122
Any one of them could've removed the bones
and sank the skin in the river.

549
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,461
<i>[Zack] Personally, I would've cremated</i>
<i>the remaining skins and organs.</i>

550
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,728
<i>No crematorium</i>
<i>at that mortuary.</i>

551
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,566
I am gonna draw them
a wedding picture.

552
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,766
Okay. Well, you do that.

553
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:08,574
We should find out who poisoned the victim
and arrest him for murder.

554
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:12,912
Probably the, uh, bouncing,
flying mail-order husband.

555
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,920
Does that count as whimsy?

556
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,979
Well, you're handicapped, Zack.

557
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,686
Someone really needs to throw
a telethon for you.

558
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,856
<i>How did Sully find Harper so quickly?</i>

559
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:30,094
He didn't say.
You know, Sully's a nice guy.

560
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,102
You sound condescending.

561
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,331
I'm just trying
to be nice, okay?

562
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,839
I'm complimenting the fact that
you got a good one this time.

563
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,036
Thereby implying I'm incapable
of making my own judgments.

564
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:43,103
The physicist
who couldn't tie his shoes?

565
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:47,618
Oh, the former professor who was jealous
of your own success. Should I stop?

566
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,245
- Yes.
- Oh, the guy that you found on the Internet...

567
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,448
and ended up being some
kinda recruiter for a cult.

568
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:55,959
Oh, and this is my favorite...
the guy who cut off his own brother's head...

569
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,961
because he thought
he was possessed by a witch.

570
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,963
You made your point.

571
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:03,899
Look, I'm just saying a guy who wants to take
you away from all of this on a sailboat...

572
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,129
- that's a step up.
- Condescending.

573
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,195
<i>[Chattering In Chinese]</i>

574
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,012
- That's our guy.
- <i>[Brennan] Okay. So when do we take him off?</i>

575
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,847
Down. We take him down when Sully
puts his cap in his back pocket.

576
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,523
Now. Freeze!

577
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,152
- [Groans]
- Freeze! Harper!

578
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,493
Geez, I told you he was fast.

579
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:36,055
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

580
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,500
<i>Great. Fine. Sully, you chase him.</i>
<i>I'll head him off. Okay?</i>

581
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,402
Okay, okay, okay.
[Grunts]

582
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,378
- <i>Have you thought about my offer?</i>
- Yes.

583
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:52,041
- What do you think?
- This is not the time to discuss it.

584
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,918
- <i>[Sully] The guy must be on meth.</i>
- [Brennan] Martial arts.

585
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,961
F.B. I! Freeze right there!

586
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:10,228
<i>I said freeze!</i>
<i>Freeze! Damn it!</i>

587
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,138
<i>What is he, on wires?</i>

588
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,280
[Groans]

589
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,749
- [Groans]
- He ain't bouncing around anymore now, is he?

590
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,883
See that?

591
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:40,988
- I did not kill Ling Fan.
- Then why did you keep running away, huh?

592
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:44,296
- I'm a criminal. You're police.
- <i>[Sully] Ling Fan didn't really know anyone.</i>

593
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,929
- That makes you a good suspect.
- Sell her bones for $25,000.

594
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,132
- Make up for the loss.
- What loss?

595
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,905
You paid $25,000
to The Perfect Wife Agency to bring her over.

596
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:57,004
Probably another eight grand
for the round-trip ticket.

597
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,141
- That's a lot of knife sales.
- <i>[Harper] You people got it completely wrong.</i>

598
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,847
Chick doesn't work out,
you get a full refund or a swap.

599
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,855
I took the money-back guarantee.

600
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,084
- Really?
- Oops.

601
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,356
I didn't lose a cent. It's the mail-order agency
that's out all that dough.

602
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,260
- What was wrong with her?
- What?

603
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,961
Why did you send
Ling Fan back?

604
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,969
Chick was defective, man.

605
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,971
I'm a very active person.

606
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,439
<i>She moved slow, like an old lady.</i>

607
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:31,010
- You meet the flying horse?
- Yeah.

608
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,711
<i>That is a very good item.</i>
<i>Maybe you still want to buy it?</i>

609
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,719
I'm gonna need bail money.
