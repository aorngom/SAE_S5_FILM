1
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,608
So who do they
think the body is?

2
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:34,312
Federal prosecutor,
disappeared five years ago,

3
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,510
the day before he was
starting a mob trial.

4
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,329
Five years, so there's
not much left of him?

5
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,283
Ye that's why they
flew you to Sin City.

6
00:00:44,953 --> 00:00:47,377
They call this America's
playground?

7
00:00:47,377 --> 00:00:50,151
No, we're miles outside Vegas,
Bones.

8
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:52,267
This is America's frying pan.

9
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:56,024
No kidding. A person can melt
before finding a body anywhere near here.

10
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,360
Once the mob makes a federal
prosecutor disappear,

11
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:00,507
they kind of want him staying
that way.

12
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:02,690
- Agent Booth.
- Agent Xang.

13
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,158
Dr. Brennan,
thanks for coming.

14
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,702
Okay, on May 20, 2001, Mason
Roberts was supposed to deliver

15
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:09,862
a key note address at UNLV,
but he never showed.

16
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:12,872
Found his car three blocks
from his office, engine still running.

17
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:14,932
- Right this way.
- Wait, no leads until now?

18
00:01:14,948 --> 00:01:16,552
Leads don't mean much
without a body.

19
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:20,021
Then, yesterday, we get this tip
from this call girl working at the Tangiers Hotel.

20
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:24,232
Oh, so I dragged out
one of the top forensic anthropologists

21
00:01:24,827 --> 00:01:28,493
- ...across the country, on the word of a prostitute?
- What difference does her profession make?

22
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:30,241
- I'm backing you up.
- You were judging.

23
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,462
- I wasn't judging.
- Your voice was judging.

24
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:37,292
Anyway, the body is right
where she said it would be: Mile Marker 15

25
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:41,562
Confirmed victim is male,
late 30s, no clothing,

26
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,072
no personal artifacts.

27
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:45,240
Okay, this informant of yours,
any chance I can talk to her?

28
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:46,920
Long as you don't expect
her to talk back.

29
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:48,940
She died this
morning, cancer.

30
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:51,393
It was a deathbed confession.
She was still scared as hell.

31
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:54,020
Multiple fractures to the skull
and upper extremities,

32
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:57,491
caused by something cylindrical,
like a pipe or a bat.

33
00:01:57,495 --> 00:01:58,992
Straight out of Capone's
playbook.

34
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:01,470
I'll know more
once I compare
dental records.

35
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:03,323
But...

36
00:02:03,965 --> 00:02:06,932
What?
Bones?

37
00:02:08,808 --> 00:02:11,482
It's a vulture. Dead body here,
kind of how it works.

38
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:13,140
They don't circle
skeletal remains.

39
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:14,571
Get my bag.

40
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:22,730
Oh, right.

41
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:25,320
It's the sun-baked rotting
corpses they're into.

42
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:27,311
BRENNAN:
It's female, mid-20s.

43
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:29,373
Similar injuries
to the male victim,

44
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,021
but this is a fresh kill.

45
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,192
A week to ten days.

46
00:02:33,197 --> 00:02:35,242
Popular dumping ground
for these guys.

47
00:02:35,248 --> 00:02:37,313
What, you don't mean
the same guys, five years later?

48
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:38,613
Well, you know,
if they're not connected,

49
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,230
it'd be one
hell of a coincidence.

50
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:42,453
I'd have to compare
them side-by-side,

51
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:44,373
but from what I see here,

52
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:46,821
whoever buried that victim
buried this one, too.

53
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:48,753
So two dead
for the price of one.

54
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,433
Viva Las Vegas.

55
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:36,753
Yep, dental records confirm,
the male victim is Mason Roberts,

56
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:40,333
bludgeoned to death,
presumably with a baseball bat.

57
00:03:40,338 --> 00:03:42,352
This guy here looks like
a long ball hitter.

58
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:45,170
That's Sweet Pete Arno.
He's the gaming exec at the Tangiers.

59
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:46,211
He and the other two there,

60
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:48,583
they were on Robert's immediate
to do list when he disappeared.

61
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:50,273
Any specs
on the female victim yet?

62
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:52,213
Uh... Only preliminary.

63
00:03:52,217 --> 00:03:55,303
Blows to the cranium, torso
and upper extremities.

64
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:56,951
All similar injuries to Roberts.

65
00:03:56,955 --> 00:03:59,213
But the likely result
of domestic abuse.

66
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:02,361
Likely results? Bones, there's
nothing domestic about a mob hit.

67
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:06,671
But the shape of her injuries,
the pattern of healing, and rebreaking?

68
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:08,860
There's a long history
of assault here, Booth,

69
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:13,050
and not from any baseball bat.
Plus, I found this embedded in her skull.

70
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:16,822
- Is that a hearing aid?
- They're common with abuse victims.

71
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:20,801
Repeated blows to the head can
damage the bones of the inner ear.

72
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:22,492
Uh, sorry to butt in, Brennan,

73
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,451
but I got a name
off the serial number.

74
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:25,941
The hearing aid is registered

75
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:29,653
to a Willamina Morgan
of Mt. Charleston, Nevada.

76
00:04:29,656 --> 00:04:31,230
Oh, that's not too far
from here.

77
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,291
XANG:
She goes by the name Billie.

78
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:34,563
Listed here as Billie Morgan,

79
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:38,550
26, reported missing two weeks
ago by her husband Donald.

80
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:40,582
Her abusive husband
covering his tracks?

81
00:04:40,586 --> 00:04:43,721
- Possible.    - Okay, he might know
how his wife and Roberts ended up here.

82
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:46,020
He may even know, uh,
your friends here.

83
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:49,432
You get on that;
I'll fly these remains back to the Jeffersonian.

84
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:52,481
- ok... We can't leave.
- We can't?

85
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:55,741
No, I mean, we came for one body
and suddenly there's two?

86
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:57,073
What if there's more?

87
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:58,742
SAROYAN:
Just ship both sets
of remains here,

88
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:00,690
along with bugs, dirt,
the works.

89
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:03,141
If there's a forensic link
to these murders, we'll find it.

90
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:04,530
As long as you keep me
in the loop.

91
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:06,490
As if we could actually keep
you out?

92
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:08,490
Okay, all right, fine.
So that's the deal.

93
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:12,723
Box  them up, and we go break
the news to Big Don.

94
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:18,513
And here I thought she left me.

95
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:20,043
BOOTH:
Now why would
she do that, Don?

96
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:23,140
I got laid off
a couple of months ago.

97
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:24,293
Poor Billie.

98
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:27,873
She hated seeing me
sitting around the house all day, depressed.

99
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:29,130
Drinking?

100
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:30,393
And punching walls?

101
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,582
No, I-I just,
I fell off a ladder.

102
00:05:32,585 --> 00:05:34,611
Breaking a fall like
that would fracture

103
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:37,012
a distal radius,
not proximal phalanges.

104
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:39,790
All right, listen.
So I got a police report
that says your neighbors

105
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:42,063
heard you screaming
at your wife three weeks ago.

106
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:43,960
Screaming? No.

107
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:45,872
We were just arguing.

108
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:48,541
See, Billie wanted to help out.

109
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,602
She thought she could
bring in some money dancing,

110
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:52,562
you know, the exotic kind.

111
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:54,240
I kind of flipped out.

112
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:56,062
And broke your thumb
against your wife's face?

113
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:58,923
No! Look, I could never hurt
Billie. Okay?

114
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,260
Then how'd she lose her hearing?

115
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:02,962
I don't know. She was a kid.
Okay? Playing sports.

116
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:05,393
- One too many soccer balls to the head.
- Oh, please.

117
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:07,662
Listen,  Don, you're
my number one suspect.

118
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,611
So it would be
wise if you were
straight with us.

119
00:06:11,607 --> 00:06:13,391
Implants.

120
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:16,841
Breast implants?

121
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:20,603
She thought they'd help her
chances of landing a job as a dancer.

122
00:06:20,637 --> 00:06:23,943
So as much as I hated the idea,
I borrowed eight grand

123
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:26,773
from a loan shark.
I gave the money to Billie.

124
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:29,883
That's the last time
I ever saw her.

125
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,631
So that's how
you broke your thumb?
Huh?

126
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:34,650
The loan shark comes
to collect his eight grand.

127
00:06:34,656 --> 00:06:36,843
Don, here, he can't
pay him, so...

128
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:38,561
Yeah, now I owe him ten.

129
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,971
I need the loan shark's name,
just give me a name.

130
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:51,502
Yeah, that's right,
Lewis Mackey.

131
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:54,183
Yeah. Send his information
to my cell phone

132
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:56,283
as soon as
you can. Thanks.

133
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:57,563
We had the shark
in our system.

134
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:59,642
Pring, at least,
that he exists.

135
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:03,201
You know, Don's story
might seem a little,
I don't know, hinky,

136
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,721
but just try to keep
an open mind.

137
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:07,640
An open mind to what?
All those soccer balls to the head?

138
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:10,091
I'm just not sold on
the whole domestic
abuse thing.

139
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:11,503
All right?
A scrawny guy like that.

140
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:13,323
Rage has nothing to do
with size.

141
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:14,440
I know that, Bones,
all right?

142
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:15,733
You know that
I know that... It's just,

143
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:17,940
I looked
into the guy's eyes,

144
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:21,237
- ...and I-I just didn't see it.
- What about the breast implants?

145
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:22,270
You know, if she'd gotten them,

146
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,788
they would have been
in part of her remains.

147
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:26,341
Yeah, well, then the money had
to be for something else,

148
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:30,580
and, hopefully, this guy will be
able to tell us what it was.

149
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:37,630
There's our
loan shark; let's go.

150
00:07:37,636 --> 00:07:40,402
O kay.
Just, uh, give me a moment here.

151
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:44,051
Oh, my god...

152
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:45,910
I completely forgot.

153
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,462
You can't be here, Booth.
You're a degenerate gambler.

154
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:51,991
Former gambler, okay? Not degenerate.
I've been through the program, okay?

155
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:53,881
And you know what,
he's on the move, come on.

156
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:56,611
What if you get a
sudden urge to gamble
while you're here?

157
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:59,430
I mean, it's like
sending an alcoholic
to a distillery.

158
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,910
Do you need
to sit down?

159
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:02,783
No, I'm fine.

160
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:04,441
It's just, you know,
it's the sound of the winning.

161
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:07,260
- It'll, it'll pass.
- What, the sound, or the winning?

162
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,310
It just kind of reminds me
of the first time.

163
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:12,231
I walked in to the Desert Inn
with 35 bucks in my pocket,

164
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:14,652
and I walked out
with a cool ten grand.

165
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:16,543
The next night
I lost everything.

166
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:18,771
Tapped out my ATM
trying to get it back.

167
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,631
- What's that game called again?
- Craps.

168
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:23,180
- What's the matter now?
- No, it's the game.

169
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:25,991
It's called "craps." You know, hey,
this used to be my game, Bones.

170
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:28,742
Roll them bones,
chuck the dice, 7-11.

171
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,870
<i>That's craps.</i>

172
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:35,093
And he's going for the bar.

173
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:37,062
Okay, you stay here. I know
how to talk to these guys.

174
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:38,993
Whoa, talk?
You can barely breathe.

175
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:41,140
I'm fine, just trust me.
All right?

176
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,153
Wait here.

177
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,872
And do what, exactly?

178
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:46,082
You're an anthropologist.
Observe the culture.

179
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:03,501
Lou Mackey,
don't I owe you money?

180
00:09:03,947 --> 00:09:06,310
I'm afraid you have me confused
with someone else.

181
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:07,760
I don't think I do. Uh...

182
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:10,791
My buddy, uh, Don Morgan,
he introduced us?

183
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:13,662
30, scrawny guy,
broken thumb.

184
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:15,491
Do I need to call security?

185
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:18,123
Yeah, you know,
that's a great idea.

186
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:20,931
Maybe you can tell all of us
what you did to Don,

187
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:23,563
and just maybe
how his wife ended up dead.

188
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:25,433
I don't know anything
about any wife.

189
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:28,291
Come on, Lou, don't make
me work so hard here.

190
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:29,642
Look, the guy
owed me money.

191
00:09:29,646 --> 00:09:30,903
He neglected to pay.

192
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:33,313
And then he fell off
of a ladder.

193
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:34,990
It's instant karma.

194
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:37,332
Instant karma, that's going
to get you every time, isn't it?

195
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:40,491
What about, uh,
Billie Morgan?

196
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,760
She have
instant karma, too?

197
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:44,480
She's attractive.

198
00:09:44,658 --> 00:09:46,433
I didn't even know
he was married.

199
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:48,361
How about the name
Mason Roberts, huh?

200
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:49,780
I'm sure that rings a bell.

201
00:09:49,786 --> 00:09:52,723
Whispers on the strip is
that you finally found him.

202
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,280
C ongratulations.

203
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,050
Now leave me alone.

204
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:58,803
If you know more than
what you're saying,

205
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:00,890
I'm going to find out,
eventually.

206
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:02,691
Do I look worried?

207
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:05,401
I'm a businessman.

208
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:07,431
What are you harassing me for?

209
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:10,380
Ah, you know, it's just
something I have about bullies.

210
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:13,833
Thanks for the drink.

211
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:17,083
- 19's a winner.
- Yes!

212
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:20,593
Uh, hey, Bones.

213
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:22,260
Oh, Booth, have you ever played
this game before?

214
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:23,971
It's basic math.
You just count the cards

215
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:25,790
and then you know
what the dealer has left.

216
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:26,561
<i>Yeah. Ixne...</i>

217
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:29,461
The most common card is a ten
because of the face cards.

218
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:31,922
So if you just always assume
that the down card is a ten...

219
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:33,330
I'm sorry, I'm afraid
you're going to have to...

220
00:10:33,337 --> 00:10:34,771
We were just about to leave.

221
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:36,133
- Thanks. Come on.
- What, I was just getting good.

222
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:37,782
Good at cheating,
that's what counting cards is.

223
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:39,933
No, it's not cheating;
it's strategy.

224
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:40,910
Not to them, it's not.

225
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:42,340
Well, what is
the fun in that?

226
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:44,951
I mean, the odds are completely
skewed in the dealer's favor.

227
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:46,163
Right, now do you see
the attraction?

228
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:50,172
Plus, now the man
on my right is going
to win the next hand, if he doesn't
hit on an eight....

229
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:02,090
Agealea consina.

230
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,150
Gesundheit.

231
00:11:03,158 --> 00:11:04,941
Also known as
scarab beetles.

232
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:07,141
They came from the soil
around Billie Morgan.

233
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:10,550
These adults feed on
putrefied organic matter,

234
00:11:10,557 --> 00:11:13,152
or in this case, Billie.

235
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:15,981
As a result, they suffered unusually
short lifespans.

236
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:17,321
From ingesting Billie's flesh?

237
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:19,991
More likely the powerful
glucocorticoid in her system.

238
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:21,692
I've yet to isolate
which one specifically.

239
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:24,111
Be sure to notify
Dr. Brennan when you do.

240
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,822
Any specifics on the bat used
to kill Roberts yet, Zack?

241
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:28,152
Here's a replica.

242
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:32,652
Cincinnati Slugger with a three-inch
diameter weighing about 27 ounces.

243
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:36,083
You'd think the mob would come up with
less clichéd ways to whack people.

244
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:37,680
But there's
something else.

245
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:39,382
Staining in Robert's cranium

246
00:11:39,385 --> 00:11:41,841
indicates seepage
to the cervicaspine.

247
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:44,671
So somehow, blood from his head
got down to his neck.

248
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:47,153
Vertebrae C-7--

249
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:48,460
are those cut marks?

250
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:49,940
So  his throat was cut, too.

251
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:51,880
Did you find a specific cause
of death on Billie Morgan yet?

252
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:53,820
She displays a hemothorax
in her left lung.

253
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:55,831
Caused by a left-sided
rib fracture.

254
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:58,873
A broken rib punctures a lung
causing massive internal bleeding?

255
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:01,620
And between her preexisting
injuries and the new ones,

256
00:12:01,627 --> 00:12:03,201
the poor girl never
had a chance to heal.

257
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:06,370
Oh, won't Dr. Brennan
love to hear that.

258
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:12,820
Take a closer look at the stress
markers to his sternum, Zachary.

259
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:14,360
Strike you as unusual?

260
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:16,031
Well, they do seem
more the result of

261
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,140
repetitive
medium impact

262
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:19,393
manual blows than
the single high impact

263
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:20,392
from a bat.

264
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:22,292
This husband could
really dish it out.

265
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:23,603
Maybe she dished it back.

266
00:12:23,607 --> 00:12:25,461
These hairline fractures
on her knuckles.

267
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,930
<i>Defensive wounds.
Wait a minute.</i>

268
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:30,012
Let me zoom in.

269
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:32,260
Repetitive manual blows,

270
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,292
fractured knuckles.

271
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:36,233
The glucocorticoid
that killed your bugs, Hodges,

272
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:39,012
<i>could it have been simple
cortisone to treat an injury?</i>

273
00:12:39,015 --> 00:12:40,333
Yeah, it's certainly possible.

274
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:41,703
What are you thinking,
Dr. Brennan?

275
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:44,863
I'm thinking that Billie Morgan
could have been a boxer.

276
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:47,390
What do you mean,
like a real boxer in a ring?

277
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:50,413
But wouldn't boxing gloves
prevent injuries like these?

278
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:51,893
Unless she wasn't
wearing gloves.

279
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,451
Well, what boxer
does that?

280
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,791
- Ultimate fighters.
- Ultimate fighters.

281
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:58,881
Oh, you're into that crap,
too, huh, Hodges?

282
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:02,100
When it shows up on cable,
I can't turn it off.

283
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:04,461
- And it's actually legal?
- Completely sanctioned.

284
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:06,101
They do wear some
protective gear,

285
00:13:06,106 --> 00:13:07,950
which would fly in the face
of our girl's injuries.

286
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:10,010
Well, that is, unless
it was underground.

287
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,000
Underground where?

288
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:12,760
Come on, haven't you guys
ever seen Fight Club?

289
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:15,362
Illegal, no-holds-barred
slugfests.

290
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:17,430
Modern day panem et circenses.

291
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:19,920
But generally there's
no free bread.

292
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:20,661
What?

293
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,313
So Don Morgan
didn't beat his wife.

294
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:25,652
Hate to say I told you so.

295
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:30,420
Why didn't you
tell us, Don?

296
00:13:30,985 --> 00:13:32,721
Because, I didn't know.

297
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,993
All right?
She never told me.

298
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:36,670
Your own wife didn't tell you
that she was fighting?

299
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:38,343
Because I'd never let her.

300
00:13:38,347 --> 00:13:40,010
Billie hadn't boxed
in a year.

301
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:42,962
Commission took her license away
when they found out about her hearing.

302
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:45,052
It about broke her heart.

303
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:47,570
- But she was done.
- Apparently not.

304
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,560
You know what I think? Somebody offered
to Billie an illegal fight, and you jumped

305
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:51,763
at the chance
for a pay day.

306
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:52,860
Are you out of your mind?

307
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,433
So you borrowed money from
Mackey and you put it all

308
00:13:55,437 --> 00:13:57,280
on Billie, and she ended up
paying the price.

309
00:13:57,286 --> 00:13:58,992
No, no, that's not true.

310
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:01,190
- Who are you protecting, Don?
- Nobody.

311
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:03,551
Look, I swear, I didn't know.

312
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:05,730
Don, we can protect you

313
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:06,952
if you let us.

314
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,592
If I knew who killed Billie,
I'd tell you.

315
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,252
Believe me, please.

316
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:16,623
Why would anyone fight
illegally in the first place?

317
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:17,782
You know, there's
limited options.

318
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:19,880
Not everybody could be
Oscar De La Hoya.

319
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:20,972
Who?

320
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:24,902
Injuries, criminal pasts,
failed drug tests

321
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,230
leaves them with no skills,

322
00:14:26,236 --> 00:14:28,492
so they take on a fight
wherever they can find one.

323
00:14:28,558 --> 00:14:30,401
Even if it kills them?

324
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:32,811
<i>Brennan.</i>

325
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:35,543
I found something in the particulates
from Billie's shoes.

326
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:38,380
Traces of hexavalent chromium.

327
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:40,782
It's a chemical used in
high-end automotive shops,

328
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:42,303
specializing in chroming.

329
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:45,471
<i>Mechanics who use them have
to file reports with the EPA.</i>

330
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:47,401
What?

331
00:14:47,406 --> 00:14:48,922
<i>No gambling.</i>

332
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:50,551
Am I interrupting something?

333
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,300
<i>It's just keno, all right?</i>

334
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:56,462
I'm sorry if Hodges lost me
at, uh, hexa-valium chromum.

335
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:59,693
Hexavalent chromium, and
we need to find some.

336
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:02,472
How can we contact the
Environmental Protection Agency?

337
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:04,263
Yeah, I'm on it.

338
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:10,143
This is an auto shop?

339
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:12,423
Yeah, EPA, they shut
it down months ago

340
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:15,210
for, uh, hazardous
waste material.

341
00:15:15,217 --> 00:15:18,723
It was the only shop authorized
to use that chromium stuff.

342
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:22,492
- See it anywhere?  - Could be absorbed
into the dust particles on the floor.

343
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:25,650
Along with the flash paper.

344
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,262
- What's that?
- Betting slips.

345
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:29,521
Burn fast in case
there's a raid.

346
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:34,130
Look at this.

347
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:36,500
They painted a ring
for the fights.

348
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:38,252
So this was
the fight club.

349
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:41,011
If there's blood,
I'd say it is.

350
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:43,703
Where's your, uh,
light thingie?

351
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:52,440
Sangre... Todo el
lugar está cubierto de sangre.

352
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,370
Of the 30 blood samples
found in the body shop,

353
00:15:57,376 --> 00:15:59,451
six were A-positive--
same as Billie Morgan.

354
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,580
Still waiting on DNA.

355
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,943
30 fighters translates to five

356
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:04,003
two-person fights per hour
over a three-hour period.

357
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,851
Or three fights over five hours,
six fights over...

358
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:07,920
We get the idea, Zack.

359
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:08,820
Lots of fights.

360
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:11,421
I ran thermal imaging on
Billie's remaining soft tissue

361
00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:12,803
to reconstruct her injuries.

362
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,161
This is what she might have
looked like after the fight.

363
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,672
Ah, the sweet science.

364
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,110
Just when I get to
a place where I can

365
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:21,842
almost stomach seeing
maggots eating intestines, this.

366
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:24,581
How could anybody do this
to themselves?

367
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:27,762
You know, in 900 B.C.,
the Greek ruler Theseus

368
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:29,492
entertained himself
watching two men in chairs

369
00:16:29,497 --> 00:16:31,341
beat each other
to death.

370
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:34,060
Just saying, it's nothing new.

371
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:35,812
I can work up force
and velocity readings

372
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:37,371
for each blow.

373
00:16:37,377 --> 00:16:38,981
Zack can help me ID her opponent

374
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:41,490
from the circumference
and diameter of the fists.

375
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:44,513
I'd rather Zack focus on our
second weapon for Roberts.

376
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,712
None of these blades
are narrow enough.

377
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:49,150
It's as if his vertebrae
was cut with a razor blade.

378
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:50,452
Or a razor wire.

379
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,420
Luca Brasi.

380
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,073
"The Godfather?"

381
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,432
Please, someone,
buy a DVD player.

382
00:16:58,437 --> 00:16:59,381
You mean a garrote?

383
00:16:59,387 --> 00:17:01,161
HODGINS:
Yes, a garrote
pued so tightly

384
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,850
arnd Lucas...
or rather, Robert's neck...

385
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,223
That it sliced
through his throat

386
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:07,043
and severed his
carotid artery.

387
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:09,512
Okay, the whole maggots
eating intestines thing

388
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:12,453
is not nearly as gross to me now.

389
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,131
Yeah, yeah. Bones, come here.
Okay, thanks a lot.

390
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:17,893
Agent Xang said he found the owner
of the old body shop.

391
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:20,313
He said some guy
paid him $3,000 cash

392
00:17:20,315 --> 00:17:21,861
just to use the
place for one night.

393
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:23,581
No names, no
questions asked.

394
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:25,302
Seems like a theme
in this town.

395
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:27,721
Hey, why is he
hitting on a 16?

396
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,150
I mean, look at him, he's
completely distracted.

397
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:33,071
Well, you know what? Actually, Bones,
you can if the face card is showing...

398
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:35,892
All  right,
let me just...

399
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:38,821
There he is.

400
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:42,402
Look at this, this is
my buddy Lou Mackey.

401
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:44,261
Oh, great,
so we're friends now.

402
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:46,623
Yeah. I need you to tell me
where a fight fan can get a little...

403
00:17:46,626 --> 00:17:49,090
- Seeley?
- Frankie?

404
00:17:49,095 --> 00:17:51,123
What are you doing
back in Vegas, huh?

405
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:53,142
- Look at this.
- Man's got a lot of friends.

406
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:54,680
So it would seem.

407
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:56,392
I'll catch up with
you later, Frankie.

408
00:17:56,395 --> 00:17:57,472
Hey, Lou...

409
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:58,751
See you, friend.

410
00:17:58,755 --> 00:17:59,633
Is he a problem?

411
00:17:59,638 --> 00:18:01,272
No, no, it's all good, huh?

412
00:18:01,277 --> 00:18:02,713
Hey, look at you, huh?

413
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:03,772
Yeah.

414
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:05,800
Frankie Daniels.
Hey, Temperance Brennan,

415
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:07,733
Frank Daniels. We served
in the Gulf together.

416
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:08,272
That's right.

417
00:18:08,276 --> 00:18:09,803
Hit the strip
the minute we got back.

418
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:11,210
And you never left?

419
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:12,941
I bounce around, you know,

420
00:18:12,947 --> 00:18:15,651
here, Chicago, L.A.
You know me, huh, Seel?

421
00:18:15,658 --> 00:18:17,850
- Always chasing rainbows.
- Good old Frankie boy.

422
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:19,241
How's Karen?

423
00:18:19,247 --> 00:18:21,232
No, no, that's over, you know?

424
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:23,273
She ran off with some
loser stockbroker.

425
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:25,010
It's just as well.
I don't need that.

426
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,510
Come on, Frankie.
You all right?

427
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:27,961
- You don't need...
- Don't start with that, huh?

428
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,770
It's been too many years.
I'm getting by, all right?

429
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,031
Yeah, guys like Lou Mackey?

430
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:35,193
Yeah, well, you know, minor,
uh, minor occupational hazard.

431
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,780
Have you considered medication?

432
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:37,763
Oh, Bones.

433
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:40,812
An antidepressant might
raise your norepinephrine level.

434
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:42,973
It could help control
the impulsivity.

435
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,550
What are you, a drug rep
now or something?

436
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,360
It's...

437
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,372
Excuse us, Bones, okay?

438
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:50,650
Wondering if you
know anything about

439
00:18:50,656 --> 00:18:52,501
these, uh, underground
fight clubs.

440
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,113
Uh, yeah, actually,
I do know one.

441
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:56,272
Bare knuckles, no rules.

442
00:18:56,277 --> 00:18:58,112
I need to
know where.
It moves around.

443
00:18:58,206 --> 00:19:01,201
This guy, this guy Joe Nolan,
he sells 800 numbers.

444
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,221
You call, you find out the time, the place,
code to get in.

445
00:19:04,237 --> 00:19:05,840
Like the old boxer Joe Nolan?

446
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:07,772
Yeah, welterweight champ in '92.

447
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:09,972
He owns a gym here on Federal.

448
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:11,091
Thanks.

449
00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:12,002
Hey, uh,

450
00:19:12,008 --> 00:19:14,172
think you can spot me
a couple of bucks?

451
00:19:14,177 --> 00:19:16,471
Think I forgot my wallet at the house there,
you know?

452
00:19:16,477 --> 00:19:17,642
Yeah.

453
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:19,912
Just something, you know.
I'll get youback.

454
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:24,440
Frankie's a better guy
than he seems.

455
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:26,561
And yet he knows
this Nolan guy.

456
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,061
Anybody who knows
the fight game knows Joe Nolan.

457
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:30,671
I mean, the guy,
he was, you know,

458
00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:32,623
set to be the
next Sugar Ray.

459
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,281
Till he was accused of, you
know, throwing a couple fights.

460
00:19:35,537 --> 00:19:38,911
You mean losing on purpose?
Why would anyone do that?

461
00:19:38,915 --> 00:19:40,650
Maybe I should just
talk to Joe alone.

462
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:43,162
What's with this sudden
impulse to leave me behind?

463
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:43,973
I'll tell you,
Bones, all right,

464
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,942
the usual rules,
they don't apply here, okay?

465
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:49,451
The deeper we get, I don't want
anyone knowing that we're FBI.

466
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,492
Well, that's easy
for me-- I'm not.

467
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:52,440
Okay, fine.

468
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:07,532
Hey, what do you think?

469
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:08,313
I have enough Bibles,

470
00:20:08,316 --> 00:20:09,480
thank you, but try next door.

471
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,220
You said I could be
a school teacher.

472
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:13,710
Not the spinster kind who lives
with a sister, but, you know,

473
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:16,201
the hot one who makes
the boys crazy. Here.

474
00:20:16,205 --> 00:20:18,792
Put on the one
that I picked out.

475
00:20:18,795 --> 00:20:19,440
All right?

476
00:20:19,447 --> 00:20:21,503
Okay, but don't
be so bossy.

477
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:23,200
We're newlyweds,
I said.

478
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:25,260
Taking Sin City by storm.

479
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:27,550
Ready for action.

480
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:30,871
But you know, marriage is such
an archaic institution.

481
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:33,732
Listen, Bones,
I know what I'm doing, okay?

482
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:35,710
I've done this before.

483
00:20:35,738 --> 00:20:37,460
Just stop arguing.

484
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:38,800
Well, I'm not,
it's just, you know,

485
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:40,303
I don't need a piece of paper

486
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,853
to prove my
commitment.

487
00:20:42,017 --> 00:20:43,961
Fine, we're engaged.

488
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:46,161
Why would I be okay
with engagement?

489
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,992
Whatever, Bones, all right?

490
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,711
We're a loosely committed couple

491
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:51,461
of hot high rollers.

492
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:53,801
See? With money to burn.

493
00:20:53,808 --> 00:20:57,120
'Cause that is what's gonna
get us in the door.

494
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:01,100
Like this?

495
00:21:04,957 --> 00:21:07,950
Yeah.
Yeah, like that.

496
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:14,142
Hey, Cam.

497
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,660
Dr. Brennan, judging by
the angle of the blows,

498
00:21:16,665 --> 00:21:19,471
Billie's last opponent
was five-six and left-handed.

499
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:22,121
With a fist size of
approximately 90 millimeters.

500
00:21:22,187 --> 00:21:23,631
Zack measured.

501
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:24,691
That's hot.

502
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:25,871
Hot?

503
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,170
Wait a minute.
What's hot?

504
00:21:28,176 --> 00:21:29,720
Uh, nothing.

505
00:21:29,885 --> 00:21:32,553
Vegas, Vegas is hot.

506
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:33,930
It's very hot here.

507
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:39,251
How does anyone actually
walk in these things?

508
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:42,080
Well, them boots, they ain't
made for walking, sweetheart.

509
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:44,053
Okay, that was
completely over the top.

510
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:46,331
Oh, you know, you play your
part and I'll play mine.

511
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:50,072
Hey Booth, the girl.

512
00:21:50,296 --> 00:21:51,473
Yeah, I see.

513
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,081
- 5'6" southpaw.
- Yeah, and left-handed.

514
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,813
Can I help you folks?

515
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,530
Well, I can't
believe it, huh.

516
00:21:57,538 --> 00:22:00,001
- Sloppy Joe Nolan.
- Sloppy Joe?

517
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:01,602
Yeah, that's how
he left his opponents.

518
00:22:01,606 --> 00:22:03,111
These days it's just Joe.

519
00:22:03,336 --> 00:22:04,582
Hey, I busted a lace, Joe.

520
00:22:04,587 --> 00:22:06,922
Sorry to bother you, Joe,
but you know, you had a huge

521
00:22:06,928 --> 00:22:09,533
impact on my, uh, style
back in the army.

522
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:11,773
You know, the juke to the
body, fall back right hook

523
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:12,921
worked for me
every time.

524
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:14,210
Another army fighter, Joe?

525
00:22:14,218 --> 00:22:15,832
How many of these has-beens
you get in here a week?

526
00:22:15,837 --> 00:22:17,820
At least this one still looks
like he's in shape.

527
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:21,050
Oh, yeah, my man's
in great shape, believe me.

528
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:22,242
Easy there, honey.

529
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:23,540
Well, let's see it, army.

530
00:22:23,548 --> 00:22:25,453
Show us those moves
that made you so famous.

531
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,133
Oh yeah, go ahead, tiger,
show these clowns.

532
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:30,553
- Come on.
- Maybe I will, just for a little.

533
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:31,930
Yeah, come on, tiger.

534
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,691
All right, let's see, Joe.

535
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:36,001
Give that little,
you know, tap,

536
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,951
you know, juke to
the body, with a hard

537
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,452
Right. Followed by
a whole bunch of them.

538
00:22:47,386 --> 00:22:50,512
So much for my has-been
army fighter.

539
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:51,150
Not bad.

540
00:22:51,157 --> 00:22:52,290
You know, I still got it.

541
00:22:52,297 --> 00:22:54,171
Yeah, maybe a
little too much.

542
00:22:54,177 --> 00:22:55,613
What's your name?
Tony Scallion.

543
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:57,440
Here's my fiancée, Roxanne.

544
00:22:57,446 --> 00:23:00,033
Yeah, we're more
engaged to be engaged.

545
00:23:00,036 --> 00:23:01,390
So you looking to train or what?

546
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:02,902
Ah, you know, I don't
fight no more.

547
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:04,902
But they say that you could
direct me and Roxie

548
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:07,922
to a little, uh,
you know, underground action.

549
00:34:30,107 --> 00:34:31,633
They say a lot, don't they.

550
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:33,102
Yeah, well, some guy
at the Rio,

551
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:35,330
one of them, uh, you
didn't hear it from me types.

552
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,363
Sorry. Can't help you.

553
00:34:37,437 --> 00:34:39,101
Uh, what'd I tell you, Tony?
That guy was just

554
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:39,231
trying to hit on me.

555
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:41,431
Though I do know a
number you could call.

556
00:34:41,507 --> 00:34:43,430
Not that I give it
to just anybody.

557
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:44,862
Oh, come on, Joe.

558
00:34:44,938 --> 00:34:47,000
They seem like such nice people.

559
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:49,333
Yeah, we're nice people.

560
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:50,663
A thousand bucks,

561
00:34:50,736 --> 00:34:51,760
each.

562
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:52,832
Oh, that's a little

563
00:34:52,906 --> 00:34:55,101
steep.
No, Tony, come on.

564
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:55,231
We only live once and
I want to see a fight.

565
00:34:58,135 --> 00:34:59,463
(grunts)

566
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:04,502
Nothing like being
a kept man, huh?

567
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:06,632
Yeah, I don't know
what I'd do without her.

568
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,261
That was amazing.
What got into you?

569
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:14,060
It's from when I used to watch
old movies with my dad.

570
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:14,202
He really liked Clara Bow.

571
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,530
Clara Bow was a silent
film star, Bones.

572
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:21,103
Yeah, but I-I guess that's how
I always imagined she sounded.

573
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:24,630
Just like you imagined she
carried around a wad of cash?

574
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,601
Oh, that.

575
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,860
No, I couldn't sleep last night,

576
00:35:26,936 --> 00:35:29,701
so I snuck off to play
a little crap.

577
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:30,930
Craps, Bones, plural.

578
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:32,531
And I can't believe your
beginner's luck.

579
00:35:32,636 --> 00:35:34,330
Don't say that. You'll jinx it.

580
00:35:34,437 --> 00:35:35,663
Since when do you
believe in jinxes?

581
00:35:35,768 --> 00:35:37,030
I don't, but after hearing

582
00:35:37,107 --> 00:35:37,163
the crap dealer say it--

583
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,233
Crap dealer's right,
all right, no jinxes.

584
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:41,830
We got a big night ahead of us.

585
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:44,801
<i>HODGINS:
All right,</i>

586
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:47,232
the federal prosecutor
here and Billie here.

587
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:49,203
Both show evidence
of topical chemicals.

588
00:35:49,268 --> 00:35:50,830
Now this will extract
the elements I need

589
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:52,532
to cross-reference with
the dead beetles,

590
00:35:52,606 --> 00:35:54,031
safely.

591
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:55,431
Not that she was safe.

592
00:35:55,505 --> 00:35:57,962
Letting herself get drawn
into a fight like that.
Mm.

593
00:35:58,036 --> 00:36:00,162
We've all been in a fight
or two we wish we hadn't.

594
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:02,033
Not me.

595
00:36:02,107 --> 00:36:03,130
You've never fought?

596
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:05,601
Never thrown a punch?

597
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:07,503
Never saw the logic of it.

598
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:09,000
It's not about logic.

599
00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:11,701
It's-it's, it's
emotional, it's anger.

600
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:12,830
I don't get angry.

601
00:36:12,906 --> 00:36:14,362
It's not rational.
What if you were sitting

602
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,330
on the beach and someone
kicked sand in your face?

603
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,360
I don't go to the beach.

604
00:36:17,435 --> 00:36:18,703
All right, work with
me here, Zack.

605
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:19,833
There has to be something

606
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:22,032
that would piss you off.
What if I call

607
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:24,330
call you a scrawny
twit who can't hold

608
00:36:24,405 --> 00:36:25,963
a normal conversation
with a ten year old.

609
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:27,931
I don't have much in common
with a ten year old.

610
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:29,903
And although I don't know
what a twit is,

611
00:36:29,965 --> 00:36:32,003
objectively, I am thin
and lack muscular definition.

612
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:33,202
Dude,

613
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:35,932
you're a Vulcan, and
a dull Vulcan at that.

614
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:37,061
Can we please work?

615
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:39,133
All right,
now you're pissing me off.

616
00:36:39,236 --> 00:36:41,631
You're a freak, man.
Anger is a part of being human.

617
00:36:41,706 --> 00:36:43,160
Grow a set.

618
00:36:43,238 --> 00:36:45,262
I would really like to work,
Hodgins.
You know,

619
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:46,800
it is not enough to be some

620
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:49,563
botic second-rate grad
student.

621
00:36:49,637 --> 00:36:50,703
I am the most

622
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:52,431
valuable and accomplished
grad student

623
00:36:52,536 --> 00:36:54,201
whose ever been installed
at the Jeffersonian.

624
00:36:54,266 --> 00:36:55,703
Yeah, and you're going
to be a grad student

625
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:57,963
the rest of your life,
because you have no fire.

626
00:36:58,037 --> 00:37:00,302
I'm working on my dissertation.

627
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:01,332
Oh, please.

628
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:02,732
You've been saying that
for years.

629
00:37:02,808 --> 00:37:04,360
You're a poser.
You don't have

630
00:37:04,437 --> 00:37:05,700
your doctorate
because you have no drive.

631
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,061
No passion for
what you love.

632
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,832
Dude.

633
00:37:17,908 --> 00:37:19,130
It's not what you think.

634
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:20,663
You got pissed.

635
00:37:20,735 --> 00:37:23,603
No, striking you merely seemed
to be the most practical way

636
00:37:23,665 --> 00:37:25,762
to get you to be quiet
and focus on work.

637
00:37:25,836 --> 00:37:28,200
But I didn't realize
how much it would hurt.

638
00:37:28,268 --> 00:37:30,833
Nice punch though.

639
00:37:30,906 --> 00:37:32,001
Thank you.

640
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:33,603
And my dissertation
will be finished

641
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:34,862
by the end of the month.

642
00:37:34,937 --> 00:37:36,463
Have the chemicals
been extracted yet?

643
00:37:36,535 --> 00:37:37,763
Looks good.

644
00:37:37,835 --> 00:37:39,800
Dr. Brennan wanted the results
as soon as possible.

645
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:41,703
I'm moving.

646
00:37:41,768 --> 00:37:44,202
You're not going to hit me
again, are you?

647
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,760
BRENNAN:
I suppose from an

648
00:38:14,836 --> 00:38:14,902
anthropological standpoint,

649
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:19,232
this taps into the annihilistic
part of the human psyche,

650
00:38:19,336 --> 00:38:20,402
fascinated by blood

651
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:21,661
and gore.

652
00:38:21,738 --> 00:38:21,802
That's human fighting.

653
00:38:22,807 --> 00:38:23,961
More like lesser

654
00:38:24,037 --> 00:38:26,163
surrogates engaged
in battles on behalf

655
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:26,302
of the elite lords
who don't have the courage

656
00:38:28,337 --> 00:38:29,662
to fight themselves.

657
00:38:29,735 --> 00:38:33,131
Well, you know what,
come back to me Roxie.
Ooh,

658
00:38:33,236 --> 00:38:34,860
look at all this sweat.

659
00:38:38,638 --> 00:38:38,702
That's it, it's over.

660
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:41,163
Your winner.
Little Mikey!

661
00:38:43,236 --> 00:38:44,833
Come on, give it up.

662
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:45,903
Give it up, everybody.

663
00:38:45,968 --> 00:38:47,863
Come on for Little Mikey,
let's go.

664
00:38:47,938 --> 00:38:50,332
(cheering)

665
00:38:54,136 --> 00:38:54,202
What theell
are you looking at?

666
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:55,560
Not much.

667
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:02,003
Hey,

668
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:03,762
Tony.

669
00:43:09,408 --> 00:43:11,432
Sorry, Booth.
I just couldn't have you blowing

670
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,832
my cover.
Ah, yeah,

671
00:43:12,908 --> 00:43:15,033
and as they taught us
in Quantico, Walt,

672
00:43:15,108 --> 00:43:16,802
I wasn't about to.
Do you know everyone

673
00:43:16,868 --> 00:43:17,962
in this town?

674
00:43:18,036 --> 00:43:19,502
I had no idea
we had an agent in there.

675
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:21,562
Yeah, I'm on a special
recourse assignment,

676
00:43:21,637 --> 00:43:24,261
under deep cover about a month.
Still can't crack who's

677
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,960
running the show.
What do you know
about Joe Nolan?

678
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:28,432
Uh, he low level guy,
one of many buffers.

679
00:43:28,507 --> 00:43:30,131
That 800 number he sells

680
00:43:30,205 --> 00:43:32,302
changes with every event.
Trying to track him is

681
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:33,303
like playing whack-a-mole.

682
00:43:33,368 --> 00:43:34,661
Have you ever seen

683
00:43:34,735 --> 00:43:36,200
her fight at the club?

684
00:43:36,267 --> 00:43:39,702
Uh, yeah, it's um,
Billie something, right?

685
00:43:39,765 --> 00:43:41,432
Yeah, 4-1 underdog.

686
00:43:41,508 --> 00:43:43,900
Oh, she whooped this hot Latina
pretty good.

687
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:45,560
Latina, about 5'6"

688
00:43:45,636 --> 00:43:46,731
left-handed?

689
00:43:46,806 --> 00:43:47,963
She works out at Nolan's club?

690
00:43:48,035 --> 00:43:49,433
Yeah, Marisol.
Tough as nails,

691
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:51,201
and undefeated before
your girl came along.

692
00:43:51,267 --> 00:43:53,463
Well, what if
Billie bet on herself.

693
00:43:53,536 --> 00:43:54,960
Well, you know what,
with the money

694
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:58,702
that Don borrowed, uh,
$8,000, you know, 4-1 odds,

695
00:43:58,765 --> 00:44:00,160
that'd get under their feet

696
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,760
in a hurry.
Maybe that's what
got her killed.

697
00:44:01,837 --> 00:44:03,503
Well, we got to talk
to this Marisol person.

698
00:44:03,567 --> 00:44:05,633
Yeah, we'll go find her.
So what's next for you?

699
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:09,562
Uhsprained my wrist two fights
ago with no chance to heal.

700
00:44:09,636 --> 00:44:11,632
If I lose another bout,
I'm off the rotation.

701
00:44:11,707 --> 00:44:12,861
Booth's a boxer.

702
00:44:12,965 --> 00:44:14,361
Excuse me?

703
00:44:14,435 --> 00:44:16,230
I'm just saying,
if we can find a way to get you

704
00:44:16,307 --> 00:44:17,660
into the rotation,
you can fight Walt

705
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,302
and lose, and
then he can stay

706
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:20,503
and maybe have
a chance to heal.

707
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:21,602
You're volunteering me to fight?

708
00:44:21,668 --> 00:44:23,163
(phone rings)
No, I'm volunteering you

709
00:44:23,268 --> 00:44:25,001
to throw one.
You could lose with

710
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:26,303
your hands tied
behind your back.

711
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:27,761
Hey, Hodgins.

712
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,531
How's this for coincidence?

713
00:44:29,605 --> 00:44:29,660
Scarab beetles from Robert's
body had the same short lifespan

714
00:44:33,165 --> 00:44:35,062
as Billie's,
but not from cortisone.

715
00:44:35,136 --> 00:44:37,900
His bugs died from ingesting
Pinus elliottii.

716
00:44:37,968 --> 00:44:40,561
Pine? In the desert?

717
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:42,861
Yeah, pine oil resin is
often used

718
00:44:42,937 --> 00:44:45,400
to treat the same skin
conditions as the cortisone

719
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:46,903
that killed the other beetles.

720
00:44:46,968 --> 00:44:49,202
Okay, confirm that
and get back to me.

721
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:53,601
Pine oil.
Okay.

722
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:53,731
Pine oil.

723
00:44:55,366 --> 00:44:57,260
What's that mean?

724
00:44:57,336 --> 00:44:58,462
I don't know yet.

725
00:45:00,705 --> 00:45:02,500
Go pick your fight.

726
00:45:02,565 --> 00:45:02,630
What the hell is all
this about anyway?

727
00:45:06,008 --> 00:45:06,060
He insulted me, Joe.

728
00:45:07,306 --> 00:45:09,861
He needs a beating
and I need the money.

729
00:45:09,936 --> 00:45:11,630
I thought you didn't
fight anymore.
Ah,

730
00:45:11,707 --> 00:45:12,831
you know,
that was before I got

731
00:45:12,938 --> 00:45:14,802
blind-sided out
of retirement, huh?

732
00:45:14,868 --> 00:45:15,933
Will, uh, this do?

733
00:45:18,038 --> 00:45:22,061
Glad to see your sugar mama
taught you a thing or two.

734
00:45:27,305 --> 00:45:28,362
Hey,

735
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:29,763
Bones, fight's on.

736
00:45:29,865 --> 00:45:31,500
No trouble convincing Joe?
Nah.

737
00:45:31,568 --> 00:45:32,630
Nothing a stack of
bills couldn't fix.

738
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,400
She give us anything yet?
Nothing.

739
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:35,760
We're going to need a warrant.

740
00:45:35,837 --> 00:45:36,803
For what? What's
our evidence?

741
00:45:36,866 --> 00:45:38,732
Agent Xang's talking to it.

742
00:45:38,805 --> 00:45:42,501
Marisol's bones, tissue and
muscle are still healing.

743
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:44,360
If we can match her injuries
to Billie's,

744
00:45:44,437 --> 00:45:45,502
we can prove they fought.

745
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:46,661
If the fight's
what killed Billie,

746
00:45:46,738 --> 00:45:48,231
Marisol's guilty
of manslaughter.
Ah.

747
00:45:48,305 --> 00:45:49,562
Which would give us leverage

748
00:45:49,635 --> 00:45:49,703
to force her to give up
whoever runs these fights.

749
00:45:51,308 --> 00:45:53,602
Which she might do
in exchange for protection.

750
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,603
So what you want to do is,
you want to get her DNA sample

751
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:55,733
send them back
to the Jeffersonian.

752
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:58,760
Actually,
I want to send Marisol.

753
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:00,730
This girl, the whole girl?

754
00:46:00,808 --> 00:46:00,863
Our squints
can perform a live autopsy

755
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:04,631
while our thermal
imaging programs

756
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:06,432
reconstruct a
theoretical find.

757
00:46:06,506 --> 00:46:08,360
You know, you're lucky
I know a very understanding

758
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,761
judge in Vegas.
Of course you do.

759
00:46:17,735 --> 00:46:19,902
Okay, Marisol.

760
00:46:19,966 --> 00:46:22,060
You're not under arrest.
You're just

761
00:46:22,136 --> 00:46:24,932
here as evidence. So when this
nice agent leaves you here...

762
00:46:25,008 --> 00:46:26,533
I'm going to kick
your skinny ass.

763
00:46:26,606 --> 00:46:27,762
Honey, I'm from the Bronx.

764
00:46:27,836 --> 00:46:29,801
Don't for a second think
you scare me.

765
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:32,561
Look, I didn't kill nobody,
all right?

766
00:46:32,637 --> 00:46:33,560
I didn't even fight.

767
00:46:33,636 --> 00:46:34,700
Well, if that's true,

768
00:46:34,768 --> 00:46:36,332
let's go over to the scanner
and prove it.

769
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:38,331
Or disprove it.
Hodgins.

770
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:40,563
I'll take your robe.

771
00:46:40,638 --> 00:46:42,203
Is this going to hurt?

772
00:46:42,268 --> 00:46:43,360
You won't even know
it's happening.

773
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,562
Marisol, sorry
if these are cold.

774
00:46:53,865 --> 00:46:55,663
(beeping)

775
00:46:55,735 --> 00:46:56,731
What just happened?

776
00:46:56,806 --> 00:46:57,961
Blood pools
in recent injuries.

777
00:46:58,037 --> 00:46:59,632
Thermal imaging
records that.

778
00:46:59,706 --> 00:47:01,900
Now we're going to
match your injuries

779
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:03,103
against Billie Morgan's.

780
00:47:03,165 --> 00:47:03,231
(cheering)

781
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:11,403
Are you nervous?

782
00:47:11,466 --> 00:47:12,563
About what, huh?

783
00:47:12,635 --> 00:47:12,701
Throw a few to
make it look good

784
00:47:14,408 --> 00:47:16,160
and I let Walt
take me down.

785
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:21,363
It's over!

786
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:23,603
Your winner.

787
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:25,930
Diana. The destroyer!

788
00:47:28,808 --> 00:47:28,860
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

789
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:32,662
We've got some fresh blood

790
00:47:32,765 --> 00:47:34,363
to shed for you tonight.

791
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:38,231
The great Tony the Tiger!

792
00:47:38,337 --> 00:47:39,933
(audience booing)

793
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:43,333
Why are they booing?

794
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:43,463
They find it more fun
than cheering.

795
00:47:45,107 --> 00:47:45,160
That's the guy

796
00:47:47,235 --> 00:47:49,531
from Nolan's gym.
Yeah, I had a
feeling we'd

797
00:47:49,635 --> 00:47:50,831
see him again.
Hey,

798
00:47:50,906 --> 00:47:52,901
Tony.
What are you
doing over here?

799
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:54,033
Yeah, you're
supposed to be

800
00:47:54,106 --> 00:47:55,363
over there.
Hold on, folks.

801
00:47:55,438 --> 00:47:55,500
There's been a change
in the cards.

802
00:47:57,568 --> 00:47:59,030
I'm sorry, man, they pulled me.

803
00:47:59,108 --> 00:47:59,160
They what?
In this corner,

804
00:48:00,868 --> 00:48:00,932
a man who needs no
introduction,

805
00:48:04,136 --> 00:48:07,400
Monroe!

806
00:48:07,466 --> 00:48:07,532
They said Monroe

807
00:48:08,606 --> 00:48:09,960
would be a bigger draw
for the betters.

808
00:48:10,037 --> 00:48:12,160
Yeah, you know,
he's sort of bigger everything.

809
00:48:12,237 --> 00:48:14,361
(cheering)

810
00:48:14,435 --> 00:48:16,133
All right, ladies
and gentlemen,

811
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:18,563
place your bets.
Last call for wagers

812
00:48:18,638 --> 00:48:21,160
right now.
Get your money down.

813
00:48:21,268 --> 00:48:23,362
(cheering, Monroe growling)

814
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:24,563
You can't fight him, Booth.

815
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:26,401
He'll kill you.

816
00:48:26,465 --> 00:48:28,163
I don't really
have a choice, Roxie.

817
00:48:28,237 --> 00:48:33,260
Tiger, center ring, now.

818
00:48:39,335 --> 00:48:41,203
Okay, boys,
on my signal.

819
00:48:41,305 --> 00:48:42,600
Kill!

820
00:48:42,707 --> 00:48:44,302
(crowd cheering)

821
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:47,930
ADDY:
Damage to Billie's scapula
and thoracic vertebrae...

822
00:48:48,005 --> 00:48:52,031
Force and velocity match patella
damage to Marisol's left knee.

823
00:48:52,108 --> 00:48:54,060
This contusion on
Billie's fifth rib,

824
00:48:54,136 --> 00:48:55,463
the mark looks like
it was delivered

825
00:48:55,536 --> 00:48:57,300
by a heel or a fist.

826
00:48:57,365 --> 00:49:01,733
<i>Now a right, followed
by a grab to the throat,</i>

827
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:05,900
<i>and Billie's down again.</i>

828
00:49:06,005 --> 00:49:07,932
<i>More damage to the scapula.</i>

829
00:49:08,008 --> 00:49:09,460
(grunting)

830
00:49:09,536 --> 00:49:10,500
<i>HODGINS:
Whoa.</i>

831
00:49:10,568 --> 00:49:11,901
Easy on Billie's
chest there, Marisol.

832
00:49:11,967 --> 00:49:12,033
ADDY:
Hairline fracture
of Billie's sternum

833
00:49:14,135 --> 00:49:15,331
at the third
costal cartilage

834
00:49:15,407 --> 00:49:18,201
is congruent with damage
to Marisol's left hand.

835
00:49:18,266 --> 00:49:20,030
And we have another match.

836
00:49:20,105 --> 00:49:22,930
<i>Billie ducks and causes
the maxillary fractures</i>

837
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:25,563
<i>of Marisol's skull.</i>

838
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:28,303
Marisol seems to favor
the right to the body,

839
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:29,733
left to the head combo.

840
00:49:29,806 --> 00:49:30,832
I do not.

841
00:49:30,906 --> 00:49:32,030
You can deny it all you want.

842
00:49:32,106 --> 00:49:33,262
We've got the evidence
right here.

843
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:36,363
<i>The choke hold...
Excuse me. Tony!</i>

844
00:49:36,436 --> 00:49:37,960
<i>...matches the bruising
on Billie's neck.</i>

845
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,833
Tony! Stay down.

846
00:49:41,906 --> 00:49:44,203
(grunts)

847
00:49:44,308 --> 00:49:47,063
Monroe has calcium deposits
on his left medial epicondyle.

848
00:49:47,136 --> 00:49:49,461
And that helps me how?

849
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:52,502
Excuse me.

850
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:55,202
Excuse me.

851
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:57,461
He can't extend his arms,

852
00:49:57,535 --> 00:49:57,601
and he lacks range of motion
in his quadratus lumborum.

853
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:03,130
Hit him there.

854
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,332
Hit him where?

855
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:06,963
His lower back,
above his right kidney.

856
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:11,002
The tide has turned,
my friends.

857
00:50:11,106 --> 00:50:13,262
MARISOL:
I told you she could fight.

858
00:50:13,335 --> 00:50:15,131
She doesn't fight,
she dominates.

859
00:50:15,207 --> 00:50:17,131
(crowd cheering)

860
00:50:19,236 --> 00:50:19,303
Give him
your Nolan move.

861
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:36,031
(thud)

862
00:50:48,466 --> 00:50:50,763
Wow.

863
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:52,760
You can say that again.

864
00:50:52,836 --> 00:50:54,500
How could I miss that?

865
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:56,102
We all missed it, Zack.

866
00:50:56,168 --> 00:50:57,162
MARISOL:
Missed what?

867
00:50:57,238 --> 00:50:58,303
What is it?

868
00:50:58,365 --> 00:50:59,301
Your winner!

869
00:50:59,368 --> 00:51:01,262
Your winner!
(crowd grumbling)

870
00:51:01,335 --> 00:51:03,203
Tony, the man-eating tiger!

871
00:51:03,267 --> 00:51:06,131
Tony t Tiger.

872
00:51:06,235 --> 00:51:07,931
I did it. I did it.
(phone ringing)

873
00:51:08,007 --> 00:51:10,901
Your winner!
Your phone is ringing.

874
00:51:12,006 --> 00:51:13,530
(groaning)

875
00:51:13,606 --> 00:51:14,800
Hey, Cam.

876
00:51:14,865 --> 00:51:14,933
SAROYAN:
We missed it.

877
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,400
The fatablow was obscured
by all her other injuries.

878
00:51:19,466 --> 00:51:21,063
Marisol cracked Billie's ribs,

879
00:51:21,135 --> 00:51:22,733
but not hard enough
to puncture the lung.

880
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:25,233
It was a bat,
the same baseball bat

881
00:51:25,306 --> 00:51:27,203
that killed
the federal prosecutor.

882
00:51:27,266 --> 00:51:27,330
What is it?

883
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:31,201
It was a baseball bat
that killed Billie.

884
00:55:44,235 --> 00:55:45,732
<i>MONTENEGRO:
So when you're dressed,</i>

885
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:49,562
um, the agent will take you
back to the airport.

886
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:53,800
Marisol...

887
00:55:57,037 --> 00:55:59,330
Why do you fight?

888
00:55:59,405 --> 00:55:59,461
Where else am I going to make
a thousand in one night

889
00:56:02,538 --> 00:56:04,101
without selling myself?

890
00:56:04,206 --> 00:56:07,461
And I could make even
more betting on myself.

891
00:56:07,536 --> 00:56:09,603
Long as I ain't greedy.

892
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:10,931
What do you mean, greedy?

893
00:56:11,008 --> 00:56:13,133
Bookies don't mind us making
a few bucks on the side.

894
00:56:13,205 --> 00:56:14,401
But just a few.

895
00:56:14,468 --> 00:56:15,901
Had you bet on your fight
with Billie?

896
00:56:15,968 --> 00:56:17,560
Girl cost me $200.

897
00:56:17,638 --> 00:56:19,162
Had Billie bet on herself?

898
00:56:21,405 --> 00:56:22,830
Marisol?

899
00:56:22,907 --> 00:56:25,832
From what I heard...

900
00:56:25,907 --> 00:56:28,361
some guys picked Billie up
after the fight.

901
00:56:28,436 --> 00:56:29,701
They didn't look
too happy.

902
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:32,101
Why didn't you tell the police
or tell us?

903
00:56:32,166 --> 00:56:35,760
Look, I might not have much,
but what I got, I aim to keep.

904
00:56:35,835 --> 00:56:37,760
What could be
so important to you

905
00:56:37,835 --> 00:56:39,961
that you could let somebody
get away with murder?

906
00:56:40,036 --> 00:56:41,931
My daughter.

907
00:56:42,006 --> 00:56:43,062
She's two.

908
00:56:43,136 --> 00:56:44,762
She lives with
my mom, okay?

909
00:56:44,837 --> 00:56:46,433
And if they found out
I was brought here...

910
00:56:46,538 --> 00:56:48,663
Who's they?

911
00:56:50,137 --> 00:56:52,230
Look, I don't know.

912
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:54,631
And I don't want to know.

913
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:57,561
I'm sorry.

914
00:57:01,936 --> 00:57:02,000
BRENNAN:
Thanks, Angela.

915
00:57:04,335 --> 00:57:06,002
So we were right.

916
00:57:06,067 --> 00:57:07,830
Billie bet on herself,

917
00:57:07,906 --> 00:57:10,332
which is why
I bet on you.
You bet on me?

918
00:57:10,406 --> 00:57:11,563
Yeah, with Nick,
the guy from Nolan's gym.

919
00:57:11,635 --> 00:57:13,263
It was one of
two reasons, actually,

920
00:57:13,338 --> 00:57:15,830
but when I heard
the odds I couldn't...
My odds?

921
00:57:15,907 --> 00:57:16,801
Yeah.
What were they?

922
00:57:16,906 --> 00:57:18,361
Well, you were 20-1 underdog.

923
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:20,161
So I bet with Nick,
figuring tt if...

924
00:57:20,238 --> 00:57:21,762
Wait, 20-1 against?

925
00:57:21,836 --> 00:57:23,633
Really? Did I
look that bad?

926
00:57:23,707 --> 00:57:26,461
If Nick pays me,
he's not our guy.

927
00:57:26,536 --> 00:57:27,700
But if he doesn't pay me,

928
00:57:27,765 --> 00:57:29,531
it m not prove
he killed Billie,

929
00:57:29,606 --> 00:57:31,031
but it'll put him
in strong contention.

930
00:57:31,108 --> 00:57:34,162
At the very least.
Very smart, Bones.

931
00:57:34,236 --> 00:57:35,330
What was the other reason?

932
00:57:36,466 --> 00:57:38,500
Come on.
I have winnings to collect.

933
00:57:38,608 --> 00:57:39,963
<i>BRENNAN:
Hey, Nick.</i>

934
00:57:42,038 --> 00:57:43,561
Thought you ran out on us.

935
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,831
Nick Arno don't run
from anybody, sweetheart.

936
00:57:45,937 --> 00:57:48,563
Arno? Sweet Pete's kid?

937
00:57:48,638 --> 00:57:50,562
That was quite a show
you put on tonight, army boy.

938
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:52,703
Yeah, well, you know,
I had my lucky charm here.

939
00:57:52,768 --> 00:57:54,933
Yeah, and I believe
you owe us some money.

940
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:57,761
I suppose, but...

941
00:57:57,838 --> 00:57:59,560
see, the gentlemen
I answer to,

942
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:00,961
they have sort of
an unwritten rule

943
00:58:01,036 --> 00:58:01,100
about fighters getting greedy.

944
00:58:02,306 --> 00:58:04,263
Plus their spouses,
too, I'm afraid.

945
00:58:04,365 --> 00:58:06,231
No, we're not married.
We're not even engaged.

946
00:58:06,305 --> 00:58:07,963
Wait, what's
the rule?

947
00:58:08,037 --> 00:58:10,633
Enjoy a taste,
but never expect a meal.

948
00:58:10,707 --> 00:58:12,733
Least of all
with a ringer involved.

949
00:58:12,808 --> 00:58:14,732
I ain't no ringer.

950
00:58:14,807 --> 00:58:16,400
What's a ringer?
They think I cheated.

951
00:58:16,466 --> 00:58:17,603
She's good, army boy.

952
00:58:17,666 --> 00:58:19,030
Real good.

953
00:58:19,138 --> 00:58:21,703
But I seen Monroe take out
whole biker gangs.

954
00:58:21,768 --> 00:58:23,103
Then I want
my thousand bucks back.

955
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,301
Consider it a fine.

956
00:58:24,365 --> 00:58:25,363
Fine? Are you serious?

957
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,703
Maybe I'm not
making myself clear here.

958
00:58:27,768 --> 00:58:27,832
As our new top seed,
he works for us now.

959
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:33,763
You don't just punch out
our best guy and walk away.

960
00:58:33,835 --> 00:58:35,703
Not when there's
more money to be made.

961
00:58:35,768 --> 00:58:38,231
You think you can
make me fight for you?

962
00:58:38,335 --> 00:58:39,503
You only find out
if you don't.

963
00:58:39,565 --> 00:58:39,631
Then you know what?

964
00:58:40,905 --> 00:58:43,461
I want to talk to this gentleman
that you answer to.

965
00:58:43,536 --> 00:58:45,032
And I want world peace.

966
00:58:45,135 --> 00:58:47,001
Look, take my advice.

967
00:58:47,068 --> 00:58:51,431
Let Joe here escort you
safely back to your hotel.

968
00:58:51,508 --> 00:58:52,960
Let your beautiful--

969
00:58:53,036 --> 00:58:55,132
whatever she is--

970
00:58:55,208 --> 00:58:56,860
ice your wounds.

971
00:58:56,935 --> 00:58:58,163
In about a day or two,

972
00:58:58,236 --> 00:59:00,200
we'll come and get you
for your next fight.

973
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:03,362
Get him out of here, Joe.

974
00:59:03,437 --> 00:59:05,863
Let's go.

975
00:59:07,867 --> 00:59:09,060
I vouched for you.

976
00:59:09,138 --> 00:59:10,662
So it's my ass in the
sling, you understand?

977
00:59:10,738 --> 00:59:12,533
We didn't mean
to get you in trouble.

978
00:59:12,607 --> 00:59:12,663
Yet here I am.

979
00:59:13,806 --> 00:59:13,863
So you're going to do
exactly what Nick says.

980
00:59:16,035 --> 00:59:16,103
Now the people that
are running things,

981
00:59:17,738 --> 00:59:18,901
they don't play.

982
00:59:18,965 --> 00:59:22,200
And I got enough strikes
against me as it is.

983
00:59:22,265 --> 00:59:22,332
You got an itch, Joe?
What?

984
00:59:24,837 --> 00:59:26,161
The cortisone.

985
00:59:26,238 --> 00:59:28,333
If it wasn't injected,
it could have been topical.

986
00:59:28,406 --> 00:59:28,462
Like the pine oil,
they're both common ingredients

987
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,233
in lotions used to
treat skin ailments.

988
00:59:34,466 --> 00:59:36,230
What the hell
is she talking about?

989
00:59:36,307 --> 00:59:38,461
She's talking
about your rash.

990
00:59:38,537 --> 00:59:40,063
Psoriasis?

991
00:59:40,138 --> 00:59:41,360
Eczema. Which is
none of your concern.

992
00:59:41,438 --> 00:59:42,630
Let's go.

993
00:59:42,706 --> 00:59:45,161
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa,
where we going to go, Joe?

994
00:59:45,236 --> 00:59:49,801
We going back to our hotel
or mile marker 15?

995
00:59:51,636 --> 00:59:53,761
Where we found

996
00:59:53,836 --> 00:59:56,061
Billie Morgan
and Mason Roberts.

997
00:59:56,136 --> 00:59:57,331
You remember them.

998
01:00:01,536 --> 01:00:02,961
Who are you people?

999
01:00:03,035 --> 01:00:05,033
I'm with the FBI, Joe.

1000
01:00:05,107 --> 01:00:06,203
Look, I don't
have my badge,

1001
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:07,560
I don't have my gun.

1002
01:00:07,636 --> 01:00:09,230
But you'd be wise
to believe me.

1003
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:10,532
Now you have a choice.

1004
01:00:10,637 --> 01:00:12,331
What kind of choice do I have?

1005
01:00:12,437 --> 01:00:13,963
To be the man
that you were

1006
01:00:14,065 --> 01:00:17,133
before you threw
your first fight.

1007
01:00:19,235 --> 01:00:23,831
Or you wind up dead like
the rest of these guys.

1008
01:00:23,905 --> 01:00:25,063
You were the real deal.

1009
01:00:25,135 --> 01:00:27,060
You were strong and fast.

1010
01:00:27,138 --> 01:00:30,131
Everybody wanted
to fight like you.

1011
01:00:33,936 --> 01:00:36,600
There was so much money,

1012
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,730
easy money.

1013
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:41,232
I thought I could handle it.

1014
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:44,403
He was going to get me
another shot at the title.

1015
01:00:44,467 --> 01:00:45,633
Who?

1016
01:00:45,707 --> 01:00:47,762
Nick's father,
Sweet Pete.

1017
01:00:47,835 --> 01:00:50,463
And he's owned me ever since.

1018
01:00:50,535 --> 01:00:51,701
Made me throw
more fights.

1019
01:00:51,767 --> 01:00:53,602
Made you kill Mason Roberts?

1020
01:00:53,668 --> 01:00:55,863
I didn't kill anybody.

1021
01:00:55,936 --> 01:00:59,301
I just buried them.

1022
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:01,501
For Pete?

1023
01:01:02,566 --> 01:01:04,432
And when Billie Morgan
won her bet,

1024
01:01:04,508 --> 01:01:07,261
you buried her, too.

1025
01:01:07,338 --> 01:01:09,000
She was a sweet kid.

1026
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:11,462
Just looking for a way out.

1027
01:01:11,536 --> 01:01:13,932
I begged Pete to let her be.

1028
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:15,062
He killed her.

1029
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:16,761
Might as well
have done it myself.

1030
01:01:16,837 --> 01:01:18,601
I brought her in here.

1031
01:01:18,665 --> 01:01:20,661
I knew what kind of punk
she'd be dealing with.

1032
01:01:20,736 --> 01:01:23,030
Bad enough you're under
Sweet Pete's thumb,

1033
01:01:23,107 --> 01:01:26,703
but now you're under
his son's, too?

1034
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,530
That's what happens when
your luck turns in this town.

1035
01:01:29,608 --> 01:01:32,700
You keep hoping it's going
to turn around again.

1036
01:01:32,767 --> 01:01:35,762
Hoping you're going
to get back to even.

1037
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:39,460
But you never do.

1038
01:01:41,935 --> 01:01:44,530
Write your own story now, Joe.

1039
01:01:44,606 --> 01:01:49,360
You can make Nick, Sweet Pete,
all his friends just disappear.

1040
01:01:49,436 --> 01:01:54,000
The way they did to
Billie and Roberts.

1041
01:02:00,266 --> 01:02:01,963
Vegas authorities have arrested
Nick Arno,

1042
01:02:02,068 --> 01:02:05,960
along with his father, Tangier's
casino gaming executive

1043
01:02:06,036 --> 01:02:09,061
Peter Arno,
otherwise known as Sweet Pete,

1044
01:02:09,168 --> 01:02:10,430
in connection with the murder
five years ago

1045
01:02:10,508 --> 01:02:13,161
of federal prosecutor
Mason Roberts, among others.

1046
01:02:13,235 --> 01:02:14,433
"Among others"?

1047
01:02:14,506 --> 01:02:14,561
Is that what Billie Morgan is
to these people, "others"?

1048
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:18,233
It's day one, Bones.

1049
01:02:18,308 --> 01:02:19,730
Relax.

1050
01:02:19,808 --> 01:02:21,102
But you know what,
I mean, Billie...

1051
01:02:21,168 --> 01:02:22,362
Billie's going to have
her story told.

1052
01:02:22,436 --> 01:02:23,363
It's just a matter of time.

1053
01:02:23,438 --> 01:02:25,301
So what was the second reason?

1054
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,102
What?

1055
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:30,101
You never told me the second
reon why you bet on me.

1056
01:02:30,165 --> 01:02:33,630
Yeah, it was... silly.

1057
01:02:33,706 --> 01:02:33,762
Aww, come on, you know, try me.

1058
01:02:38,607 --> 01:02:41,362
Beginner's luck.

1059
01:02:41,436 --> 01:02:45,862
I haven't lost at anything
since I've been here, so...

1060
01:02:45,937 --> 01:02:48,330
well, I...

1061
01:02:48,408 --> 01:02:50,162
I figured if I bet on you
then...

1062
01:02:50,237 --> 01:02:52,301
I couldn't lose.

1063
01:02:52,365 --> 01:02:53,963
Sounds silly, right?

1064
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:57,201
Sounds familiar.

1065
01:02:57,266 --> 01:02:58,500
Thanks.

1066
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,860
You're welcome.

1067
01:03:04,205 --> 01:03:06,932
You ready?
Yeah, let's go.
