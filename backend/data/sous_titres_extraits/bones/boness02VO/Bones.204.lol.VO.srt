1
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:05,502
Hikers aren't supposed to leave 
their dogs off the leash back here.

2
00:00:05,537 --> 00:00:08,302
But I'm pretty sure the dog was running 
free when he found... what he found.

3
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:09,613
What's the condition of the body ?

4
00:00:09,648 --> 00:00:11,763
No idea. Couldn't get close enough to examine it.

5
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:12,576
Why not ?

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,230
The dog's definitely not on his leash at this time.

7
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:17,488
Put down the bone.

8
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:19,086
How the hell will we get to the body ?

9
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:21,587
Drop it !
- You don't see that every day.

10
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:22,614
Let's leave it to Animal Control.

11
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,653
It'll take another hour though.

12
00:00:24,688 --> 00:00:25,805
Drop it now !

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,959
I'm so sorry. He's never done anything like this.

14
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:30,117
Have you ever had a dog, Bones ?

15
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:32,665
I always wanted a pig.
- A pig.

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,863
Very smart and despite the popular 
misconception, very clean.

17
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:39,057
I prefer my pig with a little mint, 
a little honey glazed...

18
00:00:39,092 --> 00:00:42,216
Not funny. In some cultures, 
dogs can guard corpses,

19
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:46,251
sometimes to the point of starvation, 
so... shoot it.

20
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:48,163
I'm not shooting him !

21
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:51,477
For just doing what comes naturally. 
As far as he's concerned, finders keepers.

22
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:54,551
The dog is compromising 
the integrity of my remains,

23
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:56,454
so wing it ! Him.

24
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,155
There's another way, Bones.

25
00:00:58,532 --> 00:01:00,191
Dogs love me.

26
00:01:01,135 --> 00:01:02,517
Nice doggie.

27
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:04,163
It's a good booch, huh ?

28
00:01:04,873 --> 00:01:08,036
Nice doggie. Good booch.

29
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:12,407
Hey, we're just gonna wait for Animal Control.

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,975
I'll do it.
- Oh yeah.

31
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:18,942
Yeah, pine cone's really gonna work.

32
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:24,129
Buddy, buddy, come back here !
- OK, I need everybody to clear the area.

33
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:27,343
Set up a perimeter.
- Clear the area, set up a perimeter.

34
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:30,990
And tell Animal Control I'll need that bone.

35
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:33,483
First thing I'll do when they're here.

36
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:41,994
Victim was female. Late teens.

37
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:43,875
Blond. Cause of death: looks like

38
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,722
blunt trauma to the back of the skull.

39
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:47,209
She was buried face down.

40
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:48,955
What's that, some satanic hoohaw ?

41
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,367
My uncle Preston wants to buried 
standing up without a casket.

42
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,722
Pupal casings and insect remains suggest

43
00:01:56,757 --> 00:01:58,526
she was buried out there 7 or 10 years ago.

44
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:00,295
Placement of wrists and ankles

45
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,008
suggests she was bound.

46
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:04,213
Residues on the medial malleolus 

47
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,632
will tell us what restraints were used.

48
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,579
Look at that.

49
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:09,784
Yeah, wear to her right lateral 
epicondyle and rotator cuff.

50
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,894
Also, repetitive motion damage 
to the lower lumbar vertebrae.

51
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:14,393
What does that mean ?

52
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:15,704
Golf.

53
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:18,321
Hi Angela.

54
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:19,824
You look great today.

55
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:21,257
Thanks, Hodgie.

56
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:23,230
This is my boho-rocker-artist-

57
00:02:23,265 --> 00:02:25,714
midweek-take-a-deep-breath-and-pout look.

58
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:27,190
"Hodgie" ?

59
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,273
I did a facial reconstruction,

60
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:33,421
extrapolating the skin tone from hair color.

61
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:37,427
For the record: I hate the guy who killed this girl

62
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:39,873
and I hope to hell he burns in all eternity.

63
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:40,988
That our victim ?

64
00:02:41,023 --> 00:02:43,989
Yeah. I found flecks of black enameled 
paint in the wound.

65
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,956
Shape suggests a tire iron.

66
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:49,006
Tire iron.

67
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:52,226
Tire iron.

68
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:53,871
Hands and feet bound.

69
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:56,299
Buried face down.

70
00:02:57,414 --> 00:02:59,031
Epps.

71
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,146
Hello, new team member in the room !

72
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:05,479
Howard Epps, serial killer on death row.

73
00:03:05,514 --> 00:03:08,201
Killed at least three.
- We found two of them last year.

74
00:03:08,236 --> 00:03:10,889
The judge stayed his execution 
to try him on the new charges.

75
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,929
He saved his life. Ironic.

76
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:14,934
The time frame fits.

77
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:18,364
This girl would have been killed about 
6 months before Epps went to prison.

78
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,292
I'll rifle through the database, get an ID.

79
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:21,418
Why don't you just ask him ?

80
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:24,152
Because the last time Bones saw Epps, it...

81
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:25,551
got violent.

82
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:27,184
You'll be there to protect her.

83
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:29,036
She's not the one who needs protecting.

84
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:30,812
Bones broke his wrist.

85
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:38,000
He touched me with his creepy serial killer hands.

86
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:40,358
Better not take Dr Brennan.

87
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:51,736
Agent Booth. What took you so long ?

88
00:03:55,263 --> 00:03:57,574
And where's Dr Brennan ?

89
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:07,532
<i> BONES 2x04
The Blonde in the Game

90
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:39,837
Who's this ?

91
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,348
Oh, right, you're chained.

92
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,838
How about removing these shackles ?

93
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:48,479
The name, Howie.

94
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:50,094
The name.

95
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,740
You know...

96
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:57,764
those hag doctors at the prison infirmary

97
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:01,598
did a miserable job setting my wrist.

98
00:05:01,632 --> 00:05:03,785
It aches all the time,

99
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,410
and I don't have the full range of movement. And let me tell you:

100
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:08,965
When you're stuck in a prison cell for 23 hours a day,

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,179
there's really only one thing you can do to pass the time.

102
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:14,525
And I need my wrist.

103
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:17,967
I'm sure Dr Brennan will be happy

104
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:20,559
to re-break it for you.

105
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,632
What's that ?

106
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:23,950
Oh, these ?

107
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:25,990
These are crime scene photos.

108
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,426
The ones you like.

109
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:28,792
Tell you what,

110
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:31,311
you tell me the girl's name,

111
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:33,411
I'll let you take a look.

112
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,723
Everything you need to win the game

113
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:37,571
is right there in front of you.

114
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:38,646
Game ?

115
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:41,457
You're bored, huh ?

116
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:43,121
Are you playing us ?

117
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:45,763
When Dr Brennan figures it out,

118
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:49,357
come and see me again. But bring the lady scientist,

119
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,453
otherwise I won't say a word.

120
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:54,306
The next time you'll see either one of us,

121
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:57,166
they'll be giving you a lethal injection.

122
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:12,289
Classic game theory. Throwing down of the gauntlet.

123
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:13,161
What ?

124
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:15,780
Conflict of interest arises, followed by a series of moves

125
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:18,365
from which diverging strategies can be discerned.

126
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,262
What did he say ?
- Epps is playing us.

127
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,981
Yes, that's exactly what I said.
- Zero-sum, obviously.

128
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,726
After a few moves, we'll know Epps' order of preference.

129
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,934
What did he say ?
- We'll find out what Epps wants.

130
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:30,468
I know what he wants. I told you.

131
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,004
He wants Bones sitting across the table from him.

132
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,901
Three rational players: me, Booth and Epps.

133
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,856
What about the non-deliberative agent ?

134
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:36,724
What did she say ?

135
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,428
In a game, there tends to be one to <i>n</i> rational players

136
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:42,511
and a non-conscious, non-deliberative agent.

137
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,126
What did Epps talk about before he said

138
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:47,620
all the information he needed was in front of you ?

139
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:50,349
Mom, Bones, blondes,

140
00:06:50,384 --> 00:06:52,406
his wrist being set badly after Bones broke it,

141
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:54,907
and, um...

142
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:56,655
he made the point

143
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,234
that he really needed his wrist.

144
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:04,067
Chronic masturbation !

145
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:06,857
The game may be all about self-gratification.

146
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:10,288
The phrase he used was "right in front of us" ?

147
00:07:10,323 --> 00:07:11,034
Yes.

148
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:13,111
The blonde is right in front of us.

149
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:16,133
And she has a wrist. Well, two.

150
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,824
If you had a pet pig, what would you name him ?

151
00:07:19,748 --> 00:07:21,121
Jasper.

152
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:23,452
This wrist looks completely normal.

153
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:26,196
Here, the right hamate bone.

154
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,640
- Hamate.
- Coloration is off.

155
00:07:31,032 --> 00:07:34,151
It's slightly greasy, compared to the surrounding bone.

156
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:38,137
It's about 1/8" bigger

157
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:40,024
than the same bone on the outside.

158
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,674
This hamate bone does not belong with these remains.

159
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:45,241
It belongs with a second body.

160
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:47,774
There's another victim out there somewhere.

161
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:51,874
Round one goes to Howard Epps.

162
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:55,653
Why ?
- Because he gets what he wants:

163
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:57,997
Me in the room with him.

164
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,846
Who's that ?
- Oh, that is Caroline Epps.

165
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:12,168
Howard's sister ?
- Uh, no. Howard's wife.

166
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:13,623
He didn't have a wife last year.

167
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:15,849
No, they got married about 4 months ago.

168
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:18,648
Heads up, Bones, it's our time 
to visit the psychotic murderous maniac.

169
00:08:18,683 --> 00:08:20,025
Bastard.

170
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,169
Hi, Mrs Epps, I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.

171
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:24,610
This is Dr Brennan.

172
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:28,242
Oh, Agent Booth. Howard told me you 
both saved his life last year.

173
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:29,349
It was our pleasure.

174
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,498
What ? I was disappointed.

175
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:34,791
Extending Howard's life has given him time to 

176
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:38,063
come to grips with what he's done, 
to ask God for forgiveness.

177
00:08:38,098 --> 00:08:40,629
Then we did the right thing by 
having his execution stayed.

178
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:43,157
Are you on some kind of medication ?
- Bones !

179
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,440
Dr Brennan, I'm not one of those crazy women

180
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:47,654
who falls in love with those death row killers.

181
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:50,856
Obviously that's exactly what you are.
- Listen, if the prison

182
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:54,023
ever gives you a hard time in coming to see 
him, call me. I might be able to help.

183
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:56,399
Thank you, Agent Booth.
- Are you serious ? She's crazy.

184
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:57,155
Chop-chop, let's go.

185
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,213
Thank you, nice to see you.
- Nice to meet you both.

186
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:02,380
Why are you nice to her ?
- Because we might need her.

187
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:05,618
Ah, Dr Brennan. You came.

188
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:07,893
I got your message.

189
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:11,374
We're analyzing the wrist bone right now.

190
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:13,426
We just met your wife.

191
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:15,827
She seems very nice.

192
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:17,563
Caroline's a hairdresser.

193
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,954
I'm glad you came.

194
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:24,571
I hope you come back after you analyzed the bone.

195
00:09:24,638 --> 00:09:26,790
Caroline's the best I could do in here.

196
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,966
Yeah, and not your usual type, Howie.

197
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,173
I mean, not young, not blonde...

198
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,346
Not dead.
- Bones, can you please shut up.

199
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:34,353
Excuse me ?

200
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:36,155
Is this why you duct-taped her mouth ?

201
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,757
Because that I understand.

202
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,961
That's the lamest attempt 
at bonding I've ever seen.

203
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:52,675
You smell that ?

204
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,990
What, my stinky effort to bond ?

205
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:58,202
Antiseptic. My mother smelled like that.

206
00:09:58,521 --> 00:10:01,866
Obsessed with germs. She washed 
her hands with ammonia.

207
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,540
Mine too.

208
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:05,616
My one regret ?

209
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,057
That I didn't make her my first victim.

210
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:10,580
Put her under a little stone cross years ago.

211
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:11,982
OK.

212
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,465
OK what ?
- OK. 
- OK.

213
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,588
Don't be mad at me, Bones.

214
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:24,441
I'm not telling you to shut up. It was a ploy.

215
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:27,471
Now he thinks you're an idiot.
- Game theory, Bones, OK ?

216
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:30,997
For two players to gain advantage over the one,

217
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:33,496
they must be distinct from each other.
- Where'd you get that ?

218
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:34,696
From me.

219
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:36,716
I suggested that you be the smart one.

220
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:41,195
Which, you know, made me make him a ploy 
that was supposed to be lame.

221
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,015
Don't enjoy this.
- What ?

222
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,691
The only reason I'm playing with you in this game

223
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:47,591
is to discover the identity of this young woman.

224
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:51,099
We've made no progress on that.

225
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:53,218
Check the junior golf leagues.

226
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,218
Given the amount of wear to 
her shoulder, elbow and spine,

227
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:58,836
she must have started golfing in an early age.

228
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:02,700
I found minute traces of gypsum and 
selenium on the mystery wristbone.

229
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,166
Also phenolphthalein, which is a kind of laxative.

230
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:08,242
Laxatives show up in bones ?

231
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:10,548
No, not even after years of ingestion.

232
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,972
The laxative is on the surface of the bone. 
I have no explanation.

233
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,492
We have scoured every inch of her,

234
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:18,720
X-rayed her, ran her through an MRI...

235
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:20,583
What clue are we missing ?

236
00:11:20,618 --> 00:11:23,521
The laxative is the one thing that makes no sense.

237
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:25,333
Last time it was masturbation.

238
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:27,193
Did he reference bowel movements ?

239
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,647
He mentioned his mother was a germophobe.

240
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:31,668
Scrubbing his hands with ammonia...

241
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:34,516
Ammonia !
- Ammonia !

242
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:36,740
Why didn't you say so ?

243
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:39,196
Ammonia.

244
00:11:40,726 --> 00:11:43,846
Booth thinks we should get together 
and buy Brennan a pet.

245
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,687
What kind of a pet ?
- A pig.

246
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:47,211
And I don't think he means a Guinea pig.

247
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:50,708
A real pig. Like a mulefoot, 
saddleback or potbelly.

248
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,791
You want to expose a crucial 
piece of evidence to ammonia gas ?

249
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:55,827
No.
- Besides being a laxative,

250
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:58,477
phenolphthalein is a sensitive pH indicator.

251
00:11:58,512 --> 00:12:00,629
Colorless, unless it's exposed to ammonia.

252
00:12:00,664 --> 00:12:02,747
The second you expose this bone, it's useless.

253
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:04,279
Epps wants you to destroy evidence.

254
00:12:04,314 --> 00:12:06,476
Why would he want us to destroy evidence he planted ?

255
00:12:06,511 --> 00:12:08,584
Why would he plant evidence at all ?

256
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:10,622
It might be a win-win scenario for him.

257
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:12,758
If his endgame is to disorient Dr Brennan,

258
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:16,498
he can do that by ruining evidence 
that he himself planted.

259
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,808
Fine. You can perform the experiment.

260
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:21,253
So, glasses.

261
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,214
What is that ?
- Not sure.

262
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,429
Freemason symbol.

263
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:53,193
Hey, this explains the buried-face-down thing.

264
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:55,601
It's all starting to come together !

265
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:58,893
These crossed hammers prove that Epps is 
working for the top level of the Illuminati.

266
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:02,174
That's the cartographic symbol for a mine.
- Oh.

267
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:07,947
Epps is telling us that the 
second victim is in a mine ?

268
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:09,089
What kind of mine ?

269
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:11,599
One that contains gypsum and selenium.

270
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,432
In prison, Epps mentioned a stone cross.

271
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:19,071
That's what we should be looking for.

272
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:23,038
OK, this is the only abandoned gypsum mine

273
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:26,095
within Epps's known killing ground 
that also contains selenium.

274
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,121
Six entrances, hundreds of shafts,

275
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:30,113
and half of it's flooded. All right.

276
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:33,572
Just follow my lead and watch 
yourself in there, OK ? Thank you.

277
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:35,727
I don't think Epps would make 
it that hard for us.

278
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:39,885
Epps said he wished he buried his 
mother under a stone cross.

279
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,239
I bet that is a hint. OK people, listen up !

280
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:44,674
I'm calling in a splonking team !
- Spelunking.

281
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,741
- Spelunking team, with imaging capabilities

282
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:48,611
to look for a stone cross.

283
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:52,032
Till they get here, let's focus 
on the ventilation shafts.

284
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:54,620
Hold on. - To the west of the main shaft...

285
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:56,195
What ?

286
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:59,098
Oh. Never mind.

287
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,903
Could we get some light down this shaft, please ?

288
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,939
It's the cross, Booth.

289
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:08,448
That is definitely a cross.

290
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:10,670
You help me move these ?
- Move what ?

291
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,151
The rocks.

292
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,364
Bones !

293
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:27,032
It's definitely human.

294
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,088
What ?

295
00:14:28,123 --> 00:14:31,608
I can't be more precise, but I don't think 
this is more than a week old.

296
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:34,777
Epps has been in prison for 7 years, which means

297
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:39,071
he has an accomplice killing people on the outside.

298
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:42,597
And I wonder how many more there are.

299
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:47,937
This is where the hamate bone was taken.

300
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,156
Victim is female, mid teens.

301
00:14:51,508 --> 00:14:53,500
Extensive contusions around the ankles.

302
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:56,320
Yes, and bone damage too.

303
00:14:57,568 --> 00:15:01,277
Hip displacement, elongation of the spine.

304
00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:07,384
He hung her upside down.

305
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:10,386
I agree. And while she was still alive too.

306
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:11,862
Is that part of Epps's M.O. ?

307
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:15,141
No.
- So his accomplice threw in some flair of his own.

308
00:15:15,176 --> 00:15:18,386
Nine years ago, Epps kills 
someone and buries her.

309
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,565
He goes to jail seven years ago.

310
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,968
Last week, his accomplice kills another girl

311
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:26,889
and swapped wristbones with the girl 
buried nine years ago.

312
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:29,929
How do they communicate ?

313
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:34,577
Inmates are allowed phone calls, visitors, 
letters, but those are all monitored.

314
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:35,859
He has a wife.

315
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:39,288
Look at this. It's a burn. Cigarette probably.

316
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,632
 And there's this.

317
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,748
Was jammed in her shoe.

318
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:47,471
And she wasn't wearing it ?

319
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:55,587
The mine victim's dental work 
identifies her as Sarah Koskoff,

320
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,973
Bethesda, Maryland. Disappeared three weeks ago.

321
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:01,947
16 years old.
- Sarah Koskoff...

322
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:05,472
She fits Epps' victim profile perfectly.

323
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:13,626
Brennan.
- Yeah, Bones, it's me.

324
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:15,558
Listen, I talked to Sarah Koskoff's parents.

325
00:16:15,593 --> 00:16:17,992
They said her dream was to own her own beauty shop.

326
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,169
She worked for a hair salon in the city.

327
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:21,039
Don't tell me.

328
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:24,684
Yup. "M Salon", Cleveland Park, 
owned by Caroline Mapother.

329
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,624
Now known as Caroline Epps.

330
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:29,524
Remember when I was nice to her and you weren't ?

331
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:31,381
This is why.

332
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:33,018
Thank you.

333
00:16:35,072 --> 00:16:38,844
Hi.
- Hi.

334
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:42,916
Is Howard OK ?
- Howard's fine, Mrs Epps.

335
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:44,479
You don't have to worry about anything.

336
00:16:44,514 --> 00:16:47,842
I couldn't help but notice the 
"Help Wanted" sign in the window.

337
00:16:47,877 --> 00:16:50,275
Did you recently lose one of your employees ?

338
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:51,732
It's...

339
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:55,588
hard to keep help that doesn't steal from you.

340
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:58,124
Sarah Koskoff steal from you ?

341
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:00,348
No...

342
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:03,333
Why ? What did she do ?

343
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,013
She died.

344
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:09,565
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you

345
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,084
when was the last time you saw her ?

346
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:18,912
Three weeks ago. She just stopped 
coming to work. She died ?

347
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:20,570
Did you ever

348
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:22,899
talk to Howard about her ?

349
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:26,584
I don't know, maybe.
- Did Howard ever see a picture of Sarah ?

350
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:29,146
I don't like this. What's going on ?

351
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,779
She was found buried, face down, 
in an abandoned mine.

352
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:37,919
Back of her head bashed in, wrists, ankles tied.

353
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:40,658
Your husband's MO.

354
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:44,794
Poor Sarah.

355
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,070
But Howard...

356
00:17:48,956 --> 00:17:53,242
Howard has been in prison for 
the last seven years.

357
00:17:53,427 --> 00:17:55,824
How could he kill anyone ?

358
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:58,194
He has an accomplice.

359
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:01,013
You think it's me ?
- You love your husband.

360
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:03,991
I love the good in Howard.

361
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,251
I reject the evil.

362
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:09,339
We're going to have a child.

363
00:18:09,374 --> 00:18:11,993
I've petitioned the court to let 
Howard donate.

364
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:13,318
Yeah.

365
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:17,814
I have a search warrant here, 
for your home and your shop.

366
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:20,191
I don't need a search warrant.

367
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:24,905
You can look anywhere you want, 
because you won't find anything.

368
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:33,446
Sarah Koskoff was hung upside 
down before she was killed.

369
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:36,088
That suggests a torture room.

370
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:40,621
I was hoping it was in the basement 
of the beauty salon,

371
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:43,507
but my agents didn't find anything.

372
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:46,359
What's that ?
- Religious medal.

373
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:48,549
Sarah had it in her possession.

374
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:53,304
St Agnes, patron saint of young women.

375
00:18:54,105 --> 00:18:57,080
Especially those who remain pure.

376
00:18:57,115 --> 00:19:00,056
How do you know all that ?
- I'm catholic, Bones.

377
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:03,447
"SAHS"

378
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:06,057
Yeah, the St Agnes High School.

379
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:12,420
Except....Sarah Koskoff went 
to public school. Oh God !

380
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,529
What ? What does that mean ?

381
00:19:14,564 --> 00:19:17,697
It means I have to go talk to a nun.

382
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:21,549
We have no student at St Agnes 
named Sarah Koskoff.

383
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:24,744
Maybe she's a friend of one of your girls ?

384
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:29,283
As soon as you called me last night, 
we implemented a telephone tree

385
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:31,519
asking precisely that question.

386
00:19:31,554 --> 00:19:33,578
No response.
- Do the names Howard Epps,

387
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:37,620
Caroline Epps, Caroline Mapother 
mean anything to you ?

388
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,049
May I have the keyboard.

389
00:19:40,084 --> 00:19:42,772
Yes, sister, of course, here.

390
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:49,066
I need to enter a password.
- Oh, yeah.

391
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:51,165
I'll be right over here.

392
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:52,818
I'm catholic.

393
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:57,365
I...I go to mass every sunday. 
Almost every sunday.

394
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:59,401
I'm very trustworthy.

395
00:20:00,362 --> 00:20:02,667
Nobody by any of those names.

396
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:07,859
I feel that I have been very patient 
in regard to not asking

397
00:20:07,894 --> 00:20:13,016
what this is about.
- Oh... Murder victim.

398
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:16,930
A girl was found with this religious medal.

399
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:26,119
Helen Majors.
- Helen Majors ?

400
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:27,597
Who is that ?

401
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:33,126
This golden medal is given to the Holy 
Spirit Award winner every year.

402
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:37,159
I presented this medal to Helen Majors myself.

403
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:41,223
May we please see Helen Majors ? Talk to her ?

404
00:20:41,258 --> 00:20:43,735
Helen left school three days ago.

405
00:20:44,087 --> 00:20:46,872
No one has seen her since.

406
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:50,959
Three days ago, Helen had that medal.

407
00:20:50,994 --> 00:20:54,338
Yesterday, we found it with 
Sarah Koskoff's dead body.

408
00:20:54,373 --> 00:20:56,322
It's possible Helen is still alive.

409
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:58,925
We have Caroline Epps under surveillance.

410
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,412
I hate this.

411
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:02,813
Booth.

412
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:05,365
I don't want to find that girl's 
remains in some mine, Booth.

413
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,617
Reiner Hatin ?

414
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:07,944
Address.

415
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:11,060
7408 Haskell St, Cleveland Park.

416
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:15,574
22705 to control, I'm en route 
to possible HRT incident

417
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,785
at 7408 Haskell St. Request some backup.

418
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,926
<i>Confirming that, 22705. 7408 Haskell.

419
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:23,852
What ?
- Epps's prison letters log

420
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:26,487
show that in the last year he wrote six letters

421
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:29,053
to a man by the name of Reiner Hatin at that address.

422
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:32,198
Caroline Epps might not be Epps's 
accomplice after all.

423
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,095
What're you doing ?

424
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,355
Where's the siren on this thing ?
- Don't touch !

425
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:45,955
OK, Bones, I'm going in, you wait outside.
- Booth...

426
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,251
No, I don't want to hear it.

427
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:50,051
Backup arrives, tell them 
there's a federal agent inside.

428
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:51,623
What is it ?

429
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:56,959
Great. A vacant lot.

430
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:07,015
Did you hear ? I'm gonna be a father.

431
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:10,821
The judge granted our petition 
for artificial insemination.

432
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:17,015
When I make my donation at the baby bank, 
I'm gonna be thinking about you.

433
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:19,327
Who's Reiner Hatin ?

434
00:22:19,362 --> 00:22:21,117
Aw, Reiner.

435
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,247
<i>Alter Freund mit ähnLEICHEm Geschmack.

436
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:26,460
The letters were addressed to a vacant lot.

437
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:28,388
I must have written the address down wrong.

438
00:22:28,593 --> 00:22:31,097
I'm slightly dislexic, you know.

439
00:22:31,337 --> 00:22:32,422
Hey, come here.

440
00:22:32,457 --> 00:22:34,927
You know, I really enjoyed playing your game,

441
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:37,362
but now, you know what ? There's a girl

442
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,038
out there, hanging upside down 
with duct tape over her mouth.

443
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:43,956
Booth, let him go. Let him go !

444
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:53,999
For all your faults, Mr Epps, 
you were never interested

445
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:55,768
in letting your victims suffer.

446
00:22:55,803 --> 00:22:59,366
You didn't torture them. 
You're not that kind of man.

447
00:23:01,224 --> 00:23:03,769
She's an innocent child.

448
00:23:04,471 --> 00:23:06,691
She's a young woman.

449
00:23:06,913 --> 00:23:11,067
And there's no such thing 
as an innocent woman.

450
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,823
Look within yourself.

451
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:17,274
You know I'm right. I'm just 
guessing here, you'll understand,

452
00:23:17,446 --> 00:23:19,171
but I think you'll find

453
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:22,460
that Helen Majors has less than 24 hours to live.

454
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,241
Better get going.

455
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,182
Sorry.

456
00:23:46,631 --> 00:23:48,034
What are you asking me for ?

457
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:50,328
You said you've dealt with 
manipulative men before.

458
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:53,153
Sweetie, this is a psycho killer,

459
00:23:53,188 --> 00:23:56,870
not some loser who wants you 
to co-sign a loan for his Jet Ski.

460
00:23:56,905 --> 00:23:59,267
Epps is pushing me around, Ange.

461
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:01,629
He's in control. I hate that.

462
00:24:01,947 --> 00:24:03,214
You know...

463
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:07,388
Epps is acting kind of like a boyfriend.

464
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:09,665
What ?

465
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,455
Well, you obviously fascinate him.

466
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:17,824
He can't have you and he can't kill you, 
so he wants to make you hate yourself.

467
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:21,437
God, Ange, what kind of boyfriends have you had ?

468
00:24:21,472 --> 00:24:23,772
Let's keep the focus on you and Epps, OK ?

469
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,548
OK.

470
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:28,924
Epps knows that you will never forgive 
yourself if you don't find Helen Majors

471
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,686
before she is murdered.

472
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,326
Not only is Helen being tortured,

473
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:37,043
but her family must be in agony.

474
00:24:37,172 --> 00:24:38,670
You see ?

475
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:40,577
This is what he's doing.

476
00:24:40,903 --> 00:24:45,190
He's putting pictures in your mind. 
He's messing with your objectivity.

477
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:47,364
There's nothing you can do about that.

478
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:49,468
You have to step back, OK ?

479
00:24:49,503 --> 00:24:52,322
Let the rest of us deal with the families.

480
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:54,374
You find Helen.

481
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,203
That'll keep Epps from getting 
a Jet Ski out of you.

482
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:05,409
Bones, Caroline Epps...not an accomplice.

483
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:07,508
She was at work when Helen Majors was kidnapped.

484
00:25:07,543 --> 00:25:10,757
<i>Alter Freund mit ähnlichem Geschmack.

485
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:12,129
Yeah, whatever.

486
00:25:12,164 --> 00:25:16,087
It means "old friend with similar 
taste" in German.

487
00:25:16,122 --> 00:25:18,768
I don't know. Epps tell us the name 
of his accomplice ? That's too easy.

488
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:21,563
Well, if it's too easy, 
why can't we find him ?

489
00:25:21,598 --> 00:25:24,461
You know what ? He talked about 
impregnating Caroline.

490
00:25:24,496 --> 00:25:29,413
What is with Caroline Epps ? Why have 
a child with a monster like him ?

491
00:25:29,448 --> 00:25:32,983
What's she going to tell the child when 
it grows up ? "Hi, your daddy is a monster" ?

492
00:25:33,018 --> 00:25:34,651
Time out. You gotta detach from this.

493
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:37,465
If we let Epps get under our skin, 
that's exactly what he wants.

494
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,236
Zack was right. Epps is trying to break us.

495
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,545
Not only did we save his life, 
but he is still killing.

496
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,144
I found traces of ethylene oxide

497
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,673
and high levels of an antibacterial 
agent on Sarah's ankles.

498
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:50,938
Also polymer residue found in 
Polygenix latex glove liners

499
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:52,936
used by people who handle toxic substances.

500
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:54,319
Airport screeners, cops...

501
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:55,369
Wait...prison guards ?

502
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:58,982
Lauren Hathaway was a national 
ranked junior golfer in 1997.

503
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,224
Yeah, that's Booth. I need to know 
if Howard Epps ever had

504
00:26:01,262 --> 00:26:02,762
a prison guard by the name of Reiner Hatin.

505
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:06,047
She disappeared on May 9th after 
leaving the Southampton Country Club

506
00:26:06,082 --> 00:26:10,208
in Raleigh, North Carolina.
- Check and see if any guard changed his name.

507
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,066
Reiner is German for "pure".

508
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:13,878
Epps has a thing about that.

509
00:26:13,913 --> 00:26:16,225
Translate the name and see if that 
comes back in any form,

510
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,533
and get back to me.

511
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:19,444
That's the victim from the park ?

512
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:21,122
Her father is in your office.

513
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,174
What ?
- Why didn't you say that ?

514
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:25,331
You were on the phone.

515
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:26,371
Booth...

516
00:26:27,949 --> 00:26:29,755
I can't do this one.

517
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,944
Maybe Angela can help.

518
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:36,226
All right, I'll take care of it.

519
00:26:38,776 --> 00:26:42,265
My wife died five years after Laura disappeared,

520
00:26:43,165 --> 00:26:46,382
I think because she just gave up hope.

521
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:50,761
Part of me is glad she's not here today for this.

522
00:26:50,796 --> 00:26:53,459
We're sorry for your loss, Mr Hathaway.

523
00:26:54,523 --> 00:26:56,124
For both of your losses.

524
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,086
When Lauren disappeared, the police 
originally suspected her golf coach.

525
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:03,979
Yes. He had an affair with one of his 
students the year before.

526
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:07,209
Ironically, his alibi was that he was 
with another student.

527
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:10,533
Does the name Reiner Hatin mean 
anything to you ?

528
00:27:10,568 --> 00:27:11,762
No.

529
00:27:12,045 --> 00:27:13,792
Do you recognize this man ?

530
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:18,672
No.

531
00:27:19,022 --> 00:27:22,697
I'm not helping, am I ?
- That photograph is current.

532
00:27:22,732 --> 00:27:26,372
We have some drawings that show what 
he might have looked like 10 years ago.

533
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:37,847
Yes, that one.

534
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:42,382
He was a greens keeper at the Club. 
He helped us load the car one day.

535
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:44,568
I remember because he told Lauren

536
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:46,674
she looked just like his mother 
when she was young.

537
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:48,710
It was an odd thing to say.

538
00:27:48,745 --> 00:27:50,684
I told the police about it 
when she disappeared.

539
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,921
Why didn't they arrest him ?

540
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:02,881
Caroline Epps. She knows something. 
She just won't talk to me.

541
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:05,580
Why ?
- I'm a man. Last time I checked.

542
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,492
Will she talk to a woman ?

543
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:09,058
That's my thinking.
- Fine. I'll do it.

544
00:28:08,993 --> 00:28:10,839
Oh, no. You can't sarcasm it out of here.

545
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:11,884
You have to connect.

546
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,130
You don't want to send Brennan ?
- No, Angela.

547
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:17,353
Angela's an artist, an expert 
in 3D reconstruction.

548
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:20,052
Well, unlike you and Bones, Angela is...

549
00:28:20,618 --> 00:28:21,570
What ?

550
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:23,956
She's better with the living than 
she is with the dead.

551
00:28:23,991 --> 00:28:26,782
Fine, I'll go tell her what she 
just volunteered for.

552
00:28:26,817 --> 00:28:28,148
Thank you.

553
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:32,400
Thanks for coming.

554
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:35,371
I've told your people everything I know.

555
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:37,872
I don't see the point of this.

556
00:28:37,907 --> 00:28:39,849
I know this is disturbing.

557
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:42,514
I find it very upsetting,

558
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:45,274
and I'm not married to the man who did it.

559
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:47,532
I love Howard, Ms Montenegro.

560
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,159
I believe you.

561
00:28:50,637 --> 00:28:52,664
No one's ever said that to me.

562
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:57,094
I think you'd have to love him very much, 
to be willing to overlook what he's done.

563
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:58,934
Done in the past.

564
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:00,280
The thing is, 

565
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:05,100
we're not so sure that it was in the past.

566
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,559
For Howard, it's obvious what he likes.

567
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:10,650
Blonde girls.

568
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:12,620
Not me, you mean.

569
00:29:12,655 --> 00:29:14,621
Men can't hide what they like.

570
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:16,321
For Howard, it's this.

571
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:20,021
Men can change what they look at.

572
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:22,350
Does Howard ever just look at you ?

573
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,049
So you just feel his eyes adoring you ?

574
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:32,781
He... he asks for magazines, DVDs.

575
00:29:33,237 --> 00:29:37,252
He's very specific.

576
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,115
He likes blonde girls.

577
00:29:41,271 --> 00:29:43,634
Always the blonde girls.

578
00:29:46,472 --> 00:29:50,571
Maybe if I... if I died my hair...

579
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:55,381
I'm sorry, I have to ask you something.

580
00:29:56,735 --> 00:30:00,034
Have you ever delivered any messages for Howard ?

581
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:03,427
"Don't you miss them ?"
- I'm sorry ?

582
00:30:04,412 --> 00:30:09,263
I wrote the message "Don't you miss them ?"

583
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:12,447
on a piece of paper and slipped in a mailbox.

584
00:30:12,482 --> 00:30:14,036
Whose mailbox ?

585
00:30:15,577 --> 00:30:19,818
A man named Henry Gerber 
who Howard knew from prison.

586
00:30:19,853 --> 00:30:24,069
Howard calls Henry "the mad German".

587
00:30:24,104 --> 00:30:26,194
When did you deliver the message ?

588
00:30:27,463 --> 00:30:30,432
Five days ago.

589
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:32,882
Thank you.

590
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:35,029
Can you...

591
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:39,600
sit with me just a moment longer ?

592
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:44,581
I'm... I have to make a phone call. 
Do you understand ?

593
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:49,795
But after that, I'll sit with 
you as long as you like.

594
00:30:59,402 --> 00:31:01,187
FBI ! Hands in the air !

595
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:04,198
That's it. Now move over there slowly.

596
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:07,562
Keep your hands where I can see them.
- I can't do both.

597
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:08,935
Booth.

598
00:31:10,793 --> 00:31:12,328
Easy.

599
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,676
Where's Henry Gerber ?

600
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:21,256
I'm Henry Gerber.

601
00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:26,769
There is no way a man in a wheelchair

602
00:31:26,804 --> 00:31:28,725
could have killed Sarah Koskoff

603
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:32,787
or swapped hamate bones with Lauren Hathaway.

604
00:31:33,086 --> 00:31:34,560
Right, Epps scored again, huh ?

605
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:35,999
Gerber's paralyzed from the waist down

606
00:31:36,034 --> 00:31:40,346
because Epps knifed him just before he was paroled.

607
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:42,352
So what, his message "Don't you miss them ?" 

608
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:43,981
meant what, his legs ?

609
00:31:44,016 --> 00:31:45,431
Epps is good.

610
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:47,371
Not morally, of course,

611
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,730
but it's a classic feinting parry misdirect.

612
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,767
Delivered via his wife !

613
00:31:51,802 --> 00:31:54,074
He gets off on screwing with people's lives.

614
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:56,347
Where are we on Reiner Hatin ?
- Nowhere.

615
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:58,010
I have some thoughts.

616
00:31:58,203 --> 00:32:01,126
Perhaps the point isn't that German 
is a different language,

617
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:03,480
but that it's actually a different language.

618
00:32:03,913 --> 00:32:06,031
Great. Thanks, Zack, for being so helpful.

619
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:08,940
Go on.
- More broadly speaking, 

620
00:32:08,975 --> 00:32:11,814
like an anagram or an inner or secret language.

621
00:32:12,189 --> 00:32:14,463
These are phrases I found in English.

622
00:32:14,498 --> 00:32:15,594
Perhaps in German...

623
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:17,022
No, the whole German thing was a ruse.

624
00:32:17,057 --> 00:32:18,415
If it's anywhere, it's here.

625
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,702
"RANT HEREIN I"

626
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,979
You know, like inner schizophrenic voices.

627
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:23,875
"ARE INNER HIT" could mean...

628
00:32:24,452 --> 00:32:26,135
I don't really do the poetry thing.

629
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,818
NEITHER RAIN, no, NEITHER...

630
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:29,546
NEITHER RAIN NOR SLEET 

631
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:31,204
NOR DEAD OF NIGHT

632
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:32,603
The Postal Service motto !

633
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:35,484
Hey, the guy's all about sending messages.

634
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,221
Mail to an empty lot, messages 
dropped in mailslots.

635
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,821
Postal workers wear Polygenix gloves.

636
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:43,917
Who received the letters Epps 
sent to that empty lot ?

637
00:32:45,345 --> 00:32:46,662
<i>Letters with an end-of-barrel address

638
00:32:46,697 --> 00:32:48,815
<i>and no return address go to 
the Dead Letter Office.

639
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,131
Who has access ?

640
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,591
<i>The sorting staff. And the mail 
carrier for that route.

641
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:54,261
Scheme us the route which includes 

642
00:32:54,296 --> 00:32:57,550
7408 Haskell St. It's Cleveland Park, right ?

643
00:32:57,777 --> 00:33:00,516
Yes, but there is no 7408 Haskell St.

644
00:33:01,168 --> 00:33:02,471
Got it.

645
00:33:04,238 --> 00:33:07,768
That's Caroline Epps's beauty salon.

646
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:09,681
And St Agnes High School.

647
00:33:09,716 --> 00:33:12,403
The killer picked his victims from a postal route.

648
00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:13,672
Tell us the name of the mail carrier.

649
00:33:13,707 --> 00:33:14,871
<i>I can do better than that.

650
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:16,665
<i>All I ask if this goes to the press,

651
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:19,589
<i>nobody uses the word "disgruntled".

652
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:21,685
I'm so sorry.

653
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,444
He's never done anything like this.

654
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:25,168
Booth...
- Yeah. I got it.

655
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:26,448
What ?

656
00:33:26,483 --> 00:33:28,700
That's the guy who found the first body.

657
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:31,461
Found it because he knew where it 
was buried. Let's go.

658
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,283
Right, him again. I'll need a pine cone.

659
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:44,297
Listen, dog, I'll have to shoot you in the 
head if you don't cut it out right now !

660
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:55,911
God.

661
00:33:57,687 --> 00:34:00,638
I hate this serial killer wall of death.

662
00:34:01,954 --> 00:34:03,914
This is Sarah Koskoff.

663
00:34:05,268 --> 00:34:06,543
Helen Majors.

664
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:10,502
They were so young, so innocent.

665
00:34:11,224 --> 00:34:13,175
Lauren Hathaway.

666
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,623
Southampton Country Club.

667
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:16,855
That's where Epps and his accomplice met.

668
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,017
Lappin maintained the golf carts.

669
00:34:19,052 --> 00:34:22,204
He's winning, Bones. We're this close 
to saving Helen Majors' life.

670
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,658
Running out of time.
- Yeah.    
- Hodgins, it's me.

671
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:28,154
Is there anything you can tell us 
about where Sarah Koskoff was held

672
00:34:28,189 --> 00:34:31,117
before her body was dumped in the gypsum mine ?

673
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,587
The only substance I can't explain 
is ethylene oxide.

674
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:38,023
What about the ethylene oxide plus 
the antibacterial agents ?

675
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:42,271
It could be a lot of things. 
I'll set up a statistical model,

676
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:43,747
give you 4 or 5 scenarios.

677
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,384
There is no time. The girl's life is at stake.

678
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,987
Just give me your best guess right now.

679
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:51,857
I can't just guess. I have a process !

680
00:34:54,043 --> 00:34:56,247
What if I guess and the girl dies ?

681
00:34:56,282 --> 00:34:57,676
No. No way.

682
00:34:57,711 --> 00:35:00,760
Simmer down, Hodgins. We're all just trying to 

683
00:35:00,795 --> 00:35:02,825
do our best in this situation.

684
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,009
Jack.

685
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:06,220
Hodgins, are you still there ?

686
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,990
Hey, pretend it's me asking, OK ?

687
00:35:10,002 --> 00:35:13,259
Look, we're just exchanging theories 
here at work, like always.

688
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,687
Two substances, right ?

689
00:35:16,002 --> 00:35:17,683
Put them in the same place at the same time.

690
00:35:17,718 --> 00:35:19,343
Either they mean something or they don't.

691
00:35:19,378 --> 00:35:21,072
Hodgins, you there, buddy ?

692
00:35:21,444 --> 00:35:23,154
Just give me a second, please !

693
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:24,625
We don't have a second !

694
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,130
Booth, do you think you could 
just stop talking, please ?

695
00:35:30,685 --> 00:35:34,120
OK, all right. Antibacterial agents,

696
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:36,982
and he's a postal worker.
- OK.

697
00:35:38,714 --> 00:35:40,632
What else, Jack ?

698
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:45,150
Anthrax.
- Anthrax ?

699
00:35:45,455 --> 00:35:48,022
After the anthrax attack in 2001,

700
00:35:48,057 --> 00:35:50,641
the post office shut down several 
sorting centers.

701
00:35:50,676 --> 00:35:51,938
OK, all right.

702
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:53,287
Tell me.

703
00:35:53,691 --> 00:35:57,630
They used ethylene oxide and 
this antibacterial agent.

704
00:35:57,982 --> 00:36:00,183
That's how they cleaned them. 
Not all of them reopened.

705
00:36:00,218 --> 00:36:04,158
So it's possible Sarah was kept 
at an abandoned sorting center ?

706
00:36:04,404 --> 00:36:05,666
Yes.

707
00:36:07,004 --> 00:36:08,509
Yes it is.

708
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:11,342
I knew you'd come through for me, 
buddy. Good work.

709
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:32,064
Here.
- I didn't have to ask ?

710
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,645
Yeah. Just be careful, right ?

711
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,275
Don't shoot me, don't shoot 
Helen Majors, otherwise...

712
00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:58,587
Please.

713
00:37:02,562 --> 00:37:03,855
Helen ?

714
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,831
Please help me !

715
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:07,607
All right.

716
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,245
I got you.

717
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:11,057
Where is he ?

718
00:37:11,092 --> 00:37:12,617
He just left.

719
00:37:12,652 --> 00:37:15,016
I don't know where he went.
- Bones, stay here with her.

720
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:20,098
Stay right there.
- Don't leave me. Please don't leave me.

721
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,328
Is he dead ?

722
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:57,739
Yeah, he's dead.

723
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,547
I had to shoot him.

724
00:38:08,582 --> 00:38:11,469
Yeah. I'm glad you did.

725
00:38:21,521 --> 00:38:23,065
Well done.

726
00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:26,123
Really.

727
00:38:26,158 --> 00:38:27,676
Game's over, Howie.

728
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:29,794
Yes. I won.

729
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:32,743
Only if you wanted your accomplice dead.

730
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:35,356
Lappin's dead ?
- Shot resisting arrest.

731
00:38:35,391 --> 00:38:37,015
Who shot him ?

732
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,607
It was you, wasn't it ?

733
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,351
You shot him ?

734
00:38:45,643 --> 00:38:47,976
Did he take long to die ?

735
00:38:49,669 --> 00:38:51,457
Did he suffer ?

736
00:38:53,232 --> 00:38:56,794
This is better than I hoped. 
I thought it would be you.

737
00:38:57,311 --> 00:38:58,973
How did it feel ?

738
00:38:59,008 --> 00:39:00,642
Dirty, yes ?

739
00:39:00,677 --> 00:39:02,636
There's also a rush.

740
00:39:03,438 --> 00:39:04,684
Pleasure.

741
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:07,251
Part of you liked it.

742
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:13,210
This whole game was to have us kill someone ?

743
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,978
Who's gonna tell Lappin's mom ?

744
00:39:16,013 --> 00:39:18,520
She loves him very much, you know ?

745
00:39:19,082 --> 00:39:22,784
Without her son, she'll be 
completely alone in her sad world.

746
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:28,593
We're done with you. You're never 
going to see us again. Come on.

747
00:39:31,283 --> 00:39:34,674
I'm pretty sure you're wrong 
about that, Agent Booth.

748
00:39:51,618 --> 00:39:52,945
Vodka ?

749
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:59,301
It's water. But it's on the rocks.

750
00:39:59,952 --> 00:40:02,353
You know, Bones, I'm not sure you grasp

751
00:40:02,388 --> 00:40:05,014
the basic theory on how to get drunk.

752
00:40:07,395 --> 00:40:11,008
What you need to do is order 
a shot of hard liquor

753
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:18,929
from a bartender named Shakey, 
and tell him to leave the bottle.

754
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:22,171
I'm fine, Booth.

755
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,604
I'm sitting here, thinking about it and...

756
00:40:27,276 --> 00:40:28,883
I'm fine.

757
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,829
OK.

758
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,530
What I'm getting from you up here, 
Bones, is that you're fine.

759
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:45,201
He murdered Sarah. He was about to murder Helen.

760
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:48,541
Why should I feel upset about shooting him ?

761
00:40:48,576 --> 00:40:51,847
If I was going to be upset, which I'm not,

762
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,637
it would be because Epps thinks he beat us, so...

763
00:40:55,513 --> 00:40:57,466
He didn't.
- I know.

764
00:40:57,501 --> 00:41:00,257
You're upset because you think he beat us.

765
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,060
And you know what ?

766
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,060
He did.

767
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,816
Beat us ?
- Yeah.

768
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:11,630
But you just said that he didn't.

769
00:41:11,665 --> 00:41:13,082
Well, I changed my mind.

770
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:14,961
What, in the last three seconds ?

771
00:41:14,996 --> 00:41:18,019
You're afraid that Epps turned you into him,

772
00:41:18,379 --> 00:41:20,182
into a killer.

773
00:41:20,502 --> 00:41:22,807
You have to come to grips with the fact

774
00:41:22,842 --> 00:41:25,055
that you killed another human being.

775
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,360
Because when you kill someone,

776
00:41:28,975 --> 00:41:30,687
there's a cost.

777
00:41:32,215 --> 00:41:33,863
A steep cost.

778
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,441
I know. I've done it.

779
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:41,905
I did the right thing.

780
00:41:42,697 --> 00:41:44,169
I know.

781
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:48,962
I was there.

782
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,830
Look what I did.

783
00:41:59,174 --> 00:42:00,859
It doesn't matter.

784
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:03,919
It does. It matters.

785
00:42:06,937 --> 00:42:09,390
Got something for ya.

786
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,853
A bottle of hard liquor.
- The next best thing.

787
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,597
Meet... Jasper.

788
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:38,174
You're gonna be OK.

789
00:42:39,503 --> 00:42:43,434
Yeah ?
- Definitely.

790
00:42:47,535 --> 00:42:52,035
subtitle VO : ??????????
