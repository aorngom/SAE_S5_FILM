1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,600
I'm supposed to
be on vacation,

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:04,860
you know, spending
time with Sully.

3
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:07,353
Oh, that's a good lesson
for Sully, then, huh ?

4
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:10,252
Next time he actually
takes youawayon vacation,

5
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:12,697
you should go away,
you know, leave town.

6
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:14,317
You had a vacation
and never left town.

7
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:15,873
That wasn't a vacation,
it was a suspension.

8
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:17,464
Plus compulsory therapy.

9
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:19,639
Hey, dude, don't
knock therapy, okay ?

10
00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:21,323
Dr. Wyatt has
helped me realize

11
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:23,347
that there are
certain pressures

12
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:24,711
that build up on the job

13
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:27,290
and I need creative ways...
We do everything together.

14
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,115
...of dealing with them.

15
00:00:28,142 --> 00:00:29,954
Whoa, what exactly do
you have to contend with

16
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:30,956
on the job
that I don't ?

17
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:33,258
You, Bones, you don't have
to contend with you.

18
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:35,669
So we got a trunk.
Looks like it's been wrapped

19
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:36,756
with chains,

20
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,434
battered up pretty good,
most likely came

21
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:40,544
through the sluiceways upstream
in Maryland.

22
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:41,695
Is it locked ?

23
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:43,251
Not anymore, it isn't.

24
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:44,551
Is there a body in there ?

25
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:46,299
Sort of.

26
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:52,829
Beats the hell
out of me

27
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:53,767
what the deal is with this one.

28
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:55,877
The head looks flat,

29
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:58,243
as if the skull has been
totally pulverized.

30
00:00:58,364 --> 00:00:59,068
Maybe she got run over

31
00:00:59,089 --> 00:00:59,814
by a steamroller ?

32
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:01,135
What are you saying ?

33
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,840
She was killed
by Wile E. Coyote ?

34
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:04,496
Okay, I want

35
00:01:04,517 --> 00:01:07,501
the whole kip and canoodle
transported to the Jeffersonian.

36
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:07,864
Kit...

37
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:08,972
and caboodle.

38
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:10,997
Why don't we just
wrap this up fast,

39
00:01:11,082 --> 00:01:12,574
so we can get you back
on your vacation ?

40
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:14,429
Thank you, I'd
appreciate that.

41
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,004
You have got to be kidding.

42
00:01:21,524 --> 00:01:22,632
What's with the tone ?

43
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:24,390
You want me to take this face

44
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,436
and build a
skull for it ?

45
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:28,013
Can you do it ?
No.

46
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:30,540
You're always taking skulls
and putting on faces.

47
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:32,205
Can't you simply reverse
the process ?

48
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:33,037
No.

49
00:01:33,122 --> 00:01:35,680
Why not ?
BecauseIam
a human being.

50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,111
She's missing
every bone in her body ?

51
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:44,306
Her skeleton was removed.

52
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:45,329
Oh.

53
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,569
All right, leaving
the third circle of Hell,

54
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:49,755
but before I go,

55
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:51,737
I think she's Asian.

56
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:53,719
Don't base that on skin tone.

57
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:55,041
She was boiled,
which is

58
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,247
why we can only get
partial fingerprints.

59
00:01:57,354 --> 00:01:59,272
I'm not going off skin tone.

60
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:01,230
I'm going off her hair.

61
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:04,278
I have an idea
for the face--

62
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,728
I... if you can remove
the head

63
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:07,156
from the rest
of the skin sack.

64
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:09,759
Please, God, I am not
out of earshot yet.

65
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:12,921
The victim was boiled.

66
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,756
Then a number of incisions were
made from the top of the skull,

67
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:18,441
around her right ear
and down her right side.

68
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,168
Then from her left foot,

69
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:22,206
along the outside
of the body to her left hip.

70
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,593
Someone with medical traing ?
Definitely not.

71
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:25,787
An untrained hand

72
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:27,172
but a very sharp instrument.

73
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:27,663
Boiled ?

74
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:30,242
The entire skeletal
structure removed,

75
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,878
then the skin was sewn
back around the organs.

76
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,370
It doesn't fit
any kind of

77
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:36,459
ritual killing
I've ever heard or read about.

78
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:39,139
The organs are damaged
due to the clumsy cutting,

79
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:39,760
but everything's there...

80
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:41,252
except the brain and the eyes.

81
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:42,190
Oh, God.

82
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:43,298
Must have been
difficult

83
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:44,939
to remove all the smaller bones,

84
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:46,111
like the phalanges.

85
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:47,674
It's all gone.

86
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,145
I didn't even find one bone.

87
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:50,019
The algae in the trunk

88
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,685
is cyanobacteria called
microcystis aeruginosa.

89
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:57,516
The size of the...
scum colony indicates

90
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:59,237
eight days submersion.

91
00:02:59,373 --> 00:03:00,217
Dr. Brennan.

92
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,308
Have I offended you in some way ?

93
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:05,461
Dr. Saroyan
said "no bones," so...

94
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:06,504
You know
what that means ?

95
00:03:06,632 --> 00:03:08,766
I'm back on vacation.

96
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:10,533
No bones, no Bones.

97
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:13,768
I was the second "bones."

98
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:15,707
That's very witty.

99
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:21,121
Essentially, all we have to do
is refillthe empty head.

100
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,825
Like a balloon.

101
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:25,828
Which is literally
what we did.

102
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:27,576
Oh, no, you
did not.

103
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:29,601
Put a bladder
inside the head

104
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:32,265
and inflate it very slowly.

105
00:03:35,297 --> 00:03:36,406
This is...

106
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,432
It's...

107
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,691
absolutely...

108
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:43,546
Brilliant ?
Useless.

109
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:45,482
You need the exact
shape of a skull

110
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,059
to get a likeness, not just a...

111
00:03:47,486 --> 00:03:48,466
This is...

112
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:50,107
Turn that off.

113
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:52,644
Oh, my God.

114
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:55,180
You guys are perverse.

115
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:56,791
Dr. Brennan was right.

116
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,711
Bone people should
only do bone things.

120
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:38,363
Have a good episode !

121
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:48,511
Hello !

122
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:51,197
Hey !

123
00:04:51,303 --> 00:04:52,305
Doctor Brennan !

124
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,150
Agent Sullivan I presume.

125
00:04:55,006 --> 00:04:56,327
So ! What do you think ?

126
00:04:56,498 --> 00:04:58,245
I think you're very dirty.

127
00:04:58,395 --> 00:04:59,610
Wow !

128
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:01,293
- You've got something.
- Oh.

129
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:03,062
Oh.

130
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,746
Huh... Come on aboard, here.

131
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,175
So i didn't think I'd see you 
for a couple days.

132
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,711
Well, I know... It's strange 
but I actually...

133
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:12,311
would rather spend time 
with you than work.

134
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,080
Wow. I'm flattered.

135
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:17,591
So...

136
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:19,317
You're renting it ?

137
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:21,705
Well, I...

138
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:23,708
was thinking about buying her.

139
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:24,923
Wow...

140
00:05:25,387 --> 00:05:26,154
Can you afford it  ?

141
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:29,287
If i liquidate everything and 
borrow heavily, not at all.

142
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:32,719
Seems, you live on it ?

143
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:34,417
Her.

144
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,058
You know, live on her.

145
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:37,913
And before I commit,

146
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,342
I wanna spend a night on her

147
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:42,197
With you.

148
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:43,625
Oh, what would that prove  ?

149
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:45,510
Call it sexual Feng shui.

150
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:47,700
I don't think that's a real thing.

151
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:49,746
If it doesn't work for us, 
I don't want this boat.

152
00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:57,854
Wow.

153
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,516
Apparently, you do think
it's a real thing.

154
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:09,771
I can't find anything

155
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:12,504
on how to estimate the height
of a body without bones.

156
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:15,765
Does the skin stretch or
contract without a skeleton ?

157
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:18,919
Uh, boiled leather immersed in
water would tend to stretch,

158
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,685
then contract as it dries.

159
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:22,390
Maybe the principle applies.

160
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:25,018
I'm finding bruising
on the torso.

161
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:28,187
I'll subject the tissue
to reflectance spectroscopy

162
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:30,766
to get at a rough idea
of when the blows were sustained

163
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,042
and whether they were fatal.

164
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:33,407
Dr. Saroyan ?

165
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,635
The face debacle taught me
a lesson.

166
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:38,170
I'm strictly a bone guy,
like Dr. Brennan.

167
00:06:38,508 --> 00:06:41,814
Which is exactly why
I called for you, bone boy.

168
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:44,028
A patella ?
Yes.

169
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:46,421
X- rays showed it was lodged in
the fatty tissue of the leg.

170
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,766
A bone.
Something we can work with.

171
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:50,954
It's just a kneecap, Zack.

172
00:06:51,046 --> 00:06:51,899
Don't get too excited.

173
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:53,284
To you, it's just a kneecap.

174
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:56,326
To Dr. Brennan, it's the
best part of a human being.

175
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:58,223
Good to know.

176
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:05,294
Hey.

177
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:10,893
Ahoy the boat ?

178
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:12,552
Booth ?

179
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:13,661
Yeah, I need Bones.

180
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:17,625
Permission to come
aboard or what ?

181
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:22,617
Hey, man, uh,
is this important ?

182
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:23,991
Yeah, we got a bone.

183
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:24,967
Tell me about it.

184
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:27,354
It's from the boneless girl.

185
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:29,762
What kind of bone ?

186
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,101
Here and here.

187
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:37,423
Frontal spurring.

188
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:40,172
What's that mean ?
Zack ?

189
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,483
A lot of time spent
on the knees.

190
00:07:42,644 --> 00:07:44,685
Oh, so she's either
a nun or a prostitute.

191
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,680
No, tendon attachments

192
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:49,548
on the inside of the patella
also suggest squatting,

193
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:50,851
which is not

194
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:52,383
nun-like behavior.
You didn't need

195
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:54,020
to interrupt my vacation
for this, you know.

196
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,898
Well, you know, you said to call
if a bone showed up, and...

197
00:07:57,814 --> 00:07:58,773
this is a bone.

198
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:01,365
The density of secondary
osteon structures

199
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:03,469
suggests the victim was
in her early 20s

200
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:04,554
at the time of her death.

201
00:08:04,703 --> 00:08:05,961
See, Zack is capable.

202
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,069
You don't need me.

203
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,439
It's an interesting shape.

204
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,408
Square rather
than triangular.

205
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:14,039
Classic nail-patella syndrome.

206
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:16,938
It's a genetic defect,
also known as Fong's Disease.

207
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:18,277
Fong's Disease, right.

208
00:08:18,473 --> 00:08:19,515
What's that ?

209
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:21,877
Angela said the victim's hair
suggested Asian.

210
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:23,383
Our victim
may have grown up

211
00:08:23,393 --> 00:08:25,549
in a non-industrialized
rural environment.

212
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:28,889
Well, early 20s, Asian, rural area.

213
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,211
I'll check
with immigration.

214
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:32,022
Zack will do
an osteological profile

215
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:34,367
on the bone, see if we
can focus geographically,

216
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:36,385
while I get back on vacation.

217
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,160
Wow, Dr. Brennan
really likes that boat.

218
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:48,442
I thought you said
you couldn't make a face.

219
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,485
Well, did you hear
about Zack and Hodgins

220
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:51,711
and the balloon
in the head ?

221
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,749
Ha. Is it as bad
as it sounds ?

222
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:54,616
Yes.

223
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:56,978
The least I could do is
try to give her a face,

224
00:08:57,106 --> 00:08:57,980
poor woman.

225
00:08:58,598 --> 00:08:59,536
So...

226
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:00,986
a boat, hmm ?

227
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,266
Oh, Sully ? Yeah.

228
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:05,500
Last month he wanted
to live in a tree house.

229
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:07,805
He's like me.

230
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:09,319
Yeah.

231
00:09:10,726 --> 00:09:11,642
No, I don't see that.

232
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:15,195
Well, he's not really made
for all this murder and corpses

233
00:09:15,323 --> 00:09:17,604
and empty eye
sockets crap.

234
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,416
He's a romantic.

235
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:20,588
Unlike me ?

236
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:21,462
No.

237
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,551
You're a romantic
of a narrow kind.

238
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:25,595
You live to
catch bad guys.

239
00:09:25,787 --> 00:09:27,172
Sully lives wide.

240
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:30,881
Hey, I got a hit off the Homeland 
Security database.

241
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,545
Li Ling Fan.

242
00:09:33,884 --> 00:09:36,636
Yeah, she's here on a Fiancé
Visa from mainland China.

243
00:09:36,985 --> 00:09:39,414
Fingerprints...
it's a match.

244
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:40,825
Print this up for me.

245
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:42,121
Yeah, this is the victim.

246
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:44,466
Okay, I'll go, uh,
visit her fiancé tomorrow.

247
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:48,153
I... I live wide, too.

248
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:50,546
Far and wide.

249
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,059
Right ?

250
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:53,786
There's nothing wider
than Seeley Booth.

251
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:56,301
Okay, then.

252
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:58,070
My bad.

253
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:00,578
Ling Fan is dead ?

254
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,454
Are you certain ?

255
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:04,990
When was the last time you saw
your wife, Mr. Harper ?

256
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:06,695
Fan wasn't my wife.

257
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:07,781
Well...

258
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,641
she immigrated here
on a, um, Fiancé Visa

259
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:15,134
and you're listed
as the, uh, fiancé.

260
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,202
We called it off.

261
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:18,991
Mutual thing.

262
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:20,078
Well, you see,

263
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:21,293
I don't believe that.

264
00:10:21,506 --> 00:10:23,766
I mean, a poor girl
from China travels

265
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,899
thousands of miles
away from her family

266
00:10:27,048 --> 00:10:30,528
to be with the man
that she loves.

267
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:32,062
It's not like she has
many options.

268
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,963
So, uh, when was the last time
you saw her ?

269
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,071
About a month ago.

270
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:38,265
How did she die ?

271
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,352
Yeah, we're still, uh,

272
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,616
we're still looking into that.

273
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:43,195
Foul play, right ?

274
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:44,644
I mean, the FBI
wouldn't be asking

275
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,669
so many questions
if it was an accident.

276
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:47,830
So you, uh,

277
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:49,546
so you get off
on all this, uh...

278
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,903
Asian stuff, huh ?

279
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,353
Martial arts ?

280
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:55,632
Weapons ?

281
00:10:55,717 --> 00:10:58,104
I've dedicated my life to it.

282
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:00,001
She had some bruising,
your fiancé.

283
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:02,433
I don't know anything
about that.

284
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,183
These, uh, weapons here,

285
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:06,334
here are they, uh,

286
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,890
genuine ?
Knockoffs.

287
00:11:07,996 --> 00:11:09,275
I can't afford the real thing.

288
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:10,064
Really ?

289
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:12,424
Since when does
a fence

290
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:14,321
worry about affording things ?

291
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,068
Details
like a criminal record,

292
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,116
they tend to, uh, come up
during a murder investigation.

293
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:21,412
Murder ?

294
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,456
Homicide.

295
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,268
See, I've, uh,
dedicated

296
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:25,376
my life to it.

297
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:07,432
I've been on Arab dhows
about this size,

298
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:09,663
but I don't think I could
handle one all by myself.

299
00:12:10,182 --> 00:12:12,434
This is a lot more
high tech than a dhow.

300
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:17,353
Why... Why didn't you ask me
to go out with you ?

301
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:18,950
I'm a good sailor.

302
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:20,314
Well, you know,

303
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:22,275
I've got to be able
to handle it by myself.

304
00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:25,759
I'd much rather have
a crew... you, in fact...

305
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:28,999
but what if you got
conked on the head,

306
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:30,214
and ran off
with a pirate ?

307
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:33,177
Ahoy, the boat.

308
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:34,704
Oh... Booth...

309
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:37,092
Don't tell me.
You found another bone.

310
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:40,656
Well, I've got this Chinese book
that needs translating.

311
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,250
Maybe you, uh, got somebody

312
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:44,076
at the Jeffersonian
we could, uh, talk to ?

313
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,271
No ! I'm on vacation.

314
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:48,062
Well, he'll just
keep showing up.

315
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:50,215
Might as well pitch in and get
the case solved.

316
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:54,578
It's a ledger for buying and
selling weapons.

317
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:56,508
Illegal
weapons.

318
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:00,865
One entry
refers to this.

319
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,082
It's a Jian,

320
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:03,616
a double-edged
sword.

321
00:13:03,744 --> 00:13:05,023
A dergu...

322
00:13:05,513 --> 00:13:06,878
This fellow's not Chinese,
correct ?

323
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:08,092
How can you tell ?

324
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,435
These characters are

325
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:10,906
labored, overly formal.

326
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:13,947
Professor Shi Jon Chen
is a highly-respected

327
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:15,120
cultural
anthropologist

328
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:17,102
- who specializes...
- Yeah, he's one of you.

329
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,402
Yeah, I get it.

330
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:20,086
You definitely
didn't get all

331
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:20,768
the weapons.

332
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:23,809
Including this...
a Xing shuang.

333
00:13:25,344 --> 00:13:26,282
A Flying Horse.

334
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,157
A very rare ornate dagger.

335
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:29,862
So, what do you think, Jon Chen ?

336
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:32,477
Obviously, he has
a fetishistic slant

337
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:33,650
towards all
things Asian.

338
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:35,120
A mail order bride
would have been

339
00:13:35,206 --> 00:13:37,124
a thing to him,
like these weapons.

340
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,767
What about the ritualistic
removal of the bones ?

341
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:41,365
Could it be Minghun ?

342
00:13:41,624 --> 00:13:43,179
No. Definitely not.

343
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:44,671
What's that, huh ?

344
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,016
It's an ancient belief
in rural China

345
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:49,361
that if a young,
unmarried male dies,

346
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:50,405
his family
should rebury

347
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:51,869
his bones with the bones
of a woman.

348
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:53,724
A- A bride for the afterlife.

349
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:54,939
Like a bury-age,

350
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:55,940
or a marr-ial.

351
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:57,198
A deading ?

352
00:14:01,684 --> 00:14:02,898
But I've
never heard

353
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:05,904
of anyone committing murder
to get these bones.

354
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,568
Well, then, we should pursue
this avenue of investigation.

355
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:10,055
If you come across

356
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:11,232
a Minghun

357
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:14,278
in which the origin
of the bride's bones is unclear,

358
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:15,728
you let us know.

359
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:20,928
Of course.

360
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:26,761
All right,
Sully, look,

361
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:28,195
I want you to look into buying
one of these ancient

362
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:31,137
Chinese weapons,
Leaping Donkey ?

363
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,309
Flying Horse ?
Yeah.

364
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:34,848
Whatever. See if Harper surfaces
long enough

365
00:14:34,997 --> 00:14:36,361
to, uh... to make the sale.

366
00:14:39,302 --> 00:14:40,368
Homeland Security says

367
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:43,096
the Fiancé Visa was
expedited by a lawyer

368
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:45,818
on a retainer, and to
a smaller bride agency

369
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,609
here in town called
The Perfect Wife.

370
00:14:47,758 --> 00:14:49,079
That sounds archaic.

371
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,672
Well, you know, in
therapy, I learned

372
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,283
that, uh, superlatives like
"perfect" are, uh, meaningless.

373
00:14:55,446 --> 00:14:56,299
Not in science.

374
00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:58,792
A perfect number is a number
whose divisors add up to itself,

375
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,945
as in, one plus two
plus three equals six.

376
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:02,437
You know, in
therapy I learned

377
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:05,592
that definitive statements are
by their very nature wrong.

378
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:06,395
Isn't the statement,

379
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,680
"Definitive statements
are by their very nature wrong"

380
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:11,216
definitive,
and, thus, wrong ?

381
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:12,687
You hate psychology.

382
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,264
You haven't said anything
to change my mind.

383
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,389
You know,
this is exactly why, okay,

384
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:19,267
sometimes I-I do things like
shoot up an ice-cream truck.

385
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:20,951
Well, it's a good thing
you had therapy.

386
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:25,468
You know, we talked about you
in therapy.

387
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,322
You did ?

388
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:32,886
What did you say ?

389
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:36,123
Well, you know,
since it was, uh, my therapy,

390
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,314
I don't have
to share the details.

391
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:40,872
Sorry.

392
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:44,106
So you specialize

393
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,728
in bringing brides
over from Russia,

394
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:48,795
Romania, China
and Thailand ?

395
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:50,586
I've had over 500 marriages

396
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:51,758
since I opened shop.

397
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:53,498
I match the happy couple

398
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:55,182
using an empirical system

399
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,759
of reciprocal attributes.

400
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:57,867
You can't match

401
00:15:57,995 --> 00:15:59,317
humans empirically
because

402
00:15:59,465 --> 00:16:01,661
the variables number
in the tens of thousands.

403
00:16:01,832 --> 00:16:03,516
I never recommend a match

404
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,366
with less than 200 points
of compatible commonality.

405
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:10,160
Tens of thousands is
way more than 200.

406
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:12,313
Yeah, this is great.
Were Drew Harper and Miss Fan...

407
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:13,485
Miss Li.

408
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:14,801
In Chinese nomenclature,

409
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:15,760
the last name's first.

410
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,678
And the first name is last.

411
00:16:18,254 --> 00:16:19,639
Great. Were they a good match ?

412
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:21,920
Sadly, I'm sorry
to say, in the end, no.

413
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:23,817
They decided not to marry.

414
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:26,321
What-What happened
to Ms. Li after that ?

415
00:16:26,662 --> 00:16:29,412
On a Fianc\e Visa,
the couple has 90 days to marry,

416
00:16:29,558 --> 00:16:31,394
and if they don't,
the bride is required

417
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:33,312
to return to her country
of origin,

418
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:35,965
so, if Ling Fan is missing,

419
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,833
it's probably because
she went back home.

420
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:39,070
Ms. Fan is...

421
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,252
Li Ling Fan is dead,

422
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:47,552
Miss Burrows.

423
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:48,639
She was beaten.

424
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,622
Drew Harper may
have killed her.

425
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:51,602
Did that possibility

426
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:53,371
show up in your 200 points ?

427
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,036
Um...

428
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:01,660
This is my background check
on Drew Harper.

429
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,516
You'll find that my screening
process exceeds the minimums

430
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:06,068
set by the Marriage Broker Act.

431
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:09,095
Thank you, Ms. Burrows.
You-You can leave.

432
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,055
Well, Harper provided
a completely false background.

433
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:22,377
Is that possible ?

434
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:23,847
Well, career criminal, fence.

435
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:25,148
I mean, yeah,
he could bring himself

436
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:27,080
a whole identity
based on false documents.

437
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,299
This is definitely
not a match made in heaven.

438
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,878
I've bn worming my way
into observing this ceremony

439
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:37,585
firsthand for two months
through the groom's family.

440
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:39,227
That would be the dead groom ?
Yes.

441
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:41,230
Overtures are always made
by the groom's family.

442
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:45,185
Now, I hear they will pay
$25,000 dollars for a bride.

443
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,777
- That would be the dead bride ?
- Booth...

444
00:17:46,896 --> 00:17:48,419
you're being very judgmental.

445
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:50,465
I apologize.

446
00:17:50,998 --> 00:17:51,658
I just

447
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:52,618
think it's a little...

448
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:54,557
Apparently,

449
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:55,623
they've found a bride.

450
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,322
Well, who is she, or was she ?

451
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,836
You know, because she's dead.

452
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,585
My sources don't know anything
about the bride.

453
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,695
Who got the $25,000 ?

454
00:18:03,887 --> 00:18:05,123
Most likely the bride's family.

455
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,253
Most likely ?

456
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:07,802
My understanding

457
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,020
is that before the Minghun,
the bones are spread

458
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,470
throughout the family members,

459
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,454
and then brought together
for the reburial ceremony ?

460
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:16,562
- That's correct.
- If you could get

461
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:17,687
me a sample of one

462
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:19,734
of the bones,
we could check the DNA,

463
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,098
see if it's Li Ling Fan.

464
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:23,059
Do you know where
any of these bones are, Professor Shi ?

465
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:31,377
I might know where
maybe one bone is being kept.

466
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:32,827
If you could get me to a place

467
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:34,170
where I could just look

468
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:35,491
at the bone,
your subjects

469
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:36,898
will never know I was there.

470
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:42,487
All right,

471
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:44,426
but you'll have
to pretend to be

472
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:45,790
my girlfriend...

473
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:49,520
and her brother.

474
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:52,672
Yeah, right.

475
00:18:59,023 --> 00:18:59,978
What did she say ?

476
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:01,875
Just hospitality stuff.

477
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:12,691
I don't need to
speak Chinese to get that.

478
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,439
She don't think
Bones is good for you.

479
00:19:14,908 --> 00:19:16,080
You just made that up.

480
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:18,126
Nail on the head.

481
00:19:18,446 --> 00:19:19,448
Ha !

482
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:39,181
She said your face
has character.

483
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:41,973
Yeah, well, all the, uh, older
ladies, they-they like me.

484
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:44,333
Bones, what are you
doing, Bones ? Bones ?

485
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:48,063
The... These are traditional
storage pots.

486
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:49,522
Please, Dr. Brennan,
whatever you find,

487
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,865
you promised not
to disturb it.

488
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:53,040
No, I promised not
to disrupt your study. Ooh !

489
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:56,124
Whoa, what is it ?
Is that human ?

490
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,213
Yeah, it's an ilium
part of the hip bone.

491
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,131
What am I supposed
to do with this ?

492
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:01,960
Dr. Brennan, quickly,
put it back !

493
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:18,321
Did Bones just speak Chinese ?

494
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:23,605
Definitely human.

495
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:25,715
No sign of any cut marks.

496
00:20:25,864 --> 00:20:27,548
- Well, is it Li Ling Fan ?
- No.

497
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:28,635
It's male.

498
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,106
So, what, you got a...

499
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:31,890
part of the groom instead
of a piece of the bride ?

500
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:32,998
Bones stole it.

501
00:20:33,147 --> 00:20:35,406
Not stole, swapped.

502
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:36,962
From an old Chinese lady's
mantle.

503
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,533
I brought
a bunch of

504
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,540
chimpanzee bones and pulled
the old, uh, switchamacallit.

505
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:43,819
Switcharoo.

506
00:20:43,968 --> 00:20:45,013
Whatchamacallit.

507
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:45,817
Two different things.

508
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:47,010
These anomalies--

509
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,270
whoever this was died of cancer.

510
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:50,591
I'll get Zack
to find the details,

511
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:52,616
but this is definitely not
Li Ling Fan.

512
00:20:52,744 --> 00:20:54,492
Maybe it's the groom.
Makes sense.

513
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,451
Especially if this is a
dead people bone marriage thing.

514
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:00,945
Uh, Temperance ?

515
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:02,501
Hey.

516
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:04,185
Um, you got a sec ?

517
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:08,944
Excuse me.

518
00:21:09,711 --> 00:21:10,926
You bought the boat.

519
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:12,844
Finalized this morning.

520
00:21:14,485 --> 00:21:17,102
Wait, sailboats
have keys ?

521
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:20,511
Uh, no,
not-not really.

522
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:23,750
These are keys to the marina,
but, you know, it's symbolic.

523
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:26,126
Congratulations.

524
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:30,623
So, I'm gonna tell you
something, and I-I want you

525
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:32,745
to think about it a while
before you answer.

526
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:34,877
Okay.

527
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,049
Well, you say ok,

528
00:21:36,177 --> 00:21:39,395
but it takes you microseconds
to think things through, so...

529
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:41,953
this time,
I'd-I'd appreciate it

530
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,115
if you, uh, just
took a breath,

531
00:21:44,243 --> 00:21:45,245
because...

532
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,461
it's... it's big.

533
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:52,683
what is it ?

534
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,248
I'm headed south

535
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:58,145
in the boat to the Caribbean.

536
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:00,830
When ?

537
00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:02,770
When this case is done.

538
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:05,866
You quit the FBI ?

539
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,230
No. No, not yet.

540
00:22:07,486 --> 00:22:10,805
I'll take a couple of months
to get used to the boat...

541
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:11,721
you know, really check it out...

542
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:14,279
and then I'll start
running charters, probably

543
00:22:14,407 --> 00:22:16,432
- for the Turks and Caicos, which is...
- You're...

544
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,393
You're really talking a lot.

545
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:19,906
I know.

546
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:22,523
And I haven't even gotten
to the main part.

547
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:26,786
Which is, uh...

548
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:29,919
I really...

549
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:32,861
really want you to come with me.

550
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:38,788
You do ?

551
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:41,005
I do.

552
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,383
Take a sabbatical.

553
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:48,538
There's more to life
than corpses

554
00:22:48,644 --> 00:22:49,262
and murders.

555
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,012
You know, we do this job
for too long, we get warped.

556
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:54,542
I can feel it
happening already.

557
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:56,183
- Maybe you can, too.
- Let...

558
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,720
Let's run away together.

559
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,034
Well, you know,
think about it.

560
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:08,423
Want a hug ?

561
00:23:08,977 --> 00:23:09,937
Okay. No.

562
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:11,066
That's...

563
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,667
That's a lot to process.

564
00:23:13,795 --> 00:23:15,220
So, just, you know,
I don't know,

565
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,012
you know, let me know
when you think that maybe...

566
00:23:18,886 --> 00:23:19,888
Okay.

567
00:23:38,822 --> 00:23:42,189
Stage Three Sarcoma,
M-1 Metastasis.

568
00:23:42,573 --> 00:23:44,534
Like Brennan said: Cancer.

569
00:23:44,832 --> 00:23:46,978
Yes, most likely,
it spread from

570
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:48,939
prostate or testicular cancer.

571
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:50,708
So it's definitely a guy.

572
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:52,904
If this is the groom,
then he's Chinese,

573
00:23:53,053 --> 00:23:54,545
and, according
to Dr. Shi,

574
00:23:54,652 --> 00:23:56,246
most likely related in some way

575
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:59,571
to the old lady
who kept him in a pot.

576
00:23:59,614 --> 00:24:01,276
Which should be enough
to identify him

577
00:24:01,354 --> 00:24:02,299
through hospital records.

578
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:05,006
None of Harper's weapons show

579
00:24:05,113 --> 00:24:07,393
any sign of being used
to dissect a human being.

580
00:24:07,564 --> 00:24:08,438
No protein residue,

581
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:09,738
even under ALS.

582
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,166
Is there any way to tell

583
00:24:11,272 --> 00:24:13,127
what kind of blade
was used on the skin ?

584
00:24:13,212 --> 00:24:14,938
Only that it was sharp
and straight-edged.

585
00:24:15,024 --> 00:24:16,339
But I did find
evidence of

586
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:17,916
toxicity damage to the kidney.

587
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:19,749
Wait, the victim was poisoned ?

588
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,222
I thought she was
beaten to death.

589
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:24,801
Well, the bruising could've been
a result of Fong's Disease.

590
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,820
Toxicology
identified the toxin

591
00:24:26,948 --> 00:24:28,760
as a root called Lei Gong Teng.

592
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:31,147
In small doses,
it's an anti-inflammatory.

593
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:33,357
In large, it has another name.

594
00:24:33,747 --> 00:24:35,047
Loosely
translates as

595
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:36,746
"Walk seven steps and die."

596
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:39,900
I'll have Booth check out
Chinese herbalists.

597
00:24:43,374 --> 00:24:44,717
Want me to bring you up to date ?

598
00:24:45,078 --> 00:24:45,996
No.

599
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,342
I want you to tell me
what to do.

600
00:24:49,811 --> 00:24:50,856
About what ?

601
00:24:52,153 --> 00:24:53,816
Sully wants me
to run off with him.

602
00:24:54,221 --> 00:24:55,969
- Go.
- For a year.

603
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,823
- Go.
- He wants to run a charter boat

604
00:24:57,908 --> 00:24:58,974
around the Caribbean.

605
00:24:59,336 --> 00:24:59,891
Go.

606
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:01,830
He says I should
take a sabbatical.

607
00:25:01,894 --> 00:25:02,555
Go.

608
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:04,710
What is the downside ?

609
00:25:05,158 --> 00:25:06,436
He's a great guy.

610
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:07,886
This is a
great idea.

611
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:09,655
I'd miss you guys.

612
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:11,914
Oh, we'll meet you in Barbados.

613
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:14,960
Look, you have been working
every day since I met you.

614
00:25:15,088 --> 00:25:17,646
It's time to let another part
of yourself out into the sun,

615
00:25:17,902 --> 00:25:21,269
with a bare-chested man
in a tropical breeze.

616
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,955
William Chang.

617
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:27,111
Single, age 27,
died two years ago

618
00:25:27,218 --> 00:25:29,498
of metastasizing
prostate cancer.

619
00:25:29,605 --> 00:25:31,438
Great nephew
of Mei Zhang.

620
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,887
He looks nice.

621
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,891
Booth will want
to talk to his parents,

622
00:25:34,975 --> 00:25:36,787
try to find out where
they got the female bones,

623
00:25:36,894 --> 00:25:38,236
in case it's Li Ling Fan.

624
00:25:38,343 --> 00:25:39,878
Listen to
me, Brennan.

625
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,561
Go.

626
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:47,171
There'll still be
murder and mayhem

627
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:48,258
when you get back.

628
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:56,677
They're going to know this
information came from me.

629
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,772
You've ruined my study.

630
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,435
They won't know for sure it was you.

631
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:03,205
Their son's bones are
spread all over the city.

632
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:06,125
They let me in on something very
precious to them and now this.

633
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:08,016
I broke the
first rule

634
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:10,894
of anthropology: minimize
the effect on the study.

635
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:12,748
Do you really believe
that your study

636
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:15,050
is more important
than catching a murder ?

637
00:26:17,085 --> 00:26:17,660
You used to be

638
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:20,538
dedicated to a much larger,
timeless truth.

639
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:25,517
Now, you're just a tool for those
who have smaller concerns.

640
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,680
So you buried your son William
three years ago.

641
00:26:46,197 --> 00:26:47,838
My condolences.

642
00:26:51,141 --> 00:26:52,797
We have come into possession

643
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:55,014
of one of his bones.

644
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,765
You have no idea
how this happened ?

645
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:05,030
Maybe you're planning on
reburying your son

646
00:27:05,115 --> 00:27:06,565
with the bones of a young woman

647
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:08,078
to provide him

648
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:09,911
loving company in the afterlife ?

649
00:27:14,412 --> 00:27:15,243
You see, we need to know

650
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,144
who this woman is,
because it's possible

651
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:18,547
that she's a murder victim.

652
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:23,407
You wouldn't want that,
would you ?

653
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:31,791
Okay. Well, you give me
no choice

654
00:27:31,876 --> 00:27:33,347
but to get an order
of exhumation.

655
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,373
Sully bought that boat.

656
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:39,546
Yeah ?

657
00:27:40,143 --> 00:27:40,867
Next thing you know,

658
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:43,958
he'll be shipwrecked on some
island talking to a volleyball.

659
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:45,748
He's leaving for
the Caribbean.

660
00:27:49,552 --> 00:27:50,320
Really.

661
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:54,561
Look, I'm... I'm sorry, Bones.

662
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:56,181
I know that
the two of you

663
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,328
were kind of
hitting it off, and...

664
00:27:58,392 --> 00:27:59,671
He wants me to go with him.

665
00:28:01,568 --> 00:28:02,676
Oh.

666
00:28:04,317 --> 00:28:05,653
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

667
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,106
He says I should take
a year off, a sabbatical.

668
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,534
He says it would be fun.
Yeah, it would be.

669
00:28:11,877 --> 00:28:14,392
You just said he'd be
shipwrecked with a volleyball.

670
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,246
No, he's got you,
he doesn't need the volleyball.

671
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:20,913
You think I should go ?

672
00:28:25,586 --> 00:28:26,566
Yeah.

673
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:27,742
Yeah.

674
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:30,403
You know, what's one year
out of your life, huh ?

675
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:33,387
A person's got to live wide.

676
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,261
This is kind of narrow.

677
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:41,396
Whoa.

678
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:43,421
That the coffin already ?

679
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:44,657
Can't be.

680
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:45,851
We're only
two feet down.

681
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:47,193
Oh, easy ! Careful !

682
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,254
Is it fake money ?

683
00:28:56,453 --> 00:28:58,265
There's no body in this coffin.

684
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:02,796
There was a body in here,
but it was removed.

685
00:29:03,627 --> 00:29:04,906
What's with the fake money ?

686
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:06,420
Chinese tradition.

687
00:29:06,803 --> 00:29:09,035
Send a loved one off to
the afterlife well-funded,

688
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:10,782
at least symbolically.

689
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:12,701
How long ago was
the body removed ?

690
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:15,685
This little darling is
Phaenicia sericata,

691
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,177
also known as
the common green bottle fly.

692
00:29:18,305 --> 00:29:20,905
Now, William Chang was buried
in January, three years ago.

693
00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:22,248
Since the green bottle fly

694
00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:24,870
is only active in the summer
months, I contend he was dug up

695
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:26,532
last July or August,

696
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,131
which allowed
maggots to be laid

697
00:29:28,252 --> 00:29:29,701
in the casket to feast on.

698
00:29:29,787 --> 00:29:30,959
Okay, yeah, I got it.

699
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:32,643
I can be a lot more specific.

700
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:33,559
No, no, you know...

701
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,648
dug up last summer and
distributed to the family...

702
00:29:35,755 --> 00:29:37,481
specific enough for the FBI.

703
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:39,312
He would've
decomposed quickly.

704
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:41,060
Buried in a pine box,

705
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:43,639
improperly sealed,
buried only two feet

706
00:29:43,724 --> 00:29:44,662
below the surface.

707
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:47,134
The Changs should
sue their mortuary.

708
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:48,648
Because of the
shallow burial ?

709
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:50,145
Yeah, and the decomp seepage

710
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:52,596
into the fake money is,
um, au naturel.

711
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:54,536
What does that mean ?

712
00:29:54,728 --> 00:29:56,348
The body was not embalmed.

713
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:58,543
All right, none of this is
helping us solve the mystery

714
00:29:58,692 --> 00:30:00,439
of what happened to Li Ling Fan.

715
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,570
The funeral home is in on it.

716
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:04,488
They wanted the
body to decompose

717
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:05,980
as quickly as possible.

718
00:30:06,215 --> 00:30:07,472
Full service mortuary.

719
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:10,435
They perform funerals
and weddings for dead people.

720
00:30:14,248 --> 00:30:16,443
Mortuary records show
that we buried William Chang

721
00:30:16,635 --> 00:30:17,743
in a lead-lined
casket.

722
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,214
If you found
another casket...

723
00:30:19,363 --> 00:30:21,047
Pine box.
It was a pine box.

724
00:30:21,132 --> 00:30:24,541
It is obvious that Mr. Chang
was dug up and reburied.

725
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,012
Who embalmed William Chang ?

726
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:27,482
The records show that

727
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,275
my grandson and I had 
that honor.

728
00:30:30,488 --> 00:30:31,191
You're lying.

729
00:30:31,255 --> 00:30:32,768
William Chang was
never embalmed.

730
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:34,020
said there was nothing

731
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:34,857
But you yourself

732
00:30:34,942 --> 00:30:37,287
but fake money in the casket.

733
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,374
So how can you tell ?

734
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:39,717
We can tell
from the residue

735
00:30:39,802 --> 00:30:40,910
left in the empty casket.

736
00:30:45,306 --> 00:30:46,734
I'm sorry, but we cannot help you.

737
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:48,439
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mr. Han,

738
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:49,462
please, just...

739
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:51,849
sit down... please ?
Just...

740
00:30:52,744 --> 00:30:54,907
Here's what I think, okay ?
I think that you have

741
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:57,869
some old Chinese
traditions alive

742
00:30:57,997 --> 00:31:00,278
which are illegal
in this country.

743
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:02,217
The Minghun reburial ceremony.

744
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:03,447
...I'm not
concerned about.

745
00:31:03,532 --> 00:31:06,409
What I care about is
if the bride was murdered.

746
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:07,944
Murdered ?

747
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:09,969
Our understanding is
that Mr. Chang's family

748
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:12,633
paid $25,000 for her bones.

749
00:31:12,697 --> 00:31:13,976
People have killed
for much less,

750
00:31:14,061 --> 00:31:18,218
so what part of that
25 grand came to you ?

751
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:20,712
Did the Changs admit
to paying that money ?

752
00:31:21,053 --> 00:31:21,735
No.

753
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:24,612
We found a cash withdrawal
that they can't explain.

754
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:26,520
But you are
not even certain that

755
00:31:26,828 --> 00:31:30,292
William Chang's Minghun bride
is this murdered woman ?

756
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:31,635
No, sir.

757
00:31:31,784 --> 00:31:33,340
But we can't know
for sure it isn't her

758
00:31:33,447 --> 00:31:34,662
without looking at the bones.

759
00:31:34,747 --> 00:31:37,266
If the bride were not
this murdered woman,

760
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:39,891
would you allow
the ceremony to proceed ?

761
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:40,744
Grandfather...

762
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,281
What ceremony ?

763
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:03,181
We're very sorry to disturb you.

764
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,225
FBI.

765
00:32:04,396 --> 00:32:05,504
I need to see the coffin.

766
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:07,902
Sorry.

767
00:32:08,946 --> 00:32:10,837
Take a look, Bones.
Take a look.

768
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:11,647
Okay.

769
00:32:12,904 --> 00:32:14,098
Indications of cancer.

770
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:15,845
I believe this is William Chang.

771
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:19,165
Here's the chimpanzee
ilium that I left.

772
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:20,188
What about the girl ?

773
00:32:23,598 --> 00:32:25,836
Lots of score marks
on the bones

774
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:27,541
congruent with flesh
being removed

775
00:32:27,598 --> 00:32:29,261
from the skeleton
with blades.

776
00:32:30,092 --> 00:32:31,733
I believe this is
Li Ling Fan.

777
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:35,314
Where is everybody ?

778
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:38,186
Well, I guess we really
broke up the party.

779
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:48,005
Positive I. D. on both
sets of remains:

780
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:49,945
William Chang
and Li Ling Fan.

781
00:32:50,222 --> 00:32:51,586
Wow, they kind of go together.

782
00:32:51,714 --> 00:32:53,042
Because they're deceased ?

783
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:54,528
Yeah, but more than that,

784
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:57,192
they're exactly the same
level of hotness.

785
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:59,364
Which is zero,
because they're skeletons.

786
00:32:59,555 --> 00:33:00,484
The cuts left on

787
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:03,243
the skeletal structure by
the removal of soft tissue

788
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:04,863
match the
implements the FBI

789
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:06,720
confiscated from the mortuary.

790
00:33:06,845 --> 00:33:07,717
She was ill,

791
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:09,252
and he was ill.

792
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:11,852
It's really too bad
they never actually met.

793
00:33:12,585 --> 00:33:15,114
The mortician's lawyer
advised him to clam up.

794
00:33:15,582 --> 00:33:17,032
The Changs now say

795
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:19,899
the $25,000 was used
to pay off a family debt.

796
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:20,560
You ever think that

797
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,393
their spirits actually did meet

798
00:33:22,478 --> 00:33:25,889
and are working to get
their bones together here

799
00:33:25,974 --> 00:33:26,848
on the physical plane ?

800
00:33:26,976 --> 00:33:29,683
You mean, like we're possessed
and doing their bidding ?

801
00:33:31,565 --> 00:33:32,965
You know what you people lack ?

802
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,591
Whimsy.

803
00:33:35,337 --> 00:33:36,702
It's a genuine handicap.

804
00:33:40,005 --> 00:33:42,195
There are four morticians
working at that mortuary

805
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,559
and a half a dozen assistants.

806
00:33:43,678 --> 00:33:45,179
Then any one of them
could have removed the bones

807
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:46,522
and sank the skin in the river.

808
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:47,758
Personally, I would
have cremated

809
00:33:47,886 --> 00:33:49,123
the remaing skins
and organs.

810
00:33:49,272 --> 00:33:50,940
No crematorium
at that mortuary.

811
00:33:51,382 --> 00:33:53,663
I am gonna draw them
a wedding picture.

812
00:33:54,644 --> 00:33:55,453
Okay.

813
00:33:56,008 --> 00:33:57,977
Well, you do that, we...

814
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,377
should find out
who poisoned the victim

815
00:34:00,484 --> 00:34:02,018
and arrest him for murder.

816
00:34:02,947 --> 00:34:04,209
It's probably the, uh,

817
00:34:04,337 --> 00:34:06,511
bouncing flying
mail order husband.

818
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:10,007
Does that count
as whimsy ?

819
00:34:10,454 --> 00:34:11,887
Well, you're
handicapped, Zack.

820
00:34:12,373 --> 00:34:14,782
Someone really needs
to throw a telethon for you.

821
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,409
How did Sully find Harper
so quickly ?

822
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,645
He didn't say.

823
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:23,691
You know, Sully's
a nice guy.

824
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:25,646
You sound condescending.

825
00:34:26,456 --> 00:34:28,161
I'm just trying
to be nice, okay.

826
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:30,207
I'm complimenting the fact that
you got a good one this time.

827
00:34:30,506 --> 00:34:33,511
Thereby implying I'm incapable
of making my own judgments.

828
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,743
The physicist
who couldn't tie his shoes...

829
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:38,320
Oh, the former professor

830
00:34:38,405 --> 00:34:41,048
who was, uh, jealous of your
own success... should I stop ?

831
00:34:41,134 --> 00:34:42,647
- Yes.
- Oh, the guy

832
00:34:42,775 --> 00:34:43,905
that you found
on the Internet

833
00:34:44,054 --> 00:34:45,731
ended up being some kind
of recruiter for a cult.

834
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,650
Oh, and this is my favorite:

835
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:49,440
the guy who cut off
his own brother's head

836
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,380
because he thought he was
possessed by a witch.

837
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:52,531
Yeah, you made your point.

838
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:53,980
Look, I'm just
saying a guy

839
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:57,409
who wants to take you away
from all this on a sailboat,

840
00:34:57,643 --> 00:34:58,645
that's a step up.

841
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,945
Condescending.

842
00:35:07,097 --> 00:35:07,907
That's our guy.

843
00:35:08,248 --> 00:35:09,314
Okay, so when do
we take him off ?

844
00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:10,507
Down.

845
00:35:10,998 --> 00:35:13,065
We take him down
when Sully puts his cap

846
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:14,323
in his back pocket.

847
00:35:20,213 --> 00:35:21,214
Freeze !

848
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:23,836
Freeze !

849
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:26,536
Geez, I told you
he was fast.

850
00:35:27,282 --> 00:35:28,497
- Are you okay ?
- Yeah.

851
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:30,266
Okay, great, fine.
Sully,

852
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:31,950
you chase him,
I'll head him off, okay ?

853
00:35:32,398 --> 00:35:33,810
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

854
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,903
- Have you thought about my offer ?
- Yes.

855
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,717
- What do you think ?
- This is not the time to discuss it.

856
00:35:53,056 --> 00:35:54,122
The guy must be
on meth !

857
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,252
Martial arts.

858
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:59,536
FBI. Freeze right there.

859
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,889
I said freeze !

860
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:02,274
Freeze !

861
00:36:02,497 --> 00:36:03,499
Damn it !

862
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,174
What, is he on wires ?

863
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:25,731
He ain't bouncing around
any more now, is he ?

864
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:28,968
See that ?

865
00:36:30,737 --> 00:36:32,293
I did not kill Ling Fan.

866
00:36:32,826 --> 00:36:34,128
Then why'd you keep
running away, huh ?

867
00:36:34,297 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm a criminal !

868
00:36:35,085 --> 00:36:35,938
You're police.

869
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:37,451
Ling Fan didn't really
know anyone.

870
00:36:37,558 --> 00:36:38,829
That makes you a good suspect.

871
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:40,712
Sell her bones for $25,000.

872
00:36:40,797 --> 00:36:41,884
Make up for the loss.

873
00:36:42,012 --> 00:36:42,630
What loss ?

874
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:44,378
You paid $25,000

875
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:46,915
to the Perfect Wife agency
to bring her over;

876
00:36:47,106 --> 00:36:49,626
probably another eight grand
for the round-trip ticket.

877
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:51,246
That's a lot of knife sales.

878
00:36:51,395 --> 00:36:52,973
You people got it
completely wrong.

879
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,530
Chick doesn't work out,
you get a full refund

880
00:36:55,871 --> 00:36:56,873
or a swap.

881
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,743
I took the money-back guarantee.

882
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,021
Really ?

883
00:37:00,107 --> 00:37:02,089
- Oops.
- I didn't lose a cent.

884
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,370
It's the mail order agency
that's out all that dough.

885
00:37:05,877 --> 00:37:07,028
What was wrong with her ?

886
00:37:07,454 --> 00:37:08,221
What ?!

887
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:09,820
Why did you send Ling Fan back ?

888
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:12,335
Chick was defective, man.

889
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:15,020
I'm a very active person.

890
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,257
She moved slow,

891
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:17,361
like an old lady.

892
00:37:21,794 --> 00:37:23,094
You hit me
with the Flying Horse ?

893
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:23,584
Yeah.

894
00:37:23,712 --> 00:37:25,183
That is a very
good item.

895
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:27,606
Maybe you still want to buy it ?

896
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:29,119
I'm gonna need bail money.

897
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:38,555
So, you wanna know
what your first mistake was ?

898
00:37:39,471 --> 00:37:41,453
Thinking you wouldn't find out
about the refund ?

899
00:37:41,517 --> 00:37:42,583
No, your first mistake

900
00:37:42,732 --> 00:37:43,905
was killing Ling Fan.

901
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,921
And your second mistake was

902
00:37:44,985 --> 00:37:46,627
keeping the poison
that you used

903
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:47,927
in your refrigerator.

904
00:37:48,204 --> 00:37:50,484
Third mistake was thinking
that, once we had you,

905
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:53,895
that the grandson
at the mortuary, Nelson Han,

906
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,691
that he wouldn't
cooperate.

907
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,842
I mean, not only
did he follow...

908
00:37:58,312 --> 00:38:01,616
You know, Booth, uh...
is a really good guy.

909
00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:03,364
He says the same about you.

910
00:38:03,726 --> 00:38:04,728
Really ?

911
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:07,329
'Cause I figured
he was the one talking you out

912
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:08,629
of going with me.

913
00:38:09,972 --> 00:38:11,187
No, he told me to go.

914
00:38:11,677 --> 00:38:12,977
Angela did, too.

915
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:16,432
Everyone thinks
it's a great idea.

916
00:38:17,766 --> 00:38:19,109
Everyone except you ?

917
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,864
But you're not gonna go,
are you ?

918
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,901
Why, Brennan ?

919
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,832
Sailing around
warm oceans

920
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,260
with someone who loves you.

921
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,882
Please,

922
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,886
tell me
what is holding you here.

923
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,511
Look, I don't...

924
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:53,218
I don't wanna sound conceited...

925
00:38:54,923 --> 00:38:55,839
but, uh...

926
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,604
I think
I'm worth the risk.

927
00:38:59,478 --> 00:39:00,544
You are.

928
00:39:03,229 --> 00:39:04,402
You definitely are.

929
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,161
All right, well,
you're the logical one.

930
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:11,676
What's your thinking ?

931
00:39:14,713 --> 00:39:15,790
Rationally...

932
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:22,190
...rationally thinking, I...

933
00:39:24,598 --> 00:39:25,898
I want to go.

934
00:39:26,894 --> 00:39:29,237
And I know I should go,
but...

935
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,954
...I can't.

936
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:45,545
What you're doing...

937
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:48,593
it's important...

938
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,260
... but it's not important enough
to be your whole life.

939
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,026
What are you doing here ?

940
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,748
I'm waving goodbye...
see ?

941
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,372
What do you want ?

942
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:26,013
Breakfast.

943
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:27,441
I'm not hungry.

944
00:42:27,633 --> 00:42:29,388
Aw, come on, huh ?

945
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:30,561
What are you gonna vomit

946
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:33,076
when we come across one of
those, uh, horrific cases ?

947
00:42:33,182 --> 00:42:34,205
I don't vomit.

948
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,550
Give it time,
Bones, okay ?

949
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:37,701
Give it time.

950
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,696
Everything happens
eventually.

951
00:42:41,124 --> 00:42:41,891
Everything ?

952
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:45,877
All the stuff you
think never happens,

953
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:47,838
it happens.

954
00:42:48,946 --> 00:42:50,396
You just gotta
be ready for it.
