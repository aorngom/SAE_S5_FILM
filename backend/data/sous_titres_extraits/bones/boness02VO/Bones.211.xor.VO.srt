1
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,300
Mr Addy, your dissertation is entitled 
"Analysis of Bone Trauma".

2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When viewed in cross section, the pressing force 
exerted by the weapon can be assessed.

3
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,200
Obtaining the cross section will compromise 
the original bone.

4
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,200
My technique preserves bone surface morphology 
through the use of polyvinyl replication.

5
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,300
A transparent positive is made by covering the impression 
with an aqueous solution of synthetic polymer.

6
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,500
Hey, Bones, come on. 
Got a body.

7
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,500
One lit up like a roman candle.

8
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,800
Hey, Zack, how's it going?

9
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,300
So far they don't like me.

10
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,400
Shocker.
Come on, let's go.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,700
What? I'm in the middle of something.

12
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,700
Well, you know, real life murder and mutilation 
vs academic clap trap -- no contest.

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,900
Sorry. 
No offense.

14
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,900
This committee can carry on without you, Dr Brennan.

15
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,900
Zack, just answer the questions.
- Yeah.

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,000
Next question?

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How do you expect anyone to take you seriously 
as a working forensic anthropologist

18
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,100
when you look the way you do?

19
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,400
What?

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,300
Male, middle-aged.

21
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,600
What was it with Zack back there?

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,900
Defending his dissertation, last step before 
he gets his doctorate.

23
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,000
I think these are what's left of his intestines.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,200
Is he gonna make it?

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,700
No, he's very dead.

26
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,300
I mean, Zack.

27
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,600
Uh, fifty-fifty.

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,900
He's a stoolie.
- What, Zack?

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,200
Our victim. 
He's a rat. Snitch.

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,000
What makes you say that?

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,100
He's got his guts spilled. 
You know, "spill your guts"?

32
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,200
Very literal.

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,600
Yeah, hang up there like a scarecrow on a 
rooftop of the hotel that used to house the witnesses.

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,200
It's a warning.

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,300
There's something jammed down his trachea.

36
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,100
I rectified their erroneous assumptions 
concerning polyvinyl replication.

37
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,700
You corrected them?

38
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,400
Only when they were wrong.

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,600
Are the remains ready for X-ray?

40
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,800
Yes.

41
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,400
Maybe we'll get lucky and 
ID the poor bastard that way.

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Oh, we just got lucky.

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,400
"My name is Garrett Delaney".

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
There's something metallic here.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is gonna turn out to be some freaky weird 
ritualistic thing, isn't it?

46
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,500
Oh man, I hope so.

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,900
Christopher Columbus.

48
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,000
Where is Dr Brennan?

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Her brother came for a visit.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Dad called you?

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,900
Are you sure it was him?

52
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,800
He said, "you and your sister are in danger", 
and he hung up.

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I spend half my time with a sniper-trained FBI agent. 
I feel safe.

54
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,500
Tempe, I know someone is watching me.

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,300
What's your evidence?

56
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,700
I can feel it on the back of my neck.

57
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,700
You spend some time in jail, you develop a sixth sense.

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,500
Maybe you should stay with me for a few days.

59
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,100
Tempe, I have work, I have Amy and the girls, I...

60
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,800
What about your sixth sense?

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,900
Hey.
- What?

62
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,900
You can't not believe in something one second 
and then use it against me in the next.

63
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,700
It's a long drive. 
You could start fresh tomorrow.

64
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,500
And I've got cold beer in the fridge.

65
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,100
Don't drink the Moroccan beer, it tastes of earwax. 
How are you doing, Russ?

66
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,100
OK, Booth. You? Good?
- Yeah.
- Good.

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
I still make him nervous, don't I?

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,200
Come on, let's go.
- Wha--

69
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,800
Why do I always feel like you're abducting me?

70
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,600
It turns out our corpse is a former FBI agent,

71
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Garrett Delaney, 
who left the FBI about 10 years ago.

72
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
He's now head of security of some 
big K Street lobbyist.

73
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,800
So why did he end up a human torch?

74
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,000
That's what we're here to find out.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,800
His place is much better than yours. 
Ten times better.

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,700
I told you, he left public service.

77
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,700
He makes more money than I.

78
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,800
So that's all your dad said, huh? 
That you're in danger.

79
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,400
Yes. 
And Russ's sixth sense agrees.

80
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,900
What are you doing?

81
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,200
I've been practicing some of 
the black op stuff you told me.

82
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,400
All right, I'll show you.

83
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,600
Every FBI agent in the country is looking for my father. 
Maybe he's trying to scare us off.

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Six months without a break in the case, 
he ain't gonna be nervous now.

85
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,900
My dad's a crook.

86
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,700
I mean, just because he says Russ is in danger 
doesn't mean it's the truth.

87
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,700
I'll show you that stuff, OK?

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I've gotten it right this time.

89
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,300
Russ!

90
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,300
These are all pictures of Russ!

91
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,900
Me at work. 
Me and Amy.

92
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,300
This is the day before yesterday.

93
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,500
Dad was right. 
Somebody's watching me.

94
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,700
This is worse than watching.
- What do you mean?

95
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,800
This is hunting.
- Hunting?

96
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,700
As in, kill.

97
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,600
You see these right here? 
These are ranges.

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,800
He's picking a spot from which to shoot you.

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,900
So what do I do now?

100
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,700
The hunter's dead. 
The hunt is over, right?

101
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,000
Anyone else know you're here?

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,900
Only Amy.
- Great.

103
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,900
Call Amy and tell her, if anyone calls looking for you, 
she doesn't know where you're at.

104
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,300
You should stay with me and find out 
why Delaney intended to kill you.

105
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,400
How are you gonna do that?

106
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,400
By figuring out who killed him.

107
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,500
This is the paper 
that was pulled from Delaney's throat.

108
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,500
It was dated, signed and initialled 
at the bottom of both sides of the page.

109
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,800
February 1978.

110
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,900
Looks like a cop's notebook.

111
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,800
That makes sense, except...

112
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,800
"I will not put an innocent man in prison 
just because he is a political threat.

113
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,900
"Marvin Beckett hasn't broken any law."

114
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,900
Whoa, whoa. 
Marvin Beckett?

115
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,500
Back in the 60s, Marvin Beckett was 
a civil rights activist.

116
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,500
He made his bones protesting African-American 
overrepresentation in the Viet Nam war.

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
In '78, he was sent to prison for life.

118
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,100
Why?

119
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,400
He killed an FBI agent named Gus Harper.

120
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,100
Wait, Augustus Harper?
- Yeah.

121
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,800
You know the case?

122
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,800
"August Harp", look. 
Augustus Harper.

123
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,500
Oh, wow.

124
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,500
This means Delaney's murder had something to do 
with Marvin Beckett going to prison.

125
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,300
When you're good, you're very very good.

126
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,300
1970s, Ohio, there was a task force 
made up of FBI, state police and local cops.

127
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,000
Goes bad. 
Starts taking the cut from the same bankrobbers 
they're supposed to be catching.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Then, they conspired a plan 
to stack stolen money on Marvin Beckett.

129
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,800
Then this young agent, right, Harper?

130
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,500
He decides he can't live with that 
and starts to blow the whistle.

131
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,100
I can read.

132
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,700
The same guy who is gonna 
blow the whistle on them for framing Marvin Beckett

133
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
then gets murdered by Marvin Beckett?

134
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,300
Come on. 
Talk about killing two birds at one stone.

135
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,700
Who else knows about this?

136
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,800
Us and you. 
That's it.

137
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,400
Let's keep it that way.

138
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,400
I have seen this movie. 
I get killed on the way home.

139
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
Then don't go home.

140
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,100
Are you serious?

141
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,100
30 years ago, I was married to Gus Harper 
for exactly 8 months.

142
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,600
I'm not sure I can help you.

143
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,000
What about the contents of the note?

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,500
What do you people want?

145
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,900
The truth.

146
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,900
The last time the FBI came to talk with me, 
they told me to keep my mouth shut.

147
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,900
"Or you won't get your husband's death benefits."

148
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,200
Your husband was a good man.

149
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,800
And he tried to do the right thing, 
and he ended up dead.

150
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
I can't let that stand.

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,900
The FBI murdered Gus.

152
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,600
Then they had a state funeral for him,

153
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,600
complete with the grieving widow as a centerpiece.

154
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,100
Is this your husband's handwriting?

155
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,900
Yes. 
He was compiling evidence.

156
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
And there is more?

157
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,800
There's a diary, a dozen audiotapes, field notes...

158
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,300
Where did Gus keep it?

159
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,100
Safety deposit box.

160
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,100
Can you tell us where that safety deposit box was?

161
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,100
Ohio First Savings & Loan in Dayton.

162
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,300
Excuse me.

163
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,900
My parents robbed that exact bank 
just days after Gus Harper was killed.

164
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,000
They were looking for that evidence.

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,800
That has to be why Delaney was stalking Russ.

166
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,700
Go home.

167
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,900
I have a few more questions for Barbara Harper, OK?

168
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,400
Go home and be with your brother, all right?

169
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,400
OK.

170
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,900
You think it's Delaney?

171
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,300
Definitely.

172
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,200
I hope to keep working here 
when I received my doctorate.

173
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,500
We'd all like that.

174
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,500
What did she mean when she was saying, 
"How do you expect anyone to take you seriously"?

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's a comment on -- your deportment.

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,400
Dr Brennan doesn't care about deportment.

177
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,400
True, but if you work here, 
you won't be Brennan's grad student anymore.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,800
You'll be a full-blown forensic anthropologist.

179
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,600
Cam will be your boss.

180
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,500
In your opinion, 
does deportment matter to Cam?

181
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Let's just say that Cam's 
not just the kind of woman you catch with

182
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
crusties in the corner of her eye.

183
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Hebe's six, and Em is eight.

184
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,800
Tempe!

185
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,500
I'm sorry. 
Preoccupied.

186
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,900
Tempe, if I play my cards right,

187
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,300
these little girls are gonna be your nieces 
in the next couple of months.

188
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,300
The least you can do is 
memorize their names.

189
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
They're cute.

190
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,900
Hebe has lung trouble. 
They're trying to figure it out.

191
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,000
Do you have a deal with an HMO?

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,300
If it's money, Russ, I can help.

193
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,900
No, forget it.

194
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,900
If I'm gonna become these little girls' Daddy, 
I'm gonna man up for the job.

195
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,700
That's not rational.

196
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm a good mechanic. 
I'll take care of my own.

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
Gus Harper's service history.

198
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,000
Graduated top out of his class in Quantico.

199
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He was assigned the 
Joint State-Federal Bank Robbery Task Force.

200
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,500
The victim.

201
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,800
Back when he was Special Agent Delaney 
superivising Gus Harper.

202
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,900
The guy that was hunting me?

203
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,000
That's right.

204
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Here's a list of the bank robberies 
with the FBI codenames.

205
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,900
Dad's codename was Columbus.

206
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,900
Yeah. 
Lewis, Clark, Magellan, Cook, Columbus.

207
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,000
All named after explorers.

208
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,100
That's Mom and Dad.

209
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,400
Everyone of these people are deceased.

210
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,500
Except for Dad.

211
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,000
Delaney was killed to send a message to the FBI.

212
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This Columbus coin was found in the victim's mouth.

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Columbus shot a man in the head, 
hung him from a pole, gutted him and set him on fire.

214
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,800
And Columbus...

215
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,800
is our father.

216
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,400
Dad had it under control.

217
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,600
For 15 years, everything was fine until...

218
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,900
Until what?

219
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,800
Dad left you a message, 
he said "Stop looking", you didn't.

220
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,900
So this is my fault?

221
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,400
"Consequences aren't the same as fault."

222
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,800
My parole officer is very philosophical.

223
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,600
Well, all we have is 
a voice tape of Dad saying "Back off"

224
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,600
and a little silver dolphin 
I found at Mom's grave.

225
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,300
That's as far as the investigation has gone.

226
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,200
According to Booth.

227
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,000
What? Booth and I are partners.

228
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,900
Tempe, he's FBI, you aren't.

229
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,900
You're the daughter of a career criminal 
and the sister of a loser on parole.

230
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,600
What?

231
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
I wouldn't let anyone else call you a loser, Russ. 
What makes you think you're allowed?

232
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,800
I love you too.

233
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,400
What you're asking is the kind of thing 
that destroys careers.

234
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,000
From the time I was a little girl 
I dreamt of putting bad men in jail.

235
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,100
Put that back.

236
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,000
Which is why I became 
an Assistant US Attorney.

237
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,100
OK, look, you don't have to help me.

238
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,500
Of course I have to help you.

239
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,600
Marvin Beckett is still a hero 
to a lot of African Americans.

240
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,100
Some of us never believed 
he killed this FBI boy.

241
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,400
Now you buy me breakfast, 
tell me you found a way to clear his name,

242
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,400
release him out of wrongful incarceration 
after 30 years --

243
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
I cannot walk away!

244
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,700
Don't you already know?

245
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,900
Maybe you should have some more coffee.

246
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,800
Of course I want more coffee! 
We have to come up with our plan of attack.

247
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,000
OK, I was thinking Judge Moran...

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,200
You should exhume Gus Harper.

249
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,400
See if your genius scientist partner 
can ascertain

250
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,400
whether he died in the manner 
the FBI said he died 30 years ago.

251
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,100
Moran *****

252
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,500
No, we want Kemper.

253
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,300
"Hang him right" Kemper?

254
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,300
Hey, I'm ruining my career, 
I'm doing it my way, understand?

255
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,100
Now.

256
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Take a donut home. 
I'm offering.

257
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,600
Thanks.

258
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,400
This was lodged 
in Garrett Delaney's sinous cavity.

259
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
.22 caliber.

260
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,000
These dimples...

261
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
indicate that the bullet 
ricocheted around inside the cranium.

262
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,300
Are you worried about your doctorate?

263
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,300
No, Dr Greyson touched me 
with an open hand on the shoulder.

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,400
You mean inappropriately?

265
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,500
No. I read a book on body language.

266
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Apparently in our culture,

267
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,400
when an older male lays an open hand 
on a younger male,

268
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,800
he conveys approval.

269
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,700
But if he bumps the younger male 
with a closed fist,

270
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,300
he conveys doubt.

271
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,500
Dr Greyson went like this.

272
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,900
Not like this.

273
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,500
Like this.

274
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Not like this.

275
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,200
Dr Greyson is elderly and arthritic.

276
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Perhaps he simply needed help 
getting to his feet, like this.

277
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,300
Dr Brennan?

278
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Visitors in your office.

279
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,000
Tempe, this is a friend of Dad's.

280
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,500
Father Coulter. 
It's Toby Coulter.

281
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,100
Train trussel guy.

282
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,400
Oh, yeah.

283
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,400
I remember that story when Dad and his friend 
accidentally blew up a train trussel.

284
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,300
Come on, how do you accidentally 
blow up a train trussel?

285
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,300
Well, we were hired by a farmer 
to dynamite the ice off a stock pond.

286
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,000
And we would get this competition going:

287
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,400
who's gonna slide the dynamite 
farther across the ice before it blows?

288
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,300
You know, it's a federal offense 
to blow up a train trussel, Father.

289
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,200
Even if it is "accidental".

290
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Father Toby Coulter, 
meet my partner Seeley Booth.

291
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,400
Careful, he's FBI.

292
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,100
Ooh.

293
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Well, I'm innocent. 
It was Max's toss that brought the trussel down.

294
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,900
Max Keenan's best friend 
grows up to be a priest.

295
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,200
I'm sure you people have that fact 
on file somewhere.

296
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,900
Tempe, Father Coulter has a message from Dad.

297
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,000
It's a private message.

298
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Come into my office.

299
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,700
She's just gonna tell Agent Booth anyway. 
You might as well let him listen.

300
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,600
"Back off." That's the message.

301
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,400
He said you'd understand?

302
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,600
Where'd you see him?

303
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,900
In confession.

304
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,400
We're not Catholic.

305
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,400
The sanctity of the confession 
was extended to all.

306
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,300
Did he ever call you 
on your cellphone, Father?

307
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,100
Two days ago.

308
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,400
Can I see your phone?

309
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,800
You want to trace the call?

310
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,700
Yeah.

311
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,400
So, Max Keenan, 
did he come to you for absolution?

312
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,600
I'm sure you know 
the requirements for confession.

313
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,200
Contrition and intent not to repeat the sin.

314
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,900
And Max doesn't have either.

315
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,300
And as a priest, I failed him.

316
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,500
I never was able to get him to 
walk the straight and narrow.

317
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Is there anything else you can tell us?

318
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,200
Well, he was angry, 
felt his hand had been forced.

319
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,900
Where can we reach you, Father?

320
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,700
Father Coulter is staying 
at St Augustine's Seminary for the next few days

321
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,200
before heading back to Ohio.

322
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,700
Father.

323
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,100
Your father loves you.

324
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,400
Is that part of Dad's message?

325
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,400
That's a personal observation.

326
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,900
Delaney's murder, the threats on Russ's life, 
this is all happening now

327
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,800
because of the little metal dolphin 
we found in your mother's grave.

328
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,800
FBI field unit in Denver traced it 
to a local artist in Mead, Colorado.

329
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,200
Who identified Dad as the buyer.

330
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,800
But Delaney left the FBI 15 years ago.

331
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,200
Then somebody told him about your dad.

332
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,300
And didn't tell you?

333
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,500
They're part of the conspiracy.

334
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
You must be annoyed.

335
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,800
Yeah, you know what? I am.

336
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,800
I don't like finding out 
there's a dirty FBI agent in this building.

337
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,700
Here's what I think happened:

338
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,000
Delaney goes to your father.

339
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He asks him to hand over the evidence.

340
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,900
If he doesn't do it, he kills you or Russ.

341
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,000
Dad calls Russ to warn him...

342
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,600
and then kills Delaney.

343
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,900
Guts him, burns him, leaves a calling card.

344
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
"Don't mess with Max Keenan's kids."

345
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,700
Am I supposed to like that?

346
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Uh, Bones, I'd take a stand-up crook 
over a crooked cop any day of the week.

347
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,400
Booth, I got us to meet with the judge. 
Let's go.

348
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,400
And you better get back to your lab, 
in case we're successful.

349
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:19,027
You'll have to find 
it's best to do what she says.

350
00:18:19,062 --> 00:18:20,124
OK.

351
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:22,176
You want to exhume the young FBI agent

352
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:25,300
that Marvin Beckett murdered?
- That's correct, Your Honor.

353
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:29,344
That is a big noisy mess in the making.

354
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:32,933
The FBI has credible evidence

355
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:35,328
that the homicide case against Marvin Beckett 
was manufactured.

356
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:37,689
Assistant US Attorney Dan Burridge

357
00:18:37,724 --> 00:18:39,477
arguing against this writ, Judge Kemper.

358
00:18:39,512 --> 00:18:41,992
On behalf of...?
- The FBI.

359
00:18:42,027 --> 00:18:45,021
I thought <i>you</i> were FBI.
- I am, Your Honor.

360
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:48,260
I told you: a big noisy mess.

361
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,822
All right, 
let's hear your argument, Mr Burridge.

362
00:18:50,857 --> 00:18:54,000
This is a precipitated exhumation 
in a highly inflammatory case.

363
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:55,670
The evidence to which Ms Julian alludes

364
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:58,065
has not been authenticated.
- It's been authenticated

365
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,338
by the Jeffersonian Institution.
- The FBI would like to do their own

366
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,643
in-house analysis before proceeding.
- Of course they would.

367
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,049
They're the ones who did the framing 30 years ago.
- I take exception of that.

368
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,765
Why? You weren't even born 30 years ago.
- Judge!

369
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,760
Not like me and Judge Kemper 
who got to see first hand

370
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:14,444
what Marvin Beckett was really like.

371
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:17,017
Ms Julian, did you bring this to me

372
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:20,083
because I knew Marvin Beckett personally?

373
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,049
Did you?

374
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:23,105
I wasn't aware of that, Your Honor.

375
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,126
Were you aware of that, Agent Booth?

376
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:29,507
We'd like to do this slowly and carefully, 
Judge, that's all.

377
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,221
And we want to exhume Gus Harper

378
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:34,020
so we can make sure 
he was murdered

379
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:38,481
in exactly the way that damn FBI 
said he was murdered... Your Honor.

380
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:41,370
As mandated by the writ of exhumation

381
00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:43,304
by Judge Theodore Kemper

382
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:45,692
of the DC Federal Judicial District,

383
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,451
I, Dr Camille Saroyan

384
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,260
will be performing an autopsy

385
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:53,000
of Special Agent Augustus Donald Harper 
under the auspices

386
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:55,604
of the Jeffersonian Institution. 
Date of death:

387
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:58,696
June 25th, 1978.

388
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:02,378
Date of interment: July 2nd, 1978.

389
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:03,700
Date of exhumation:

390
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:04,952
That would be today.

391
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:07,431
Also present 
at the post-exhumation autopsy

392
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:09,005
is Dr Temperance Brennan.

393
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,298
The original autopsy in 1978

394
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,376
found that Agent Harper was killed

395
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:16,338
when he was shot three times at close range

396
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:19,231
by a .38 Colt Detective Special revolver.

397
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,654
Two shots to the chest, 
one piercing the heart,

398
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,428
the other the left lung.

399
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:27,870
The third, 
a shot to the frontal bone...

400
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,786
What?

401
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:35,237
That bullet hole in the head, 
that's from a .38.

402
00:20:35,272 --> 00:20:36,578
Just like the coroner said.

403
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:39,522
I can already tell these two holes 
were from something

404
00:20:39,557 --> 00:20:41,922
a whole lot bigger than 
a snub-nosed revolver.

405
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:45,097
Something more like a rifle 
that a sniper would use.

406
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:47,114
Zack, you better get a full set of X-rays

407
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:49,207
before Dr Saroyan reopens.

408
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:53,126
We're gonna conduct this one 
like the whole world is watching.

409
00:20:58,367 --> 00:20:59,630
Russ.

410
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,784
OK, I'm here. 
What's up?

411
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:05,291
You know, you're an idiot, Russ.

412
00:21:05,326 --> 00:21:07,564
I like you, but you're a real idiot.

413
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,360
What did I do?
- I had a call from your parole officer today.

414
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,561
Why?

415
00:21:12,596 --> 00:21:15,721
Why, because you crossed state lines 
without informing him.

416
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:18,846
I just told him you were aiding 
in an FBI investigation.

417
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,281
Thanks.

418
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:23,892
You're slipping, aren't you?

419
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:26,497
Look, I wanna marry Amy and raise her kids.

420
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:28,996
One of them is sick. 
That costs money.

421
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:31,047
I'm a felon on parole.

422
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,650
I work part time as a mechanic.

423
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:34,184
You tell me, what job am I gonna get

424
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:36,679
that lets me be 
the man I need to be to raise a family?

425
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:39,156
You got this sick little girl depending on you.

426
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:40,724
I get that.

427
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,704
But if you go back inside and you cross that line, 
you're not helping anybody.

428
00:21:47,244 --> 00:21:49,456
Everybody down!

429
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:01,624
Civil rights activist and convicted murderer

430
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:04,998
Marvin Beckett was released today 
when a second autopsy

431
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,926
on his alleged victim, 
FBI Agent Gus Harper,

432
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:13,338
revealed inconsistencies 
with details of Mr Beckett's trial back in 1979.

433
00:22:13,351 --> 00:22:15,119
What kind of inconsistencies?

434
00:22:15,154 --> 00:22:17,553
All right. 
You have your confidencies to keep, Father --

435
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,844
I have mine.
- Well, it's over, right?

436
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:23,597
I mean, now that it's out, 
there's no reason to kill Russ.

437
00:22:23,632 --> 00:22:26,086
The men behind this 
don't care about Marvin Beckett.

438
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:28,071
They care about being exposed.

439
00:22:28,106 --> 00:22:30,918
Lucky you were together. 
Why were you together?

440
00:22:31,094 --> 00:22:33,338
You know, man's gotta eat.

441
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:38,736
To think that some people 
still refuse to believe in guardian angels.

442
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:40,177
Booth!

443
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:45,267
Who's that?
- Deputy Director Kirby.

444
00:22:45,302 --> 00:22:47,423
My boss's boss's boss.

445
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:54,528
You're what's known as a real pain in the ass, 
Agent Booth.

446
00:22:54,563 --> 00:22:55,826
Yes, Sir.

447
00:22:56,686 --> 00:23:02,128
I've just had my testicles handed to me 
by the Attorney General of the USA.

448
00:23:03,117 --> 00:23:05,914
He wanted to know why this Marvin Beckett issue

449
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:07,564
wasn't done slowly

450
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,606
and carefully, with greater forethought and tact.

451
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:10,710
You know what I told him?
- No, Sir.

452
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:13,072
I told him I did not know.

453
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:15,514
Sir, I had to do it the way I did it 
'cause the FBI is...

454
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:18,073
Not your decision, Booth.

455
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:22,555
You're suspended without pay.

456
00:23:23,617 --> 00:23:25,608
Gun, ID, security card, please.

457
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:28,132
Sir, I'm entitled to 
the reading of the charges against me.

458
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:30,795
The charges against you

459
00:23:31,446 --> 00:23:34,971
are that I was pissed upon 
from a very great height!

460
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:38,343
You're outta here in 10 minutes.

461
00:23:41,977 --> 00:23:45,122
Can they do that? 
Just kick you out without any warning?

462
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:47,238
Two guys standing behind me with guns

463
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:49,240
seemed to think so.
- As you can see,

464
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:51,741
Harper's ribs and sternum 
were practically obliterated

465
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:53,609
by the two shots to his torso.

466
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:57,439
Zack, Booth got fired.
- Suspended, not fired.

467
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,374
"Suspended"'s FBI speak for fired.

468
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:02,476
And you know what hurts the most? 
They took the car. I got no wheels!

469
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:05,544
The bullets themselves were removed from the body, 
of course.

470
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,722
But Hodgins found some very small fragments.

471
00:24:07,757 --> 00:24:09,611
Copper, lead, polymer.

472
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:11,430
This is a conspiracy, baby.

473
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:14,016
Guys, what we're dealing with here 
is that Booth

474
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:15,476
won't be working with us anymore.

475
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:20,283
Well, I got my own gun, it's just... 
God, why did they have to take the company car?

476
00:24:20,318 --> 00:24:22,664
I estimate, the only way 
for Booth to get his car back

477
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:25,010
would be to solve the case on his own, 
and that we'd help.

478
00:24:25,045 --> 00:24:25,952
Oh no.

479
00:24:25,987 --> 00:24:27,476
No, I can let you guys do that.

480
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:31,558
Anyone who wants to help Booth, 
raise their hands.

481
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:40,252
I reverse-engineered to find 
the most likely design of the bullets.

482
00:24:40,335 --> 00:24:44,315
After the bullet's spread, 
lead pellets were released, like buckshot.

483
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,347
Wait a second. 
That's a homemade round

484
00:24:46,382 --> 00:24:47,795
invented back in the 70s.

485
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,819
We're talking a military-issue 
M40A1 sniper rifle.

486
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:51,421
Nice.

487
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,901
Dude, what you call being a conspiracy theorist, 
I call being well informed.

488
00:24:55,989 --> 00:24:58,988
Gus Harper was murdered by a military sniper?

489
00:24:59,023 --> 00:25:00,335
Who makes his own rounds.

490
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,213
Maybe we could compare it 
to the bullet that grazed Russ.

491
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:06,133
I'm a civilian. 
We don't have access to that round.

492
00:25:06,168 --> 00:25:08,071
Maybe Caroline can help us.

493
00:25:10,972 --> 00:25:13,072
You still have the job?
- Not for long.

494
00:25:13,107 --> 00:25:14,840
I'm on Performance Review.

495
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,430
Look, none of the FBI members 
of the Bankrobbery Task Force

496
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:18,857
had sniper training in the 70s.

497
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,446
I need to know who else was on that task force,

498
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:23,322
local, state cops, ...
- Booth! I got it figured out!

499
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:25,140
... ATF, and if anyone of them 
had sniper training.

500
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:26,889
Once you found out, 
you keep your head down.

501
00:25:26,924 --> 00:25:31,029
Task force, sniper training, 70s, duck. 
Got it.

502
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:33,496
I figured out a way 
to solve the case and get your job back.

503
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,007
Wow! That would be great.

504
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:37,002
We need my father to give us 
the rest of the evidence

505
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,739
he saved from the safety deposit box.

506
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:40,322
Great.
- I'll drive.

507
00:25:40,697 --> 00:25:45,842
Dr Saroyan, when I get my doctorate, 
I'd like to work here.

508
00:25:47,557 --> 00:25:51,676
Zack, you're an excellent scientist, 
but an important part of the job

509
00:25:51,773 --> 00:25:54,158
is appearing as an expert witness in court.

510
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:56,508
Ooh.
- Ooh what?

511
00:25:56,543 --> 00:25:58,838
Jurors have to take you seriously, 
and frankly,

512
00:25:58,873 --> 00:26:03,618
you look like a weekend fill-in 
at a college radio station.

513
00:26:05,727 --> 00:26:08,751
Truth hurts, dude. 
Learn from it and grow.

514
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,498
But you weren't able to find Max 
by tracing him from the cellphone call he made to me?

515
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:18,894
The call came over the Internet, 
it was untraceable.

516
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:22,183
Max always did things his way.

517
00:26:22,218 --> 00:26:24,876
Guess you being a priest 
didn't have much effect on him.

518
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:29,408
Son, I spent my whole life 
trying to turn Max's life to Jesus.

519
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:32,096
He knows exactly one Bible verse:

520
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:34,744
Numbers 35:19.

521
00:26:36,192 --> 00:26:39,186
"The revenger of blood himself 
shall slay the murderer:

522
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:42,304
when he meeteth him, 
he shall slay him."

523
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:45,346
What does that mean?
- That's the law of the jungle.

524
00:26:46,364 --> 00:26:49,696
Father Coulter, if my father 
makes contact with you again,

525
00:26:49,731 --> 00:26:51,862
please tell him he needs to trust me.

526
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:54,785
He's the one who got my mother murdered 
and almost got Russ killed.

527
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,466
It's time I tried it my way.

528
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:59,612
He won't contact me again.
- How do you know?

529
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,441
Ask him. 
He put me under surveillance.

530
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:09,190
If a parish priest can figure out 
the FBI is watching him,

531
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:12,589
then so can an experienced fugitive 
like your father.

532
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:29,288
I need a makeover.

533
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:33,662
Zack, I am a big believer in 
people being themselves.

534
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:35,532
You're actually kinda cute.

535
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:37,790
Yes, I've been told that many times.

536
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,979
Usually followed by the word <i>but</i>.

537
00:27:40,014 --> 00:27:44,735
In this case, 
"<i>but</i> no one takes you seriously".

538
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,910
I need help, Angela.

539
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,913
So what do I do first?

540
00:28:04,592 --> 00:28:07,241
Lose the floppy hair.

541
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:11,434
Why are you mad at me?
- I need a gun.

542
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:12,794
No, you don't. 
You got me.

543
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:14,174
I'm your gun. 
You want equipment? Here.

544
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:16,244
Have these, all right?

545
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,673
New division of labor: 
I shoot 'em, you cuff 'em.

546
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:21,021
Why didn't you tell me 
they had Father Coulter under surveillance?

547
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:23,587
It is my job to find your dad 
and put him in prison.

548
00:28:23,622 --> 00:28:26,152
And you don't think I'll help?
- He's your father!

549
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:28,683
I really don't think 
I should have to ask you to help.

550
00:28:28,718 --> 00:28:30,416
He abandoned me, Booth.

551
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:32,127
And that's the best thing you can say about him.

552
00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:33,623
Your father lives by a certain code.

553
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:37,171
And part of that code is 
defending his family by whatever means necessary.

554
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:40,193
You mean killing people 
and setting their corpses on fire?

555
00:28:40,228 --> 00:28:42,221
"Any means necessary" sort of covers that.

556
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:45,209
You respect him?
- I'm just saying, in his world he's a very honorable man.

557
00:28:45,244 --> 00:28:46,310
That's ridiculous.

558
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:48,129
There's only one world. 
It's this one.

559
00:28:48,164 --> 00:28:49,804
Would that be the one world 
where you're mad at me

560
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,362
for trying to catch your father, 
or the other world

561
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:52,885
where you actually want him caught?
- Neither.

562
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,286
You have to pick one.

563
00:28:54,321 --> 00:28:56,310
Either. Both.
- Dr Brennan.

564
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,890
Agent Booth.

565
00:28:57,925 --> 00:29:00,010
I thought you'd like to meet the reason

566
00:29:00,045 --> 00:29:02,922
we're all losing our jobs and getting shot at.

567
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:05,568
This is Mr Marvin Beckett.

568
00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:07,409
I wanted to thank you personally.

569
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:08,980
You're welcome, Mr Beckett.

570
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:11,297
30 years ago, crooked agents put me in jail

571
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,456
for something I did not do.

572
00:29:13,491 --> 00:29:15,904
I did not kill the young FBI agent.

573
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,871
I did not steal the money.

574
00:29:17,906 --> 00:29:20,294
And I thank you for proving it to the world.

575
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:23,199
That's why I'm here, to tell you to your face

576
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:28,559
to assure you I did not do those things. 
You freed an innocent man.

577
00:29:28,806 --> 00:29:32,161
And in return, I must warn you:

578
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:36,290
The people that did this to me 
aren't just a bunch of corrupt cops.

579
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:39,504
They serve masters of much greater influence.

580
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:42,844
You're looking to bring their world down 
around their ears.

581
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:47,005
They will strike at you. 
Watch yourselves.

582
00:29:49,858 --> 00:29:53,003
Here's your list of snipers from the decade of disco.

583
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,580
This time I'm advising you: Duck!

584
00:29:58,336 --> 00:29:59,874
Anyone you know?

585
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:05,908
Yeah. The ATF on the task force 
was a Marine sniper, Robert Kirby.

586
00:30:05,946 --> 00:30:08,844
FBI Deputy Director Robert Kirby,

587
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:11,339
that just suspended you?

588
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:13,573
Call your brother Tom to get out of the house.

589
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:16,688
Tell him to get out, now!
- Why, what's going on?

590
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,850
Seconds after Caroline got this list, 
Kirby knew about it.

591
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:21,102
He's not answering.

592
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:22,516
I don't understand, Booth.

593
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:25,645
It's not us that Kirby is afraid of, 
it's your father.

594
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,838
The only way to strike at him is 
to go through you or Russ.

595
00:30:28,873 --> 00:30:31,698
Kirby was the one that took a shot at Russ.

596
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:33,369
No answer.

597
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:35,222
Russ!
- Hello?

598
00:30:35,257 --> 00:30:36,349
Stay back.

599
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:38,269
Russ?
- There's no sign of a break-in.

600
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,155
I'll check the back. 
Russ!
- Russ!

601
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:45,807
Oh my god.

602
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:48,015
Booth?
- What?

603
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,485
Russ.
- Take it easy, all right?

604
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,447
We don't know that for sure.
- That's too much blood.

605
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:59,439
Nobody could survive that much blood loss.

606
00:30:59,474 --> 00:31:00,686
Nobody.

607
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,909
All right. 
OK.

608
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:05,399
It's all right.
- Oh my god.

609
00:31:13,056 --> 00:31:16,237
It's against the law, us not calling in a murder.

610
00:31:16,272 --> 00:31:19,386
It wasn't a murder, it was a blood stain.

611
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:22,500
That much blood, it's... 
it's murder.

612
00:31:22,535 --> 00:31:26,472
If we call it in, the next thing is, 
we find ourselves under arrest.

613
00:31:28,073 --> 00:31:31,480
That had to be Russ's blood.
- You got a sample, right?

614
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,850
Check the DNA at the lab.

615
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:35,644
Until then, 
you know who's the one who always says,

616
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,227
"don't jump to conclusions".

617
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:39,953
Yeah, you're right.

618
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,571
Thanks.

619
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:47,295
I wish I wouldn't keep 
letting you hug me when I get scared.

620
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,949
Hey, I get scared and... 
I'll hug you.

621
00:31:51,013 --> 00:31:52,991
Call it even.

622
00:31:57,113 --> 00:31:59,196
Results?
- Blood's not Russ's.

623
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:02,079
Even you can't do a DNA test that fast.
- Didn't have to.

624
00:32:02,114 --> 00:32:05,234
Both Brennan and her brother are O-type blood, 
as was their mother.

625
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,727
The blood sample you brought me was AB.

626
00:32:07,762 --> 00:32:10,139
Therefore...
- OK, let's go tell Bones.

627
00:32:10,174 --> 00:32:12,510
I just saw her. 
She's on her way to see the priest.

628
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:14,298
Why?
- He said he had something for her.

629
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,054
No, she can't go places without me, 
now when it's open season

630
00:32:17,089 --> 00:32:18,273
on Brennans.

631
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:20,550
Bones?

632
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:22,693
Not even close, chéri. 
We need to talk.

633
00:32:22,728 --> 00:32:25,213
Well, first I want to tell you 

that your brother

634
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:28,500
is... 
with his father.

635
00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:30,495
You mean...

636
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,681
with god?

637
00:32:32,716 --> 00:32:34,781
No, his earthly father.

638
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,261
Your father.

639
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:40,223
Are you certain?
- Saw it with my own eyes.

640
00:32:40,446 --> 00:32:42,234
Oh, thank god.

641
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:45,623
Which I used only as a figure of speech.

642
00:32:45,656 --> 00:32:49,830
Well, it has to start somewhere.

643
00:32:51,063 --> 00:32:53,621
You know, you're very much like him.

644
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:57,843
I'm nothing like my father.
- Black and white, the two of you.

645
00:32:57,878 --> 00:32:59,747
You always saw the world in black and white.

646
00:32:59,782 --> 00:33:01,405
Your mother wasn't like that.

647
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:03,502
Either is Russell.

648
00:33:10,377 --> 00:33:12,163
All right, go.

649
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,023
I was cleaning up my desk

650
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:17,092
when my phone rings, 
and it's this FBI agent named Carlsen.

651
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:18,626
Yeah, it's our surveillance...
- And he tells me,

652
00:33:18,661 --> 00:33:21,154
"You and Booth are wasting your time 
with this damn priest."

653
00:33:21,189 --> 00:33:23,460
I tell him, 
"You better mind your mushy mouth."

654
00:33:23,495 --> 00:33:25,627
Caroline, I gotta find Bones, 
keep her from getting killed.

655
00:33:25,662 --> 00:33:27,978
Father Coulter is 90 years old,

656
00:33:28,013 --> 00:33:30,260
confined to bed, with Alzheimer's

657
00:33:30,295 --> 00:33:32,538
in a convalescent home 
out there at the seminary,

658
00:33:32,573 --> 00:33:35,139
which does not much sound like 
the priest you told me about.

659
00:33:35,174 --> 00:33:38,241
Your father, he talked about

660
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:42,629
when you were four and your brother was nine,

661
00:33:42,664 --> 00:33:44,424
and he hid behind his door,

662
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:45,648
and he jumped out at you...

663
00:33:45,683 --> 00:33:48,424
You know what? Just give me the keys to your car.

664
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,841
My car?
- "Boo!", and how he was, "boo!"

665
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,189
And you had this doll,

666
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:55,299
had this string in the back for talking...

667
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:56,797
Chatty Cathy.

668
00:33:57,427 --> 00:33:59,644
Wham! You took that doll,

669
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,680
and you wound up and hit your brother so hard

670
00:34:01,715 --> 00:34:03,277
you knocked him flat as a dead pig.

671
00:34:03,312 --> 00:34:04,804
I said to your mother,

672
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,006
"No one will ever jump out at that girl again."

673
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:09,835
And your mother said,

674
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:13,908
"Just like you, Max.
She's just like you."

675
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:19,027
Hair color,

676
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:22,227
plastic surgery,

677
00:34:23,258 --> 00:34:24,292
colored contact lenses,

678
00:34:24,393 --> 00:34:26,093
chin and cheek implants...

679
00:34:26,127 --> 00:34:28,761
15 years older...

680
00:34:32,008 --> 00:34:33,319
Still...

681
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,797
You should have seen it.

682
00:34:43,923 --> 00:34:46,486
Come on, Bones, pick up. 
Pick up!

683
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:49,049
This is Dr Temperance Brennan. Leave your message.
- Damn it!

684
00:34:49,812 --> 00:34:52,445
Russ knew it was you all along?

685
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,985
Yup.

686
00:35:01,272 --> 00:35:03,995
You talked to Russ, but not to me?

687
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:06,193
You know, to tell you the truth:

688
00:35:06,228 --> 00:35:07,834
You do better without me,

689
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:09,707
and Russ does worse.

690
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:10,822
Take this.

691
00:35:10,857 --> 00:35:12,675
I'm not religious.

692
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,294
No, we're gonna play this your way.

693
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:16,976
Please.

694
00:35:21,395 --> 00:35:23,012
This is Gus Harper's journal.

695
00:35:23,047 --> 00:35:26,484
There's a key there. 
It's to a safety deposit box.

696
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:29,907
In that safety deposit box is all the evidence.

697
00:35:29,942 --> 00:35:33,261
Why didn't you give it to them back in 1978?

698
00:35:33,296 --> 00:35:35,398
Because your mother took one look at it and said,

699
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,500
"If you turn this over to them, they will kill us.

700
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,675
"And our kids."

701
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,259
They got Mom anyway.

702
00:35:42,294 --> 00:35:43,753
There's not a day that goes by

703
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:46,817
that my heart is not broken.

704
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,789
Dad! Come on!

705
00:35:55,402 --> 00:35:57,725
I gotta go.

706
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,533
Wait. 
I can't let you go.

707
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,908
I love you too.

708
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:11,166
No, I mean, I can't let you go.

709
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:13,884
I'm sorry.

710
00:36:14,471 --> 00:36:16,066
I must be getting old.

711
00:36:16,101 --> 00:36:18,436
I let you get the drop on me.

712
00:36:18,471 --> 00:36:19,666
I'm sorry.

713
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:22,115
I just can't let you get away.

714
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:25,943
I'm sorry.

715
00:36:26,343 --> 00:36:27,371
Listen to me.

716
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:29,918
If you find somebody that you can trust,

717
00:36:29,953 --> 00:36:32,191
you hang on to them. 
Remember that.

718
00:36:32,229 --> 00:36:35,568
Dad, let's go!
- I'm proud of you. 
I love you.

719
00:36:40,706 --> 00:36:42,443
Get in.

720
00:36:48,866 --> 00:36:51,120
You take care of her.

721
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:54,200
FBI. 
Stop, or I'll shoot.

722
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:55,944
Booth!

723
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:59,760
Booth!

724
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:34,655
Did you really have to hit the car? 
I wasn't gonna chase them.

725
00:37:47,955 --> 00:37:50,062
You OK?

726
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,137
What's this?
- Zack's doctorate.

727
00:39:17,172 --> 00:39:18,870
I'd like to recommend him for a job.

728
00:39:18,905 --> 00:39:20,989
I can't put him in front of a jury, I'm sorry.

729
00:39:21,024 --> 00:39:22,822
I'll put in a good word in Pure Research,

730
00:39:22,857 --> 00:39:25,963
that way he can come visit once in a while.
- Visit?

731
00:39:25,998 --> 00:39:27,127
Dr Saroyan,

732
00:39:27,162 --> 00:39:28,939
Dr Brennan, Dr Hodgins,

733
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,264
I'd like to present your colleague,

734
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:37,066
Dr Zachary Uriah Addy.

735
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:41,788
Look at you.

736
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:43,106
All grown up.

737
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,511
Wow. 
Very impressive.

738
00:39:46,546 --> 00:39:49,311
I can learn how to be effective in front of juries.

739
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:51,065
Zack can learn anything.

740
00:39:59,888 --> 00:40:02,234
All right. 
He's hired.

741
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,523
Who am I to break up this team?

742
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:07,228
Lunch is on me, Dr Addy. 
Anywhere you wanna go.

743
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:08,017
The diner.

744
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:09,339
Anywhere, I said.

745
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:10,592
I like the diner.

746
00:40:10,627 --> 00:40:12,244
Do me a favor, "Uriah".

747
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:13,827
I need a little time

748
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:16,320
to adjust to your fascist haircut.

749
00:40:18,955 --> 00:40:20,368
Let's go.

750
00:40:26,197 --> 00:40:29,279
Congratulations, Dr Addy.

751
00:40:31,452 --> 00:40:33,710
Thank you, Dr Brennan.

752
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:50,577
What happened?

753
00:40:50,612 --> 00:40:52,720
The Attorney General took one look

754
00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:54,948
at the evidence your father provided,

755
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:56,965
and you know, he reinstated me.

756
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:00,932
I'm glad.

757
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:04,988
Listen, we... 
found another burned body.

758
00:41:05,023 --> 00:41:07,140
Same place, same setup.

759
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,067
Kirby?
- I'm pretty sure.

760
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:13,053
It was Kirby's blood in your apartment.

761
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:15,005
Dad's still trying to warn people

762
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,308
to leave me and Russ alone.

763
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:18,845
Russ, he's safe with your father.

764
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,372
They're warning people to stay away from you.

765
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,233
You know what, I'm sorry

766
00:41:24,268 --> 00:41:25,826
that you had to go through it again.

767
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:27,694
Watching your family drive off,

768
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:29,685
they leaving you behind.

769
00:41:30,584 --> 00:41:31,810
I'm sorry.

770
00:41:31,845 --> 00:41:33,166
My father is...

771
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:34,350
He's your dad.

772
00:41:35,164 --> 00:41:36,374
And he loves you.

773
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:45,421
You know, I'm just...

774
00:41:47,857 --> 00:41:51,773
I'm just one of those people 
who doesn't get to be in a family, that's...

775
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:53,410
Listen, Bones, hey.

776
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,664
There's more than one type of family.

777
00:42:06,402 --> 00:42:08,547
Hell, Zack got the job, right?

778
00:42:08,582 --> 00:42:09,809
Come in and congratulate him.

779
00:42:09,844 --> 00:42:11,037
Nah, he's your squint.

780
00:42:11,072 --> 00:42:12,205
Not my squint.

781
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,728
No, Booth, we are all of us your squints.

782
00:42:15,823 --> 00:42:19,359
Do me a favor and pat Zack on the shoulder

783
00:42:19,394 --> 00:42:20,336
with an open hand.

784
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,139
What? Why? Does that mean something?
