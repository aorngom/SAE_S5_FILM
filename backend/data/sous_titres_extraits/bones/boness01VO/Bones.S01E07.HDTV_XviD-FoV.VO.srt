1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,850
Name?

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,877
- You know my name.
- Bones, you are making an official request

3
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:11,400
to the FBI to be allowed
to carry a concealed weapon.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,600
I have to follow protocol.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,600
It's ridiculous.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,300
Fine. Then we're done here.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,600
You want to get some coffee...?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
My name is Dr. Temperance Brennan.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,400
- Reason for wanting a gun?
- To shoot people.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,900
- Not a good response.
- It's the truth.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,402
You know,I'm writing,

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,883
Self-defense in the performance of my duties

13
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:31,967
pursuing suspected felons

14
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:35,887
as contracted out to the FBI.

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,300
So I can shoot them.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,400
Have you ever been charged with a felony?

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,300
- Charged Or convicted?
- Charged.

18
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,000
- You know I have.
- I have to ask the questions.

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,500
- Bureaucratic nonsense.
- Nevertheless...

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,700
- Name of the arresting officer?
- You

21
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,800
Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Do you need me to spell that for you?

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,900
I can sound that out.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So, when do I get the gun?

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,200
You can't have a gun.

25
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,100
- Why not?
- Because you were charged with a felony.

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,900
Write down that you were wrong to charge me.

27
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,700
There's no space for that.

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,500
Why'd we go through all this
if you were never going to give me a gun?

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,800
You have a constitutional right
to apply for a weapon.

30
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,440
I would never deny
your constitutional right.

31
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,000
I need a gun!

32
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,400
Rules are rules.

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,800
Tell them that I shot a murderer
who was going to light me on fire.

34
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,800
Which is why you weren't convicted.

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,100
But you did shoot an unarmed man.
I can't ignore that.

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,271
I swore an oath to protect society
from people who shoot people.

37
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:38,100
It was only his leg and he's in jail
for the rest of his life.

38
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,400
How much is he going to use it, anyway?

39
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,800
You have the right to an appeal.

40
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,766
To whom?

41
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,683
Cullen?

42
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,200
I'm pretty sure he doesn't like me.

43
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,300
I'm pretty sure you're right.

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,800
Bones, you don't need a gun.

45
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,100
If anyone needs shooting, I'll do it.

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,900
What if you're injured or dead
and someone still needs shooting?

47
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,600
I'm not hoping it will happen.
I'm just stating a possibility.

48
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,600
You know what, Bones?

49
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,500
You're a professor.

50
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,943
You're not an FBI agent.

51
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,101
Use your mutant powers
just talk people to death.

52
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,500
Am I interrupting?

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,100
I told them not to let you in this building.
I gave them your picture.

54
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,000
Which is why I wore the tiny skirt.

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,900
Very cute.

56
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,800
- Amy Morton.
- Temperance Brennan.

57
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,800
- You work with Booth?
- Yes, I'm a forensic anthropologist.

58
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,300
I'm a defense lawyer.
I tend to work against Booth.

59
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,400
If it's all the same,
I'd prefer you two didn't bond in any way.

60
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,935
Hey,I want to get back to the lab.

61
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:35,201
You said I had to fill out
some gun application form.

62
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:35,700
Send it back by courier.

63
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,971
- No hurry.
- Nice to meet you.

64
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,600
- What do you want, Amy?
- You remember Howard Epps?

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,300
Not likely to forget him.

66
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,300
He's scheduled to
be executed tomorrow night.

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,300
My job is to keep that from happening.

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,874
Best of luck.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,383
Howard Epps deserves
five minutes of consideration

70
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:57,101
from the man who put him on death row.

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,300
I arrested Howard Epps.
It was the jury who sentenced him to die.

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,951
They found a pubic hair
on the victim at the crime scene.

73
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:04,368
It didn't belong to my client.

74
00:03:04,398 --> 00:03:05,800
They never figured out whose it was.

75
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,000
Blame the judge who disallowed it as evidence
and the judge who disallowed it on appeal.

76
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Epps was not well-represented
at either trial.

77
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,700
How long you been on the case?

78
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,300
Almost a week.

79
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,400
Less than a week,huh?

80
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,250
Two judges, two juries, two prosecutors

81
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,456
that find Epps guilty,
but yet it's me you come after.

82
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm asking...

83
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,900
are you absolutely positive
Howard Epps killed that girl?

84
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,500
Yeah. I'm absolutely positive.

85
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,348
You know in your heart the judges
should have allowed the juries

86
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:36,029
to hear that that victim
was with another man that night.

87
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,800
- You know it.
- Epps still would have been convicted.

88
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,300
Not if I'd been his lawyer.

89
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,200
- You weren't.
- I am now.

90
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,100
When was the last time
you looked him in the face?

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,100
Because you're a lot smarter
than you were seven years ago.

92
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,700
A lot less angry.

93
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,700
You might want to
check out the evidence again.

94
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,000
I'd ask how you were doing, Howard
but I guess we both know the answer.

95
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Agent Booth..
did you come to apologize?

96
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm not the one
who beat a 17-year-old girl to death.

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,800
Your attorney wants me
to look you in the face.

98
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,400
Why?

99
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,700
She thinks you're innocent.

100
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,900
Well, she's right about that.

101
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,900
I didn't kill anybody... unlike you.

102
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,400
The girl who got murdered was smart
she was pretty, she was from a good family...

103
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,100
someone has to die for that.

104
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,800
And I'm all they got.

105
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,900
Okay.

106
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,600
- I looked you in the face.
- I read it can be hell.

107
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,200
They say it's like going to sleep
but you're on fire...

108
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,700
and you're paralyzed,

109
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,600
so you can't scream...

110
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
I mean, that's all you got sometime, you know?

111
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,700
The scream.

112
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,000
What if they get mixed up?

113
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,500
I can tell them apart.
That's Jeff and that's Ollie.

114
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,800
I win.

115
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,600
What do you...?! What?!
That one was mine.

116
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,400
You had Jeff, I had Ollie.
Ollie won. You owe me a buck.

117
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,800
You want in on the action, Angela?

118
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,200
No,thank you.
I'm going to go have sex.

119
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,400
- Have a good time.
- Yeah, okay.

120
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,900
You sure you don't want to come?

121
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,000
Troy can call a friend.

122
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,100
I've been waiting months for these.

123
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
It's a partial skeleton
from southern France.

124
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,400
- The institute...
- the whole point of the week is the weekend.

125
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,300
This is not the cabaret, my friend.

126
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,600
Life is the cabaret.

127
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,800
Come to the cabaret.

128
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,900
It's like describing the moon to a mole.

129
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,700
I demand another beetle, all right?
Jeff's got a groin pull.

130
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,700
Arthropods do not possess groins.
Pay up.

131
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Mmm. Angela, you're looking good.

132
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,000
And don't I know it.

133
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,700
Okay, our tax dollars hard at work.

134
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,900
Oh,yeah? What's break time at the FBI?
Book burning? No! Oh, god!

135
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,200
Hey,Bones,what are you doing this weekend?

136
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,600
I have plans.

137
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,500
- No, come on. I'm serious.
- With your new girlfriend, the corporate lawyer

138
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,600
and the defense lawyer on the side,
your weekend must be completely booked.

139
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,900
What is your thing with lawyers?

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,971
Look, seven years ago,
a 17-year-old girl, April Wright

141
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,900
was found beaten to death in a federal park.

142
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,165
Amy's just trying to stop the guy
who did it from being executed.

143
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,960
So I guess we're not pursuing
your lawyer obsession?

144
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,512
No, Amy doesn't think he did it.

145
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,103
And what does this have to do with you?

146
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:04,107
Oh, well, you know, Amy's client is deep sixed
and she doesn't turn over every stone...

147
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,100
and you're one of her stones.

148
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,600
- Do you think he did it?
- Yes.

149
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:10,900
What's her reasoning?

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,100
There was a pubic hair
that wasn't accounted for.

151
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,800
Pubic hair?
Sounds like a job for the FBI crime lab.

152
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,100
It's a weekend deal. Off the books.
But if you have plans...

153
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,500
Wait.

154
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,200
This is a personal favor you're asking.

155
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,100
Not for me, for Amy.

156
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,500
Well, your personal favor will be for Amy,
but mine would be for you, strictly speaking.

157
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,500
Please do me a favor.

158
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,000
- Any remains withheld from burial?
- Not after the last appeal.

159
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,900
I'd need x-rays from the M.E.
And the coroner-originals.

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,500
The copies are useless.
Bone scrapings, lab results, tox screens...

161
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,100
- All the evidence will be here within an hour.
- I'll ask the others, but I won't order them.

162
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
They might have plans.

163
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,700
It's Friday night
and they're racing beetles.

164
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,700
How much time do we have?

165
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,800
Howard Epps will be executed
in 30 hours and 23 minutes.

166
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's start.
Zack, pull up the first x-ray.

167
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,300
Stress fractures on both tibias.

168
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,200
- What's that mean?
- Preexisting the assault.

169
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,400
Probably an old injury
from dance or running.

170
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,300
She was a cheerleader.

171
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,400
The Chinese used to execute people by
cutting small pieces of flesh off their bodies.

172
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
Called it the death of a thousand cuts.

173
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,700
Compound fractures of the trapezium
scaphoid and the base of the radius.

174
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,400
What's that mean?

175
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,266
When she was being beaten to death
with a blunt instrument

176
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:19,267
she threw her arm up to defend herself.

177
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,900
Well, that's consistent with the
defensive wounds in the autopsy report.

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,400
In medieval Scotland, they tie a
convict's arms and legs to two bent saplings.

179
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,071
When they release the saplings,
the trees sprang apart,

180
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:31,200
and the convicted felon was torn in half.

181
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,500
Should I grab particulates from this?

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,200
That's clean.
It's a phone number we found on the girl.

183
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,700
Belonged to an old woman in a nursing
home with no connection to anyone involved.

184
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,140
Extensive damage to the skull.

185
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:46,733
Smashed six to eight times
with a narrow,cylindrical object.

186
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:48,900
The tire iron-
it was missing from April Wright's car.

187
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:49,000
Autopsy showed she'd had sex
shortly before her death.

188
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:52,028
Consensual.

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,500
No assault.

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,700
The hair they found
was never matched to anyone?

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,200
No, the prosecution got it excluded
from evidence both in trial and on appeal.

192
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,200
That's the basis of your lawyer's
last-ditch attempt to stop the execution?

193
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,400
Yeah, and, uh, whatever else you guys can find.

194
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,800
There are particles lodged
between the left triquetral and the capitate.

195
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,200
The M.E. concluded that they were
bone fragments dislodged by the tire iron.

196
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,600
No,these radiographic shadows
are too opaque for bone.

197
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,200
What's that mean?

198
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,100
The prosecution's theory of the crime
does not include foreign matter in the bone.

199
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,500
Let's see if these shadows are
bone fragments or something else.

200
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,100
Like what?

201
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Let's pretend we're objective
scientists and not indulge in conjecture.

202
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,700
Zack,get a driver to
take you over to Greenbelt Park.

203
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,600
I want you to take pictures of
the area where the body was found-

204
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
ground covering, paved areas.

205
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
- Why does he need a driver?
- I can't drive.

206
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,100
You're a genius who can't drive.

207
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,500
If you knew what I knew about
structural design, you wouldn't drive either.

208
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,900
Take the file.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,943
Get photos of the surrounding area.

210
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,202
So that we can contextualize
the materials we found.

211
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,500
Yeah.

212
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,700
Yes, I'll be right there.

213
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That was April Wright's father.

214
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,900
- Our murder victim's dad called you?
- His wife is a wreck.

215
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,700
They heard that Amy's
angling for a last-minute reprieve.

216
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,700
Why did he call you?

217
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,100
Because Booth was the agent that
arrested Howard Epps in the first place.

218
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,226
I'm pretty sure that
that evidence is not in the file

219
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:20,491
earlier you said it's
a phone number we found on the girl.

220
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,500
We're trying to save someone
you arrested for murder?

221
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,500
All right, you know, I think he did it.

222
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,600
I think this scumbag bashed
April right to death with a tire iron.

223
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,100
We found some anomalies
in the prosecution's case.

224
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,000
Do you want us to stop now
before these anomalies become meaningful?

225
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,000
No, stay on it.
I got to get going.

226
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,000
It's Friday night.

227
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,800
There's nothing pathetic about
pro bono work on a death penalty case.

228
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,100
Everybody, this is Troy.

229
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,000
Hey, how you doing?

230
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,300
Could you just wait here one second?

231
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:44,800
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

232
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Why did you call me in?

233
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,800
Look at this guy.

234
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,100
He's cuter than a monkey with a puppy.

235
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,100
I really,really need you to do
texture analysis on seven-year-old x-rays.

236
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,400
But I am on a date with Troy.

237
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,900
He's a man.

238
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,500
Wave.

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,600
- What's the big steaming gigantic rush?
- A man is scheduled to die in 26 hours.

240
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,300
I think he'd like the results
of our findings before then.

241
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:20,800
Good one.

242
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,900
Troy, sweetie,
I've got a few things to do around here.

243
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,500
Do you mind just
hanging out for a little while?

244
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,300
Uh, sure. No problem.

245
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,900
Let me just call the restaurant
tell them we'll be late.

246
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,400
What do you think, half an hour?

247
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
- Hmm, you better make it an hour...

248
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,900
- Minimum.
- Okay.

249
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,800
Hodgins.

250
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,600
Most recondite codes
have a complex numerical cipher.

251
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,200
That's a fun factoid, Zack.
Thank you.

252
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,100
One, two, four, zero, two,
five, one, zero, two, two, one.

253
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,700
That's the number they found on the victim.

254
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
You're the one with the photographic memory.

255
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,500
- I'm the one that's good with the ladies.
- It's not a phone number.

256
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,000
Hey.

257
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,500
So, uh, what exactly do they do here?

258
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,000
I thought Angela was an artist.

259
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,900
She is.

260
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,600
Do mostly forensic identification
and reconstruction of discorporated remains.

261
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,400
My specialty's entomology and particulates.

262
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Ever see maggots?

263
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,900
Just got these in.

264
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,100
Do not talk to him.

265
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,600
Wait in the lounge, baby.

266
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,500
It's up those stairs, right over there.

267
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,100
- Don't talk to anybody.
- Okay.

268
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,600
What'd you find?

269
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,200
A shard of bone.

270
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
How'd they miss that?

271
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,800
They're not as good as we are.

272
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,600
40-times magnification.

273
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,400
That's not bone.

274
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,500
It's an organic mineral... possibly quartz.

275
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,256
I was out taking the pictures you needed

276
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:18,890
and there was a sign and numbers on the ground,

277
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,800
and I thought"why assume a quasi-randomly
generated function-oriented paradigm?"

278
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,000
Zack, when you talk that fast,
human beings can't hear you.

279
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,700
The number they foundon the girl
1-240-251-0221,

280
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,600
everyone assumed
it was a phone number but what if,

281
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,100
instead of spacing numbers
like a phone number,

282
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,600
you space them like this?

283
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,000
I was in the park taking picture
and I saw the parking space was numbered.

284
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,100
To get to picnic area ten,
you go through gate 25.

285
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,000
Seems more than a coincidence.

286
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,600
1-2-4-0,what do those represent?

287
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,800
The time, 12:40. It was when she
was going to meet whoever she was meeting.

288
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,000
It fits with the timeline.

289
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,500
He's weird, but he's smart.

290
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,400
- April Wright was setting up a date.
- Probably with the guy who left a pubic hair on her.

291
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,700
Good job, Zack.

292
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:12,800
I got something.

293
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,600
It's not quite so idiot savant, but...

294
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,500
it's aggregate gravel.

295
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,000
What,what if the rest of the
shadows on the x-rays were also gravel?

296
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,600
There was no gravel where her
body was found. It was all grass.

297
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,200
Then she was killed someplace else.

298
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,500
We have to exhume our victim's body.

299
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,800
It's very stressful
waiting for this all to be over,

300
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,000
and now we hear Epps's lawyers
are trying for a reprieve.

301
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,700
I've heard.

302
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,820
He got himself a young lawyer
from the innocence project.

303
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:55,444
They don't consider the family of the victims.

304
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,900
You remember our lawyer, David Ross.

305
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,100
Agent Booth is the investigator
who caught Epps.

306
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,500
Is this ever going to be over?

307
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,600
- I understand how difficult this is, Mrs. Wright.
- Epps killed my daughter.

308
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,600
- You believe that, don't you, Agent Booth?
- Yes, ma'am.

309
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,000
I haven't changed my mind.

310
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,700
- He deserves to die for what he did.
- The jury thought so, the judge thought so.

311
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,500
- All these appeals...
- It's part of the process, that's all.

312
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,900
Each effort to stop his execution
is more and more desperate.

313
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,300
This one's not going to work either.

314
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,400
It's the third time they've launched an appeal.
It's going to be the third time they fail.

315
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,500
It's the last picture we have of April.

316
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,100
She wanted to be a lawyer.

317
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,900
David was her role model.
He gave her a job at his firm on the weekends.

318
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,400
She was a good worker.

319
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
She was a beautiful girl.

320
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,900
Excuse me.

321
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,300
Booth.

322
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,700
It's me. I'm with Amy.

323
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't like the sound of that.

324
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,300
We're going to see the judge.
I'm going to try to get an exhumation order.

325
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,200
What? Why?

326
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,700
We found evidence April may not
have been killed where they found her body.

327
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,900
You want details?

328
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,100
Um, it's not a good time.

329
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,300
We need to look at April's remains.
Zack decoded the phone number.

330
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,600
- Who decodes phone numbers?
- It's not a phone number.

331
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,357
- April met someone in Greenbelt
Park the night she was murdered.

332
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:07,321
So she met someone in the park.
What does that prove?

333
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
- Is this about April?
- Um,let me get right back to you.

334
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,700
What's happening now?

335
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,400
Apparently, some new evidence has surfaced.

336
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,600
What kind of evidence?

337
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,700
Why don't you give me
a few minutes with Agent Booth?

338
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,300
- Let me evaluate these new developments.
- Let's get some coffee.

339
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,900
So,this new evidence-
is this something they can bear to hear?

340
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,100
Well,it concerns the person April had
sexual relations with the night she was murdered.

341
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,700
- The judge ruled that irrelevant.
- Well, it's always hung there as a question.

342
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,300
It's always the basis of the appeal.

343
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,700
If we just I.D. The guy,
this whole issue would just disappear.

344
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,300
It was sex in a car.

345
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,900
It was probably another teenager.
Some kid too scared to come forward.

346
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,100
Nobody said anything about
sex being in the car.

347
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,065
It was a parking lot.
I assume the sex act took place inside a car.

348
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,600
When April worked for your law firm
on the weekends, what'd she do, the filing?

349
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,500
That's right.

350
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
Who was with her in the office?

351
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,000
Why do you ask?

352
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, 17-year-old girl-

353
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,100
I'm sure you just wouldn't
leave her in there all by herself.

354
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,800
Oh, what, you can't remember?

355
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,500
I'm sure the security logs
will be able to tell us something.

356
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,900
Refresh my memory, Mr. Ross.

357
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,600
Where were you the night that
April was killed, say, around 12:30?

358
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,400
Now's the time that I ask
for my lawyer and say nothing.

359
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,300
- So,you seeing each other?
- Who?

360
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,500
You and Booth.

361
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,100
No. No, we're, we're working together.

362
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,900
'Cause I'm picking up a bit of sex vibe.

363
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,100
No, that's tension.

364
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,100
He has a girlfriend.

365
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,800
Tall, blonde,beautiful.

366
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,500
A lawyer.

367
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,300
Figures.

368
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,200
Should have jumped him
when I had the chance.

369
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,300
- You really interested in Booth?

370
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,000
- You aren't?
- No.

371
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,200
Then why are you helping him?

372
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,400
Because he asked me.

373
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,500
He said please.

374
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,400
Come on! You think he's hot.

375
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,600
No, not at all.

376
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,500
This is a very interesting case.

377
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,600
- Booth did say you had some kind of mania for the truth.
- Mania? As in maniac?

378
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,500
I'm notsure he meant it as a bad thing.

379
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
Which, obviously, is how you're take it.

380
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,700
You want to start, or shall I?

381
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,200
I'm sorry, sir, I... I... I'll start.

382
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,600
I'm thinking of, uh,

383
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,300
suspending you for freelancing on a death
penalty case we cleared seven years ago.

384
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,400
My intention was just to
tie up a few loose ends...

385
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,200
- Do you, disapprove of the death penalty on principle?
- No, sir, I have no problem with the death penalty.

386
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,300
Because I hear that you're working for
a particularly attractive, young idealist¡­¡­

387
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,300
Not true, sir.

388
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,600
I mean, yes,she's young, she's an idealist,
but I'm not working for her, no.

389
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,100
Like I said, there was a loose end

390
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,013
and I arrested Howard Epps.

391
00:21:15,014 --> 00:21:17,263
I provided the evidence
which led to the death sentence.

392
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,000
- That's your job.
- I need to be sure, that's all.

393
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,610
This guy was her godfather.

394
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:25,395
I believe he had sex with a 17-year-old girl
the same night she was murdered.

395
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,500
A fact that the jury never heard,by the way.
He's married, he's partners in a law firm.

396
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,100
The guy's got everything to lose.

397
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,500
If you want to question him, fine.

398
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,800
Is that the end of
your involvement, Agent Booth?

399
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,400
Not exactly.

400
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,100
They're moving to
exhume the victim's body, sir.

401
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,700
On whose recommendation?

402
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,200
The young idealist lawyer...
and Dr. Brown.

403
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,100
Got the squints involved.

404
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,100
Well, if she shoots anybody this time,
I sure the hell hope it's you.

405
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,800
- These are not the robes I'd like to wear to work, Ms. Morton.
- Sir, if you could maybe tie your dressing gown?

406
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,500
It's 1:00 in the morning.
Deal with it.

407
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,275
So,you found
a piece of be the size of a toothpick.

408
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:25,056
Yes, it's a shard from her left triquetral
with gravel embedded in it.

409
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,500
Describe the implications.

410
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,200
The jury was told that these shadows here and
here were bits of bone shattered in the attack.

411
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,880
Through advanced digital x-ray
techniques Dr. Brennan's team of scientists

412
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:42,304
have foundthat the density of these fragments
is not the same as the surrounding bone.

413
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,000
What are they?

414
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,800
The only way I can tell
is by actually looking at them.

415
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,300
- You want to exhume April Wright?
- Yes, please.

416
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,600
- Because of some shadows on an x-ray?
- I don't see another alternative.

417
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:55,500
But, Dr. Brennan...

418
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,500
if those shadows turn out to be pieces of bone,
I'd be extremely angry.

419
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,500
Thank you, judge Cohen.

420
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,700
For making a veiled threat?

421
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,500
I thought you were threatening me
because you decided to sign the exhumation order.

422
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,900
I did not kill April Wright.

423
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,600
There are good people out there.

424
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,600
And people who believe me.

425
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,400
People who know I did not kill that girl,
'cause they saw all the evidence.

426
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,300
I honestly think he's innocent.

427
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,600
Don't you?

428
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,455
I don't like to form any
conclusions before all the evidence is in.

429
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,834
They won't let me die just for stealing a car.

430
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,400
April Wright's body just arrived.

431
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,400
This is Jacqueline Singer reporting
to you live from cumberland state prison.

432
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,200
You might be more comfortable staying here.

433
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,500
- I... I can't.
- Aw, God.

434
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,900
Don't look, sweetie.

435
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,800
You're not an artist.
You're a freak.

436
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,300
You people are all freaks.

437
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,900
This job is so hard to describe online.

438
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,200
The left... triquetral.

439
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,200
That's a match.
For the record, do you concur?

440
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,300
I concur.

441
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,100
Got several pieces of
foreign material lodged in the bone.

442
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,600
That's the same stuff we found in the shard.

443
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,700
Which is consistent with the arm being
dragged through gravel after the attack.

444
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:47,675
I got a warrant to search the house
of the guy April Wright

445
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,579
had sex with the night she was murdered.

446
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,700
- What'd you find?
- Underwear.

447
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,700
Can you run a comparison on the hair?

448
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,500
That April Wright?

449
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,500
Looks like she wasn't killed
where she was found.

450
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
Then where was she murdered?

451
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,300
We've got microscopic particles beaten into the skull.
Were these ever I.D.'D?

452
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,900
According to the autopsy report- no.

453
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,800
It's a visual match.

454
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,800
Will you back-stop him on that?

455
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,400
Where's Amy?

456
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,400
- Here. I can't...
- that's okay. Things can get pretty...

457
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,200
you know, disgusting around here.

458
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,900
I concur with Zack.
We have a visual match on the pubic hair.

459
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,600
Is a visual match enough to stop the execution?

460
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,900
We need DNA to be sure.

461
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,300
Amy's right.
This evidence isn't enough to stop the execution.

462
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,100
And you've got nothing else?
Nothing at all?

463
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,400
I don't know what else we can do.

464
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,400
If you tell the judge
you've changed your mind...

465
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,100
that Howard Epps is not guilty...

466
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,900
- Have you changed your mind?
- No.

467
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,600
I have doubts that the guy
should be executed, but...

468
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,900
Let's go see the judge.

469
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,800
At my age, a man needs a good night's sleep.

470
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,100
Lack of sleep clouds judgment.

471
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,400
You stay the execution, judge,
I promise you'll sleep like a baby.

472
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,500
- Mr. Carlyle, what does the prosecution think?
- This is a waste of the state's time, your honor.

473
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,800
Ms. Morton is recycling old evidence,
presenting it in a different way,

474
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,000
in a last-ditch attempt to
keep Howard Epps from being executed.

475
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,100
- She's an ideologue.
- That's true.

476
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,600
But it doesn't mean I'm not right.

477
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,700
But this case doesn't add up.

478
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,300
You, brilliant scientist lady,
talk to me about this bone shard.

479
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,900
It indicates the body was dragged to
the location where it was later discovered.

480
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,900
- That plus the gravel...
- common gravel.

481
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,800
I'm not convinced.

482
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,000
What about the hair?

483
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,000
It's a visual match.
That narrows the statistical probability to...

484
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,300
- DNA?
- Ten days.

485
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,700
We'll have it in ten days.

486
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,500
What about this man that
the FBI's taken into custody-David Ross?

487
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,565
Has he confessed to sleeping with her?

488
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,800
- No.
- Even if the DNA say David Ross slept with the girl,

489
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,900
it doesn't prove he killed her.

490
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,900
Let's stick with new facts, Ms. Morton.

491
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,300
Your honor, at least give us time to find David Ross's car.
There could be evidence of murder... could be?

492
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,384
I can't stop an execution
because there could be an evidence.

493
00:27:26,385 --> 00:27:30,301
Judge Cohen, I have the arresting officer right here.

494
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,000
The primary investigator.

495
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,000
Agent Booth,have you suddenly
decided that Howard Epps is not guilty?

496
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,700
- No.
- Booth!

497
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,658
I think there are doubts.

498
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,624
When it comes to an execution,
there shouldn't be any doubts.

499
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:46,300
He doesn't have doubts.
He has cold feet.

500
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,900
You think I won't pop you one
just because we're standing in the judge's kitchen?

501
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,400
You see? You lose sleep, you get cranky.

502
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,600
- Judgment suffers. It's not enough.
- Your honor, you can't dismiss this so easily.

503
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,600
Easily?

504
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,800
I allowed you to exhume that girl's remains.

505
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,600
You think I did that easily?

506
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,000
We all feel the weight of a capital case, Ms. Morton, but the law is clear.

507
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,500
Unless there is proof of grievous incompetence by counsel or
an denial of legitimate and definitive factual certainties,

508
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,300
my hands are tied.

509
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,100
- I'll go out the prison and tell Epps.
- I'll take another look at the skull, see if we didn't miss something.

510
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,600
- Bones...
- The particulates in the skull haven't been analyzed yet.

511
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,800
This is so barbaric.

512
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,000
- When are they going to put a stop to the damn death penalty?
- I believe in the death penalty.

513
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,800
What?!

514
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,400
There are certain people that shouldn't be in this world.

515
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,800
The people who hacked hundreds of innocent children to death in Rwanda.

516
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,100
Be headed them at their desks at school.

517
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,600
The people who did that-they should be executed.

518
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,400
So why do you care about Epps?

519
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Because the facts have to add up.

520
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,100
Drop me at the lab, please.

521
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,800
Last meal.

522
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,700
I can't decide.

523
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,500
What's the last taste that I want?

524
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,300
Howard, I am so sorry.

525
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,000
Dr. Brennan is still working on a few ideas.

526
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,600
You see the truth.

527
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,700
- You know I'm innocent,right?
- Well, there's a chance you're not guilty.

528
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,600
That's good enough for me.

529
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,100
A chance, I said. A chance.

530
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,000
- These are slivers of metal found on the skull.
- Probably from the tire iron.

531
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,700
- Is that blood?
- It's silt.

532
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,700
I'm breaking it down.
It contains traces of two chemicals.

533
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,400
Anthracene and Fluoranthene.

534
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,300
I scanned in all the x-rays and built a 3-d module.

535
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,900
Troy would have liked that.

536
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,100
Bastard.

537
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,200
I found some more material.
In the fractures along the sagittal suture.

538
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,500
It's a pollen.

539
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,400
The pollens from Spartin Alterniflora.
More commonly known as smooth cord grass.

540
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,800
I'm sorry, what does pollen tell us about April Wright's murder?

541
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,200
Angela.

542
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,800
The murder weapon collected pollen from the surrounding flora.

543
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,300
When she was struck,pollen from the murder weapon was deposited in April's skull.

544
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,600
Spartina Alterniflora is only found along Chesapeake bay.

545
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,500
The pollen and silt both show traces of complex chemicals.

546
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,500
- What does that mean?
- April Wright was killed in a marsh near a chemical plant.

547
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,800
Amy Morton.

548
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,800
Thanks.

549
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,400
They've moved Howard Epps to the imminent room.

550
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,500
What's that?

551
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,300
It's where he has his last meal and says good-bye to his family.

552
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,100
We need the location of that marsh.

553
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,100
Look, the hair we found proves that you had sex with April Wright.

554
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,700
- You're going to be charged with statutory rape.
- Not by you.

555
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,400
Statutory rape is not a federal crime.
So I'm left to assume that you're here to get my client to confess to murder.

556
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,800
Oh, it adds up, it tracks.

557
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,300
I didn't kill April.

558
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,300
You met April in a bar, but she was killed somewhere else.
Near a chemical plant?

559
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,500
- I don't know anything about that.
- You had sex with her.

560
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,900
She threatened to tell her family;
you couldn't let that happen.

561
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,400
- No... no...
- you'd lose your business, your professional standing.

562
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,300
- Do not engage with him, David.
- You had motive, you had means, you had opportunity.

563
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,100
- I didn't kill her.
- Then why aren't you helping us?

564
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
- What?
- By not admitting that you were there that night,

565
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,500
by not confessing that you were with her,
you're clouding the issue.

566
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,300
So what?
Epps will still be in jail for the rest of his life.

567
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,900
We are not discussing the events of that night, Agent Booth.

568
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,500
You are the only person who could tell us what happened that night.

569
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,600
- Do you care at all about what happened to her?
- Okay, look, I went there that night just to talk,okay?

570
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,400
- That's all.
- This interview is over.

571
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,600
No! I went just to talk.

572
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,200
Look, I'm not proud of what happened.
I can tell you exactly why it happened, but I'm not proud of it.

573
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,600
I shouldn't have let myself get pulled in.

574
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,500
I didn't know it was her first time.
I didn't know she'd get so upset.

575
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,400
She ran off.

576
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,800
- Don't tell me you left her in that park.
- No. I looked for her. I waited for over two hours.

577
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,200
Finally, I figured she'd
called somebody to come get her.

578
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,800
Was her car still there when you left?

579
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,200
- Yes, it was.
- What time was that?

580
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,400
- It was after 2:00 A.M.
- Did you see anyone else?

581
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,200
Yeah there was traffic.
There was some traffic-it was all teenagers.

582
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,300
After 1:00 A.M.There was nothing.

583
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Look,
maybe it is my fault that he got to her.

584
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,800
You know, maybe I should go to jail for that.

585
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,800
Its to having sex with her?

586
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,100
Yes, sir.

587
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,400
Did he kill her?

588
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,900
Well, he's either telling the truth
or he's setting up his defense.

589
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,300
So, April Wright met David Ross
for a sexual liaison;

590
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,100
he took her to a second unknown location,

591
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,500
beat her to death and deposited
the body back at the park.

592
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,400
That's sketchy.

593
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,600
Which is why we have to
find the murder weapon.

594
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,100
Find a tire iron in a marsh
after seven years-that's a long shot.

595
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,500
- That's why we need metal detectors and gpr.
- And a dozen or so agents, sir.

596
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,400
And if you find this tire iron,
you can positively identify it as the murder weapon?

597
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,400
It's possible we can match
the traces we found in April's skull.

598
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,600
Possible? No.

599
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:37,400
Howard Epps' lawyer should present
this argument to the judge and let him decide.

600
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,400
Well, sir, without the murder weapon,
he will not stay the execution.

601
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,400
Way out on a limb here, Booth.

602
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,500
He's just trying to find the truth.
Why should he be penalized...

603
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,900
- Take the equipment and the men you need.
- Thank you, sir.

604
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
She can't have a gun.

605
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,800
No gun. Absolutely not.

606
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,900
We have gpr and more agents
will meet us out there.

607
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,600
We'll have a total of four devices,
so we'll be able to cover a lot of ground.

608
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,700
I'm plugging in all the data from the area
to get the location with the closest match.

609
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,813
Given the chemicals
in the soil and the pollen,

610
00:34:19,814 --> 00:34:22,507
I'd say we're looking for a spot
near the rock hall processing plant.

611
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:24,400
We'll have video relay
when we get to the bay.

612
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,800
- And I need pictures of the type of grass
we're looking for. - Okay.

613
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,700
There are four areas
that have Spartina Alterniflora.

614
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,900
Muddy area, knee-high grass...

615
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,500
Okay, go back one screen.

616
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,000
It's just off that service road.

617
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,000
We've got the tire iron over here.

618
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,500
There's something else.

619
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,200
Here. I got something.

620
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,900
And it's more than a tire iron.

621
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,100
Is that what I think it is?

622
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,600
I need a shovel...

623
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,900
I need a shovel; she's digging here.

624
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,800
Are you going to help?

625
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,900
I would,but this is a $1,200 suit.

626
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,100
Are you kidding me? I haven't slept in 48 hours
and you're worried about your suit?

627
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,300
Get over here.

628
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,900
Fine. Can I get a shovel?

629
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,100
Thank you.

630
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,800
Dig gently, Booth.
Small layers at a time.

631
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,800
What would you usually be doing?

632
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,000
What?

633
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,600
- If it were a normal weekend.
- You want to discuss this now?

634
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,700
- Compared to you, with your multiple sex partners...
- you know, that's none of your business, okay?

635
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,692
I'm not having sex with Amy,

636
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:55,948
and I've never ever cheated on any woman
that I've ever been with.

637
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,900
Never!

638
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,100
I just asked what you'd normally be doing.

639
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,800
I'd be at a movie,
dancing with somebody I care about.

640
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,900
You?

641
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,200
What the hell is going on here?

642
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,500
Female, approximately 17 to 25 years old.

643
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,600
Blunt trauma to the skull.

644
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,800
Also female, same approximate age,
same type of injury.

645
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,200
This doesn't fit with Ross.

646
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,200
If he killed April,
it was a panic murder, personal, not serial.

647
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,200
Both these victims have been
dead for at least five years.

648
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,900
- Maybe more than seven?
- Yes.

649
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,300
Epps. It was Epps.

650
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,456
He snatched April from the park

651
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:07,806
after she ran from Ross, brought
her here,to his killing ground.

652
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:09,200
Why did he take her back to the park?

653
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,800
He watched them have sex.

654
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,500
He saw them argue.

655
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,200
Epps knew suspicions would fall on Ross.

656
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,900
- He took her back.
- And stole her car.

657
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,100
We got played.

658
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,600
What? How?

659
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,900
Either way, Epps wins.

660
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,500
We find Ross, the execution is stopped.
We-we find thise bodies...

661
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,800
the execution is stayed
until these murders are investigated.

662
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,700
If I don't make this call...

663
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,600
he's gonna be dead in a half an hour.

664
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,600
But these women, they deserve to be heard.

665
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,700
It's what we do, Booth.

666
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,200
- The rest...
- Lawyers.

667
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,800
Lawyers.

668
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,300
Amy, it's Booth.

669
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,300
I think we got you your stay of execution,

670
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,900
but you're not going to like it much.

671
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,500
Thank you.

672
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,500
- All I can say is "thank you. "
- What's that, Howie?

673
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,300
Practicing to get jury sympathy?

674
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,800
I did not kill anyone.

675
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,800
Thank you. I mean it.

676
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,900
We found the tire iron.

677
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,700
You'll be found guilty of these murders.

678
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,600
Well, I need a good lawyer.

679
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,700
These murder investigations
take a long time.

680
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,900
Then there's the appeals...

681
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,600
and since I should have been dead
a half an hour ago,

682
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,100
it's all gravy from now on.

683
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,200
We gave him everything he wanted.

684
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,700
Who knows if there'll even
be a death penalty then.

685
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,000
I mean, that's your dream, isn't it?

686
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,600
We want the same things from life.

687
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,200
And I owe you, too.

688
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,200
I read your book.

689
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,700
When I heard you
were working with Booth here,

690
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,200
I knew you were just what I needed.

691
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,100
- You going to arrest me for assault?
- From what I saw purely self-defense.

692
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,700
- Maybe I shouldn't carry a gun after all.
Hell, you can have mine.

693
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,400
- What's the matter with you two?
- Bad day at work.

694
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,900
Well,that's what
you get for working on weekends.

695
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,500
You ever hear about taking some time off?
Having a little fun?

696
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,100
Why? What did you do?

697
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,200
I'd be breaking about six different laws
if I just told you

698
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,100
how I maneuvered on my saturday nights.

699
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,000
But I will bring you some food.

700
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,300
I'm not hungry.

701
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,400
No use arguing with Sid, Bones.

702
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,500
Are you in trouble with your boss?

703
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,900
- I'm sorry for wrecking your weekend for nothing.
- No, not for nothing.

704
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,100
You know what I mean.

705
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,200
You know, all that running around-

706
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,500
that didn't change anything.

707
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,100
Epps was guilty.
He was always always guilty.

708
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,700
There was doubt.

709
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,800
We had an obligation to respect that doubt.

710
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,800
We all share in the death
of every human being.

711
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,000
- Very poetic.
- No. Very literal.

712
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,400
We all share DNA.

713
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,700
When I look at a bone,
it's not some artifact that I can separate from myself.

714
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,000
It's a part of a person
who got here the same way I did.

715
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,300
It should never be easy to
take someone's life.

716
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,900
I don't care who it is.

717
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,000
What?

718
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,300
What?

719
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,100
You've been practicing your
Nobel Prize speech just a little too much.

720
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:01,700
Scallops in Szechwan garlic sauce, dark fried rice.
Apple pie, hot cup of joe.

721
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,000
To simple pleasures, my friends.

722
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,000
To the simple pleasures.
