1
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,000
- Bones, over here!
- Where have you been?

2
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,600
You said you'd meet us
on the corner.

3
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,100
There's a lot going on, in
case you haven't noticed.

4
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,900
These girls, they're
with me-- Dr. Temperance

5
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,600
Brennan, Angela Montenegro
from the Jeffersonian.

6
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,300
- I need ID.
- Check the RI-5 list, Homeland Security.

7
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,500
She's their forensic
anthropologist.

8
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,400
- They're clear.
- Thanks.

9
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Come on.

10
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,500
God, what's that smell?

11
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Burnt flesh.

12
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,900
Are there a lot
of injuries?

13
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,100
Four known dead, 15 injured.

14
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, my God...

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,100
Details. Whatever you have.

16
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,300
Not much. Witnesses said
they saw a Middle-Eastern man,

17
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,600
mid-30s, pull up to the cafe,
and the car just blew.

18
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
The vehicle's registered
to Hamid Masruk,

19
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
head of the Arab-American
Friendship League.

20
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,400
If you know who it is,
why do you need me?

21
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,700
Because we're
hoping we're wrong.

22
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,700
Masruk is a White House
consultant in Arab relations

23
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,900
had lunch with the
president just last week.

24
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,500
You remember Agent Gibson,
Homeland Security?

25
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,400
Dr. Temperance Brennan
and Angela Montenegro.

26
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
If Masruk was involved

27
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,100
in a terrorist attack,
it means we have a huge

28
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
national security problem.
- Not to mention

29
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,600
a very humiliated president.

30
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,800
The press is already running with this.

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,000
- If you think I'm gonna alter my...
- Not at all.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,900
Maybe it's not Masruk.

33
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,100
We need to be sure.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Booth says you're the best.

35
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,200
I need surgical gloves and masks

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,500
for the retrieval team,

37
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,600
sterile medical bags
and vegetable oil.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Vegetable oil?

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,300
The oil will loosen the seared
body parts stuck to the metal.

40
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,900
It's no different than a steak
on a grill that sticks.

41
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,400
It's okay, you know,
I trust you.

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
Should I photograph the scene?

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Focus on 30-meter
radius from the blast.

44
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,600
Okay to pick up?

45
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,000
Ya know, that's okay to be upset.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I wish this is the
worst thing I've seen.

47
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,800
You know, uh...

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,400
I don't think I can...

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Sorry.

50
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,900
Well, if you can't either...

51
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,100
I'm cool.

52
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Zack, I need two
more evidence bags.

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,700
Facial epidermis and the fingertips
are completely decimated.

54
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,900
We're not going to be able to ID
anything from the flesh.

55
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,400
It's basically carbon.

56
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,300
We're missing the lower left leg

57
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,600
and the lumbar spine.
- Here's C2

58
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,800
and the right ischium.

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,000
If Smokey here had access
to the president

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,700
why would he attack a cafe?

61
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,900
Smokey?

62
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
It's how I deal with stress.

63
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Targeting everyday
places causes panic,

64
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,000
people stay home,

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,400
the economy is crippled--
it's Terrorism 101, man.

66
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,000
Take samples from the clothes,
see whatever you can find,

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
traces of cologne,
laundry detergent...

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,800
anything that we can link
to Masruk's home.

69
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,500
I'll grab any particulates
that can identify type of bomb.

70
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,100
Isn't that
the FBI's job?

71
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,900
You trust the FBI?

72
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,700
You realize those guys are gonna
suppress whatever they need

73
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,800
to cover their asses.

74
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,200
Found a portion of the clavicle.

75
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,900
- Are you even listening?
- No.

76
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,500
They have a separate division,
you know.

77
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,600
That way their hands
are always clean.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
In 1974...

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Jack!

80
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,300
We're trying to work.

81
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,700
Someone seems
really defensive

82
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,400
about the FBI lately.

83
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
You realize Booth is just

84
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,800
another government
stooge...

85
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,500
This has nothing to do
with Booth.

86
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,100
I don't enjoy
having squints on my team

87
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,800
any more than you
like me on yours.

88
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,000
But, you know, we're supposed
to be working together.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,700
Okay?

90
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,100
Sure. So what
do we do?

91
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,100
Group hug?

92
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,000
Agent Gibson here will be
overseeing things for Homeland Security.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll try not to be in the way.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,500
We don't need to be overseen.

95
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,800
That's really 
not your call, Bones.

96
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,200
How soon
can we get the DNA match?

97
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,100
That'll take days.

98
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,800
I can get a match
much sooner than that.

99
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I have all we need.

100
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,700
You're gonna be able
to ID him from that?

101
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
Asking stuff like
that is "in the way."

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,100
Remove any flesh and
particulates you can,

103
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,500
and then macerate him.

104
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,300
If that's all right
with you?

105
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't touch the table.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Don't touch the table!

107
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,200
This is my lab!

108
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,900
I'm a scientist, a doctor.

109
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,600
ah, so I've heard.

110
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Would you be able to do your job
if someone was

111
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,100
looking over your shoulder
all the time?

112
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,800
We do, ok!
I developed a tolerance.

113
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,500
Sorry, but I don't understand
the advantage of compromise.

114
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,600
It's a terrorist attack, Bones.

115
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,400
It's bigger than you
and it's bigger than me.

116
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,400
- The job is the same.
- No, it's not!

117
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,300
We're dealing with someone here
who devalues an entire culture,

118
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,300
terrorizing people by using
God to justify mass murder.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,500
You're making it personal.

120
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
That doesn't help.

121
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,900
It is personal, Bones.

122
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,900
All of us die a little bit
on one like this.

123
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,900
All the trace evidence
has been stripped.

124
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,900
Hodgins scavenged as
much as he could.

125
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,900
Okay, let's get started.

126
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,200
What the hell are those?

127
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Dermestes maculatus.

128
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,600
Flesh-eating beetles.

129
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
It's how we clean the bones
of burn victims.

130
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Gibson.

131
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Yes, sir?

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes, sir.

133
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,300
The president wants to know
how long the ID is going to take.

134
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,500
Why don't you ask them?

Only for www.forom.com

139
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,900
{\a6}You've made
a mistake.

140
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,800
{\a6}It can't be
my husband.

141
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,700
My brother was
no terrorist.

142
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,400
He hated those people.

143
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,300
You can read his speeches,
talk to anyone.

144
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,700
We aren't making any accusations.

145
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,800
It's all over the news.
It's all anyone's talking about.

146
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,500
{\a6}We can't control
the press, Mr. Masruk.

147
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,200
{\a6}How about your men?

148
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,100
{\a6}They've searched
our house.

149
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,700
{\a6}They've talked
to our friends.

150
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,200
{\a6}Until we can identify the body,

151
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
{\a6}we have to conduct a
thorough investigation.

152
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,900
So identify the body.

153
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,400
The longer you wait...

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,600
Do you know
what it's like for us?

155
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,700
His body was fragmented
by the blast.

156
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,200
We're still
retrieving pieces...

157
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
{\a6}I understand how difficult
this is, not knowing.

158
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I'll work as quickly as I can
to get you what you need.

159
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,200
That's why I asked for his history,
where he grew up,

160
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,200
any injuries from his youth,
medical records...

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Of course.

162
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,700
I brought you what you asked for.

163
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,100
Thank you.

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,100
{\a6}We lived just
like you.

165
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,900
We came to this country
because we love it.

166
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,900
We are Americans.

167
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,100
It can't be Hamid.

168
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
It can't.

169
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
My husband was not a terrorist.

170
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,600
{\a6}Could be a perchlorate.

171
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,900
{\a6}Wouldn't that be used in a bomb?

172
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,900
{\a6}Yeah, but this is a crystalline
structure-- aluminum based.

173
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,500
{\a6}Okay, I'm back.

174
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,800
{\a6}How are we doing?

175
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,500
{\a6}We have his detergent
brand, cologne, shampoo.

176
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,900
{\a6}He died a well-groomed man.

177
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Thanks.

178
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,000
{\a6}The bones done yet?

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,800
{\a6}I'll check the beetles.

180
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,900
{\a6}Dr. Brennan,
whatever you have there...

181
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,100
{\a6}It's a piece of paper, that's all,
with some writing on it.

182
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,100
{\a6}Hard at work?

183
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,700
There's a shocker.

184
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,700
{\a6}I just saw his wife.

185
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,700
She gave me his medical records,
photographs...

186
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,000
apparently he was ill.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,500
They were testing for lupus.

188
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Which would explain the face...

189
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,300
It must've been painful.

190
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,900
Look, I...

191
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,800
I know that you needed help out there--

192
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,500
at the crime scene...

193
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
and I wanted to, but...

194
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
It's okay.

195
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,500
You see it.

196
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,100
I don't anymore.

197
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
I don't know what's worse.

198
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
You holding up okay?

199
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
His wife doesn't believe it was him.

200
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,900
I've got to give her an ID.

201
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,100
Whatever I can do.

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah, I know.

203
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,900
And about this weekend...

204
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,200
Angela, I don't know.

205
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,100
Oh, come on, Brennan.
I know this great club.

206
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,500
- They play trip-hop and trance.
- I don't know what that means.

207
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,400
It doesn't matter.

208
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
We'll grab Booth...

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,200
I think he likes you.

210
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,700
God, if I were you,
I'd buy a ticket on that ride.

211
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Look, I'm going to be very busy
this weekend.

212
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Even after the ID,
I have these...

213
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,500
Remains from World War I?

214
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,400
That's what the Institute pays me for.

215
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,200
I've got hundreds of these waiting.

216
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
And they can't wait one more weekend?

217
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,300
They've got relatives.

218
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,800
They've waited long enough.

219
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,800
It's not that scary, Brennan.

220
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,500
You have a few drinks,
you move to the music...

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,500
You might even smile.

222
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,400
The bones are clean.

223
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,500
I've got to run.

224
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,000
You hang around!
I may need you.

225
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,400
Comparing remains
to details provided

226
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,900
of Hamid Masruk,

227
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,900
age 37, of Afghani origin.

228
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,500
Texture of pubic symphysis
indicates age of bone

229
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,300
consistent with Masruk,
as is height.

230
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,700
Complexity of the cranial
vault sutures matches

231
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,800
a statistical probability of
Eurasian descent...

232
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
- Good.
- Too bad we can't tell why he did it.

233
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Isn't that what
we all really want to know?

234
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,100
Uneven growth patterns
in the vertebrae

235
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,400
indicate malnourishment as a child.

236
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,900
Consistent with the diet
where Masruk was from.

237
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
Probably evident on the calvarium?

238
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,000
Why don't you reconstruct
the skull, check it out?

239
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,800
My first cranial reconstruction.

240
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
Evidence of multiple fractures

241
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,000
to the bottoms of the feet

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,200
consistent with methods
of torture used in Afghanistan

243
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,700
and consistent with Masurk's history.

244
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,100
I'm convinced.

245
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,200
We have a statistical match.

246
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,900
- So Masruk is the bomber?
- Yes.

247
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,900
What about the skull?
You're having the kid reconstruct...

248
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,600
This is an educational institute.
He wants to learn.

249
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,000
Is that okay with you?

250
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,600
For a forensic I.D.,
we have what we need.

251
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,400
Now, I'd like to get this data
to Booth as soon as I can.

252
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,600
I'll take it.

253
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,500
No, I don't think so.
I work with Booth.

254
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,200
That's my deal.

255
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,400
Dr. Brennan, I have jurisdiction.

256
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,900
Then why don't I destroy my notes

257
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,900
and let you guarantee
the identity of the remains.

258
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's best to just ride it out...

259
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,900
like an earthquake.

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,800
Bones!

261
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
- Did we have an appointment?
- No, I...

262
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,300
It's him.

263
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,200
Masruk is the bomber.

264
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,300
I guess the wife didn't know
the husband very well.

265
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,500
Hi. Sorry.

266
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,200
Tessa, this is Brennan.

267
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,400
Tessa Jankow, Dr. Temperance Brennan.

268
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,100
Oh, hi.

269
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,900
I've heard a lot about you.

270
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Really...

271
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,600
- Tessa's an attorney.
- Mm, corporate.

272
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,500
Keeping the fat cats fat.

273
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,700
I was just studying
a cranial fissure on a

274
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,600
corporate attorney last week.

275
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,400
Of course, he was... dead, so...

276
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Interesting.

277
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Thanks.

278
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,000
Well, the Bureau.

279
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,800
I was just heading to the Bureau,
Santana called,

280
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,900
said, uh,
something about the bombing,

281
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,300
and I thought you were at the lab.

282
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,000
Maybe, uh, you should come.

283
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,400
Sure.

284
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,900
See you later?

285
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,900
What is so funny?

286
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,500
I just never figured
you'd be in a relationship.

287
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,000
Why? Do you think something's
wrong with me?

288
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,200
No, not wrong.

289
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,000
You just have alpha male attribute

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,500
usually associated
with a solitary existence.

291
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,200
Oh, me? You're solitary.
- No, I'm private. It's different.

292
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,700
- And we weren't talking about me.
- I was.

293
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,900
Well, I wasn't.
Look, I'm happy for you.

294
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,800
Relationships have
anthropological meaning.

295
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,300
No society can survive

296
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,900
if sexual bonds
aren't forged between...

297
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,900
What the hell
are you talking about?

298
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,700
- Booth!
- Yeah?

299
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,500
- You got that I.D.?
- Yeah, it was Masruk.

300
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,300
Oh, that's too bad.

301
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,300
He killed four people
and injured another 15.

302
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,100
The report came back from Ballistics.

303
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
Now, the explosives
were placed underneath the car

304
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
with a trigger connected to the odometer.

305
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,100
Masruk was murdered.

306
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,800
So Masruk wasn't a terrorist.

307
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,500
Somebody tried
to make him look like one.

308
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,200
Any leads on who did it?

309
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
That's why we're paying you Booth!

310
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,200
We're very sorry, Mrs. Masruk.

311
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,400
I told you Hamid was the victim,
but you wouldn't listen.

312
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,600
You couldn't imagine an Arab
who was a peace-loving man.

313
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,500
- That's not true
- No?

314
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,400
<i>We must investigate everything, Mrs. Masruk.</i>

315
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,900
<i>We must turn your house
upside down because we believe</i>

316
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,900
<i>your husband was a good man.</i>

317
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,800
Is that the truth?

318
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,200
No, they searched your house because
Muslim extremists have declared war

319
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,500
on the United States.

320
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,000
Preliminary findings
made your husband a suspect,

321
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,100
which we are required to...
- It's not Bureau policy

322
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,600
to target or profile
any ethnic group.

323
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,000
It wasn't our intention,
but I can understand why

324
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,300
you may feel offended.

325
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,400
- I can't.
- Bones...

326
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
What?

327
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,500
She's been a part of a
criminal investigation, that's all.

328
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,000
Her rights haven't been violated.

329
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,600
It's unfortunate that her husband's
ethnicity is a factor,

330
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,800
but to say that it
isn't would be disingenuous.

331
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,300
I have to apologize for Dr. Brennan.

332
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,200
It's fine, Mr. Booth.

333
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,500
Honesty is always a welcome relief.

334
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,800
So when can I bury him?

335
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,500
When can I give him peace?

336
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,100
There are certain body parts
that I'm still examining.

337
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,300
Others are still seared
to the surface of the wreckage.

338
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,100
I'm sure Mrs. Masruk doesn't
really need to know the details...

339
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,400
If I can retrieve
more remains of her husband,

340
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Muslim law requires that I do.

341
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
I spent some time in Iraq
identifying bodies.

342
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,700
I'll give you whatever I can

343
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,700
so that he can be purified for burial.

344
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,300
Thank you.

345
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
Is that all?

346
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,500
One last thing.
A few calls were made to, uh...

347
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,000
his cell phone from your house,

348
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,800
minutes before the blast...

349
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,100
Yes. We argued.

350
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,000
It was a family matter.

351
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,200
My final words to him
were words of anger.

352
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,700
I'm very sorry.

353
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,500
That must be very painful.

354
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,000
You looked very happy in that picture.

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,800
Thank you. If there's
anything else that, you know,

356
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,800
you can think of, just give us a call.

357
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
I think she's having an affair.

358
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Personally.

359
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,200
She was having an affair!

360
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,600
I'm sorry,
but that's an offensive assumption.

361
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,300
All the signs are there.

362
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,000
You can't make wild accusations
about somebody's personal life

363
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,800
based on a feeling.
- It's more than a feeling, okay?

364
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,300
That photograph is evidence
just as solid as the markers

365
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,100
that you squints pick up
looking at your little bones.

366
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,900
The evidence I find is empirical.

367
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,300
What you consider
evidence is merely conjecture.

368
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,100
She dyed her hair,
she lost weight, you know?

369
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,900
She shoved a little Botox
in her forehead,

370
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,000
and she's still feeling guilty
over the last fight she had

371
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,900
with her husband.

372
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,500
You are an insufferable, arrogant...

373
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,900
man.

374
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,400
Oh, so only a woman can know a woman

375
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,500
I thought women
wanted us to understand them.

376
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,200
Not really.

377
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,300
A magician never wants
to reveal her tricks.

378
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,600
- We're having a private conversation.
- I'm not here.

379
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
So you think you know
women just because you live

380
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,900
with some sexy lawyer?
Unbelievable.

381
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,600
You live with a sexy lawyer?

382
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,100
She has her own place, okay?

383
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,600
He thinks just because Masruk's wife

384
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,300
started working out,
had a little makeover,

385
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,500
that she's having an affair.

386
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,900
- How long were they married?
- 11 years.

387
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,700
I'm with him.

388
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,300
There is no concrete proof.

389
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,700
- Boobs perkier?
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,400
I don't believe this.

391
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,900
If you're so sure,
then why didn't you confront her?

392
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,600
Because if she or
her boyfriend were involved,

393
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,300
she would warn him.
- Very good.

394
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,800
I'm a constant surprise.

395
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,300
All right, great.

396
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,300
I will be in the lab
getting us some real data.

397
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,500
So...

398
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,500
How many nights a week
does "Sexy" sleep over?

399
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,800
How's it coming?

400
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,800
The ethmoid and sphenoid fragments
won't piece together.

401
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,900
Zack, I'd like to return the remains
to the widow before her demise.

402
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,300
I'm doing my best, Dr. Brennan.

403
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,800
The integrity of the bone
seems to be compromised.

404
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,000
I don't know if it's from
the metal fragments from the blast.

405
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,600
I examined the chemicals
used in the explosives.

406
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,200
The perchlorates I found
can have a degenerative effect.

407
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Not this quickly.
Excuse me.

408
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,700
Unusually soft bone tissue...

409
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,900
You know, this has nothing
to do with the blast.

410
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,300
I owe you an apology, Zack.

411
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,800
Do you have his medicals?

412
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Stiff joints,
facial disfigurement...

413
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,100
There's a disorganized
trabecular pattern here

414
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,800
that his doctors
wouldn't have been able to see.

415
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,600
It could be a degenerative disease.

416
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,700
I don't get it.

417
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,600
How does his medical condition
figure into the murder?

418
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,500
Now it's a murder.

419
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,100
Before, it was terrorism, because
we didn't have all the facts.

420
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,100
You don't overlook anything
when you're looking for the truth.

421
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,500
Check for lupus and Paget's.

422
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
Do you have enough tissue?

423
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,900
- Yeah, I can manage it.
- If those come back negative,

424
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,500
he might have been exposed
to a toxin,

425
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,800
which would mean
his brother was, too.

426
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,600
He's exhibiting similar symptoms.

427
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I'll get the brother's medicals.

428
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,600
I graduated top of my class,
Rhodes scholar

429
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,500
the youngest member inducted into
the Academy of Physical Sciences,

430
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,900
but she still makes me feel like a cretin.

431
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,600
She apologized to me.

432
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,700
Yes, I am a Christian.

433
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,700
But Hamid is a Muslim, and Sahar...

434
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,300
I converted.

435
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,400
Hamid could never accept it.

436
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,200
Religious differences
cause too many problems.

437
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Seems to be a consistent
fact throughout history.

438
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Please.

439
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,400
I tried to make peace with my brother,
but it was difficult.

440
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,700
There was more than religion between us.

441
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,700
Sahar mentioned that there were some,
uh, family problems.

442
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,600
Yes

443
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,500
I can understand how, uh,
delicate they can be.

444
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,800
Did she tell you any more than that?

445
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,200
No, but, I mean, if you have, uh,

446
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,400
any other information that could
help us in the investigation...

447
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,100
It's not my place.

448
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,100
We're just trying to find out
who killed your brother.

449
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,300
Sahar was seeing another man,

450
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,900
but I can't believe she'd hurt my brother.

451
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,500
Do you know who this other man is,

452
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,300
or is it just a feeling you have?

453
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,900
I've met him.

454
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,500
Ali Ladjavardi.

455
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,700
He worked with Hamid
at the Friendship League.

456
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,000
I wanted Hamid to confront Ladjavardi.

457
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,300
Did both you and Hamid
have contact with Ladjavardi?

458
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,200
Yes, once.
A meal.

459
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,100
I brought Hamid to meet him.

460
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,600
Sharing a meal is a gesture of peace.

461
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,100
I was trying to save their marriage,
but Sahar and Ladjavardi

462
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,200
were not going to stop their affair,

463
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,300
so I told Hamid to repudiate her.

464
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,100
I'm sorry?

465
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,100
In Muslim law, it's a method of divorce.
It's called Talaq.

466
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,400
I still respected his traditions.

467
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,400
You and your brother seem
to share a medical condition.

468
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
- Why is that important?
- We don't mean to embarrass you,

469
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,600
but Dr. Brennan is just trying
to figure out the condition.

470
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,400
It's routine,
part of the investigation.

471
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,800
- Have you seen a doctor?
- Yes.

472
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,400
He believes it's a genetic disorder we share.

473
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,800
He was going to call
Hamid's physician to discuss it.

474
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,600
Would you mind
if we saw your medical records?

475
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,200
Of course not.

476
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,200
If I could be helped, I welcome it.

477
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,600
Apparently,
they live together a few days a week.

478
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,400
But he was very clear
that she has her own place.

479
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,800
Should you be intruding
into their lives like this?

480
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,100
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
- We're negative for lupus and Paget's.

481
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,700
When you're done, I'll do
a scraping for environmental contaminants.

482
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,800
I found these:

483
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,600
shiny flakes that caught onto
the torn edges of bone.

484
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,700
Bottom line, I still think Brennan
has a shot with Booth.

485
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,100
But she says she's not interested.

486
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,400
Methinks the lady doth protest too much.

487
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,800
Maybe she protesteth just enough

488
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,900
Please.

489
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,200
She's been sleeping alone for months.

490
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,900
She has enough pent up sexual energy

491
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,000
to power a small midwestern city.

492
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,100
This looks like gypsum.

493
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,700
It wouldn't cause any organic damage.

494
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,200
It was probably used
to insulate the explosives.

495
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,400
Bet the FBI doesn't know that yet.

496
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,300
I'm going to go check out this girlfriend.

497
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,200
I'm not proud of the affair.

498
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,100
I admired Hamid.

499
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,400
But Sahar and I are in love.
I can't change that.

500
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,700
You worked with Hamid.

501
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,300
- You had access to his car.
- That's ridiculous!

502
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,900
You also had contact
with his brother, Farid,

503
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,300
who said you were less
than friendly with Hamid.

504
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Have you ever been in the middle
of a messy relationship, Agent Booth?

505
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,000
Or are you a perfect man?

506
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,600
I'd prefer to ask the questions, Mr. Ladjavardi.

507
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,200
And I have the right for an attorney.
Have you called the number I gave you?

508
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,400
Of course, you know,
I would never deny anyone his rights.

509
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Mr. Ladjavardi...

510
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,700
I'm Special Agent in Charge Santana.

511
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,700
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
You're free to go.

512
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,700
Thank you.

513
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,600
- You're finished.
- What the hell was that all about?

514
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,900
He was a prime suspect.

515
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,600
He's a mole for Homeland Security.

516
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,400
They planted him in
the Arab-American Friendship League.

517
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
He admitted the affair.

518
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,400
Maybe, but Homeland Security
says he's clean.

519
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,500
They do not want his cover blown.

520
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,500
- But, sir...
- Do I look like I'm discussing this?

521
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,600
Come on.

522
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,700
You want me to drive?

523
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,600
No. Why?

524
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,800
- You're angry.
- I'm not angry.

525
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,200
Yeah, you're furious.
You're going to kill somebody.

526
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,000
I am not angry.

527
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,700
Believe me,
you do not want to see me angry.

528
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,400
That's the last thing you want to see.

529
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,700
This is me accepting reality.

530
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,100
Okay, my mistake.

531
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,400
My superiors, they make the decisions,
Bones. All right?

532
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,700
They don't think them through,
that's really not my problem.

533
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,100
If I were you, I'd be mad.

534
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,500
Homeland Security is preventing you

535
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,000
from doing a proper
investigation of a murder case.

536
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'm a grown-up. I'll deal.

537
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,000
You know that thing
where you ask for the strength

538
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,500
to change the things that you can

539
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,400
and the wisdom to know the difference?

540
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,900
Not really.

541
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,100
Well, that's a good thing.

542
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,100
Who do you ask?

543
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,600
- For what?
- For the strength and the wisdom?

544
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,000
God.

545
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,100
And it works?

546
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,500
Can we talk about something else?

547
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,700
Sure. Tessa?

548
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,700
Tessa? No.

549
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,300
- Why do you want to talk about Tessa?
- Why? Why not?

550
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,500
I'm sorry. We won't talk about Tessa.

551
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,400
I prefer if we would just stay on point

552
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,000
and talk about things
that you like to talk about

553
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,700
like dead people. Dead bodies.

554
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,000
Sure, sure. You've
killed a lot of people, right?

555
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,200
When you were a sniper?

556
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,500
Maybe we shouldn't talk at all.

557
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,700
Right, 'cause you're angry.

558
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,600
I'm not angry. Not.

559
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
We'll find out who killed him, Booth.

560
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,400
We've got Hamid's body.

561
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
You can always count on the dead.

562
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,900
When Booth sends over the brother's
medicals, I want them matched to Hamid's.

563
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,900
I'm starting on a tox screen.

564
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,500
Farid said that his doctor
suspected a genetic condition.

565
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,100
Maybe we're overlooking something.

566
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,200
What is that?

567
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,200
We used the trace elements we
recovered to try and rebuild the bomb.

568
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,000
It might give you another link.

569
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,400
Isn't the FBI working on that?

570
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,100
Yeah-- this is just for fun.

571
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,900
To see who's better?

572
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,700
Maybe.

573
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,800
A little.

574
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,600
Yeah.

575
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,700
Good luck. 

576
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,700
Ta-da.

577
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,500
Nice job.

578
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,100
No wonder you had such trouble
with the reconstruction.

579
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,700
Look at the spread of
the trabecular pattern in the bone.

580
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,800
Microscopic fissures, like cracks.

581
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,700
- I knew that.
- I don't think so.

582
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,700
Can we focus?

583
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,600
The spread was too rapid
for any organic bone disease

584
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,400
or genetic condition.
It's definitely a toxin.

585
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Is there any surviving marrow to test?

586
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,100
I'll try and find some.

587
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,000
Let's do it.

588
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,000
The marrow's degraded.

589
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,600
I can give you basics, but that's it.

590
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,500
Well, according to these tests,
the liver function was impaired.

591
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,300
His body was trying to get rid
of whatever was poisoning him.

592
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
There is trouble in paradise.

593
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,100
I beg your pardon?

594
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,900
Tessa does not feel secure
in that relationship.

595
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,300
- I think she's threatened by you.
- You talk to her?

596
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,500
She didn say much,

597
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,600
but even though
she has a phenomenal figure,

598
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,800
she was chowing down
on a fat-free muffin.

599
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,700
And she was reading a book
about unsolved FBI cases.

600
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,100
She's obviously feeling insecure.

601
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,600
She's spying for you?

602
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,100
Even if you have nothing in common,

603
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,400
it's difficult to sublimate
intense sexual attraction.

604
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,400
And we hear it's been a while.

605
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,500
Okay, stop!

606
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,600
He is there for the taking, honey.

607
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,100
Okay, I couldn't get his medical records.

608
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,900
- What?
- Uh, nothing.

609
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,700
Trying to track down the doctor.

610
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,600
Don't need him.

611
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,100
It's definitely a toxin.

612
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,200
- But we can't determine what kind.
- Too bad the liver is cooked.

613
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,700
That could tell us everything.

614
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,600
I need subtitles walking in here.

615
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,400
The liver is like a filter.

616
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,100
It would contain evidence
of any toxins in the system.

617
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,100
But we don't have the liver
or any of the flesh left.

618
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,800
But we do have the beetles.

619
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,200
They ate Hamid's flesh
and whatever organs remained.

620
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,700
And as we all know, you are what you eat.

621
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,300
So you can I.D. the poison from the beetles?

622
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,500
You can't kill them.

623
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,100
They have names.

624
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,200
We have to, Zack.

625
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Some.

626
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,500
In Thailand, they're sautéed in peanut oil.

627
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,700
We're going to have to run a simulation.

628
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,700
I need you to input
the skull and give me a face.

629
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,100
You got it.

630
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,900
And no more talk about Booth.

631
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,500
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

632
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,500
- But that's what friends are for.
- Please, Angela...

633
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,600
Hey, whoa, where did you get this?

634
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,900
I'm building it--

635
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,900
theoretical construct of the bomb
based on the particulates we gathered.

636
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,600
This isn't your job,
the Bureau's doing this.

637
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Got it!

638
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,000
They were poisoned by dioxin.
A very pure form.

639
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,600
It would stay in his system for years,

640
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,900
cause cancer, diabetes, heart attack

641
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,300
and the facial cysts
and bone degeneration we saw.

642
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,200
Give me the saturation levels.
Angela can use it in the simulation

643
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,900
to give us an approximate
date of ingestion.

644
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,300
- How much would it take to poison them?
- Just a little slipped into their food.

645
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,800
Like at that lunch
they both had with Sahar's lover.

646
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Impressed?

647
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,700
Dioxin levels were 5,600 parts per trillion.

648
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,000
Speed of bone degeneration is an 80%
increase over baseline osteoporosis.

649
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,900
Date of death was...

650
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,600
I remember that one, thanks.

651
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,800
Run the scenario.

652
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,700
I will never get used to this.

653
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,700
Chicks with toys.

654
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,200
Poor bastard.

655
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Match it to his INS photograph,
see how accurate you are.

656
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,900
Good work, Angela.

657
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,300
Probable date of exposure...

658
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,300
about four months ago,
I'd say first week in June.

659
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,300
Let's go pay a little visit to Mr Ladjavardi.

660
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,200
I thought you were told
to stay away from him.

661
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,300
Yeah. And, as an FBI agent,
I cannot disobey my superior.

662
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,100
But you're not an FBI agent.

663
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,600
Hey! Hi.

664
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
How you doing?

665
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,800
What the hell are you doing here?

666
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,400
- You had orders.
- No, not me.

667
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,800
I... I just have a couple
of quick questions for you.

668
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,300
Look, I'm not involved in this.

669
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,500
- Sahar won't even talk to me anymore.
- Yeah. I wonder why.

670
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,100
- I'm calling Santana.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

671
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,100
I'm warning you.

672
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,900
I wouldn't threaten her if I were you.

673
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,800
Look, I just want to know
where you were

674
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,900
in June, first week, to see if
you poisoned Hamid and Farid.

675
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,900
- Subtle.
- I'm leaving. That's it.

676
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Told you.
She doesn't like to be touched.

677
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
I didn't poison anybody.

678
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,800
Then tell me where you were in June.

679
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,800
In Utah, for training
with Homeland Security.

680
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,500
I didn't get to D.C. until August 12.
Check with the department.

681
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
All right.

682
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
Thanks.

683
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,200
The insulation they used
is gypsum-based,

684
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,500
with plaster and lead
mixed with asbestos.

685
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,600
Pyrobar.

686
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,000
It's a fireproof tile
developed in 1903

687
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,800
by the United States Gypsum Company.

688
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,900
It was only used for a few years.

689
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,900
So it probably came from the
building the bomb was constructed in.

690
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We find the building,
and we find the bomber.

691
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,700
How about this?

692
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,900
Sahar wants out of the marriage.
Hamid refuses.

693
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,300
So Sahar poisons him so that
she can run off with Lajavardi.

694
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,400
Doesn't make sense.

695
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,500
When someone dies,
the first suspect is the spouse.

696
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,100
Well, at about Hamid's brother?
Did she poison him, too?

697
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,500
Why not? He's pushing his nose
into their marriage.

698
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,200
Suddenly, Sahar is facing a devout Muslim

699
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,700
and a fundamentalist Christian.

700
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,500
And, you know,
nobody allows divorce,

701
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,800
and she's pushed to murder.
- That eschews logic.

702
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,500
Come on, Bones!
Just work with me here!.

703
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,900
It's what we in law enforcement
call <i>positing a scenario</i>.

704
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,200
And don't use the word <i>eschew</i>.

705
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,900
What if you and Tessa were going
to break up, but you didn't want to?

706
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,300
- Which I don't.
- Well I'm <i>positing a scenario</i>

707
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,300
Tessa wants to break up, an you
don't want to, so she poisons you.

708
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,200
And then, just to make sure,
she blows you up with a bomb.

709
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,600
- Why would Tessa do that?
- Exactly. Thank you.

710
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,800
'Cause Tessa and I...
that's a bad example.

711
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,200
You're a couple in love, right?

712
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Why do you keep bringing up Tessa?

713
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,700
I mean, why?
What's the big deal?

714
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,700
Is it so odd for you
that I have someone in my life?

715
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,100
We were talking about couples.

716
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,900
It's a natural segue.

717
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,100
You know, you have to quit using
the word <i>segue</i> and <i>eschew</i>.

718
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,600
All right? They sound French.

719
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,800
You keep changing the subject.

720
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,800
I get it. You're sensitive
about you and Tessa.

721
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,600
Why aren't we talking
about you and your boyfriend?

722
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,100
I don't have a boyfriend.

723
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,500
You just said that
as though it's a good thing.

724
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,900
And you know what?
It's a very, very, sad

725
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,600
comment on your personal life.

726
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,900
Look, you're angry again.

727
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,600
Brennan.

728
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,700
The bomb insulation
was made from Pyrobar,

729
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,000
which was used by an
architect named William Allard.

730
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,300
He was known for developing
the Woodley Park neighborhood

731
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,800
around 1910.

732
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,100
Hang on a second, Zack.

733
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,100
- The bomb was made in Woodley Park.
- That's where Farid lives.

734
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,300
Okay, hold on.

735
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,900
No wonder we couldn't get his medicals.

736
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,500
He already knew what was poisoning him.

737
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,900
Just stay in contact with your boys,

738
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,400
and tell them we're going to need them.

739
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,300
Listen, Bones, we're heading
into a very unknown situation.

740
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,300
I think it's best that
you just stay in the car.

741
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,000
Okay, then, you know,
if you have to come in with me,

742
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,500
then you stay behind me.

743
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,100
Fine. Just be careful, all right?

744
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,500
Okay, anybody asks,
that door was open.

745
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Stay right here.

746
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,900
FBI, Farid!

747
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,800
Show yourself.

748
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
Clear.

749
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,600
Can you get me Hodgins?

750
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,400
Farid was making something here.

751
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,100
I've got melted plastic,
bottles of chlorine...

752
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,800
Dioxin. That's how you'd make it.

753
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,100
Bones!

754
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,500
The insulation.

755
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,000
Farid definitely made the bomb.
He killed his brother.

756
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,800
- Stay with me, Hodgins.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

757
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,000
<i>Hamid must have been killed</i>

758
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,400
<i>because</i> he found his brother making dioxin.

759
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,100
All right, that's probably
how they got contaminated.

760
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,600
Come on. Mechanic's Guide
for Hamid's SUV.

761
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Page on the odometer... dog-eared.

762
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
He wasn't a Christian.

763
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,800
<i>Deceit in the service of Allah is holy.</i>

764
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,600
The Koran?

765
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,400
No. An Imam's twisted
interpretation of the Koran,

766
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,000
so that mass murders
don't have to feel guilt.

767
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,200
He's made another bomb.

768
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,400
It's out there, right now.

769
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,900
I'm convinced.

770
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,700
What's the dispersal rate
for a bomb packed with, say,

771
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,400
two liters of dioxin?

772
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,900
A homemade device
similar to the car bomb?

773
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,200
That could be 300 to <i>500 meters.</i>

774
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,800
<i>If the victims weren't killed,</i>

775
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,600
<i>they'd develop</i> cancer, blindness,
lesions, diabetes...

776
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,900
Today's day is marked.

777
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,900
Call Homeland Security.
They'll secure the apartment.

778
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,500
There's a convenience store across
the street from Farid's apartment.

779
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,700
The owner saw him get on
to a bus and head downtown.

780
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,700
We're not sure what bus.

781
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,500
Booth is checking with the <i>FBI now.</i>

782
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,500
<i>If you find anything...</i>

783
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,200
I know. It's just these bus
schedules are totally confusing.

784
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Yeah. We saw his datebook.
He had 5:30 circled.

785
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,800
Just check anything that has
anything to do with 5:30--

786
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,200
begins, ends, whatever. Yeah.

787
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
I'm not going anywhere.

788
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Angela's checking, too.

789
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,600
I still don't understand
why Farid would kill his brother.

790
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,300
Because both of them were
developing symptoms, man,

791
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,200
and people were going
to start asking questions,

792
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,900
and then Farid would have been exposed.
He had a mission to accomplish.

793
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,400
How the hell does he think
he's bringing about a better world

794
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,800
by blowing people up?

795
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,000
Fanaticism and logic don't go hand in hand.

796
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,400
It's almost 5:30. Come on, Angela.

797
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,500
Anything between
Woodley Park and downtown.

798
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,900
Three movies start at 6:00,

799
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,100
there's a lecture at Fuller Hall on birds.

800
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,100
I can't imagine that will be crowded.

801
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,600
And a peace conference
at the Hamilton Cultural Center.

802
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,900
<i>There'll be speeches by
Arab mo</i>derates and a congressman.

803
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,900
<i>That looks like the one.</i>

804
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,400
Peace conference,
Hamilton Cultural Center. That's it.

805
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
That's got to be it.
Okay, Gibson, just get your boys

806
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,200
over to the Hamilton Cultural Center.

807
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,000
Just keep them back when you get there.

808
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,500
You understand me?
If you spook this guy,

809
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,700
he'll blow himself up
before we can take him out.

810
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,600
- Thanks, Angela.
- Bye. Bye.

811
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,200
- You know, you don't have to come.
- You've got to be kidding me.

812
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,200
{\a6}We'll start down here
and we'll make our way upstairs.

813
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,100
<i>Welcome to the Hamilton Cultural Center
Peace Conference.</i>

814
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,100
<i>We would ask that all delegates
check in at the orientation...</i>

815
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,300
<i>located at the east atrium before...</i>

816
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,900
<i>for the keynote speaker address.</i>

817
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,400
There are too many ways in.

818
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,800
Where are the reinforcements?

819
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,100
Aren't there always reinforcements?

820
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,800
- They're downstairs tying up the horses.
- Sarcasm doesn't help.

821
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,800
Ok they're mobilising squad team and
additional agents, but it takes time.

822
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,600
If Farid has the bomb,

823
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,200
spots them, that could be bad.

824
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,500
- If you see him, will you shoot?
- Well, he might not have the bomb.

825
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,900
You don't believe that.

826
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,600
I'm not taking out a target,
Bones, unless I'm sure.

827
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,300
Is that how you make it easier?

828
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,600
Calling him a target?

829
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,600
You know, you really picked an
odd time to have this conversation.

830
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,300
Booth.

831
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,300
Farid?

832
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,800
There! That's Farid.

833
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm not sure.

834
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,200
Look, his walk is labored
from the dioxin poisoning,

835
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,100
and the parietal bones
in his skull match his picture.

836
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,400
His back's to us.
What if you're wrong?

837
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,400
This is what I do, Booth.
Do you really want to wait?

838
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,800
He's carrying something
heavy in his camera bag.

839
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,000
See? The actual weight
is causing his shoulder to...

840
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
- No, I can't.
- He has all the markers, Booth.

841
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
- I need a face. I need a face!
- Farid!

842
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,700
On the ground!

843
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,500
He's going for the bomb!

844
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,100
I told them to tell the press
that it was an undercover operation.

845
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
But it would be a Rose Garden ceremony.

846
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,100
That's an honor, right?

847
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I thought you FBI guys liked your medals.

848
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
There's no pleasure
in taking someone's life.

849
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,400
It's nothing to celebrate.

850
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
You saved so many people, Booth.

851
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,800
Don't forget that.

852
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,400
Want another drink?

853
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,900
Shouldn't you be getting home?

854
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Tessa will be worried about you.

855
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,000
I guess I should.

856
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,800
Thanks for your help, Bones.

857
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,900
Sure.
