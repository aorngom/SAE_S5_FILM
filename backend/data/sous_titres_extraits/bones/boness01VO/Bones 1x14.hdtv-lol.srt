1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,501
We'll be meeting
with agents

2
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:05,167
from the FAA,
the NTSB and local police.

3
00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:07,000
Usually Booth handles
those people.

4
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:08,934
Plane crashes don't belong
to the FBI.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,467
Why not? FAA stands
for "Federal Aviation
Administration,"

6
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:13,934
the NTSB stands for
"National Transportation
Safety Board."

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,267
That sounds federal to me,
and FBI stands for Federal...

8
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:17,501
Zack...

9
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:19,267
It's the third time
in a row

10
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:20,367
we've investigated
without Booth.

11
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:21,467
I don't like it.

12
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:23,267
Why? He mostly
ignores you.

13
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:26,634
Ignoring me is Booth's way
of acknowledging my presence.

14
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:27,901
It's a guy thing.

15
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:29,567
Here we are.

16
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:45,734
Dr. Brennan?

17
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes.
I'm Ian Dyson
with the NTSB.

18
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:48,834
This is my assistant,

19
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:49,968
Zack Addy.

20
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:52,133
At approximately

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
0400 last night,

22
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:56,367
a private jet with five
passengers on board

23
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:58,167
reported horizontal
stabilizer trouble

24
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:00,934
200 miles southeast
of Norfolk.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,167
Yeager Airport in Charleston
tracked them for 30 minutes

26
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:06,467
until they dropped off the radar
screen at 0430.

27
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:09,234
The plane tried to make
an emergency landing here

28
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,901
when it clipped some trees
and slammed to the ground.

29
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:15,367
We found another mostly intact
body over near the trees.

30
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:16,601
The rest is bits and pieces.

31
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:17,834
What makes this

32
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:18,901
one of our cases?

33
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:20,200
I beg your pardon?

34
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:22,067
We're kind of special.
We're elite.

35
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:24,534
We don't sort
through just any
set of bodies.

36
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:25,934
It was a State
Department flight

37
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:27,467
with a bunch of VIPs on board.

38
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:29,000
Is that special enough?

39
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:30,667
I apologize
if I've offended you.

40
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:31,934
Usually, we have

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,501
an FBI agent
who mediates

42
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,334
our interpersonal encounters.

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,300
We found another skull.

44
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:37,767
Two skulls.

45
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:40,367
Those, uh, pieces
are from two different skulls.

46
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,133
I'll leave you super elite types
to it.

47
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:47,033
Zack, we don't need Booth

48
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,968
to mediate our interpersonal
encounters.

49
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:52,834
Pilot, copilot,

50
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:55,067
brings our count to six.

51
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:57,200
Three mostly intact sets
of remains,

52
00:01:57,267 --> 00:02:00,434
one partial and two fragmented.

53
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:02,200
Obviously, bodies are burned
to a crisp.

54
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:07,501
No dermis, very little
soft tissue, indications

55
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,434
of high-impact trauma;

56
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:12,267
burst fracture of the lower
thoracic and lumbar vertebrae

57
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:14,300
consistent with injuries
caused by the vertical impact

58
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,801
of the falling aircraft.

59
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:18,534
Should I keep talking
as though

60
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:19,767
you're paying attention?

61
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,634
What do you make of this?

62
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:27,767
A femur fragment.

63
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:29,734
No charring.

64
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:31,501
You think this fragment doesn't
belong to the plane crash.

65
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,601
What are the odds?

66
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,734
A crashing plane falling
directly on a human being?

67
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:40,234
One in... ten million.

68
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,367
The information that I'm about
to tell you

69
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,067
must not leave this room.

70
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,400
I am philosophically opposed
to institutional secrecy

71
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:49,534
in all its forms.

72
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:51,067
Fine. Get out.

73
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:56,000
Two Communist Chinese trade
attaches were on that plane

74
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:57,434
when it crashed--

75
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:58,567
both high-ranking
party members.

76
00:02:58,634 --> 00:02:59,834
Well, obviously,
we shot it down.

77
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:02,601
The FAA and the NTSB
can prove

78
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,400
that it was an accident.

79
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:07,033
Also on the manifest
was an American businessman,

80
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,000
a pilot and a copilot.

81
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,133
Five people.

82
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,834
Dr. Goodman,

83
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:14,200
we found six sets of human
remains on that airplane.

84
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:16,200
Not to mention
three bone fragments

85
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:18,100
which were not on the plane.

86
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,968
Is there any chance those bone
fragments were on the plane?

87
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,501
What, you mean
as carry-on luggage?

88
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:23,934
No, everything on the plane
burned.

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,467
They were untouched by fire.

90
00:03:25,534 --> 00:03:28,033
Hmm. And forget about the bone
fragments for the time being.

91
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,234
The State Department
is extremely anxious

92
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,467
to find the identity
of that sixth person.

93
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:34,667
No one wishes this to become
an international incident,

94
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:38,100
therefore this
is our only priority.

95
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:39,868
I disagree.

96
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:41,300
For the love of God, why?

97
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:42,934
Because the plane crash

98
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,834
was an accident,
bone fragments were not.

99
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:46,801
How do you know?

100
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:48,133
Zack found unusual cut marks.

101
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,367
Cut marks congruent

102
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:50,801
with dismemberment.

103
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:52,601
People,

104
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,934
one hour ago,
I received a call

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,567
from the Secretary
of State

106
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:58,701
requesting that the unidentified
extra passenger

107
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:00,234
be our first priority.

108
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,300
So, now politics

109
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,934
are more important than murder?

110
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,100
I'm not saying "please."

111
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,901
I'm not being
reasonable.

112
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:08,667
I'm making
the decision.

113
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:11,267
First and foremost,
identify that sixth body.

114
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,300
Got it, or you want me
to explain again?

115
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:24,434
I got it, okay?

116
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:26,234
The plane goes down,
kablooey.

117
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,767
There's an extra body
on board

118
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,334
which you really
don't care about

119
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
'cause you're more
interested in these
bone fragments

120
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:32,501
that you found
on the ground.

121
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:33,567
Exactly.

122
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:35,701
Oh, this all you got?

123
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:37,400
So far.

124
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:40,234
Piece of skull, chunk
of vertebra, part of a femur.

125
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,934
Not much to go on.

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,868
These fragments come from
a person who was hacked.

127
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,434
Hacked to little bits?

128
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:47,200
No, medium-size bits.

129
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:48,667
I'm not sure how it turned
into little bits yet.

130
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:51,067
Okay, and I'm here why?

131
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,234
Dismemberment,
little bits--

132
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,033
it's a murder.

133
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,567
FBI doesn't have
jurisdiction at a golf course.

134
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:57,901
Well, who does?
I don't know.

135
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:58,701
Try the PGA.

136
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:00,767
Uh-huh.

137
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,100
You know, you've done
a couple cases without me

138
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:04,234
and you miss me.

139
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:05,334
Zack misses you, not me.

140
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,133
Zack and I don't even talk.

141
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,033
He seems to think
it's a male-bonding ritual.

142
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,567
Maybe he's right.
- No, it's not.

143
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:12,000
Could be.
- You told him that

144
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,100
so you wouldn't have
to talk to him.

145
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,968
Well, it was nicer
than shooting him.

146
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:18,567
Goodman has ordered
me to investigate the
other extra body.

147
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, then you better
get on that.

148
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:21,167
Next time you know you miss me,

149
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:22,400
pick up the phone, call me.

150
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:23,334
We'll do lunch
or something.

151
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,000
I do not miss you.

152
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,801
Come on. Say it!

153
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,300
I do not miss you!
Dr. Brennan,
Agent Booth,

154
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:28,734
you have a visitor.

155
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:29,901
No, I don't.

156
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:31,200
You miss me.

157
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,100
Dr. Temperance Brennan?
- Yes.

158
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:42,567
Special Agent Seeley Booth.
I'm Jesse Caine.

159
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:43,534
You're Jesse Caine?

160
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:44,501
You've heard of me?

161
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:45,534
I haven't.

162
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:47,000
Jesse here is sort

163
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:48,434
of an expert
on missing persons cases.

164
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:50,501
I've done some writing
on missing person laws

165
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,434
and investigative techniques.

166
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:54,000
Interagency cooperation,

167
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:56,234
jurisdictional dispute,
that kind of thing.

168
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,200
I heard about the bones
you found at the golf course.

169
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:01,133
I can't really talk about that.

170
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,534
I don't mean the Communist
Chinese on the plane.

171
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:05,133
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Communist Chinese?

172
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,634
The other bones,
the fragments.

173
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,734
How'd you hear about
the Communist Chinese?

174
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:12,500
Those pieces of bone
you found on the golf course?

175
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:15,834
I'm pretty sure that's my dad.

178
00:06:50,974 --> 00:06:53,374
My expertise
in missing persons investigation

179
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,107
derives from one thing--
my search for my father.

180
00:06:56,173 --> 00:06:57,974
He went missing five years ago
during a trip to his cottage

181
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,774
in Virginia Beach.

182
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:01,440
What makes you think
these bone fragments

183
00:07:01,507 --> 00:07:03,173
come from your father?

184
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,841
You know, there is a question
of national security

185
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:05,807
here that is in
my jurisdiction.

186
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:06,741
He's not supposed
to know

187
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:08,040
about the Chinese.

188
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:09,774
My investigations
lead me to conclude

189
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:12,173
that my father was murdered in
the area and his body disposed.

190
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,008
What do the police say?

191
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:15,774
They gave up four years ago.

192
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:16,874
Because there was no evidence
of foul play.

193
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,707
The investigation was bungled.

194
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:21,008
The city police didn't have
the manpower.

195
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,008
The state trooper said
it was a federal matter

196
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:25,173
and you guys suggested
a private investigator.

197
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,908
It was not bungled, okay?

198
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:28,407
Because there was
no evidence of foul play.

199
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:30,574
It's a common story, okay?

200
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:32,440
A guy goes in for a pack
of cigarettes,

201
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:35,107
he ends up renting out
snorkeling gear in Guam.

202
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:38,040
He doesn't know what it's like
to lose a parent. You do.

203
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,374
You want back down
a jot there, buddy?

204
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,741
How do you know about that?

205
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:44,740
No offense, Dr. Brennan,

206
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:46,740
but you're a writer,
a well-known scientist.

207
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:48,074
It's out there.
Plus, you're one of us.

208
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:49,473
One of us?

209
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,774
People whose loved ones
have simply vanished.

210
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,207
In your case, both parents.

211
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:53,740
Okay, how do you know
about the Chinese?

212
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,840
Do not look
at Dr. Brennan, okay?

213
00:07:56,907 --> 00:07:58,540
Whether you like it
or not,

214
00:07:58,607 --> 00:07:59,674
this is an issue
between you

215
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,640
and the FBI.

216
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:02,308
If body parts are found

217
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:03,374
in roughly the area
my father disappeared,

218
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,308
I'm going to know about it.

219
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:05,141
Radio chatter,
the Internet,

220
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:06,274
the local law enforcement...

221
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:08,740
That's all I'm prepared
to tell you.

222
00:08:08,807 --> 00:08:10,740
Do you mind if I ask you

223
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,274
how many bone fragments
you found?

224
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:13,573
Yes, I do.

225
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,408
I don't discuss ongoing
investigations.

226
00:08:15,473 --> 00:08:18,907
She doesn't discuss
ongoing investigations.

227
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:20,774
Fair enough,
Dr. Brennan.

228
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,007
These are my notes
from the last five years.

229
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,507
Every lead, every clue,

230
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:26,473
every person I've ever
talked with is here.

231
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,874
And why would Dr. Brennan
care about that?

232
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,207
'Cause it will at least give her
a candidate to eliminate.

233
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:34,674
He's got a point.

234
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,674
My father's
medical records,

235
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,540
pictures, last
known whereabouts,

236
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:41,640
even a connection
to the golf course.

237
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,507
Also my phone number.

238
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:46,941
But don't worry.

239
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:48,573
If I don't hear from you,

240
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
you'll hear from me.

241
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:57,507
Pushy.

242
00:08:57,573 --> 00:09:00,207
Well, maybe he discovered
that being pushy

243
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:01,840
is how you get cops
to pay attention.

244
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:03,540
What are you hawking
at me for?

245
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:06,974
The Chinese, the plane crash,
that's geopolitics.

246
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,041
This is murder.

247
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:10,907
Will you help?

248
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:15,941
Well, you know, I guess
if you're really asking me

249
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:17,740
I guess I could, you know,

250
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,241
budget with my boss
to make it

251
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,774
look like
it was attached

252
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,074
to the Chinese
plane crash thing.

253
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:28,640
We've made some progress
on the mystery passenger.

254
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:30,107
Fill me in.

255
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:32,640
Nasal ridges indicate
she was a Caucasoid female,

256
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:34,241
approximately five feet,
ten inches.

257
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:35,941
Epiphysial fusion
puts her age

258
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:38,007
somewhere between 20 to 25.

259
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:39,308
I have a theory.

260
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:40,473
Femme fatale
assassin.

261
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,141
Unregistered flight attendant.

262
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,074
Young beautiful girl,

263
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:45,941
doesn't appear
on the in-flight manifest,

264
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:47,408
group of high-powered

265
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:48,408
politicos...

266
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:49,440
Oh...

267
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:51,007
What? What?

268
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:52,573
Someone on
that flight

269
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,473
might have been doing
his daughter

270
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,308
or his girlfriend a favor.

271
00:09:54,374 --> 00:09:55,640
You're so sweet, honey.

272
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:57,041
You really are.

273
00:09:57,107 --> 00:09:58,540
Oh!

274
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:01,573
You think she was
the in-flight <i>entertainment.</i>

275
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:05,540
Yeah. Anything you want
to tell us

276
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:07,107
about the bone bits
you care about?

277
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:10,440
Supra-orbital margin
is rounded,

278
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:12,573
suggesting a male.

279
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,473
Yes, and there's signs
of osteophitic lipping

280
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,308
or polish on this piece
of vertebrae.

281
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:17,408
Arthritis?

282
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:18,840
So, middle-aged guy.

283
00:10:18,907 --> 00:10:20,540
Weathering and
discoloration

284
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:22,740
suggests these bones
have been out there

285
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:23,674
for approximately five years.

286
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:27,807
I'm going to ask you guys
to help me on this.

287
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:29,907
You mean, after
the communist thing?

288
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:31,740
No, immediately.

289
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,874
I'm in.

290
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:34,473
You want us to defy Dr. Goodman?

291
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,740
I'm in.

292
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:36,774
Not defy, per se.

293
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,174
Do both jobs, but...

294
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:40,174
but keep one a secret.

295
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:41,174
I'm in.

296
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,308
We get it. You're a rebel.

297
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:45,207
Zack, I need you
to analyze the cuts on the bone.

298
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:47,607
I was kind of hoping
to keep my job.

299
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:51,473
There's not enough skull here
for me to do a reconstruction.

300
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,174
If I give you a picture,

301
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:54,840
you could tell me if the skull
piece doesn't match?

302
00:10:54,907 --> 00:10:56,941
I could construct a schematic
and see if the shard

303
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:58,408
fit the general

304
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:00,540
shape of the skull...
if I had a picture.

305
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:02,607
Has anyone noticed that I was
the first to offer help

306
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:03,974
and apparently,
I'm useless?

307
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,141
Not true.

308
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,640
You're the one
that's going

309
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,974
to keep Goodman
from finding out.

310
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,874
I'm in.

311
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:11,907
CAINE:
<i>So the bone fragments</i>

312
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:13,907
are the same sex and age
as my father.

313
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:14,907
Yes.

314
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,408
Thank you.

315
00:11:16,473 --> 00:11:18,408
It's a long way
from conclusive.

316
00:11:18,473 --> 00:11:19,907
Yeah, I know

317
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:21,740
at times like these
not to get hopeful.

318
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:22,774
But, on the other hand,
you've got to have hope.

319
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,374
Even after five years?

320
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,174
People are found after decades,
Dr. Brennan. After centuries.

321
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:29,774
You've done some of the finding.

322
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
Booth says you've
made a living

323
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:33,907
off of the disappearance
of your father.

324
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:37,207
About six months
after my father disappeared,

325
00:11:37,274 --> 00:11:40,074
I found out nobody
was actually looking for him.

326
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:41,941
Next thing I knew,
I was an expert

327
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:43,674
in motivating the police--
victims' rights.

328
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,174
Becoming well-known
is a byproduct

329
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:48,241
of my search for my father,
not the goal of my search.

330
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,041
You should understand
my motivation

331
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:51,274
better than most people
in law enforcement.

332
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:52,241
I'm not really

333
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:53,774
interested in bonding

334
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,041
over the loss
of my parents.

335
00:11:57,408 --> 00:11:59,241
Booth is looking over
your file now.

336
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:01,141
I wasn't looking for <i>his</i> help.

337
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:03,274
We work together.

338
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:05,141
Booth knows that
the bone fragments

339
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:06,707
are evidence
of foul play.

340
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:07,974
That's all the
motivation he needed.

341
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,341
You didn't have to lean on him?

342
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:13,907
Not at all.

343
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:17,341
If you say so.

344
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:32,141
ADDY:
One of the bone fragments

345
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:33,974
has distinctive
ridge-mark indentations.

346
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,341
A knife mark.

347
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:37,007
Yes. Specifically,
a carving knife.

348
00:12:37,074 --> 00:12:38,374
Well, what about
the other ones?

349
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,107
The jagged marks?

350
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:41,707
Some kind
of machine blade.

351
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:46,141
What? Like a... a jigsaw
or a chain saw?

352
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,674
( <i>Goodman clears throat</i> )

353
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,941
Are you suggesting
one of the

354
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:50,308
Chinese diplomats was wielding

355
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:51,507
a chain saw?

356
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:54,540
Uh... good one, sir.

357
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,007
Very droll.

358
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:58,941
Zack knows much more
about this than I do,

359
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,408
but we weren't discussing
a literal chain saw cut,

360
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,007
but, rather, the pattern
it leaves

361
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,408
on the bone.

362
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:05,674
Right?

363
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,840
Zack?

364
00:13:06,907 --> 00:13:08,041
You know, blades move

365
00:13:08,107 --> 00:13:09,440
in several distinctive ways.

366
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:11,308
Several distinctive ways.

367
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,341
Circular, elliptical,
segmented

368
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:15,440
Chain saws are designed to cut
soft materials at high speed.

369
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:16,874
When cutting hard materials
like bone, they create

370
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:18,041
wave-ridge walls
by the action of the blade.

371
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:19,740
This pattern's too organized.
Too linear.

372
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:21,408
HODGINS:
Therefore,
no <i>Chinese Chain Saw</i>

373
00:13:21,473 --> 00:13:22,573
<i>Massacre</i> scenario.

374
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:25,840
Yes. Fascinating.

375
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:27,440
What has it go to do with
the victims of the plane crash?

376
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,341
We not only

377
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,674
have to reassemble
each of the plane crash victims,

378
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,640
but figure out how their remains
were scattered.

379
00:13:33,707 --> 00:13:35,573
Not by being cut up.
That's for sure.

380
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,341
Now we've eliminated blades.

381
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:45,207
Never freeze
on me again.

382
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:47,408
I find Dr. Goodman scary.

383
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:49,473
Well, I'm never trusting
any of us again.

384
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,308
We're that good at lying, huh?

385
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:54,440
We're going to do much better.

386
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:01,440
<i>Well, you know, I have to admit</i>

386
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,308
Jesse Caine's file on his father

387
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:05,607
is both well-organized
and complete.

388
00:14:05,674 --> 00:14:07,007
Yep. The main

389
00:14:07,074 --> 00:14:08,807
suspect is his
father's girlfriend.

390
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:10,840
Karen Anderson.

391
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:12,241
No alibi.

392
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:14,341
And, since they were
living together

393
00:14:14,408 --> 00:14:15,774
at the time
of the disappearance,

394
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,107
she remains in the house,

395
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:18,807
and has access
to their joint accounts.

396
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:20,674
How much money
are we talking about?

397
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,874
Max Caine, he was
a stockbroker.

398
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:24,408
He was worth millions.

399
00:14:24,473 --> 00:14:26,074
But, you know,
after seven years missing,

400
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,840
the courts will declare him
officially dead.

401
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:31,007
By that time, she could have
siphoned out most of the money.

402
00:14:31,074 --> 00:14:33,241
So I say we go
visit Miss Anderson,

403
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:35,974
and we'll know pretty fast
if she's a suspect.

404
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,408
How?

405
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:38,607
How?

406
00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:40,573
Subtle psychological indicators.

407
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,041
I looked those up
on the Internet.

408
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:43,473
Body language, sweat,

409
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,041
tonal quality,

410
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:46,141
shifty eyes.

411
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:47,740
Hey, you
know what?

412
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,174
I don't go poking around
your bone stuff, okay?

413
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:51,241
Just leave the human stuff
to me.

414
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,007
<i>Why has Max's disappearance</i>

415
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:55,107
become a matter for the FBI?

416
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:57,807
Max's disappearance
is not an FBI matter.

417
00:14:57,874 --> 00:14:59,374
You're an FBI agent.

418
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,007
Human remains
were found

419
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,374
in the course
of a federal investigation.

420
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,874
Agent Booth is tasked

421
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:05,907
with the job of
identifying them.

422
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:08,807
I'd like to eliminate Max Caine
as a possibility, and just

423
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,141
move on altogether.

424
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:11,674
So this is a
pro forma interview?

425
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,041
Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

426
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:15,607
Because I know
Max's son Jesse

427
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:17,640
accuses me of Max's murder.

428
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:20,041
Why do you think
he suspects you?

429
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:22,007
Because of the age difference
between me and Max.

430
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:23,007
Because I'm still living

431
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:24,640
in the house.

432
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,607
Because, after five years,
I dared to fall in love

433
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:28,374
with someone new.
And who knows?

434
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,241
Well, some people find it harder
than others

435
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:31,774
to get over the loss
of a loved one.

436
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,207
Bones? Psst!

437
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:34,007
What?

438
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:35,341
Jesse got to you,

439
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:36,274
didn't he?

440
00:15:37,274 --> 00:15:38,507
The dimples

441
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,640
and the sad smile
and melancholy,

442
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,440
on a mission
to find his beloved father.

443
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:44,374
You know all that.

444
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,207
Jesse didn't love his father?

445
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:49,041
Max and Jesse didn't speak
for the two years

446
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:50,707
before Max
disappeared.

447
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:52,674
And that was before
I came into his life.

448
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,807
What do you think
caused the rift?

449
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:54,774
Max cut

450
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,107
Jesse off financially.

451
00:15:56,174 --> 00:15:58,440
Max thought Jesse
was lazy,

452
00:15:58,507 --> 00:16:00,374
running around New York
doing nothing

453
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,640
with his life and,
well, Jesse was furious.

454
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:14,577
The hack marks
were caused

455
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:16,411
by a Heidel
carving knife.

456
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,077
And the osteological
profile suggests evidence

457
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,611
of postmortem freezing.

458
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,511
Max Caine disappeared midwinter.

459
00:16:21,577 --> 00:16:23,377
What about the jagged cut marks?

460
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:25,678
This is the part
that makes me queasy.

461
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:29,144
The victim was frozen,
dismembered,

462
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,110
and fed into a wood chipper.

463
00:16:31,177 --> 00:16:32,877
Then spread over a golf course.

464
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:34,544
Either talk
loudly enough

465
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:36,943
so I can hear all the way,
or whisper so I can't.

466
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,778
Maybe, if we told Goodman
what we know,

467
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:40,244
he would authorize
a change in priorities.

468
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:41,744
Or he'd

469
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,810
suspend us all
for defying him.

470
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,778
Angela's right.

471
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:48,377
So we're going to drop this,
and get back

472
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:50,577
to what Dr. Goodman told us
to do in the first place?

473
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:53,377
No. We are going
to keep doing what we're doing

474
00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:55,843
behind Goodman's back.

475
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,778
That's the spirit!

476
00:17:02,577 --> 00:17:04,311
Yeah. It's true.

477
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:06,010
My father cut me off
financially.

478
00:17:06,077 --> 00:17:07,843
So I take it that means
you talked to Karen.

479
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,644
Anything else
you failed to mention?

480
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:10,977
Why didn't
you tell us?

481
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:12,477
I know I didn't
kill my father,

482
00:17:12,544 --> 00:17:14,144
so I'd rather you didn't
waste your time

483
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,511
on that line of investigation.

484
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,577
Too late. So what happened

485
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:19,377
between you and your father?
Hmm?

486
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:21,044
About five years ago,
I was enrolled at NYU.

487
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,511
But all I really did
was go clubbing

488
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:23,977
and have a good time.

489
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,244
My father was right
to cut me off.

490
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,544
I was a disappointment to him.

491
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:27,910
But if only he

492
00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:29,377
could see you now.

493
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:31,177
I like to think
he <i>can</i> see me now.

494
00:17:31,244 --> 00:17:32,077
Your father is dead.

495
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:33,444
A dead person

496
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,544
can't see anything.

497
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:36,277
Maybe that's true.

498
00:17:36,344 --> 00:17:37,711
Maybe it isn't.

499
00:17:37,778 --> 00:17:39,110
But, either way,
at least I know

500
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:40,477
my dad would be proud.

501
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:43,044
Bones?

502
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,511
Tell Jesse

503
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:45,744
what happened to the victim.

504
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,077
Really?

505
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:48,444
What?

506
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:49,778
It's just
that usually

507
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:50,977
you tell me <i>not</i> to tell people.

508
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:52,678
Well, it can't
be worse than

509
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:53,477
some of the things
that I've imagined.

510
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,810
The victim was frozen,
dismembered,

511
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:58,511
and fed through a wood chipper.

512
00:18:01,744 --> 00:18:03,611
Bones has
figured out

513
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:05,877
what type of wood chipper
was used, and we're trying to trace it

514
00:18:05,943 --> 00:18:08,678
to the manufacturer and see if
one was sold in Virginia Beach.

515
00:18:08,744 --> 00:18:13,977
I can't believe someone
would do that to my dad.

516
00:18:14,044 --> 00:18:17,511
We haven't positively identified
the victim as your father.

517
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:19,311
I have our artists
comparing

518
00:18:19,377 --> 00:18:21,511
the skull fragment
to pictures of your dad.

519
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:25,077
Could I see the bone fragments?

520
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:38,377
This is all of him?

521
00:18:38,444 --> 00:18:39,778
Yes.

522
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:41,277
I mean,

523
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:45,044
it's all of somebody.

524
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,744
He was a big man, my dad.

525
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,511
It's hard
to believe

526
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:51,277
that this is all
that's left of him.

527
00:18:51,344 --> 00:18:53,678
How can you
get anything

528
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:55,744
from three small bits of bone?

529
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,877
It's more than
a lot of people get.

530
00:19:01,877 --> 00:19:05,344
I know where my dad was
right before he disappeared.

531
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,943
I know my dad
met with a client

532
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,377
at the North Star Grill
in Virginia Beach.

533
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:16,744
I know he had meat loaf.

534
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:24,544
I know he was supposed
to meet Karen at the pier,

535
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:27,244
but he didn't show up.

536
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:30,077
I know she waited

537
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:35,010
two days before
reporting him gone.

538
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:45,910
I have a good timeline,

539
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,577
and I have three small bits
of bone.

540
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:53,210
You don't have any
of those things,

541
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,810
and I realize how hopeless
you must feel.

542
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,678
Come with me.

543
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:12,477
This is all you have?

544
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,611
Yes. You were right
about how little it is.

545
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:17,044
No, I mean this is simply

546
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,977
your copy of the official file.

547
00:20:19,044 --> 00:20:21,611
Yes. What else
would there be?

548
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,144
You never tried to hire
any private investigators?

549
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,177
Did any poking around

550
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:26,511
by yourself?

551
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:28,411
Well, I'm pretty new
at field work.

552
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,910
Mostly been a lab rat
my whole career.

553
00:20:30,977 --> 00:20:32,843
Plus, I trusted

554
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,611
the authorities would
do what the could.

555
00:20:34,678 --> 00:20:36,444
The authorities
have rooms filled

556
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:37,644
with files like these.

557
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:38,943
Warehouses.

558
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,544
I'm the authorities.

559
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:43,010
Booth is
the authorities.

560
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:44,810
Did you ever show this file
to Booth?

561
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:48,344
No. No.

562
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:58,311
This is where I work.

563
00:20:58,377 --> 00:21:01,010
Uh... Which
is my cue.

564
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:02,711
Um... uh.. um...

565
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:03,943
Angela, come in.

566
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,010
This is Jesse Caine.

567
00:21:06,077 --> 00:21:07,977
Hello.
Hi.

568
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:09,110
Hi. Angela

569
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:10,843
Montenegro.

570
00:21:10,877 --> 00:21:12,910
What's that?

571
00:21:12,977 --> 00:21:15,044
Uh.. uh... nothing
that can't wait.

572
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,843
Is it about my father?

573
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,277
You know, as far as I know,
which is quite far,

574
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:22,711
believe me, no one

575
00:21:22,778 --> 00:21:24,411
has tried to
kiss Brennan
in this office

576
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:26,244
and lived to tell about it.
Angela.

577
00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:29,210
Would one of you
please tell me

578
00:21:29,277 --> 00:21:30,644
what that piece
of paper is?

579
00:21:31,877 --> 00:21:34,010
It's a, uh...
It's a schematic

580
00:21:34,077 --> 00:21:36,544
comparing a skull fragment
we found on the golf course

581
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:38,611
to pictures of your father.
And?

582
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:40,778
It doesn't <i>not</i> match
your father.

583
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:42,411
So it <i>could</i> be him?

584
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:45,477
Yeah. There's
a pretty good chance.

585
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,477
I knew it.

586
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:55,644
Are you hooking
up later?

587
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:57,110
I didn't arrange anything.

588
00:21:57,177 --> 00:21:58,311
Why not?

589
00:21:58,377 --> 00:21:59,910
Because you were
right there, hovering.

590
00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:02,444
I was not. I was...
being your wingman.

591
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:04,077
What's that?

592
00:22:04,144 --> 00:22:06,577
I was rendering assistance
and enabling where needed.

593
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:09,177
Booth thinks he
might be a suspect.

594
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,444
Oh, now you're just looking for
excuses not to get involved.

595
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:15,411
Plane crash victim number
four, Captain Jacob Howard.

596
00:22:15,477 --> 00:22:17,277
Pilot, age 47.

597
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,077
Height five foot six.

598
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:21,778
Weight approximately
167 pounds.

599
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:23,778
Overlay
the photograph.

600
00:22:28,678 --> 00:22:30,977
Frontal zygomatic
sutures line up.

601
00:22:31,044 --> 00:22:33,244
Cranial menengies are in synch.

602
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:35,511
Excellent. That's
one more off our list.

603
00:22:35,577 --> 00:22:37,943
Victim number five,
Shenru Fong.

604
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,144
Age 56.

605
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,778
Height five foot six,
weight approximately 140 pounds.

606
00:22:43,843 --> 00:22:45,244
Yes, yes,
that's terrific.

607
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:46,778
Except, we knew all
of these people

608
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:48,177
were on the plane.

609
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:49,711
What the State Department
wants to know

610
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:52,210
is the identity
of our mystery woman.

611
00:22:52,277 --> 00:22:55,444
I hope I can count on your full
energies on this, Dr. Brennan.

612
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:59,210
If I could be
completely honest, sir...

613
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,943
Toxicology reports came back
from all six victims.

614
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,678
Pilot and copilot were clean.

615
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:05,943
Our two Chinese nationals
had elevated levels

616
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,444
of alcohol and Sildenafil,
more commonly known

617
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:11,077
as Viagra, and our
mystery girl showed traces

618
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:13,010
of alcohol and cocaine.

619
00:23:13,077 --> 00:23:15,644
So... will the cover-up
start now,

620
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:17,877
or somewhere between here
and the State Department?

621
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:19,611
You were saying about
being completely honest?

622
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:20,877
Yes, sir.

623
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:22,477
Regarding the bone shards...

624
00:23:22,544 --> 00:23:23,877
Ah, the prostitute was
six inches taller

625
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:25,477
than anyone else
on the flight,

626
00:23:25,544 --> 00:23:27,477
and she had occupational
stress markers.

627
00:23:27,544 --> 00:23:30,110
Let's not call her a
prostitute yet, Mr. Addy.

628
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,210
What occupational markers?

629
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,177
Ah, it's a foot thing.

630
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:34,877
She was a fetishist?

631
00:23:34,943 --> 00:23:38,744
Both her cuboid and medial
malleolus show signs of wear.

632
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,678
You can relax,
Dr. Goodman.

633
00:23:40,744 --> 00:23:42,544
She wore extremely high
stiletto heels.

634
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:46,377
I reconstructed her face
from the partial skull.

635
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:49,910
She was hot.

636
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:51,644
What's our next move?

637
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:54,778
I suggest we
try to match

638
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:56,778
this reconstruction
with escort ads

639
00:23:56,843 --> 00:23:58,411
both Internet and print
in the DC area.

640
00:23:58,477 --> 00:23:59,377
Oh, I'll do that.

641
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,511
Was that overly enthusiastic?

642
00:24:02,577 --> 00:24:06,110
Thank you for the update.

643
00:24:06,177 --> 00:24:09,977
This case continues to be
your top priority, correct?

644
00:24:10,044 --> 00:24:10,943
If I could suggest...

645
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,344
Dr. Brennan

646
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:14,110
has been very clear
about your priorities on this,

647
00:24:14,177 --> 00:24:15,277
sir.

648
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,511
What's that?

649
00:24:23,577 --> 00:24:27,110
The only Black Mantis
wood chipper in Virginia Beach.

650
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:29,210
I subpoenaed the records
fromhe manufacturer

651
00:24:29,277 --> 00:24:30,577
and traced it back
to the town equipment yard.

652
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:32,010
My people, they, uh,
couldn't find

653
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:33,644
any blood residue.

654
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:34,778
That makes sense,
if the corpse was frozen.

655
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:36,010
Yeah,
not to mention

656
00:24:36,077 --> 00:24:37,110
this puppy here has ground up

657
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:38,611
about 10,000 trees, you know.

658
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:39,744
Hey, I figure you
can match the blades

659
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,311
to the cuts on the bones, right?

660
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:44,177
Or do something
I haven't thought of

661
00:24:44,244 --> 00:24:46,010
much more, you know,
confusing and scientific.

662
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:48,144
Booth. Nobody told me you
were working this case.

663
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,644
Only two people
have had access to this machine

664
00:24:50,711 --> 00:24:52,910
in the past seven years--
city maintenance foreman and

665
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:55,010
a maintenance worker
by the name of Ray Sparks.

666
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,711
Sparks has got ejected,
so, what do you say, huh?

667
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:58,778
You want to come with me
to go talk to him?

668
00:24:58,843 --> 00:25:01,311
Told you.
It's a guy thing.

669
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:03,477
Um... Yes, I'd
like to come.

670
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,977
All right,
here we go.

671
00:25:05,044 --> 00:25:06,678
Let Angela do
the escort matching.

672
00:25:06,744 --> 00:25:08,411
I have something a lot more
interesting for you and Hodgins.

673
00:25:08,477 --> 00:25:10,244
What's more interesting
than escorts?

674
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:11,977
I need you guys
to run a dispersal

675
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,778
pattern test on the chipper.
Using what medium?

676
00:25:13,843 --> 00:25:15,477
Assume the victim
was frozen solid

677
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:16,778
when he was fed
into the chipper.

678
00:25:16,843 --> 00:25:18,377
No way!

679
00:25:18,444 --> 00:25:19,810
The correct response
would be, "Yes way."

680
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:21,311
Oh. Yes way.

681
00:25:28,144 --> 00:25:29,810
You ignore Zach
and make him think

682
00:25:29,877 --> 00:25:31,611
you've got
some special bond.

683
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:33,877
Yeah, but it works, doesn't it?
I'm happy, he's happy.

684
00:25:33,943 --> 00:25:35,277
It's not the truth.

685
00:25:35,344 --> 00:25:37,010
But it works.

686
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,678
Ray Sparks, I'd like to have
a word with you, please.

687
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:42,077
Zach wants to fit into the real
world more than anything.

688
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,778
You're not helping.

689
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:48,077
FBI. Special Agent Booth.

690
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:49,477
He went around the back.

691
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:54,644
No, no. The other
way, Bones.

692
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,244
FBI. Freeze.

693
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:06,810
Ray Sparks.

694
00:26:06,877 --> 00:26:08,311
Hey, I didn't
do nothing wrong!

695
00:26:08,377 --> 00:26:09,744
Ah, I feel like
kicking him.

696
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,843
That's normal after a pursuit.
We try not to do that.

697
00:26:31,977 --> 00:26:33,144
Too many people.

698
00:26:33,211 --> 00:26:34,377
How we going
to keep this

699
00:26:34,444 --> 00:26:35,977
from Dr. Goodman?

700
00:26:36,044 --> 00:26:36,777
Ah, he's having lunch with the
president of Harvard.

701
00:26:36,843 --> 00:26:38,544
What's going on?

702
00:26:38,611 --> 00:26:41,344
Why is every <i>guy</i>
from the Jeffersonian out here?

703
00:26:41,411 --> 00:26:42,810
They're scientists.

704
00:26:42,877 --> 00:26:44,244
This is a fascinating
scientific inquiry.

705
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,277
Oh, my God.

706
00:26:46,344 --> 00:26:48,177
They're all out here
because you're

707
00:26:48,244 --> 00:26:49,644
going to feed something
through this wood chipper.

708
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:52,810
Not just something.

709
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,110
A frozen pig.

710
00:26:55,477 --> 00:26:57,477
Ah... Ugh.

711
00:26:57,544 --> 00:27:00,411
The morphology of pig bones is
almost identical to human bone.

712
00:27:00,477 --> 00:27:02,877
By feeding the pig through the
wood chipper, we'll be able

713
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:04,977
to determine the dispersal
pattern of the fragments.

714
00:27:05,044 --> 00:27:06,743
By comparing the
pulverized pig's remains

715
00:27:06,777 --> 00:27:08,010
to the
fragments we found

716
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:09,611
at the golf course,
we'll be able to tell

717
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:10,910
if this is the
actual wood chipper

718
00:27:10,977 --> 00:27:11,710
the victim was fed through.

719
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:11,877
Liars.

720
00:27:13,177 --> 00:27:15,044
You just want to see
what happens when you toss

721
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,944
a frozen pig
into a wood chipper.

722
00:27:19,877 --> 00:27:22,077
And here we go.

723
00:27:23,444 --> 00:27:24,477
Ready?

724
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,743
One!

725
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,444
Two!

726
00:27:28,377 --> 00:27:29,010
Three!

727
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,344
Yeah!

728
00:28:02,044 --> 00:28:03,777
Okay, what have we got here?

729
00:28:03,843 --> 00:28:06,077
Break and enter, assault,
drunk, disorderly. Wow.

730
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,110
Yeah. I been keeping
myself out of trouble

731
00:28:08,177 --> 00:28:09,910
for the past
four years now.

732
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:11,743
How long you been a maintenance
worker for the city

733
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,743
of Virginia Beach?

734
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,044
Since '92.

735
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,177
You ever meet a guy
by the name

736
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:16,177
of Max Caine?

737
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:17,110
No.

738
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:18,044
Karen Anderson?

739
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,777
Yeah, I know her.

740
00:28:19,843 --> 00:28:20,710
How?

741
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:23,344
She bartends at the golf course.

742
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:26,544
You don't strike me
as a golfer, Ray.

743
00:28:29,411 --> 00:28:33,244
City land is right across
the creek from the course

744
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,110
and I, I go to the clubhouse

745
00:28:35,177 --> 00:28:37,077
a couple times a week
to have lunch.

746
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:39,110
Hey, how'd you pay for that
house you live in, Ray?

747
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:41,077
I mean, that's,
that's pretty nice.

748
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:43,377
You got a hard time sticking
to one topic, huh?

749
00:28:43,444 --> 00:28:44,777
My mom

750
00:28:44,843 --> 00:28:46,678
left me the house.

751
00:28:46,743 --> 00:28:48,344
She left it to me
and my brother Frank.

752
00:28:48,411 --> 00:28:50,010
Five years ago.

753
00:28:50,077 --> 00:28:52,044
Five years ago Max Caine
disappeared-- Karen Anderson's

754
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,910
boyfriend--
so, you know,

755
00:28:53,977 --> 00:28:55,843
you can see how my suspicions
might be a little aroused.

756
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:59,110
Yeah, but the thing is...

757
00:28:59,177 --> 00:29:02,144
I didn't live in Virginia Beach
five years ago.

758
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:04,544
I was in

759
00:29:04,611 --> 00:29:08,344
Southampton
Correctional Center...

760
00:29:08,411 --> 00:29:11,743
doing six months for skipping
out on a DUI warrant.

761
00:29:13,177 --> 00:29:14,877
Guess I don't

762
00:29:14,944 --> 00:29:16,743
need a lawyer, right?

763
00:29:19,477 --> 00:29:22,077
There's no way that
wood chipper experiment

764
00:29:22,144 --> 00:29:24,511
was connected to the plane
crash at the golf course.

765
00:29:24,578 --> 00:29:25,544
Look...
- Don't say anything.

766
00:29:25,611 --> 00:29:26,877
Just listen.

767
00:29:26,944 --> 00:29:29,211
Your primary job
is to do as I say.

768
00:29:29,277 --> 00:29:31,877
Failing that,
your job is to fool me.

769
00:29:31,944 --> 00:29:33,044
You failed
to fool me,

770
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,611
Dr. Hodgins.

771
00:29:34,678 --> 00:29:37,344
I'd have fooled you if you'd
gone to lunch as planned.

772
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:40,044
I'll find some administrative
ways to punish you. Parking,

773
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,977
dining room privileges,
budget reviews, that sort

774
00:29:42,044 --> 00:29:42,810
of thing, but if
it happens again...

775
00:29:42,877 --> 00:29:43,877
I got it.

776
00:29:43,944 --> 00:29:46,311
No. You don't.

777
00:29:48,544 --> 00:29:51,877
You think I'm
a kind and fair man.

778
00:29:51,944 --> 00:29:54,010
Egoless, balanced,

779
00:29:54,077 --> 00:29:56,411
ruled by
intelligent reflection.

780
00:29:56,477 --> 00:29:57,743
But I <i>do</i> have an ego.

781
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:03,244
I can be vindictive and petty.

782
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:05,211
I will take you down,

783
00:30:05,277 --> 00:30:07,110
even if it means
striking at you

784
00:30:07,177 --> 00:30:09,177
through
your friends and coworkers.

785
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,177
Now you understand.

786
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:22,411
Ray Sparks was in jail
when your father disappeared.

787
00:30:22,477 --> 00:30:24,110
He might have acted
as a go-between,

788
00:30:24,177 --> 00:30:25,843
put Karen in touch
with the hit man.

789
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,010
One of the things
that you lecture about

790
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:29,777
is that the simplest theory
usually turns out to be true.

791
00:30:29,843 --> 00:30:31,777
Usually, not always.

792
00:30:31,843 --> 00:30:34,110
What's the simplest theory
in this case?

793
00:30:34,177 --> 00:30:35,843
Disowned son realizes
that his father

794
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,877
may remarry,
lose his inheritance...

795
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:38,010
Booth--

796
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:39,611
are you accusing Jesse
of murdering

797
00:30:39,678 --> 00:30:41,743
his own father for money?

798
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,411
You ever hear of the
Menndez brothers?
- I came to you about

799
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,277
the bone shard,
saying it might be Dad.

800
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,144
Hey, look, your father
is declared dead,

801
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:49,678
you get your inheritance before
Karen Anderson spends it all.

802
00:30:49,743 --> 00:30:52,044
Oh, you don't seem too upset
about the accusation.

803
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,843
Agent Booth, for four years

804
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,644
I've been making enemies
with law enforcement.

805
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,010
Attacking me is
a pretty typical response.

806
00:30:57,077 --> 00:30:58,810
Booth,
is this one

807
00:30:58,877 --> 00:31:00,177
of those times
when you just

808
00:31:00,244 --> 00:31:02,010
poke and prod
to get reactions?

809
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:03,777
Now, listen, Bones, we have
to treat him like a suspect.

810
00:31:03,843 --> 00:31:06,411
He is <i>not</i> a member of the team.

811
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:07,578
Look.

812
00:31:07,644 --> 00:31:09,544
I'm like you.

813
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:10,977
I need the truth.

814
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:16,977
I have to get back

815
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,044
to the lab.

816
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:23,077
<i>Satellite imagery</i>

817
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:24,177
of the golf course.

818
00:31:24,244 --> 00:31:25,710
These three dots show

819
00:31:25,777 --> 00:31:28,177
where the bone
fragments were found.

820
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:31,710
Can you show me the results
of the wood chipper test?

821
00:31:31,777 --> 00:31:33,743
The "V" shape indicates
the maximum distance

822
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,411
from the point of origin

823
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,511
a bone fragment could have
traveled given similar

824
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:39,177
wind speeds and
ambient temperatures.

825
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:41,144
Okay, and remove
the plane crash.

826
00:31:41,211 --> 00:31:42,444
It's irrelevant to this.

827
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:45,211
The question is...

828
00:31:45,277 --> 00:31:47,910
in order to use the guys'
pig-grinding experiment,

829
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:49,944
where do we place
the wood chipper?

830
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,678
I bet the murderer...

831
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:54,611
aimed the wood chipper
over the stream.

832
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:56,544
So the evidence
would wash away.

833
00:31:56,611 --> 00:31:58,110
Mm-hmm.

834
00:31:58,177 --> 00:31:59,344
What's that?

835
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:01,244
That is...

836
00:32:01,311 --> 00:32:03,743
a small access road
for maintenance vehicles.

837
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,611
Try putting the
wood chipper there.

838
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:07,511
Mm-mm!

839
00:32:07,578 --> 00:32:09,578
Sweet smell of success.

840
00:32:09,644 --> 00:32:11,678
We should see if we can find
any more bone fragments

841
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:13,244
here and here.

842
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:17,177
Are we any closer to identifying
our mystery woman?

843
00:32:17,244 --> 00:32:20,344
Um... I'm not...
I'm not certain.

844
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:22,211
Brennan is still
waiting for an update.

845
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:24,843
I saw you come in, sir,
and I have an update.

846
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,311
I have a list
of possible matches

847
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,144
on our geisha in the sky.

848
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:29,710
She is Caucasian.

849
00:32:29,777 --> 00:32:30,977
Our mystery woman
is definitely Caucasian.

850
00:32:31,044 --> 00:32:32,411
We've sent a list

851
00:32:32,477 --> 00:32:33,843
to the FBI
and they're checking it out.

852
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,110
Ah. Well, in that case,
you might want to

853
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:39,053
turn your attention back to the bone fragments.

854
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:57,174
I came for the file
on my parents.

855
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,574
You think I might
have killed my father.

856
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,040
No, it's just...

857
00:33:11,608 --> 00:33:14,541
I asked the wrong
person to help me, and...

858
00:33:14,608 --> 00:33:16,441
What?

859
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:19,508
I just don't think it's
healthy, what you're doing.

860
00:33:19,574 --> 00:33:22,640
Putting your whole
life into this.

861
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:24,940
And I suppose
the way you're doing it,

862
00:33:25,007 --> 00:33:26,907
putting nothing into solving

863
00:33:26,974 --> 00:33:28,508
the disappearance
of your parents,

864
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:30,541
I suppose that's healthy?

865
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:38,740
We're searching the golf course
for more bone fragments.

866
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:36,608
Amazingly, we found
a piece of finger

867
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,007
with the nail
still attached.

868
00:34:38,074 --> 00:34:39,441
And underneath
that nail...

869
00:34:39,507 --> 00:34:41,074
Polyurethane.
The tough stuff.

870
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,107
The victim must have been
scraping at something

871
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:44,541
before he died.

872
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,608
Yeah, I can't identify
this bone anomaly.

873
00:34:46,674 --> 00:34:50,107
It's full of osteoids.
Thick.

874
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:52,241
Maybe part of the mandible.

875
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:54,840
Human. Something odd
with the cell structure.

876
00:34:54,907 --> 00:34:58,140
Wood chipper wouldn't do damage
at the cellular level.

877
00:34:58,207 --> 00:35:00,274
It's a nonmalignant
bone tumor.

878
00:35:00,341 --> 00:35:02,107
I need the most
recent bone scans

879
00:35:02,174 --> 00:35:03,773
from Max Caine's
medical records.

880
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,907
Hodgins.

881
00:35:04,974 --> 00:35:07,840
It's Booth.

882
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:10,040
The locals just arrested Jesse Caine

883
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:11,574
for attacking
Karen Anderson.rs

884
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:13,174
<i>Local sheriff says</i>

885
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:15,474
that Jesse showed up at Karen's
house to confront her.

886
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:18,574
He was ranting about
the murder of his dad.

887
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:20,708
Eddie tried to throw him out,
but the two of them,

888
00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:22,374
they exchanged punches...
The fact that Jesse

889
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:24,040
confronted him doesn't mean
that he isn't the killer.

890
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:26,207
I know.
- You know what, he might have done this

891
00:35:26,274 --> 00:35:28,307
just to make us think
that he was angry at her.

892
00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:30,174
All right, he's smart.

893
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:32,940
No poking and prodding-- do you
think Jesse murdered his father?

894
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:35,274
No, Bones, all I'm saying
is we get into these things,

895
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,807
we look into murders,
we can't let our heartstrings

896
00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:38,241
get all plucked, okay?

897
00:35:38,307 --> 00:35:39,740
We got to poke
at people's wounds,

898
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:40,641
we're gonna make
them bleed a little.

899
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:41,541
We got to make them

900
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:43,107
tell us things

901
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,907
that they normally
wouldn't want to tell us.

902
00:35:44,974 --> 00:35:46,407
We got to be willing
to be hard on them,

903
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:48,107
is what I'm trying
to say-- even when we know

904
00:35:48,174 --> 00:35:49,374
that we're
no different than them.

905
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:51,107
You didn't answer my question.

906
00:35:51,174 --> 00:35:52,974
Well, I have a opinion.
You want to know?

907
00:35:54,407 --> 00:35:56,074
If I had to bet,
I'd say he didn't do it.

908
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,574
Me, too.

909
00:35:57,641 --> 00:35:58,974
I'm going off my gut.

910
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,674
I mean, what's persuading you?

911
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,241
The bone fragments
at the golf course,

912
00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:05,040
they didn't come from Max Caine.

913
00:36:05,107 --> 00:36:07,274
That's great-- you knew that
when you asked me

914
00:36:07,341 --> 00:36:08,974
what I thought.

915
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,307
You testing out
my instincts, Bones?

916
00:36:10,374 --> 00:36:12,341
Poking and prodding.

917
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:14,907
I learned from the best.

918
00:36:14,974 --> 00:36:17,140
Ha. Ha.

919
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:22,140
It's not my dad.

920
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:25,507
No. We don't know
who it is yet.

921
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:27,374
How can you be certain?

922
00:36:27,441 --> 00:36:30,207
We found
a juxtacortical chondroma.

923
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:32,307
A nonmalignant
bone tumor.

924
00:36:32,374 --> 00:36:35,574
Your father's X-ray showed
no sign of such a tumor.

925
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:37,107
Maybe he got it
after the X-rays.

926
00:36:37,174 --> 00:36:38,641
The X-rays were
taken two months

927
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:40,007
before he disappeared.

928
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:41,873
It's a slow growing tumor.

929
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,608
It would have
taken...

930
00:36:43,674 --> 00:36:47,974
years to get to the size
and density that we found.

931
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,907
Look, I'm gonna see if I can
get this assault stuff

932
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,074
to go away
and get you out of here.

933
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:56,708
I'm sorry, Jesse.

934
00:36:56,773 --> 00:36:58,441
For what?

935
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,708
Suspecting that
I killed my own father.

936
00:37:01,773 --> 00:37:05,241
No. I'm not sorry for that.

937
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:11,674
I know what it's like
not to know what happened.

938
00:37:14,074 --> 00:37:17,341
I know how painful that can be.

939
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:20,940
And I'm sorry for you.

940
00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:31,807
If the bones don't belong to
Max Caine, who's our dead guy?

941
00:37:31,873 --> 00:37:33,940
We can send out a description
of the chondroma

942
00:37:34,007 --> 00:37:35,507
to area hospitals,
see if it leads

943
00:37:35,574 --> 00:37:36,574
to any missing
patients.

944
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:36,807
Yeah, we can do that.

945
00:37:38,274 --> 00:37:39,641
List the pertinents.

946
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:41,708
Me? Are you talking
directly to me?

947
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,074
Yeah, you can tell because my
eyes are looking at you,

948
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,507
my mouth is aimed
in your direction.

949
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:47,407
But what about our guy thing?

950
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,241
If you're
speaking to me,

951
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:51,040
then does this mean
I'm not on the team?

952
00:37:51,107 --> 00:37:53,441
Zack, let's concentrate
on the work.

953
00:37:53,507 --> 00:37:55,140
Pertinents.

954
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:56,608
Pertinents.

955
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,307
The victim died,
we don't know how.

956
00:37:58,374 --> 00:37:59,740
He was then frozen,

957
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:00,773
dismembered with
a Heidel carving knife

958
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,374
and pushed through

959
00:38:02,441 --> 00:38:03,674
a Black Mantis 1200
wood chipper.

960
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,007
The exact wood chipper

961
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,907
you fed the frozen
pig through.

962
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:09,807
The exact wood chipper that
Ray Sparks had access to.

963
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:11,341
But Ray Sparks
was in jail.

964
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:12,507
Ray was in jail when
Max Caine disappeared.

965
00:38:12,574 --> 00:38:14,708
But our victim isn't Max Caine.

966
00:38:14,773 --> 00:38:17,407
Well, who else would
Ray Sparks have motive to kill?

967
00:38:17,474 --> 00:38:18,940
The victim
is a middle-aged male...

968
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:20,140
His brother.

969
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:22,074
What motive?

970
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,740
They both inherited the house.

971
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:26,107
Okay, you guys,
you look at the tumor,

972
00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:28,740
and Bones and I will
go talk to Ray. Come on.

973
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,241
While you're there,
look for a large freezer.

974
00:38:31,307 --> 00:38:32,840
Why?

975
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:34,674
The body was frozen.

976
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,040
Polyurethane is a common
insulating liner in freezers.

977
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:38,708
We found it under
the victim's fingernail,

978
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:40,274
like he was scratching
to get out.

979
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:49,007
The detectives who picked up
Sparks say he claimed

980
00:38:49,074 --> 00:38:51,574
his brother was alive and
well last time he saw him.

981
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:53,507
Yeah, well,
he might have been

982
00:38:53,574 --> 00:38:55,608
for about 30 minutes, until
he ran out of air in here.

983
00:38:55,674 --> 00:38:57,174
My guys, they found claw marks

984
00:38:57,241 --> 00:38:58,907
on the inner linings
on both sides.

985
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:02,007
What kind of person
could lock

986
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:06,040
a living human being
in a freezer?

987
00:39:07,074 --> 00:39:09,040
What is that?
- That's a fingernail.

988
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,840
His own brother.

989
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:25,708
Hey.

990
00:39:25,773 --> 00:39:28,074
Booth got you out.

991
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,140
1,200 bucks bail,

992
00:39:30,207 --> 00:39:32,840
and a promise to stay
away from Karen and Eddie.

993
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:34,807
We solved the case.

994
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:38,740
And I'm sorry,
it's not your father.

995
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:44,374
We identified the victim.

996
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:46,807
His name was Frank Sparks.

997
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,641
I'm sorry I couldn't
help you, Jesse.

998
00:39:55,007 --> 00:39:56,574
How do you live with it?

999
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:59,674
What, the disappearance
of my parents?

1000
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,374
The fact that
nobody's looking.

1001
00:40:05,307 --> 00:40:08,407
I never thought about it
that way until I met you.

1002
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:15,207
There's a Zen koan.

1003
00:40:15,274 --> 00:40:18,974
It says that if you want
to find something,

1004
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,907
you have to stop looking.

1005
00:40:24,407 --> 00:40:25,574
I can't do that.

1006
00:40:25,641 --> 00:40:27,574
My dad's watching,

1007
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:30,007
and I don't want
to disappoint him again.

1008
00:40:41,307 --> 00:40:43,574
Even if you don't believe it,

1009
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:47,207
I know your parents are
somewhere proud of what you do.

1010
00:40:49,873 --> 00:40:53,107
It's not rational, but...

1011
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:56,840
I love the thought of that.

1012
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:16,040
Oh.

1013
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:17,574
How'd Jesse take it?

1014
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,507
Like an orphan.

1015
00:41:19,574 --> 00:41:20,907
What?

1016
00:41:20,974 --> 00:41:23,708
That's just...
That's a little poetic for you.

1017
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,307
I didn't mean it that way.

1018
00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:29,840
I want to ask you a favor.

1019
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:31,940
Oh, geez. Another favor.

1020
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:35,074
I wonder if you wouldn't
mind taking a look at this.

1021
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,507
The file on your parents?

1022
00:41:39,574 --> 00:41:42,708
Yeah. Okay.

1023
00:41:42,773 --> 00:41:44,274
You want to think about it?

1024
00:41:44,341 --> 00:41:45,674
It's a pretty big favor.

1025
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,040
You'd do it for me.

1026
00:41:48,107 --> 00:41:50,907
Yeah, I would.

1027
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:54,374
I'm proud you asked, Temperance.

1028
00:41:55,873 --> 00:41:57,641
Uh, Dr. Brennan.

1029
00:41:57,708 --> 00:42:01,007
Uh, Angela wants to know if we
should order anything for you.

1030
00:42:01,074 --> 00:42:03,574
Uh, no, I'm not staying.
Thanks, Zack.

1031
00:42:03,641 --> 00:42:06,207
Guess we caught
another one, right?

1032
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:09,441
All for one and one for all?

1033
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:12,474
I'll take a look and
see what they didn't give you

1034
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:14,407
and I'll get
back to you, okay?

1035
00:42:17,307 --> 00:42:18,840
Back to annoying Zack?

1036
00:42:18,907 --> 00:42:20,740
All right, look,
I know you don't approve,

1037
00:42:20,807 --> 00:42:23,274
but, you know, it works for us.

1038
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:24,574
It worked for him, so...

1039
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:25,608
Yeah, I get it.

1040
00:42:25,674 --> 00:42:29,474
And it... It's kind of sweet.

1041
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:34,474
Hey, well,
your people are my people.

1042
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:36,241
I have people?

1043
00:42:38,107 --> 00:42:42,441
Hey, I have people!
