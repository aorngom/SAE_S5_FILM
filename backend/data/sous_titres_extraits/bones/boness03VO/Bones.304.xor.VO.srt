1
00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:07,884
Okay, Dr. Brennan, Agent Booth.

2
00:00:08,012 --> 00:00:09,861
Together. A little closer.

3
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:12,904
Okay, yeah, that's perfect.

4
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:14,205
Beautiful.

5
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:18,226
Now keeping your back straight,
I want you each to lean forward.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,617
No.

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,379
- Excuse me?
- Come on, Booth.

8
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,940
I'm sure this is one of those
meaningless exercises

9
00:00:24,032 --> 00:00:27,080
meant to illustrate the importance
of supporting each other.

10
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:29,120
We agreed to see another therapist,

11
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:31,329
not be action figures for a 12-year-old.

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,970
I'm 22, Agent Booth.

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:37,295
I have a doctorate in psychology
from the University of Pennsylvania,

14
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:40,430
where my dissertation on the effects
of job stress was published.

15
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:43,170
That's great. I'm sure mom
is really proud of you, Sweets.

16
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:45,672
Dr. Sweets, or Lance, you know,

17
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:47,764
if you're more comfortable
with informality,

18
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:50,238
but I'd prefer, out of respect
for each other

19
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,609
and the process of psychotherapy,
that we at least try to,

20
00:00:53,702 --> 00:00:56,498
Sign the forms so I can get
out of this suit

21
00:00:56,602 --> 00:00:58,649
and I could have a Saturday night.

22
00:00:59,654 --> 00:01:01,619
I don't care how young you are.

23
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,358
I've never believed in psychotherapy.

24
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:06,982
Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan,
this isn't a game.

25
00:01:07,063 --> 00:01:09,803
The FBI is considering severing
your partnership.

26
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:11,236
- What?
- Why?

27
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,175
Why?

28
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:14,713
Dude, you arrested her father.

29
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:16,875
He was just doing his job.

30
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,805
but come on, he, like,

31
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:20,754
he arrested your father.

32
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:23,251
He's going to have
to be a witness against him.

33
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,083
Circumstances such as these tend to
stir up lots of scary feelings.

34
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:28,202
I don't have scary feelings.

35
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:30,618
Maybe you need a little
night-light at night to sleep.

36
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,965
Agent Booth, you've been trying
to intimidate me

37
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:34,941
since the moment you stepped in here.

38
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:36,782
- And you've succeeded.
- Don't...

39
00:01:36,883 --> 00:01:38,436
scare the boy, Booth.

40
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,574
Now, I need you both to...

41
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,105
fill out these questionnaires

42
00:01:43,198 --> 00:01:45,094
and get'em back to me.

43
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:49,105
Don't share your anwsers

44
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:52,381
It'll help me evaluate whether
Dr. Brennan's services

45
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:54,381
should be assigned to a new agent.

46
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,826
That's not gonna happen.

47
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,864
Like it or not, agent Booth, I'm the
therapist in charge of this case,

48
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:04,011
so I suggest that we work in cooperation

49
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:06,104
rather than conflict.

50
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,942
I can cooperate.

51
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:09,204
Good.

52
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,059
Agent Booth?

53
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:15,706
I'm still going to call you Sweets.

54
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:16,633
Yep.

55
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,783
- It's some kind of personality test.
- I can't believe he gave us homework.

56
00:02:21,864 --> 00:02:23,655
You know, probably his.

57
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,690
What kind of kid works
on a Saturday night?

58
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,638
That's my fault. I told him I wasn't
available during the week.

59
00:02:28,747 --> 00:02:32,672
Why'd you go and do that?
I had seats right behind the dugout.

60
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,117
Booth.

61
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,973
Don't look on my paper.

62
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:39,822
Okay, yeah, got it.

63
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,080
There's only one thing more fun than
a therapy on a Saturday night

64
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:46,860
and that's a dead body.

65
00:02:58,191 --> 00:02:59,798
Look at all the cars.

66
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:02,029
I thought the VA hospital was closed.

67
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,890
It is, Bones, but I mean, come on.

68
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,463
It's the week-end, right?

69
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:09,496
An abandoned building surrounded
by acres of secluded land.

70
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:12,188
Use your imagination.

71
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,911
Teenagers, hormones.

72
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:18,650
You're saying they're here to fornicate.

73
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,649
Yes.

74
00:03:19,753 --> 00:03:22,014
Nice image, very, uh, biblical.

75
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:26,276
These two were on their way to a
romantic encounter under the stars

76
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,022
and literally tripped over the remains.

77
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:29,930
I'm guessing that killed the mood.

78
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:31,883
I've got patchy tissue.

79
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,506
But this level of decomp...

80
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:38,247
pushes things into your territory.
I haven't touched it yet.

81
00:03:38,316 --> 00:03:40,471
Definitely not homeless, nice watch,

82
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:42,667
good shoes, at least what's
left of them.

83
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:44,540
Male, middle-aged.

84
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:48,551
Levels of decomp would suggest
he's been out here a few weeks,

85
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:50,100
- but...
- I don't get it.

86
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,632
Kids coming here every night
and they're just noticing him now...

87
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:55,754
- Dumped at the top of the hill?
- He rolled out.

88
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:59,015
Would explain the amount of fresh
mud and leaves on the body.

89
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:01,227
These bones are still greasy.

90
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,909
Did you take an internal temperature?

91
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:04,990
With this degree of decomp,
why would it matter?

92
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:07,640
Maybe he hasn't been dead
as long as he looks.

93
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:09,882
The body is still radiating
a lot of heat.

94
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:11,686
Wow, you're not kidding.

95
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:14,229
We used to use the local golf course.

96
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,029
I remember taking Mary Ann Milano
to the ninth hole sand trap.

97
00:04:18,145 --> 00:04:19,880
She had long hair all the way back to...

98
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:22,816
You are so gonna regret
telling this story.

99
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:25,614
Okay, now what do you got?

100
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,915
127 degrees?

101
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:34,283
Wow, that's really not normal.

102
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:36,934
No, that's way past really not normal.

103
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:40,606
You're saying that before
the body was dumped it was...

104
00:04:40,722 --> 00:04:41,923
- Cooked.
- Cooked?

105
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:42,889
Cooked.

106
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:57,374

--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

110
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:25,384
Has it occurred to either of you
that this might be another victim

111
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:26,755
in the Widow's Son case?

112
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:27,836
Based on what?

113
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:29,861
Because the victim was cooked
like an entry,

114
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:31,385
Sounds like that guy in Germany.

115
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:34,019
There's no evidence
here to suggest cannibalism...

116
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:35,879
- no bite marks.
- No condiments.

117
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:38,146
We have a bullet hole in
the sternum, Dr. Brennan.

118
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:39,649
What guy in Germany?

119
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,336
He ran a computer ad online,

120
00:05:41,452 --> 00:05:43,173
said he was looking for someone to eat.

121
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,531
There's an excessive amount of mud
and debris from the dump site.

122
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:48,932
It makes it difficult to get
a clear view of the injury.

123
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:50,039
Tell me about it.

124
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:52,296
I have to separate and
distinguish particulates

125
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,024
and insects from the body's
original location.

126
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:57,510
People actually replied to the ad?

127
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:00,354
Guy ended up feasting
on a computer engineer.

128
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:02,400
That's extremely disturbing.

129
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:05,452
Well, hello, my exotic princess.

130
00:06:05,544 --> 00:06:08,169
What a charmingly inappropriate
greeting, Dr. Hodgins.

131
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:09,925
I think he's talking to a bug.

132
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,810
Well, now I feel a bit... rejected.

133
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:15,047
Looks like something
from the Nitidulidae family.

134
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:18,180
Where did you come from,
you gorgeous creature?

135
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,331
Do you have any friends?

136
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,128
Boy, he melted like ice cream
on a hot summer day.

137
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:24,735
So when do I get my turn with him?

138
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:27,319
We should be finished within 20 minutes.

139
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:28,348
Excellent.

140
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:32,201
I'm finding a large
concentration of bristletails

141
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:35,065
and harvester ants dead
by the victim's feet.

142
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:36,313
That is odd.

143
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,174
The guy was cooked, Hodgins.

144
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,336
Odd is kind of a relative term.

145
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:46,278
Angela called. She wanted me to...

146
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:50,255
- Hey, is that the test from Dr. Sweets?
- Yes.

147
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:51,781
What'd you put for number seven?

148
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:54,567
Because I put 12 to 15 times
a day, and now I'm thinking

149
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,244
I really misunderstood the question.

150
00:06:56,302 --> 00:06:58,563
We're not supposed to discuss
our answers.

151
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,476
The teacher's not in the room,
let me see.

152
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:03,204
- Is this how you got through school?
- No

153
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:04,556
Maybe algebra, but...

154
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:06,816
Hey, Booth, I got your I.D.

155
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,267
Franklin Curtis, age 54.

156
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:11,733
His wife Margie reported him
missing yesterday.

157
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,838
Augusta county.

158
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:13,966
He was rich.

159
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:16,815
Founder of the Natural Sun
organic supermarket chain.

160
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:18,387
There's one near my apartment.

161
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:20,087
Excellent selection of local produce.

162
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,451
Totally overpriced.

163
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:22,687
A carrot is a carrot.

164
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,780
It's worth it.

165
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,203
Organic, there's no pesticides.

166
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:27,809
It's from sustainable farms.

167
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:30,710
Every time that I buy something
there, I feel so virtuous.

168
00:07:30,814 --> 00:07:34,167
Guy started off with a single
roadside produce stand,

169
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,456
which he grew into a nationwide
supermarket chain.

170
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:37,696
An organic capitalist.

171
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:39,887
Ambition like that is bound
to create a few enemies.

172
00:07:40,063 --> 00:07:42,369
I tested fabric samples from
the victim's pants

173
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:44,333
They were covered with chloropicrin.

174
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:47,905
Why the pinchy face, Bones?

175
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,203
Franklin Curtis built his whole career

176
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:52,032
on organic produce and chloropicrin...

177
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:53,325
Is a pesticide.

178
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,297
I was at a yoga retreat
with my daughter.

179
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,429
When Frank didn't answer
the phone, I got worried.

180
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:05,002
Here, Mom.

181
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,435
Ignatia Amara.

182
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:11,441
It's a homeopathic remedy for grief.

183
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,307
When we came home, there was a cup of
herbal tea on the counter

184
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:16,925
as if he'd just...

185
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:20,116
stepped out for a moment.

186
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,053
I noticed the fields as we drove in.

187
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:23,481
You still operate the farm?

188
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:25,937
No matter how big the business got,

189
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,469
Dad always wanted
to remember how it all started.

190
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:29,972
Your farm, it's...

191
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:32,167
certified organic, correct?

192
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:34,215
No pesticides besides natural predators?

193
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:35,105
Of course.

194
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:37,602
Your husband, was he having
any personal problems,

195
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:40,492
recent arguments?
No, everybody loved Frank.

196
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:42,182
Mom.

197
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:44,491
Your dad was a wonderful man.

198
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,445
My dad was kind of obsessed.

199
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,967
He'd pressure conventional
farmers to go organic.

200
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:52,133
"Pressure" makes it sound so...

201
00:08:52,237 --> 00:08:53,967
He was an extremely generous man.

202
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:55,452
He offered to support them

203
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:57,994
financially, while they made
the transition.

204
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,867
What if a farmer didn't want to switch?

205
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:03,001
Dad would turn things
over to his lawyers.

206
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:04,735
They'd find some legal loophole.

207
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:07,105
Property taxes, zoning, who knows?

208
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:09,764
Eventually Dad would just buy them out.

209
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:12,261
And he'd force people off their land.

210
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:15,234
I see.

211
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,411
Any farmers he was trying to convert?

212
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,457
Yeah, M... Harding?

213
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,020
Something I can help you with?

214
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:30,357
FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth. This is
my partner Dr. Temperance Brennan.

215
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:33,617
I'd like to ask you a few
questions about Franklin Curtis.

216
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:36,822
You can tell that son of
a bitch that the only crop

217
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:38,933
that will ever grow in
this land is tobacco.

218
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:40,353
I don't give a crap

219
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:42,342
how many suits he sends
over here to scare me.

220
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:45,478
He didn't send us, Mr Harding.
Franklin Curtis is dead.

221
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,777
Well, I wish I could muster up
some remorse.

222
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:52,849
No love lost between
the two of you, I see.

223
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:55,569
The man was trying
to kick me off of my own land.

224
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:58,593
My family has been on this farm
for over 150 years.

225
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:01,200
Tobacco built this country, yet these

226
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:03,334
self-righteous eco-hippies
have the nerve

227
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,767
to look down their nose at us.

228
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:07,138
Did you see Frank last Thursday?

229
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:09,228
N-Not that I can recall. Really?

230
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:12,267
Because Virginia Pesticide Control
Board reports that you registered

231
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:15,546
an application of chloropicrin
to your field last Thursday,

232
00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:17,623
the same day Frank disappeared. So?

233
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:19,816
It's a fumigant insecticide.
It's perfectly legal.

234
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:21,304
It was all over Frank's clothing.

235
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:22,593
All... over.

236
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,764
Okay, he did come over.

237
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,589
He said he was giving me one last chance

238
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,063
before he started playing dirty.

239
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:32,561
I was spraying the fields.

240
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,952
I may have accidentally aimed
the chem hose at him.

241
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:38,411
- Accidentally.
- I swear I wasn't trying to hurt him.

242
00:10:38,582 --> 00:10:40,525
I just wanted him off my property.

243
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:42,011
You understand?

244
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,874
Who the hell was he to
take my land from me?

245
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:49,478
I'm just saying the guy had a point.

246
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,137
If pesticides are so bad for us,

247
00:10:51,177 --> 00:10:53,896
then how come people live
longer now than they did

248
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,746
before they used pesticides?

249
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,361
You're over-simplifying

250
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,925
an enormously complex issue.

251
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:01,016
Meaning you don't have a good answer.

252
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:03,451
The arguments in favor
of organic farming

253
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,329
aren't just about food safety.

254
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:07,656
They're about prevention
of soil erosion,

255
00:11:07,705 --> 00:11:09,752
protection of water quality,

256
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:11,833
carbon emissions from shipping,
not to mention...

257
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:15,828
Whatever, you're not gonna see me
paying four dollars for a tomato.

258
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:22,988
You know, a researcher at the University
of Florida proved that

259
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:26,574
alligators who swim in pesticide
contaminated waters

260
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:30,434
have smaller genitalia than their
clean-water counterparts.

261
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:32,920
No way.

262
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:34,101
Way.

263
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:38,577
See? Right there.

264
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:43,253
There's some kind of pattern on what's
left of the skin tissue.

265
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,592
I'm hoping a more artistic eye
than mine can make sense of it.

266
00:11:46,684 --> 00:11:50,603
Regular circular shapes, cross-hatching,
I'd say button marks.

267
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,436
Like buttons from the victim's shirt

268
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:55,991
were pressed into his flesh
while he decomposed.

269
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:58,684
Yes, that's exactly what they are.

270
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,049
Glad to help.

271
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:01,941
Here's the thing, though.

272
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:06,196
Our victim's clothing
doesn't have any buttons.

273
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,165
Yeah, in this whole
environmental footprint thing,

274
00:12:11,435 --> 00:12:13,793
right, I mean, why shouldn't
I leave a footprint?

275
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:15,042
I'm here, right?

276
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,401
Hey, why should I have fewer
rights than any other species?

277
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:22,546
Hey, Bones, you know we're
having a lively discussion here.

278
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:24,002
Tobacco has to be cured.

279
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:25,494
Yeah, I know, and it kills you.

280
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:27,170
We're on the same side with that one.

281
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:29,679
Curing at tobacco farms
is done in curing barns,

282
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:32,089
using indirect fired burners.

283
00:12:32,274 --> 00:12:35,708
Oh, so if Frank's body were
in Harding's curing barn,

284
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,467
that would explain how it got cooked.

285
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:41,757
Brennan.

286
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:44,483
That should be enough
to get a warrant to search the farm.

287
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:45,946
There's what?

288
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:47,223
Skin slippage.

289
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:49,397
Our victim was pressed up
against another body

290
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:53,172
and during whatever heating
process the two went through,

291
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,779
the second corpse's tissue

292
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:56,987
basically melted onto our victim.

293
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,276
Thanks.

294
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:01,128
What, we got big news
from the nerd posse?

295
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,197
When we search the tobacco farm,

296
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,249
we'll be looking
for more than the murder site.

297
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:10,136
We'll be looking for a second victim.

298
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:23,201
- I'm making lemonade.
- Lemonade!

299
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,201
It's awful hot today.

300
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:28,059
It's an intrusion, Elizabeth,
not a garden party.

301
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:29,359
Agent Booth, ma'am.

302
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:31,258
Elizabeth Harding. Pleasure to meet you.

303
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,293
Listen, we won't be any longer
than we have to.

304
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:34,681
Shame about M... Curtis.

305
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,733
Uh, we don't have
to talk to them, Elizabeth.

306
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:38,334
Don't mind M. Grouchy.

307
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,998
Did you know Mr. Curtis personally?

308
00:13:40,097 --> 00:13:41,097
Oh, of course.

309
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:43,568
Although, maybe not as personally

310
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:46,086
as he might have liked. Elizabeth...

311
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,760
- How's that?
- Andy didn't tell you?

312
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,015
Oh, he get so jealous, no reason.

313
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,969
Looks aren't everything.

314
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:55,101
Mr Curtis was a big flirt.

315
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:56,795
Always making passes at me.

316
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:58,217
It didn't seem relevant.

317
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,784
And right under his
poor wife's nose, too.

318
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,391
Fool thought he could get me

319
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,379
to convince Andy to sell the farm.

320
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:07,328
Elizabeth...! Oh, don't you start again.

321
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:11,131
When I told Andy, I don't think
I have ever seen him so mad.

322
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:12,867
What a temper you have.

323
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:16,034
Thank you, Mme. Harding.
You have been very helpful.

324
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:17,201
Tell Andy.

325
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:19,234
He doesn't think
I can do anything right.

326
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,409
So how many lemonades?

327
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:23,201
Oh, how many lemonades?

328
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:28,115
Make a pitcher. Great.

329
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:34,057
Put solar panels on my house.

330
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:36,601
Compact fluorescents
in every socket and still

331
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:38,934
feel guilty when I use a paper napkin.

332
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:40,935
I've been looking at low-impact housing.

333
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:44,933
I saw a free-standing house
that was 118 square feet.

334
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:47,568
This entry to the sternum
might not be a bullet hole.

335
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:49,696
Wait, wait, wait. 118 square feet?

336
00:14:51,154 --> 00:14:53,234
Dude, that's smaller than
the janitor's closet.

337
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:56,182
There's room for a bed, kitchen on
one wall and a small bathroom.

338
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:58,034
I don't really see why
I would need more.

339
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:00,401
Isn't the goal to reduce
our impact on the environment?

340
00:15:00,463 --> 00:15:02,521
Our lives aren't only about function.

341
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:05,180
We are allowed to enjoy
ourselves occasionally.

342
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,405
That's why I work.

343
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:09,101
Yes, finally. Identified my mystery bug.

344
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,967
Carpophilus nitidulidae.
King of the lab!

345
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:13,945
It's an agricultural pest,

346
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:16,165
found on pineapple plants.

347
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,468
Agent Booth?

348
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:19,291
There's nothing,
the curing shed is clean.

349
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,888
But the body was cooked, and there
should be another body, too.

350
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:22,763
Not here.

351
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:24,456
- More lemonade?
- Yes, please.

352
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,958
No, no, no, just go back
inside and check.

353
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:29,807
I'll take half a glass.

354
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:33,208
Booth.

355
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,831
He was around pineapple plants
at the time of his death.

356
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:36,942
Pineapples?

357
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:38,656
Hodgins found insect activity

358
00:15:38,717 --> 00:15:40,307
that's only found on pineapple plants.

359
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:42,416
But the closest place
they're grown commercially

360
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,468
is Florida.

361
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,934
You're saying that the body
was moved from Florida?

362
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:48,826
I don't have an explanation,
I'm just giving you the facts.

363
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:51,728
I found this article
about the environmental impact

364
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,834
caused by transporting crops
over long distances.

365
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,067
It mentions this farmer in Virginia

366
00:15:57,162 --> 00:15:59,967
who was trying to grow
tropical crops in a hot house.

367
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:01,162
Like pineapples?

368
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:02,618
Like pineapples.

369
00:16:04,052 --> 00:16:05,000
Thanks.

370
00:16:06,306 --> 00:16:07,106
Thanks.

371
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:11,229
Boy, sorry to hear about Frank.

372
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:12,315
He was a good man.

373
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:14,296
A big supporter of what
I'm trying to do here.

374
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:16,308
All right, M... Paige...
Please, call me Lyndon.

375
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,060
You ever eat a pineapple for
the same day with picked Agent Booth?

376
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:20,316
Actually, no, and...

377
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:22,335
- Let me make you each a smoothie.
- That's okay.

378
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:25,499
I'd love one.
Frank Curtis ever visit your hot house?

379
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:28,469
Once, back when I first built it.

380
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:33,016
He had some advice on how to
maximize sun exposure.

381
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:41,685
- What's he doing?
- He's powering the blender.

382
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,859
The wheel rim is attached
to a generator.

383
00:16:43,951 --> 00:16:46,290
This is rather ingenious. Stay fit

384
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:48,161
and save energy.
Everyone should do this.

385
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:51,090
I'm sure it'll catch on. So, you and
Frank, you ever have any problems?

386
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:52,402
No, never.

387
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:55,610
Probably helped
that I didn't have a wife

388
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:57,301
for him to flirt with. Seems Frank

389
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,619
had a habit of hitting
on other people's wives.

390
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:01,568
All great men have their foibles.

391
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:03,867
Go ahead and check out the hot house.

392
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,034
I'll bring these out
soon as they're done.

393
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,634
Frank Curtis's wife stood to gain the
most from her husband's death.

394
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:15,644
- If she found out he was cheating...
- But you said her alibi is solid.

395
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,326
That doesn't mean we can't,
you know, double check.

396
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:21,432
I bet Sweets was picked that on all
through school.

397
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:23,733
And that's relevant now, why?

398
00:17:23,802 --> 00:17:25,096
You're kidding me, right?

399
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:26,820
Scrawny kid like that sees me coming,

400
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,727
a former jock,
and he's thinking to himself,

401
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,768
"Time for a little payback," you know?

402
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,890
Make him fill out all
those stupid forms.

403
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:35,128
Threatens to take
my partner away from me.

404
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:37,042
These tubs are too small

405
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:38,499
to fit anything.

406
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:40,623
We're not going to find
the second victim here.

407
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,203
Yeah, you know what, you're right.

408
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:44,242
So what do you say we go check...

409
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:49,772
Bones, was that you?

410
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:51,451
Was what me?

411
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:52,539
That smell.

412
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:54,328
I don't know what you're talking about.

413
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:55,750
Why don't girls just admit it?

414
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,380
It's a natural bodily function.

415
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:58,466
You're a scientist.

416
00:17:58,506 --> 00:18:00,073
Booth, I don't...

417
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:01,969
That had to be you.

418
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:03,811
It wasn't me! "He who smelt it,

419
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:06,339
dealt it."
How do you even know that phrase?

420
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:07,674
Sorry about that smell.

421
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:09,244
Guess I left the vents open.

422
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,541
Community composting facility
is about a mile away,

423
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:13,160
but when the winds blow westerly,

424
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:14,916
it smells like it's around the corner.

425
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:17,563
Do you take agricultural wastes
to the composting facility?

426
00:18:17,652 --> 00:18:20,069
Sure, almost every organic
farmer in the county does it.

427
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:21,271
It's a great program.

428
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:23,301
You give them your waste and in return,

429
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:25,117
they give you certified organic compost

430
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:26,481
at a fraction of the cost.

431
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:28,422
- I wasn't done with that.
- I have an idea.

432
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,799
Thank you very much, Lyndon.

433
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:31,418
Your smoothies are excellent.

434
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:33,101
Do you have any "to go" cups?

435
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:34,730
The road to the apocalypse is paved

436
00:18:34,808 --> 00:18:36,660
with disposable food containers,
my friend.

437
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:38,492
Compost, of course.

438
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,673
The identifying organisms
would have started dying

439
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:42,602
as soon as the body
was removed from the heat.

440
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,126
How high do the temperatures get?

441
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:47,251
Inside a large compost heap,
as high as 170 degrees.

442
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:49,237
That's hot enough to cook a body.

443
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:51,736
And if Lyndon contributes
his waste to the pile,

444
00:18:51,852 --> 00:18:54,234
that could explain why
the pineapple beetle was there.

445
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:58,316
Hey, you guys going to check out
a large compost pile?

446
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,501
It's wrong how excited he sounds.

447
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:12,834
We've got five people
on staff full time.

448
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:16,234
But there's 43 farmers
with keys to the gates.

449
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:17,864
You all right?

450
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,118
Just the smell.

451
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,266
We've probably got a couple
masks in the office,

452
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,888
you two want me to go... I'm fine.

453
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:24,715
Agent Booth tends to be squeamish.

454
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:26,667
I'm fine, okay?

455
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:28,165
So you were saying 43 farmers?

456
00:19:28,282 --> 00:19:30,015
They're welcome to dump their own waste,

457
00:19:30,154 --> 00:19:32,212
otherwise we schedule
a pickup with our truck

458
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,424
- when it's running.
- That's right.

459
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:36,267
- Hey, Gavin.
- Tim Peck,

460
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:38,492
Clay Ainsley,
couple of our local farmers.

461
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,441
This is Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan.

462
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:41,735
They're here about Frank.

463
00:19:41,853 --> 00:19:44,703
Truck stopped running again Gavin.
I think it needs a new fuel filter.

464
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:46,216
I just replaced it two weeks ago.

465
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:49,285
when I switched to bio-diesel, I went
through at least four fuel filters.

466
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,220
It's a conversion, loosens
up the deposits.

467
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:52,696
- You work here?
- Yes sir.

468
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:53,995
Charlie Rogan.

469
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:55,764
Did you know Frank Curtis?

470
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,996
Very well.

471
00:19:57,377 --> 00:19:58,999
I only just heard what happened to him.

472
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:00,960
I dated his daughter
all through high school.

473
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:02,600
Gavin introduced us.

474
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:05,460
If there's anything I can do...

475
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:07,515
Mr. Curtis was a great man.

476
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:09,230
Oh, you disagree?

477
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:11,523
Frank Curtis was in it for the money,
not the cause.

478
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:14,286
Then why did he donate his entire estate
to environmental groups?

479
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:15,569
We're talking millions.

480
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:18,134
- Even our corp could see some.
- You ever been to his house?

481
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,970
4,000 square feet, brand-new everything.

482
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:22,774
Left his air conditioner
on all the time.

483
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,800
Fat lot that man cared
about the environment.

484
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:25,897
Don't mind him.

485
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:28,267
The smell out here always
puts him in a foul mood.

486
00:20:28,372 --> 00:20:30,936
I'm going to need names and addresses
of every employee...

487
00:20:31,156 --> 00:20:33,075
And a list of participating faers.

488
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,550
And the facility has to be closed

489
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:38,220
until all of the composis searched.

490
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:41,388
We can get a warrant if you want.

491
00:20:42,694 --> 00:20:43,527
I do.

492
00:20:47,568 --> 00:20:50,916
Two independent people
often find themselves...

493
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:53,850
- Agent Booth, are you listening?
- What?

494
00:20:53,931 --> 00:20:55,977
The judge will call when the
warrant is issued,

495
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:57,229
Booth, pay attention.

496
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:59,873
What, I'm in the middle of an
investigation. I get distracted.

497
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:02,710
- So it's not my investigation, too?
- It's too early in the morning.

498
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,393
This is good, let's talk about conflict.

499
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:06,672
When you guys argue, how
do you come to a resolution?

500
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:08,464
- We don't argue.
- Come on, remember,

501
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:11,034
zone of truth, right here. Fine.

502
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:14,256
We might bicker a little bit,

503
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:15,893
- but that's not arguing.
- Bicker?

504
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:17,282
- I don't bicker.
- No?

505
00:21:17,413 --> 00:21:19,456
What about the whole
environmentalism thing?

506
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:21,568
- That was a discussion.
- You pretty much told me

507
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:24,234
my penis was going to shrink
if I didn't eat organic food.

508
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:26,529
That's not bickering,
that's being a good friend.

509
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,090
My penis is just fine, thank you.

510
00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:30,729
Now we're getting somewhere.
I think we're in that truth zone.

511
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:32,373
Stop with the whole truth zone thing.

512
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,906
Bones and I are trying to
catch a guy who cooked a tree hugger.

513
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:36,961
So just score the personality
test so we can get

514
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,229
back to crime fighting.

515
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:39,778
Yeah, that's good, Agent Booth.

516
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,379
Now let the anger lead you to the fear.

517
00:21:42,495 --> 00:21:45,036
You can't be whole,
you can't do your job to its fullest,

518
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,452
unless you get in touch
with that fear you feel.

519
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:50,437
Now Dr. Brennan and I
are going to close our eyes.

520
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,301
Follow the anger, all right?

521
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,600
Feel it?

522
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:58,170
Feel it softening.

523
00:21:58,285 --> 00:21:59,545
You feel that?

524
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:06,355
Very mature, guys.

525
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:09,633
Got to run, Sweets. Got the call.

526
00:22:09,823 --> 00:22:11,233
Let's boogie, Bones.

527
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:15,301
And, look, next time, you really should

528
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:19,351
tell me if there's going
to be an essay on the test.

529
00:22:25,152 --> 00:22:27,834
I just got off the phone with Hodgins.
He's knee-deep in compost.

530
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:29,152
He must be happy.

531
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:30,481
Happy as a pig in...

532
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:32,296
what pigs like to be in.

533
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,244
A sty?

534
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:35,718
You said you had things to show me?

535
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:38,192
From the injuries,
it appears there was a struggle.

536
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:40,101
You can see the bruising and fresh

537
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:43,201
hairline fractures on
the femurs and left ulna.

538
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:44,900
Consistent with defensive wounds?

539
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,733
That would be my assessment.

540
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:48,733
So, there was a fight
before he was shot?

541
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,882
He wasn't shot.

542
00:22:49,986 --> 00:22:51,661
I thought you said it was a bullet hole.

543
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:52,934
I was mistaken.

544
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:54,402
It occasionally happens.

545
00:22:54,495 --> 00:22:57,201
The hole is actually
a congenital abnormality.

546
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:58,634
A sternal foramen.

547
00:22:58,761 --> 00:23:01,434
- We're back to no known cause of death?
- Not quite.

548
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:04,434
I found multiple puncture
wounds with hinge fracturing

549
00:23:04,505 --> 00:23:07,788
on the scapula and posterior
aspects of several ribs.

550
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:09,062
He was stabbed?

551
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:09,976
By what?

552
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:11,633
I'm working on it.

553
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,634
Okay then. Enjoy.

554
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:21,600
Oh, God, I'm never going
to get over that smell.

555
00:23:22,306 --> 00:23:24,101
This place is awesome.

556
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:26,834
The thermophilic bacteria
content is off of the charts.

557
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,234
No security cameras.

558
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:30,067
Too high-tech for the granola crowd.

559
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:32,010
That means we have about 100 suspects.

560
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:33,824
- Are you coming in?
- No. You know what?

561
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:34,958
That's your thing.

562
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,767
And I'll just mess things up
if I come up there.

563
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:41,559
I just heard a crunch.

564
00:23:41,663 --> 00:23:43,667
Definitely not plant life.

565
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:47,917
I'd love to try this feeding fungi.

566
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:52,264
That's adipocere.

567
00:23:52,368 --> 00:23:54,301
- Is that good or bad?
- Good for us.

568
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:55,854
Bad for the victim.

569
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,953
Female, probably in her early 20s.

570
00:23:59,092 --> 00:24:01,057
We attribute rapid decomposition

571
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,306
to the microbial activity
of the compost pile...

572
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:07,138
She's been dead about
the same time as Curtis.

573
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:13,532
Dead Frank was fired
with another woman£¿

574
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:20,769
These three phalanges
still have some tissue.

575
00:24:20,896 --> 00:24:22,133
And fingernails.

576
00:24:23,682 --> 00:24:27,287
I may be able to get some scrapings,
maybe even a print.

577
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:31,172
Calliphoridae didn't
have a chance to oviposit.

578
00:24:31,808 --> 00:24:34,678
She must have been buried in the compost
just hours after she died.

579
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,334
Can you pinpoint how long it would take
for her to reach this level of decomp?

580
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:41,766
Well, given the carbon to nitrogen ratio
of the compost I sampled,

581
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:43,904
she's been in there
since last Wednesday.

582
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,870
Meaning she died the day before Frank?

583
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:48,517
Who catches two people cheating,
but kills them a day apart?

584
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:51,583
My sketch isn't matching
any of the missing women on file.

585
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,756
Well, maybe no one's
missed her yet. Poor thing.

586
00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:55,387
Everybody should be missed.

587
00:24:55,572 --> 00:24:57,334
Oh, you are such an angel.

588
00:24:57,404 --> 00:24:59,789
I will get a bucket
of cold water, I swear.

589
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:02,528
There's perimortem trauma to the skull.

590
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:04,354
But it's not severe
enough to cause death.

591
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:07,607
I also found multiple broken ribs,
and the sternum is severely fractured.

592
00:25:07,746 --> 00:25:09,168
Somebody tried to crush her?

593
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,772
No, these injuries are consistent
with inexpert use

594
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:14,465
use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

595
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:16,986
Somebody tried to save her.

596
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:23,835
The woman you found...

597
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,934
- Who was she?
- We were hoping you might know.

598
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:29,170
I told you, I was out of town.
I have no idea.

599
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,459
But you were aware that your husband
wasn't always faithful.

600
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:34,691
Yes, I was.

601
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,072
Yet you stayed with him.

602
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:38,619
I get it.

603
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:40,562
Big house, comfortable lifestyle.

604
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:42,515
I stayed with Frank because I loved him.

605
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:43,891
I accepted his faults.

606
00:25:43,995 --> 00:25:46,238
I'm sure you'll accept
the life insurance money, too.

607
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,320
I'm not even thinking about money,
How can you even...?

608
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,453
My husband hasn't even
been dead for a week.

609
00:25:52,557 --> 00:25:53,734
I'm aware of that.

610
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:57,001
Since you were so forgiving
of your husband's infidelity,

611
00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:59,667
why didn't you mention
that in our first conversation?

612
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:00,539
Kat.

613
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:04,001
I couldn't do that to our daughter.

614
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,337
She idolized Frank.
I can't ruin that, especially now.

615
00:26:07,406 --> 00:26:08,206
Mom.

616
00:26:09,464 --> 00:26:11,154
Mme. Curtis, I...

617
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,796
I came over to tell you and Kat
how sorry I am.

618
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:18,172
Gavin said he'd try to stop over later.

619
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:20,219
I didn't mean to interrupt.

620
00:26:20,716 --> 00:26:22,924
No, Charlie, it's okay, stay.

621
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,773
Mom, I knew

622
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:26,473
since high school.

623
00:26:26,565 --> 00:26:28,468
Charlie knew, all my classmates knew.

624
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:30,410
- Oh, God.
- Come on, Kat.

625
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:31,497
Not now.

626
00:26:31,612 --> 00:26:33,598
I pretended that I didn't.

627
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:36,574
For you.

628
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:49,372
Okay, so Margie said Frank kept
an office in town.

629
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:52,233
Turns out that office was an apartment.

630
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:55,472
- Where he took his women.
- Yeah, okay, Bones, that's right.

631
00:26:55,568 --> 00:26:57,227
Come on, let's go to the apartment.

632
00:26:57,323 --> 00:26:59,890
You know I used that
device on in one of my novels,

633
00:26:59,974 --> 00:27:01,582
and my editor thought it was trite.

634
00:27:01,617 --> 00:27:04,250
Ha! Maybe it was Frank's take
on being environmentally friendly,

635
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,819
making a friendly environment.

636
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,349
Get it?

637
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:08,646
Apparently not.

638
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:14,346
You know, I really hate these gloves.

639
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,637
No. No sign of forced entry.

640
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,001
These sunglass frames
are made of bamboo.

641
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:28,290
Oh, is that weird?

642
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,127
Well, most frames are
made of metal or plastic,

643
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:32,399
sometimes vinyl.

644
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:35,864
Maybe they belong to the Eco Avenger.

645
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:36,883
Who?

646
00:27:36,986 --> 00:27:38,900
Frank. Toiletries in the bathroom,

647
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,724
bra hanging over the shower rod.

648
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,527
Definitely a woman living here.

649
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:44,955
Dried blood on the coffee table.

650
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,117
Let's call forensics
and have the place swept.

651
00:27:47,222 --> 00:27:48,470
Send everything to the...

652
00:27:48,574 --> 00:27:49,973
To the Jeffersonian, yup.

653
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:53,201
- Got it. Including the whole...
- Yeah, the entire coffee table.

654
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,216
Here...

655
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:57,992
Here we go. Take-out receipt from, uh,

656
00:27:58,154 --> 00:27:59,495
two weeks ago.

657
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,134
Hop Lee's Chinese Kitchen.

658
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:03,405
Name on the credit card...
Emma Billings.

659
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:04,769
- Booth?
- Yeah.

660
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,211
I think we found our second victim.

661
00:28:08,488 --> 00:28:10,234
Emma Billings.

662
00:28:15,217 --> 00:28:17,980
She has an interior
superior margin fracture

663
00:28:18,095 --> 00:28:19,379
to the C-5 vertebrae.

664
00:28:19,495 --> 00:28:22,304
What about the posterior
half of the vertebral body?

665
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,281
Any linked sagittal fractures?

666
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:25,139
Yes.

667
00:28:25,668 --> 00:28:26,468
So...

668
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,376
if she fell and hit
her head on the coffee table

669
00:28:31,457 --> 00:28:33,064
at this angle,

670
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:34,960
that could account
for the broken vertebrae.

671
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,934
It's a statistically rare possibility,

672
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:38,983
but one that would
have killed her instantly.

673
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:41,786
FBI sent over some info
on our latest victim.

674
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,377
She was a cashier at one of
Franklin Curtis's Natural Sun Markets

675
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,422
- in New Jersey.
- How'd she end up in Virginia?

676
00:28:47,472 --> 00:28:48,892
They think she was hiding.

677
00:28:48,969 --> 00:28:52,048
Earlier this year, she accused
one of her coworkers of stalking her.

678
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:53,390
Check him out.

679
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,524
Wouldn't want him following me.
I know, right?

680
00:28:56,621 --> 00:28:58,211
Guy's name is Noel Liftan.

681
00:28:58,453 --> 00:28:59,512
He was fired.

682
00:28:59,564 --> 00:29:00,951
Emma filed a restraining order.

683
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:02,697
Booth is trying to track him down.

684
00:29:02,801 --> 00:29:04,200
Any progress on time of death?

685
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:05,795
It appears to have been accidental

686
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,379
That'll explain CPR

687
00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:09,853
Frank were stabbed multiple times.

688
00:29:10,003 --> 00:29:11,876
Right. Not so accidental.

689
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:13,262
Hey, Booth.

690
00:29:13,338 --> 00:29:15,118
What about the murder weapon
used on Frank?

691
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:16,200
Find anything yet?

692
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:18,472
These puncture wounds...
I still can't find any weapon

693
00:29:18,516 --> 00:29:19,935
this small and curved.

694
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:21,533
They're close together.

695
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:23,031
He didn't seem to move much.

696
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:25,031
Which is odd, because
the wounds appear deep.

697
00:29:25,123 --> 00:29:26,221
Okay, call me after.

698
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:27,673
Booth found Emma's stalker.

699
00:29:27,777 --> 00:29:31,567
He's been staying at a motel across
the street from where Emma was killed.

700
00:29:34,192 --> 00:29:35,912
Don't look at me like that.

701
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:38,421
You can't arrest me
for renting a motel room.

702
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:40,409
I didn't break any laws.

703
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:42,062
I followed her, okay?

704
00:29:42,189 --> 00:29:45,076
But the motel room is over 150 feet
from Emma's apartment building.

705
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:46,203
I measured.

706
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:48,154
Then I guess I got no reason
to suspect you.

707
00:29:48,211 --> 00:29:50,700
- You were just keeping an eye on her.
- I was.

708
00:29:51,648 --> 00:29:52,769
Frank Curtis.

709
00:29:52,862 --> 00:29:54,991
- Who?
- Frank Curtis.

710
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,934
- He's the one. You should talk to him
- OK?

711
00:29:57,049 --> 00:29:59,211
He treated Emma like he owned her.

712
00:29:59,361 --> 00:30:00,749
It was so messed up.

713
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:05,368
The reflections on this table,

714
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:07,500
the patterns are beautiful.

715
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:09,999
Focus.

716
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,884
Frank Curtis.

717
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:13,838
Oh, sure.

718
00:30:14,138 --> 00:30:16,190
Frank comes in for
one of his regional visits.

719
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:18,063
You know, and has the manager hire Emma.

720
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:21,045
The next time he comes in,
he can see that Emma's falling for me.

721
00:30:21,138 --> 00:30:24,629
So he has me fired and then tells Emma
to take out a restraining order.

722
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,860
The fact that you
called her 20 times a day

723
00:30:26,987 --> 00:30:29,544
and slept in her driveway, that had
nothing to do with it?

724
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,798
I guess you've never been in love.

725
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:35,500
Where were you last
Wednesday and Thursday?

726
00:30:35,858 --> 00:30:37,731
Mostly I just stay in my motel room,

727
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:39,581
you know,
keep an eye on Emma's building.

728
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,691
Only times I ever leave
is to go out and sell my products.

729
00:30:43,615 --> 00:30:44,615
Your products?

730
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:47,075
Hemp oil-based body products.

731
00:30:48,023 --> 00:30:49,700
I make them myself.

732
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:51,067
There's a surprise.

733
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:54,139
I guess you're telling
me you don't have an alibi.

734
00:30:58,696 --> 00:31:00,777
I reviewed the forensic
samples from the apartment.

735
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:03,112
Traces of triglycerides, diglycerides,

736
00:31:03,181 --> 00:31:06,233
and free fatty acids on both
the carpeting and the furniture.

737
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:08,329
It looks like some vegetable oil.

738
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:10,571
Could it be hemp oil?

739
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:12,664
Booth said the person
stalking Emma Billings

740
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:15,057
sells hemp-based body products.

741
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,548
Yeah, that's one possibility.

742
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:19,311
Re-examine any clothing
from Frank and Emma's bodies.

743
00:31:19,392 --> 00:31:22,600
See if you can find additional
traces of the oil.

744
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:23,866
Dr. Brennan,

745
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:25,843
I need you to see something.

746
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,637
Fracturing to Emma's sternum
I concealed a malformation

747
00:31:29,753 --> 00:31:31,938
that became apparent once
I finished reconstruction.

748
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:33,603
A sternal feramin.

749
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:35,547
Emma Billings and Frank Curtis

750
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:37,697
both shared a congenital abnormality.

751
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,819
When Zach told me his findings,
I decided to run DNA tests

752
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:42,819
on the tissue samples from both victims.

753
00:31:42,912 --> 00:31:45,067
Multiple matching RFLPs.

754
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:46,906
Our victims were related.

755
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:49,658
If our murderer thought
he killed Emma and her lover,

756
00:31:49,762 --> 00:31:52,867
- he was very wrong.
- He killed emma and her father

757
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:02,667
I've tested over 40 different knives,
ice picks, leather awls.

758
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:04,787
I couldn't find a
murder weapon to match.

759
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,834
With decomp and postmortem trauma
from being rolled down the hill,

760
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:09,234
it's very difficult, Zach.

761
00:32:09,374 --> 00:32:12,458
Okay, this will help you
visualize the pattern of the wounds.

762
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,701
Usually I can determine the weapon.
This is a very frustrating murderer.

763
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:17,856
I'm sure he'll apologize
when we catch him.

764
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:20,761
There are five puncture
wounds to Frank's chest.

765
00:32:21,162 --> 00:32:23,049
The result of repeated stabs

766
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:25,464
by an unknown and
very frustrating object.

767
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:26,909
Perhaps not.

768
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:30,308
What if Frank Curtis
had broader shoulders?

769
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:32,793
Angela, move the scapuli apart

770
00:32:32,877 --> 00:32:34,067
slowly.

771
00:32:34,738 --> 00:32:36,334
A little more.

772
00:32:36,946 --> 00:32:38,634
The wounds become equidistant.

773
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:40,900
You're probably looking
for an instrument

774
00:32:40,981 --> 00:32:44,229
with multiple sharp pointed
objects projecting from it.

775
00:32:44,608 --> 00:32:45,658
A pitchfork.

776
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:47,200
How'd you get pitchfork?

777
00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:49,223
These three wounds mark the termination

778
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:51,616
of a three-tine pitchfork's penetration.

779
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:53,304
Makes sense.

780
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:56,020
I'll go match the exact type and make.

781
00:32:57,754 --> 00:32:59,588
I've got results from the clothes.

782
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,476
You were right. Same vegetable oil

783
00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:03,085
on both Frank and Emma's clothing.

784
00:33:03,177 --> 00:33:07,061
but I found a high concentration of
methanol and sodium hydroxide mixed in.

785
00:33:07,732 --> 00:33:09,767
So, the oil isn't from body products.

786
00:33:09,836 --> 00:33:11,755
No, it's from bio-diesel fuel.

787
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,209
So your suspect is going to
give me a description of your suspect?

788
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:25,128
I'm not following.

789
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:26,723
The stoned hippie guy.

790
00:33:26,793 --> 00:33:29,417
He's all we have so far.
He'll tell you what the guy looks like

791
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,361
who went into Emma's
place and then you draw.

792
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:34,748
I've never really found
stoned guys that dependable.

793
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:38,714
Except for cookies,
they always have good cookies.

794
00:33:38,772 --> 00:33:40,300
You're grasping at straws, Booth.

795
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,851
We should wait for more information.

796
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:44,224
It has to be somebody
in the composting facility.

797
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,502
They have pitchforks
to turn the heaps, don't they?

798
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,733
Pitchforks are used
on every farm in the area.

799
00:33:48,797 --> 00:33:50,038
But not bio-diesel, okay?

800
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,289
The owner, Gavin,
said he just replaced a fuel pump

801
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,167
on his truck when he
switched to bio-diesel.

802
00:33:54,264 --> 00:33:56,842
One of the other farmers also said
that he just switched.

803
00:33:56,882 --> 00:33:59,779
And he has a key, he could've dumped the
body in the middle of th night

804
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:01,023
But whose side are you on?

805
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:03,871
don't say the facts,
because that just annoys me.

806
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:06,901
You want us to base our
actions on your gut again?

807
00:34:06,968 --> 00:34:08,100
Yes.

808
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:10,467
You have your shiny
machines, I have my gut.

809
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:13,300
Is it always like this
when you two are together?

810
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:14,601
- Yes.
- No.

811
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:15,934
It's kind of hot.

812
00:34:29,172 --> 00:34:31,241
What the hell is he doing?

813
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:33,934
It's a Vedic chant.

814
00:34:36,846 --> 00:34:38,667
All right, Noel, let's go. On your feet.

815
00:34:38,738 --> 00:34:40,114
A bass player taught it to me.

816
00:34:40,172 --> 00:34:41,802
I'm trying to calm myself, man.

817
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,305
Emma's dead and I'm innocent.

818
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:45,791
How many times do
I have to tell you that?

819
00:34:46,658 --> 00:34:48,600
- All right, you know...
- Noel!

820
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,942
Just want to ask you some
more questions, that's all.

821
00:34:52,728 --> 00:34:55,063
- Who are the chicks?
- Be respectful, be a gentleman.

822
00:34:55,153 --> 00:34:56,462
Let's go, up, up, up...

823
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:58,335
Come on. There you go.

824
00:34:58,648 --> 00:35:00,017
That's it, okay.

825
00:35:00,152 --> 00:35:01,712
This here is Dr. Brennan.

826
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:03,974
Angela Montenegro, she's an artist.

827
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:05,654
- Cool.
- Yeah, groovy.

828
00:35:05,762 --> 00:35:07,698
Did you see a truck parked outside

829
00:35:07,747 --> 00:35:10,157
Emma's apartment building
last Wednesday?

830
00:35:10,216 --> 00:35:11,224
How would I know?

831
00:35:11,274 --> 00:35:14,208
It's not like I kept a log of everyone
going in and out of the building.

832
00:35:14,254 --> 00:35:16,652
Listen, Noel, you're the
primary suspect in Emma's murder.

833
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:19,157
So if you do not cooperate,
you're looking at 20 solid years

834
00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:20,622
keeping tabs on your cell mate.

835
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:23,180
All right, fine.

836
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,966
I remember a truck,

837
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:29,776
it had a cool logo from
some organic composting place.

838
00:35:29,985 --> 00:35:32,388
We need to know who
was driving the truck

839
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:34,197
and if he went in to Emma's building.

840
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:36,344
What, you think I have
bionic vision or something?

841
00:35:36,382 --> 00:35:39,303
No, but you got binoculars...
they're in every starter stalker kit...

842
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:41,716
so give Angela something to draw.

843
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:44,005
I like artists.

844
00:35:45,808 --> 00:35:48,086
I'll crush you like a bug, dude.

845
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:49,612
Describe the guy.

846
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:52,722
Uh, he's a young dude, maybe 26,

847
00:35:52,803 --> 00:35:54,526
about my height, average,

848
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:57,566
kind of buff, Caucasian,

849
00:35:57,659 --> 00:35:58,733
uh, brown hair,

850
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:00,294
he was wearing sunglasses.

851
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:02,918
Kind of looked like they
were made out of wood or something.

852
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:04,192
Far out, huh?

853
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:05,971
Wood.

854
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:10,932
Do you guys have
medical marijuana in DC?

855
00:36:11,822 --> 00:36:13,804
Because I get anxiety attacks.

856
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:16,047
Give Angela something to draw.

857
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:24,347
He had a...

858
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:26,844
square jaw, straight nose,

859
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:29,029
cute ears.

860
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,047
Charlie Rogan got 'em from Frank Curtis.

861
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:35,457
- Why?
- What's going on?

862
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,573
Why did Frank give Charlie
a pair of sunglasses?

863
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:41,272
No real reason-Frank wore
'em one day to pick up compost,

864
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,222
Charlie admired 'em, so
Frank gave 'em to him.

865
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,160
He was like that.

866
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:46,963
Can you think of any reason why Charlie
would want Frank dead?

867
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:49,397
Of course not-he's a good kid;
he loved Frank.

868
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,988
This is the murder weapon.

869
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:52,624
- There you go.
- Bag it.

870
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,210
It seems like Charlie and Frank had

871
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:56,027
a thing for the same girl.

872
00:36:56,165 --> 00:36:57,666
Charlie gets jealous, he...

873
00:36:57,735 --> 00:36:59,727
gets into a fight with the girl,

874
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,931
kills her,
and then he goes after Frank's story.

875
00:37:02,006 --> 00:37:03,907
As old as time, my compost friend.

876
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,560
- Need something?
- Charles Rogan,

877
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:09,032
You're under arrest for the murder of
Frank Curtis and Emma Billings.

878
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,159
Oh, God, no.

879
00:37:10,217 --> 00:37:11,584
Th-This isn't what you think!

880
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,729
Gavin, I didn't...

881
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:14,406
- I swear I didn't...
- Don't.

882
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:16,360
Don't say a word, Charlie.

883
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,817
Cam, we've got the murder
weapon used on Frank Curtis,

884
00:37:19,898 --> 00:37:22,695
plus evidence linking Charlie
to the scene of Emma's murder.

885
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:24,801
Yeah, well, I hate to throw
ants in your picnic,

886
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:27,852
but I recovered DNA from
beneath Emma's fingernails...

887
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:30,152
Charlie Rogan didn't
attack Emma Billings.

888
00:37:30,268 --> 00:37:32,354
- Her assailant was female.
- What is it?

889
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:34,048
- Charlie didn't kill Emma.
- What?

890
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:35,706
- He was there.
- But there's more.

891
00:37:35,822 --> 00:37:37,278
I noticed some odd similarities,

892
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:39,694
so I compared Emma's own
DNA to that of her attacker.

893
00:37:39,786 --> 00:37:42,156
There was a 25% commonality.

894
00:37:42,249 --> 00:37:43,509
Half sisters.

895
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:49,734
- It was Cat Curtis
- She killed Emma.

896
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:54,881
My father promised
he'd stop fooling around.

897
00:37:55,678 --> 00:37:58,025
My mother was so humiliated.

898
00:37:58,337 --> 00:37:59,840
So you went to Emma.

899
00:38:02,267 --> 00:38:03,574
I had the key.

900
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:07,331
I was waiting for her.

901
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:09,076
I scared her, I guess.

902
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:10,579
And you fought.

903
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:12,197
She fell.

904
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:16,036
I never meant to hurt her.

905
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,625
I just, I wanted my dad to end things.

906
00:38:19,377 --> 00:38:21,249
It just looked like she bumped her head.

907
00:38:21,353 --> 00:38:22,856
But she was dead.

908
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:26,501
Cat called.

909
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,568
We were still friends.

910
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,146
I knew she'd never hurt anyone.

911
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,822
It was an accident.

912
00:38:32,891 --> 00:38:33,891
So you told Cat

913
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:35,492
you'd get rid of Emma's body

914
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:37,517
while her and her
mother went out of town.

915
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:40,560
- But you leave your sunglasses.
- It's not like I'd done this before.

916
00:38:40,646 --> 00:38:43,004
And Frank sees them the
next time he goes to visit Emma.

917
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:44,980
He came at me, man, one night at work.

918
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:46,622
Frank went nuts.

919
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:49,560
Wanted to know why I was at his place,

920
00:38:49,646 --> 00:38:50,893
where Emma was.

921
00:38:51,214 --> 00:38:52,400
He had a pitchfork.

922
00:38:52,461 --> 00:38:54,597
I was turning the compost
when he was yelling at me.

923
00:38:54,656 --> 00:38:57,234
He knew what would happen
to you and Kat if you found out.

924
00:38:57,738 --> 00:38:59,206
He came at me.

925
00:39:00,326 --> 00:39:02,074
I didn't even know I'd done it.

926
00:39:03,113 --> 00:39:05,726
It was like someone
else jabbed him with it.

927
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,734
But the body, Charlie, why'd you
move Frank's body?

928
00:39:09,356 --> 00:39:11,968
For my mom, for the insurance.

929
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,119
Of course, no payout without a body.

930
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,133
So I tossed him where
we knew he'd be found.

931
00:39:16,264 --> 00:39:17,911
Dad left everything to nonprofits.

932
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:20,362
That insurance money
was all my mom would have.

933
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:21,771
You did it for your mother?

934
00:39:21,887 --> 00:39:23,864
I never meant for any of this to happen.

935
00:39:23,957 --> 00:39:26,309
I never meant to hurt anyone, I just...

936
00:39:26,436 --> 00:39:28,577
I wanted my mom to be happy.

937
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,813
your father wasn't
having an affair with Emma.

938
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,374
He'd had a relationship
with her mother a long time ago.

939
00:39:40,888 --> 00:39:43,263
Emma Billings was his daughter.

940
00:39:44,344 --> 00:39:47,344
She was your half sister.

941
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:51,587
What? Oh, my God.

942
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,269
Oh, my God, no.

943
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:55,748
Oh, my God, no!

944
00:40:05,332 --> 00:40:06,939
So, case finished?

945
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:10,133
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

946
00:40:12,142 --> 00:40:13,587
You don't seem too happy.

947
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:15,749
Well, because sometimes, if you win,

948
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:18,961
you end up with somebody else's pain,
and screwed up a life.

949
00:40:20,188 --> 00:40:22,667
You work for the FBI, you
should know that.

950
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,153
Must be a challenge for
you to access those feelings.

951
00:40:26,303 --> 00:40:27,646
Okay, stop.

952
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:28,894
You don't know Booth.

953
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,593
You don't know me, you have a limited

954
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,525
view of us based on superficial data

955
00:40:32,629 --> 00:40:34,791
you've accumulated on
a standardized questionnaire,

956
00:40:34,941 --> 00:40:36,906
and a subjective analysis
from talking to us

957
00:40:36,987 --> 00:40:38,941
that is not at all scientific,

958
00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:40,968
so back off.

959
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:42,690
Just trying to help.

960
00:40:42,785 --> 00:40:44,334
By questioning his humanity?

961
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,315
You're going a little bit overboard.
He's just a kid. Right?

962
00:40:47,423 --> 00:40:50,016
I mean, the worst thing that's
probably ever happened to him

963
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:52,052
was he lost at Mortal Kombat.

964
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:55,247
Are you normally this protective of him,
Dr. Brennan?

965
00:40:55,323 --> 00:40:57,067
We are partners.

966
00:40:57,438 --> 00:41:00,493
Our lives depend on being
protective of each other.

967
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:03,086
And you feel the same way, Agent Booth?

968
00:41:03,164 --> 00:41:05,571
Sweets, I can only hope
that one day you know

969
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,704
what a real partnership is.

970
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:09,792
You two are very close,

971
00:41:09,871 --> 00:41:12,203
that was evident in your superficial,

972
00:41:12,277 --> 00:41:13,993
standardized questionnaire

973
00:41:14,092 --> 00:41:16,698
and my unscientific observations.

974
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:20,082
You complement each other.

975
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:22,836
No, she never compliments me.

976
00:41:22,877 --> 00:41:24,647
Did you compliment
me in the questionnaire?

977
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:27,103
"Complement," not "compliment."

978
00:41:27,658 --> 00:41:28,670
"Ple."

979
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,869
He means that we complete
each other, as a team.

980
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:36,009
Yeah, right.

981
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:39,397
Now, we've got a lot to
work on over the next few months.

982
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,521
Meaning we get to stay together?

983
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:43,755
Yes.

984
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,002
I'm sensing a "but."

985
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:46,737
- However...
- It's the same as "but."

986
00:41:46,854 --> 00:41:50,743
I have observed some underlying issues

987
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,419
that need to be addressed.

988
00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:54,471
- Issues?
- Yes.

989
00:41:54,572 --> 00:41:57,578
There's clearly a very deep

990
00:41:58,229 --> 00:42:00,411
emotional attachment between you two.

991
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,260
We're just partners.

992
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,400
And why do you think I
would have thought otherwise?

993
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:07,167
'Cause you're 12.

994
00:42:07,412 --> 00:42:10,013
Don't read into anything
that Booth said.

995
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:11,215
We're professionals.

996
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:13,655
There's a line that doesn't
even need to be there.

997
00:42:13,771 --> 00:42:15,123
Not at all, I mean, if...

998
00:42:16,071 --> 00:42:17,973
if there were no more murders,

999
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,656
I would probably not
even, you know, see her.

1000
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,033
That's very true.

1001
00:42:22,633 --> 00:42:24,008
Might have coffee.

1002
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,067
- Probably not.
- What?

1003
00:42:28,032 --> 00:42:29,050
What?

1004
00:42:31,327 --> 00:42:33,639
You wouldn't even have coffee with me?

1005
00:42:34,684 --> 00:42:36,200
In your scenario, we wouldn't even

1006
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:38,501
know each other because
there are no murders.

1007
00:42:38,758 --> 00:42:39,822
More.

1008
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:43,267
I said "no more murders."

1009
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,672
Then fine.

1010
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:47,644
I mean, we could have a coffee.

1011
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:51,771
So that's clear, then?

1012
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:53,176
I mean, we'd have coffee

1013
00:42:53,286 --> 00:42:54,767
and that's our relationship?

1014
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:56,685
Coffee.

1015
00:42:56,812 --> 00:42:58,373
Yeah, let's move on.
