1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
previously on  "californication"...

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,610
how come you never told
mebill's daughter was a writer?

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,740
This young woman's written what
could be the book of the year.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,740
Is that right?

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,150
The girl's gonna sell five million
copies based on the jacket photo alone.

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,040
People are gonna recognize my writing.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,060
No,see,I covered my tracks.

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,530
I added little bits of
me when I retyped it.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,600
You ha ve done some
fucked-upshit in your time,

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,360
- but I didn't think you'd do that.
- Not knowingly.

11
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,510
I'll take the book off the
counter ... you say the word.

12
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,160
- There are offers?
- Many.

13
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,000
Well,then I'm fucked.

14
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,910
Baby,come on ... hey,we
were taking a break!

15
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,240
Are you totally serious
about marrying bill?

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,460
- Yes.
- What about hank?

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,030
Are you questioning things?

18
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,680
- I question everything ,it's very healthy....
-  it's very healthy.

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,140
I just think you can't run
off and marry a guy after

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,730
making sweet love to yours truly.

21
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,950
if anyone knows of a reason
why this couple should not wed,

22
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,610
speak now or forever hold your peace.

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,070
what?

24
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,800
Uh,wait,hold on.Hold on.Stop.

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,420
- One minute.
- Time out.

26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,450
Since you are bringing it up,

27
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,860
there is something I
would like to express.

28
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,860
I just want to put it on the table.

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,090
Karen,I've got a car ...

30
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,870
there's more.

31
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,240
You just say the word,and
I'll pull it around front.

32
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,640
You get in,you grab the becca,off we go.

33
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,320
Bill,I'm sorry ... you're not invited.

34
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,480
Doesn't have much of a back seat.

35
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,800
What do you say,karen?

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,090
It's not too late.

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,620
It's never too late.

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,680
Fladong!

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,180
Are you okay?

40
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,290
Oh,sweetie.

41
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,810
Yeah.

42
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,180
Just a bad dream.

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,800
Better get moving ...

44
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,550
wedding's at 3:00.

45
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,620
I laid out your clothes.

46
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,270
There's coffee.

47
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,810
Oh,happy day.

Oh,my god,honey.

53
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,930
You look so beautiful.

54
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,710
- Dad?
- Yeah?

55
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,690
It happened.

56
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,190
What happened?

57
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,490
It.

58
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,040
It what?

59
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,310
It!

60
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,290
It?

61
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,730
The it!

62
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,770
Oh,it!

63
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,960
Shit.

64
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh,I'm so sorry,sweetie.

65
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,600
I should have been set up for such a
momentous event in the life of a young woman.

66
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,890
I should have had some
kind of kit prepared.

67
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,090
Are you okay?

68
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,330
- Do you need to sit down?
- Are you there,dad?

69
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,270
It's me ... becca.I'm fine.

70
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,480
I'm not going to die or
anything.I just got my period.

71
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,280

Shh-shh-shh!

72
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,260
- Can we keep moving?
- Yeah.

73
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,690
Aha!

74
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,150
Whoa,whoa ... oh,dear.

75
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,930
- What?
- I kinda need those.

76
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,090
Yeah,I probably need them more than you.

77
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,930
Uh,well,let me buy them off you.

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,000
- No.
- Can I buy a couple?

79
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,020
Ew,no!

80
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,620
Let me just buy a
couple tampons from you.

81
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,030
I can't buy one tampon?

82
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,970
- One tampon.
- No,I won't sell you one tampon.

83
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,530
I can't buy one tampon?Do
you have any cash?

84
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,600
Here's an idea ... why
don't you try another store?

85
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,960
They make a lot of
these things,you know?

86
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,150
You don't understand.I'm in a big hurry.

87
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,800
- I need those actual tampons.
- Bye now.

88
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,500
Lady,you know what?You
are not very nice.

89
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,750
Excuse me?

90
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,150
If I was in the market for,say...

91
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,830
I don't know,adult
diapers,and some poor,

92
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,100
incontinent soul walked by who
obviously needed them more than I did,

93
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,120
I would surrender those diapers.

94
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,020
Good to know,asshole!

95
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,730
- Everything okay?
- This guy's being a total dick.

96
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,080
He's trying to steal my tampons.

97
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,500
Why do you want to
steal a woman's tampons?

98
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,790
I wasn't trying to steal her tampons.

99
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,330
I was trying to buy them off her.

100
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,830
What the fuck you want to
buy my wife's tampons for?

101
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,780
You two are a charming
couple.You been together long?

102
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,810
Are you looking to get your ass kicked?

103
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,350
Normally,I'd say,"go for it ...

104
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,730
kick his ass,"

105
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,770
but we're running out of time here,dad.

106
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,640
Sweetie,you're right.

107
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,290
When you're right,you're
right.Let's blow this popsicle stand.

108
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,020
Hey,enjoy the shit out of your tampons.

109
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,070
Thanks a lot.

110
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,250
Go,becca.Becca,go!

111
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,000
- Go!Becca!
- Honey!

112
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:14,910
- By the heineken!
- Yeah!

113
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,240
You're open!

114
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,660
She's the one who needs them?

115
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,850
No,they're for me.I like
to use them as earplugs.

116
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,240
First time?

117
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,090
First time.

118
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,710
- Where's your mother?
- She's getting married today.

119
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,300
We're on our way to the wedding.

120
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,870
Oh,she's not married to your
father ... what a surprise.

121
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,270
Do you need some help,sweetie?

122
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,840
That's not a terrible idea,honey.

123
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,160
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,500
What are you gonna do?

125
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,650
When it comes to the woman I love,

126
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,890
- I don't think,I just act.
- Yeah,yeah,yeah.

127
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,980
- I messed you all up.
- Nah,it's cool.

128
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,670
- I'm sorry,man.
- Am I good?

129
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,870
How's the hair?

130
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,350
Looks good.

131
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,750
Hey,dad.

132
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,020
Hey.

133
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,700
Where's karen?Cold feet?

134
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,090
That's very sweet of
you,honey,and very supportive.

135
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,250
Throw a couple of drinky-poo's in her,a
roofie or two ... she's not going anywhere.

136
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,940
Hey!

137
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,490
You're lucky I have a very
sophisticated sense of humor.

138
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,890
You'll miss my dark,sardonic wit when I'm
criss-crossing the nation on my book tour.

139
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,260
Yes,um...

140
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,280
- about your book.
- You read it?What'd you think?

141
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,840
Well,uh,I wanted to save this until after
we got back from the honeymoon,but...

142
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,930
I can't,in good
conscience,let you publish it,

143
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,100
not given the current national climate.

144
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,600
What the fuck are you talking about?

145
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,110
- Mia,watch your language.
- Where is this coming from?

146
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,820
Believe it or not,I'm fairly successful
at what I do,and something called...

147
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,970
"fucking & punching" by my 16-year-old daughter
might bring me some undesirable attention.

148
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,160
You can't do this.It's
my book.I wrote it.

149
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,530
I can do whatever the
fuck I want with it.

150
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,870
I'm in business with
half of these publishers.

151
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,400
If I want to make something
go away,it goes away.

152
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,710
That's not what this is about ...

153
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,820
your reputation.

154
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,490
Well,the content is a little
unsettling,wouldn't you agree?

155
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,750
The whole thing reads like some teenage girl's fantasy
about having an affair with some depraved asshole

156
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,220
who bears a striking resemblance to
my least favorite american novelist.

157
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,280
What makes you think it's fantasy?

158
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,380
Mia.

159
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,910
- Take a hit.
- No!

160
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,470
I can't get high on my wedding day.

161
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,920
Yes,you can.

162
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,760
Yes,I did.

163
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,090
Yeah,and look how that ended up.

164
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,500
Now,you're aware that once you
say,"I do," it's gonna be you...

165
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,140
And bill's baby arm for
the rest of your life.

166
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,450
- Can you handle that shit?
- That's big.

167
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,480
A baby arm is very big,marcy.

168
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,220
- That's gonna hurt.
- Especially in the ass.

169
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,590
Has bill requested the ass yet?

170
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,710
No,and he's not gonna get it!

171
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,810
Not even on his wedding night?!

172
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,410
You don't deny your man the ass.

173
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,660
You give it to him.

174
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,380
Because once he knows he can have that,

175
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,860
he ain't gonna want that
shit anymore ... believe that.

176
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,850
Yeah,man,the ass is always greener.

177
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,690
Seriously,though,I think you're
doing the right thing here.

178
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,380
You are so fucking full
of shit.You hated him.

179
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,180
Last week,you said he
made your labia shrivel.

180
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,540
My labia.

181
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,170
Sorry.

182
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,570
- No one was a bigger hater than me,but bill's a good guy ...
- he is!

183
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,030
- He's a man of substance.
- Yes.

184
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,970
- He's not a lost boy.
- No.

185
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,330
'Cause believe me,once you've seen
the love of your life hit in the face

186
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,810
with another woman's ejaculate,

187
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,470
your perspective changes ...

188
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,340
it fucks you up.You lose your innocence.

189
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,890
That shit is fucked up.

190
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,520
Hey,marce...

191
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,190
I slept with hank.

192
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,010
Okay,either I'm really fucking baked,or
you just told me that you boned hank.

193
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,270
His dad had just died,so...

194
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,450
- you're such a slut!
- I know.

195
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,170
- Was it good?
- Yeah...

196
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,230
it was sad.

197
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,800
Like "coming and crying" sad,or
like "dirty and shameful" sad?

198
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,800
- I don't know.
- No,no,no,you stupid bitch!

199
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,750
You're gonna fuck your make-up!

200
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,900
Oh,happy thoughts!

201
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,630
What up,runkle?

202
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,010
Hey there.

203
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,200
You better pace yourself,young lady.

204
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,970
Why?I'm fucked.

205
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,430
My dad won't let me publish
"fucking & punching."

206
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,620
"National climate" and whatnot.

207
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,850
Really?I don't really know
what you're talking about,

208
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,560
"national climate and
whatnot," but that's good news.

209
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,060
You got what was
coming to you after all.

210
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,120
What do you know about it?

211
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,930
I know you fucked and punched him ...

212
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,810
set him up,stole his book.

213
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,990
Oh,ho-ho-ho,what are you
gonna do about it,huh?

214
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,130
Spank me?

215
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,280
You ladies talk about
everything,don't you?

216
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,930
Just the stuff worth talking about.

217
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,740
How long it take her to drop that one?

218
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,170
Two sips of a soy macchiato,

219
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,520
but,hey,I always knew you had
a little bit of kink in you.

220
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,300
I could tell.

221
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,130
Yeah?You looking to get
a little of that now?

222
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,620
You do realize you're
hitting on a teenage girl?

223
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,460
I thought that was your "thang."

224
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,510
Gross.

225
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,750
At least it all worked
out for the best,right?

226
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,220
Hank gets his book back,and you get to
crawl back to the hole from whence you came.

227
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,490
Hey,fuck that,runkle.

228
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,580
This ain't over till it's over.

229
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,770
You,lilliputian ...
you're going with me.

230
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,570
Don't scratch it.

231
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,520
And you ... she wants to talk to you.

232
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,470
You had sex with her!

233
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,980
- She told you?
- She told me.

234
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,820
And you gotta hit that shit again ...

235
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,000
give her some of that daddy dick.

236
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,280
Fuck her into doing
the right thing here.

237
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,940
There's something seriously
wrong with you,and you're stoned.

238
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,050
Shhh!

239
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,600
Don't be harsh.

240
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,870
You're freaking me out.

241
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,960
Behave yourself.

242
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,660
you look incredible...

243
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,320
except for the makeup,which
is a little hooker-ish.

244
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,500
Maybe that's what you're
going for,I don't know.

245
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,470
Shut up.

246
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,680
What took you so long?Where is she?

247
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,780
There was bad traffic on the pch...

248
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,060
you're so full of ... ...

249
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,700
and becca got her period.

250
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,400
What?!

251
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,040
- She did?!
- Makes perfect sense it would happen on my watch,doesn't it?

252
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,070
Oh,my god.How is she?What did you do?

253
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,480
I handled the fuck out of that shit.

254
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,520
You did?

255
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,390
You mean you showed her how to...

256
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,700
oh,god,no.

257
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,410
There was this very nice lady at
the supermarket that helped us out.

258
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,730
Jesus christ,hank!

259
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,370
Fuck!

260
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,840
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

261
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,570
I wasn't supposed to be
marrying some other guy,

262
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,940
and you weren't supposed to flush
your fucking career down the toilet,

263
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,950
and becca wasn't supposed
to start her period

264
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,280
and some strange woman show her how
to use a tampon for the first time.

265
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,270
All those things that
weren't supposed to happen...

266
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,100
they happened.

267
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,840
What happens next is up to you.

268
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,820
I'm going through with it,hank.

269
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,120
Go through with it,karen.

270
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,090
I can't cancel.It's not that simple.

271
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,140
I'm not asking you to.

272
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,970
I'm not gonna make some grand,romantic
gesture and ruin your wedding day.

273
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,570
You're not?

274
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,630
You promise?

275
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,690
I promise.

276
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,000
Good luck out there.

277
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,330
And if anyone knows any reason
why these two should not be wed,

278
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,270
please speak now or
forever hold your peace.

279
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,170
Bill.

280
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,630
Yoo-hoo!

281
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,300
Over here!

282
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,480
Mia,what are you doing?

283
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,650
Excuse me,I was told to speak
now or forever hold my peace.

284
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,500
Was that just bullshit or
can I file my grievance?

285
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,610
Oh,this could be interesting.

286
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,000
Um...

287
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,720
yeah,I just don't think that
I can fully endorse this union.

288
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,940
Get a load of the balls on this chick.

289
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,720
I told you we should cut
this part from the ceremony.

290
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,300
It's totally antiquated.

291
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,320
Let her speak,okay?

292
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,680
Mia?Come on.

293
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,030
Okay,first of all,you two
don't even love each other.

294
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,420
Yeah,you don't even know what love is.

295
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,820
I love your dad ... of course I do.

296
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,720
Karen,all due respect ...
give me a fucking break.

297
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,680
- You're still in love with hank,
- and you know what?

298
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,750
You should be.

299
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,900
He's obviously the guy for you.

300
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,460
Okay,I am so fucking high right now.

301
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,950
Dad,I want you to be happy ... I do.

302
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,840
You totally deserve it.

303
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,880
You got a bum deal.

304
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,290
You loved someone with your
whole heart ... I know you did ...

305
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,890
and they up and died on you.

306
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,900
That sucks...

307
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,630
but you gotta get real ...
you can't just play house.

308
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,020
Hold on.

309
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,180
If you marry karen,you're always gonna
be staring down the barrel of hank.

310
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,770
Simple as that.

311
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,970
- Let's take a little walk.
- You'd like that,wouldn't you?

312
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,350
We're gonna get some coffee,smoke
some cigarettes ... come here.

313
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,690
Let it go.All right?

314
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,640
Just let it go.If I can,you can.

315
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,080
You think you can just shut me up?

316
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,260
Of course you do,hank ... just like you thought
you could fuck me and never talk to me again.

317
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,070
Hank,what is she talking about?

318
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,650
Do you want to tell them or should I?

319
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,270
You fucked her,didn't you?

320
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,900
Okay,you want to do this?

321
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,330
For real?

322
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,450
Do it right ... tell them the truth.

323
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,760
Hank,what did you do?!

324
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,110
Tell them.

325
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,150
Did you,or did you not,sleep with him?

326
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,340
Of course not.

327
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,370
Give a girl some credit.

328
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,230
It's just a book ... a made-up story.

329
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,940
It's fucking fiction,people!

330
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,330
Okay.

331
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,400
Okay.

332
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,180
I don't give a damn about any
moment that's come before this.

333
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,040
It's very simple,karen.

334
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,820
I love you.

335
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,610
Do you love me?Do you want to marry me?

336
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,790
Yes,I do.

337
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,770
Man's got his woman to take his seed

338
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,350
he got the power she got the need

339
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,950
she spends her life
through pleasing up her man

340
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,580
she feeds him dinner on anything she can

341
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:53,170
she cries alone at night too often

342
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,250
he smokes and drinks and don't
come home at all   only women bleed

343
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,200
only women bleed

344
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,970
only women bleed

345
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,650
only women bleed

346
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:17,070
man makes your hair gray,he's
your life's mistake...

347
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,070
you want to talk about it?

348
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,740
- You need a hug?
- Oh,no.

349
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,130
- Let me love you.
- Will you shut the fuck up?

350
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:34,000
He slaps you once in a while
and you live and love in pain

351
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,850
so,what now?

352
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,900
Uh...

353
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,970
I was thinking maybe
I'll get into teaching.

354
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,090
There's an idea.

355
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,880
Not a particularly good one,but
it's an idea nonetheless.

356
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,260
Good luck with that.

357
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,710
I hate you.

358
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,380
I hate myself.

359
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:58,070
Only women bleed

360
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,080
Dance with your daughter?

361
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,660
Don't mind if I do.

362
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,740
Later,runkle.

363
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,170
- I'm very proud of you.
- Really?

364
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,050
And why is that?

365
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,620
Because you got throh it...

366
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,310
and didn't get into a fight with anyone.

367
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,040
Well,you didn't start it,at least.

368
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,850
You're tragically flawed,dad,

369
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,600
but you've got a good heart.

370
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,710
I'll take that.

371
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,670
Hello,sister,mind if I cut in?

372
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,840
I suppose I should thank you.

373
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,310
For what?

374
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,600
Saving my ass.

375
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,170
I'd say we're about even right now.

376
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,280
How's that?

377
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,370
My dad decided to publish the book,so...

378
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,980
I think he feels a lot better
knowing that we didn't have sex.

379
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,860
But we did.

380
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,160
Yeah.

381
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,690
Yeah,we did.

382
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,690
Once upon a time,I saw my favorite
writer in a bookstore and...

383
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,790
I seduced him.

384
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,240
So what ...

385
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,230
would it have been better to lose my virginity
in the back of some rich kid's beamer?

386
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,310
Now you're really fucking with me.

387
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,760
A girl never forgets her first.

388
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,160
Hey...

389
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,030
how you holding up,daddy?

390
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,370
Oh,hey,don't worry about me.

391
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,050
Worry about that poor
simpleton over there.

392
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,190
You can call me whenever,you know...

393
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,270
- take that.
- Come on,marcy.

394
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,060
You know you want that bald eagle back.

395
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,650
You've made him suffer long enough.

396
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,690
He's been out there.Trust
me,there's nothing for him.

397
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,690
He spanked the forbidden fruit,and now
he's realized that he'd rather be...

398
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,350
shucking your hairless clam.

399
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,240
Hey,be nice to my clam.

400
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,620
Hey,you,dance with your
fucking wife already.

401
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,750
Be nice to her vagina.

402
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,180
Well,I guess
congratulations are in order.

403
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,810
You did it.

404
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,690
Looks like I did.

405
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,560
Good for you.

406
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,140
Okay,this is starting
to give me dumb chills.

407
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,340
That's right ... you're a woman now.

408
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,800
Shut up.

409
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,770
May I?

410
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,510
Dance?

411
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,680
You?

412
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,550
Why didn't I dance with you more often?

413
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,750
Remember?You thought it was stupid.

414
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,740
Sounds familiar.

415
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,730
And once again,the joke's on
me,because I'm the stupid one.

416
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,440
You know,I'm sorry I never
gave you a day like today.

417
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,700
I don't know what I was so afraid of.

418
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,130
So negative.

419
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,260
Because I look around

420
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,100
and I think it's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen...

421
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,670
aside from you.

422
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,650
Oh,I believe that's our daughter.

423
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,650
Don't stare ... she'll kill us.

424
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,470
Just all went by so fast.

425
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,690
From the moment I met
you till just now...

426
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,920
seems like just a second ago.

427
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,690
Excuse me,hank.I wouldn't
mind dancing with my wife.

428
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,200
Bill,of course.Be good to her.

429
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,520
I had a shot with her once,

430
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,440
but I blew it.

431
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,840
That's what I call "fucking runkle."

432
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,990
You go,girl.

433
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,560
Okay,don't push your luck,clapton.

434
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,090
Becca,meet me in the car
in three and a half minutes.

435
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,900
And you?No tongue.

436
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,970
I'm serious.That's not cool.

437
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,270
Check yourself,before you
wrigidy-wrigidy-wreck yourself.

438
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,190
stay away from musicians.

439
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,940
They're nothing but trouble.

440
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,400
He asked me out...

441
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,820
on a date.

442
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,030
Captain fantastic.Thank you.

443
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,590
Can I go?

444
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,840
Of course you can go.

445
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,300
- Impressed?
- Very.

446
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,440
Maybe it's possible,after all this time,for
your old man to grow the fuck up already.

447
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,970
Maybe it happens anyway,

448
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,010
whether you like it or not.

449
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,910
yeah!

450
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,880
- Pay up.
- I gave my last bill to the valet.

451
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,560
You're shit out of luck.

452
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,250
Hank!

453
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,940
Wait!Hank!

454
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,140
Hank!Wait!

455
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,510
Hank!WaitJust go ... drive the car!

456
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,740
You sure?

457
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,890
Quick,before I change my fucking mind!

458
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,430
I'm sorry,baby.

459
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,810
Karen!

460
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,170
Karen,wait!Come back!

461
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,970
Karen!
