00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:04,933
- Hey, know you. Charlie Runkle.
- Daisy.

3
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:07,801
- That's actually my ride.
- You going to the set? I'll come with.

4
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:09,898
Did you negotiate?

5
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:12,473
Did you lay out clear rules for
what you will and will not do?

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,767
That's it! Bigs, stop the van!

7
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:17,436
Get the fuck out!
You're going too, sweetheart.

8
00:00:17,712 --> 00:00:18,712
Let's go!

9
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:23,984
Judas Priest, Hank.

10
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:25,277
What are you up to?

11
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:28,113
I was hoping you'd finally make
an honest woman of me.

12
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:30,324
- So you're pregnant, right?
- Yeah. I'm pregnant.

13
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:32,468
I think what you're saying, Sonja,

14
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:36,331
that Hank could very well be
the father of the child, right?

15
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:39,500
God, I'm sorry. I didn't want it
to come out like this.

16
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,379
I made a huge mistake.

17
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:44,630
Marrying Bill was
definitely not the answer.

18
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:46,022
Don't.

19
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:48,173
Neither is marrying you.

20
00:00:52,463 --> 00:00:53,613
I can't stay.

<i>There you go.
That's probably enough.</i>

23
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:47,682
<i>Gorgeous?</i>

24
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,257
<i>And now let's check on those onnies</i>

25
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,319
<i>that we've got going here.</i>

26
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:58,002
You look like ass!

27
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,057
That's funny,
'cause I feel like ass!

28
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:04,984
Ass that's been rid hard
and put away wet.

29
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,338
Drink.

Re... vitalize!

31
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:18,995
Geez, that's full of vodka.

32
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:24,814
<i>These onnies smell yummy!</i>

33
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:28,692
<i>Let's put some more in there.
Why not, right?</i>

34
00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:30,375
<i>Everybody loves onions.</i>

35
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,333
<i>Tear, tear.</i>

36
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:36,551
<i>Sometimes these onions are just
too much for this little gal.</i>

37
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:38,495
<i>Chloekins has a trick
for everything.</i>

38
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,696
- <i>Spesh, right?</i>
- There's something about that woman.

39
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:44,284
I wanna fuck her, but I want
to punch her in the face, too.

40
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:45,546
It's weird.

41
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:48,272
You want to hate-fuck her.

42
00:02:48,688 --> 00:02:50,672
No worries. We'll get her for you.

43
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:52,633
Get who for me? Chloe Metz?

44
00:02:52,795 --> 00:02:54,093
I know people.

45
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:56,303
Yeah, I know people too.
They're not magicians.

46
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:59,035
Well, you don't know
the right people.

47
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,245
You're in Ashby's world now.
Drink the fuck up!

48
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:05,836
Refresh yourself.

49
00:03:05,956 --> 00:03:08,190
<i>Baking's easy
when you're cooking with Chloe!</i>

50
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,726
- What are you doing here?
- Come on.

51
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:06,249
Quit acting like you're not happy
to see me. Hug back.

52
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:09,383
Shower the people you love
with love.

53
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:11,837
We don't care
what the mean girls think.

54
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:15,230
- Is something wrong?
- Why? It's Wednesday, 3:00 p.m.,

55
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,525
close enough to the dot that I haven't
to apologize for leaving you stranded.

56
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:21,347
It's Tuesday.
Mom picks me up on Tuesdays.

57
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:23,474
It is Wednesday.

58
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,894
No, it's not.

59
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:29,605
Really? 'cause I've got a serious
hump-day vibe happening.

60
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:31,174
You sure?

61
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:32,786
There's mom.

62
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:35,049
Uh, shit.

63
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,550
Uh, hi.

64
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:39,990
"Hi" to you on this...
This is a beautiful weekday, isn't it?

65
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:42,368
- What're you doing here?
- I was in the neighborhood,

66
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:45,621
so I thought I'd grab a few minutes
of father/daughter rapprochement

67
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:47,873
before you swoop by to pick
the little monster up.

68
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:50,348
So... you think it's Wednesday.

69
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:53,211
Come on.
I plead the 5th.

70
00:04:53,372 --> 00:04:55,475
Vodka. I can smell it on you.

71
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:58,634
You can't smell vodka.
That's the beauty of it.

72
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:00,302
Are you staying at Lew Ashby's?

73
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:03,847
For the time being. We haven't printed
the formal announcements yet.

74
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:06,242
Okay. Do you think
that's such a great idea?

75
00:05:06,362 --> 00:05:07,851
The road to Lew Ashby's house

76
00:05:08,013 --> 00:05:10,163
is paved with goodish intentions.

77
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,522
Thank you for asking. I'll be fine.

78
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:16,384
Why don't you take Becca home?
You guys haven't hung out in a while,

79
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:18,992
- and you're here, so...
- What do you say, Uzbekistan,

80
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:21,073
you wanna wile away an hour
with your old man?

81
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,743
Grab some ice cream?
You down for some 31 flavors?

82
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:25,994
I'm not a child.

83
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:28,556
Well, I am,
so I am desperately hoping

84
00:05:28,846 --> 00:05:32,367
there's some "very berry" something
or other in my immediate future.

85
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:33,669
Into the chariot.

86
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:34,981
That's great.

87
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:37,301
Have a good time, sweetie.

88
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:40,612
- So, drive safe...
- This sucks.

89
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:48,725
Where have I heard that before?

90
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
I remember.

91
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:58,674
This sucks.

92
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:03,385
Great minds think alike.

93
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:17,107
No, I'm not a deep-voiced woman.
I'm just helping my wife out.

94
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,807
That's right. The masturbating agent.
Can I help you or what?

95
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,671
What, exactly, might that be?

96
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:31,215
- Hold on. I'm gonna have to ask.
- Baby, do we do balls?

97
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,557
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Got ladies present.

98
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:39,027
And no, sir, we don't do balls.

99
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,776
I'm sorry. We don't do balls.

100
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:47,598
It's Daisy!

101
00:06:48,222 --> 00:06:51,084
- Daisy, how you doing?
- I've been blackballed.

102
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:55,375
What is that, like an interracial
tea bag kind of thing, or...

103
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:57,687
It's no one will fucking hire me!

104
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:02,103
Word got around what you did, and now
everyone thinks I'm a troublemaker.

105
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:04,337
Porn people
don't like troublemakers.

106
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,345
They want you to hit your mark,
suck your dick, then go.

107
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,101
It's gonna be okay.
Don't cry. Don't cry.

108
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:14,405
- We'll, you know...
- It may not look like much to you,

109
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:17,231
but I've worked really hard
to get where I am.

110
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:19,538
You don't need to tell me. I saw.

111
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,255
Jesus H., Runkle.

112
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,086
You're supposed to be helping out
and shit, not causing a ruckus.

113
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:25,694
He ruined my career.

114
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:28,284
Well, he's good at that.
Usually, his own.

115
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:31,788
What? Don't be hating
'cause I speak the truth.

116
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:33,581
You're supposed to support me.

117
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:36,626
And you're supposed to masturbate
in the privacy of your own home.

118
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:38,299
What are you, 14?

119
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:41,339
You can't keep your hands off
your dick for like two minutes?

120
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:43,067
Come here, Daisy.

121
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:44,739
Buck up.

122
00:07:45,562 --> 00:07:48,984
It's like I told Charlie.
You could either cry like a bitch

123
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:50,474
or smack a bitch.

124
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,850
So smack a bitch.

125
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,160
Don't you think I've been trying?

126
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,597
I know, Mon.

127
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:58,451
Look... this is on you.

128
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:01,192
Daisy's family,
and you fucked her shit up.

129
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,570
Marcy, it's really starting
to burn now.

130
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:06,656
Oh, okay. One second.

131
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:08,040
Thank you.

132
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,123
It's like I'm deforesting the frigging
rain forest back there.

133
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,791
I keep expecting tree monkeys
to leap out of her bush and attack me.

134
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,040
Fix this.

135
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:26,206
Okay, do you smell
that gorgeous aroma?

136
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,772
That's what you're looking for.

137
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,391
Wait a minute.

138
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:33,157
I know you.
It's on the tip of my tongue.

139
00:08:33,443 --> 00:08:35,017
And funny!

140
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:37,862
You didn't tell me he was funny.

141
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:41,243
Chloe Metz.
How the heck are ya?

142
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:43,067
A lot more impressed
with Lew

143
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:45,681
- than I was a couple of hours ago.
- Why?

144
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,608
A few hours ago, you were this big.

145
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,502
And now you're this big.

146
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:51,258
Hey, watch it, pal!

147
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:55,120
I don't barf after every show
just to maintain a size four!

148
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:58,749
Chloe's assistant is pals
with Kenny's cousin.

149
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:00,293
Well, fuck buddies.

150
00:09:03,058 --> 00:09:05,840
Let's just try to turn
the volume down a little bit.

151
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,414
It just doesn't stop
with this guy, does it?

152
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:11,923
Lew told me your sad story.

153
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:13,803
It's like you're laughing
through the pain.

154
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:15,673
You poor baby. Come here.

155
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:18,352
Yeah, you take a taste of this.

156
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,874
Here. Try this.

157
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:24,025
- It's gorgeous!
- My God.

158
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:27,236
Look. I gotta take this.

159
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:29,779
Play nice.

160
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:36,315
- He's a sweetheart.
- He's a prince among the non-princely.

161
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:38,038
So...

162
00:09:38,883 --> 00:09:40,433
- Wanna fuck?
- Yes.

163
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:44,462
Stir my gravy!

164
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,549
Yeah, fuck me with
your half-black cock.

165
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:50,801
Come on.

166
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:52,792
Oh, get the chocolate!

167
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:55,513
- The chocolate! Get the chocolate!
- Get the chocolate.

168
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,983
No, are you deaf?
Get the chocolate!

169
00:10:00,527 --> 00:10:01,677
Pour it on me.

170
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:05,823
Come on. Slather it on me.
Make me your little cupcake.

171
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,255
Well, dig in!

172
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,575
Damn! That's damn-good chocolate.

173
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:16,574
Thanks. I made it myself.

174
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,413
None of that Hershey's crap
for Chloe Metz.

175
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:22,833
Well, come on!

176
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,473
Breed me!

177
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:27,443
Yeah, make me your bitch!

178
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,636
Fuck me like I'm Al-Qaeda!

179
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:34,262
Declaring jihad on your pussy.

180
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,127
All right. What I can do to help?

181
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:39,141
You can be my agent.

182
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,951
Yeah, okay.

183
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:44,539
You want me to fluff
your co-stars while I'm at it?

184
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:45,606
I'm serious.

185
00:10:45,964 --> 00:10:48,145
If I had a big Hollywood guy
like you on my team,

186
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:49,652
they'd take me seriously.

187
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,786
I'm the fucktard who got you kicked off
"the slam van" in the first place.

188
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:56,075
I don't think those guys
are too impressed with my shit.

189
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:57,654
Fuck "the slam van."

190
00:10:57,774 --> 00:10:59,603
I'm done with that gonzo shit.

191
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:01,535
I need to move up in the world.

192
00:11:01,655 --> 00:11:05,376
I need to work for <i>The Vivids,</i>
<i>The Digital Playgrounds, Adam & Eve.</i>

193
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:08,379
- Is it hard to get those gigs?
- Fuck yeah, it's hard.

194
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,197
I've been busting my nuts for weeks

195
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:12,695
just trying to get a frigging
meeting with Ronny Praeger.

196
00:11:12,815 --> 00:11:15,579
- He's like the Spielberg of porn.
- Never heard of him.

197
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:19,140
You'd like Ronny's work...
Real artsy. Dolly shots,

198
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,612
and crosscutting.

199
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:23,163
He's doing this adaptation
of <i>Chinatown</i>.

200
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,229
Only Ronny’s calling it
<i>Vaginatown</i>.

201
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:28,107
'Cause it's not the water
that runs L.A...

202
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:29,984
It's the vagina.

203
00:11:30,144 --> 00:11:33,212
And I would be perfect
for the sister/daughter.

204
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,073
And I'd get to act.
I've always wanted to do that.

205
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:37,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

206
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:40,494
I don't see why emoting
and getting stuffed

207
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:42,330
have to be mutually exclusive.

208
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,611
So, what's happened so far?

209
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,709
Did you get in touch
with this Ronny?

210
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:49,253
Fucker won't return my phone calls.

211
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,620
I'll tell you what.

212
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,633
I'm gonna call Ronny Praeger,
see what I can do.

213
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:56,010
For real?

214
00:11:56,445 --> 00:11:59,305
It's what I do.
I get people impossible meetings.

215
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:01,057
That is so awesome.

216
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:03,893
And don't worry. I'll blow you.

217
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:07,571
Or did you want my pussy?

218
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:12,209
- You look like you'd want my pussy.
- That won't be necessary.

219
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:14,849
No, we're gonna keep this
strictly business.

220
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:16,962
I do not want... your pussy.

221
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:23,254
I could tell
you're one of the good ones.

222
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:37,259
Am I the magician or what?

223
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:39,974
You're like fucking Doug Henning.

224
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,597
Only not quite so macho.

225
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:46,606
Where were you when I was 12, fucker?
Imagine the possibilities.

226
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:50,147
Instead of whacking off to F. Fawcett,
I could've whacked off on F. Fawcett.

227
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:55,861
Feeling better? You get the old lady
out of your system?

228
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:59,135
Don't know if I got it out of my system,
but I discharged precious bodily fluids

229
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:01,200
all over your spare bedroom there.

230
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,328
A little bit of hate-fucking...
Always good for the soul.

231
00:13:04,488 --> 00:13:05,488
Lew!

232
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:09,333
This man is gorgeous!

233
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,044
And this cock.

234
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,505
God, it's gorgeous.

235
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,049
You could wrap it up
and sell it at Whole Foods.

236
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:19,844
Okay, so, what's next?

237
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,371
- What do you mean, "next"?
- Come on, fucker!

238
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:26,058
I got all night,
and I'm ready for a little F-O-N.

239
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,669
F-O-N?

240
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,329
Yeah, "fun,"
but like a retard said it.

241
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:32,981
- You had to be there.
- Yet, sadly, I wasn't.

242
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:37,076
Look, we're gonna have to catch you
another time, sweet Chloe,

243
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:39,655
'cause I gotta hit the Troubadour
and Hank's coming with.

244
00:13:39,815 --> 00:13:42,408
The Troubadour!
I'm down with that.

245
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:44,785
No, it ain't gonna happen.
No tagalongs.

246
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:47,749
- Why not?
- Because the words left my mouth.

247
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:51,451
Do I look like a person
who says things he doesn't mean?

248
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,079
You know, we'll just do it
another time, okay?

249
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,509
We'll catch you on the flip side.
But we'll do it.

250
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:03,304
Good. You've got my number, right?

251
00:14:03,464 --> 00:14:05,141
- Well, Chris does.
- Chris does.

252
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,267
- Kenny's cousin.
- Kenny's cousin has got the number.

253
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:10,201
- All right. Cool.
- Cool?

254
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:11,571
On that note...

255
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:16,901
So, who's gonna give me a ride?
'Cause my BFF dropped me off.

256
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,624
Come on. It'll be fun, guys.

257
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:33,042
- I'm looking for Ronny Praeger.
- You found him, but I'm late.

258
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:37,716
- Unless you're a money guy. Are you?
- No, I'm an agent. I'm her agent.

259
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:40,055
Then I'm definitely late.

260
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:42,635
Hey, I called.
You said you had time.

261
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:46,305
Right. You've got some bit of muff
that's gonna rock my world.

262
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:47,741
Daisy.

263
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:52,610
She ain't right.

264
00:14:53,013 --> 00:14:55,107
Hold on.
You barely looked at her.

265
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,088
Listen.

266
00:14:56,517 --> 00:14:58,138
Katherine is an innocent.

267
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,561
She doesn't have defenses.

268
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,245
This chick looks like she just blew
her landlord for rent.

269
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:07,165
- No offense.
- None taken.

270
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:08,291
I just did.

271
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:13,874
Anyway, I'm off to see Cassavetes.
Sorry.

272
00:15:16,606 --> 00:15:18,046
Well, we tried.

273
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,166
What, are you kidding me?

274
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,891
I'm just getting started.

275
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,530
- It's up here on the left. Right there.
- That?

276
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:32,908
Your abode has
a very "June Cleaver" vibe to it.

277
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:38,440
You want to say "Hey" to the beave
one more time before I have to go?

278
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,392
Ordinarily, but Lew here
is on a very tight schedule.

279
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:45,612
We can't keep the hair bands waiting.
They're very excitable, so...

280
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,244
It was real, Chloe Metz.
Real as in real.

281
00:15:50,998 --> 00:15:52,735
- Alright. Thanks.
- It was really real.

282
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:54,952
None of that, mister!

283
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:57,529
All righty!

284
00:16:00,773 --> 00:16:02,628
What are y'all doing tomorrow?

285
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:04,904
Or Friday.
You know, either way.

286
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:08,102
- We could hang. What do you think?
- I know you did it again!

287
00:16:08,222 --> 00:16:09,610
Who the fuck is that?

288
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,099
- It's my stupid husband.
- You're married?

289
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:14,388
That doesn't mean
I can't still party!

290
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:16,552
- No, yes, it does.
- What? No!

291
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:18,564
Come on! Drive, bitch! Let's go!

292
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,808
What...
Where are you going?

293
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:23,832
Where are you going?
Come back!

294
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:27,072
That's my wife!
You whore! Whore!

295
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:30,701
Where you been?

296
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,365
Do I look like I shop
at the frigging limited?

297
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:34,949
I had to borrow this crap.

298
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:37,458
This is not crap.
You look beautiful.

299
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:38,950
I do?

300
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,661
Yeah, actually, you do.

301
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:42,842
Ronny!

302
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:45,264
Fantastic. You followed me here.

303
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:47,384
Yes, I did,
'cause I'm a man on a mission.

304
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:49,832
You need to have another look
at Daisy here.

305
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:52,365
Don't kill my buzz.
I just toked on a Cassavetes joint.

306
00:16:52,485 --> 00:16:54,744
I know how you feel.
I love Cassavetes.

307
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:57,561
- Sure, you do.
- It's why I got into the business.

308
00:16:57,793 --> 00:16:59,566
Ben Gazzara,
<i>Killing of a Chinese Bookie</i>.

309
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,643
- That scene in the car.
- Total darkness.

310
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:04,113
If I had to choose
between a blow job and Cassavetes,

311
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,820
- I would choose Cassavetes.
- I'd take the blow job.

312
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:09,865
So would I. But I'd be thinking
about Cassavetes while I got it.

313
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,322
See, that's why I left
all this Hollywood crap behind me.

314
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:14,323
You know?

315
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:16,451
The shit they make
is all about the surface.

316
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:19,604
Porn is about the real.

317
00:17:20,494 --> 00:17:22,782
<i>Vaginatown</i> is gonna be
my <i>magnum opus</i>.

318
00:17:22,902 --> 00:17:25,425
I want it to have the feel
of <i>There Will Be Blood</i>.

319
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,217
You know?
I'm really into period porn.

320
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,159
Not that kind of period porn.

321
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,918
This is why
you have to hire Daisy, man.

322
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,100
Look at this girl.
She's Katherine.

323
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,578
Do you think she arrived in LA
all tarted up? She's from Long Island.

324
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:43,537
She ran away from home,
pregnant at 16.

325
00:17:43,657 --> 00:17:45,455
Sexually abused, am I right?

326
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:48,737
She came to LA
wanting to be an actress, man...

327
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:50,845
Stars in her eyes, all that shit.

328
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:53,724
- And then you know what happened.
- She got crapped on.

329
00:17:53,844 --> 00:17:55,611
Over and over again.

330
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:59,540
Can you tap into that, Daisy?

331
00:18:00,938 --> 00:18:03,835
- I don't know.
- She can tap into that. You can.

332
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:08,660
It doesn't matter.

333
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:12,094
The movie's not gonna happen anyway.
The financing just fell through.

334
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:15,139
- You're shitting me!
- I wish I was.

335
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,266
The moneymen
don't support my vision.

336
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:20,102
Which I don't understand.

337
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:22,877
The "Wall of Cocks"
sequence alone...

338
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:24,773
would've blown people's minds.

339
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:27,720
The "Wall of Cocks"...

340
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,259
I got something for you. How about
I do both you guys? Right here.

341
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:40,539
What do you say?

342
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:43,022
Too shy for that.

343
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:44,418
You're shy?

344
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:46,440
Then what about watching a little

345
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,470
girl-on-girl?
What do you say, sugar?

346
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,550
Do you want me to slap
the shit out of you?

347
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,011
- Come here.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

348
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,770
That's it! Out of the vehicle!

349
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:05,148
Yeah, get the fuck out. Come on.

350
00:19:05,616 --> 00:19:08,135
- What the hell are you doing?
- And you can't cook for shit!

351
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:10,504
That duck breast was drier
than the fucking Mojave,

352
00:19:10,624 --> 00:19:11,893
you goddamn lunatic!

353
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:14,195
You wanna know who the fuck
you're dealing with?

354
00:19:14,315 --> 00:19:16,130
Chloe Metz! Yeah. That's who.

355
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,704
Number 2 in households
on the goddamn cooking channel

356
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:22,949
in homes all across fucking
America, you motherfucker!

357
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:24,837
- Chloe!
- Not you, Hank.

358
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:27,652
Is that how you treat a lady?

359
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:34,264
What the fuck you doing?
You can't just dump her out here

360
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:37,872
- in the middle of the night.
- Yeah, she might rape somebody.

361
00:19:37,992 --> 00:19:39,187
Stop the car.

362
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:42,227
Seriously, Sam,
stop this penis-mobile this instant.

363
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,044
- I'm gonna go back for her.
- Why?

364
00:19:44,164 --> 00:19:46,785
Because despite all evidence
to the contrary, I'm a gentleman.

365
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:50,442
You just don't do that shit. This
isn't <i>Motley crue: behind the music.</i>

366
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:54,735
Whatever, dude.
Look, I got places to be.

367
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:57,301
Give Sam a call,
you need a lift back.

368
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:59,493
But just you. That
schizophrenic cooking whore?

369
00:19:59,827 --> 00:20:02,310
Not getting back
in the fucking car, all right?

370
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,205
You.

371
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,890
Hey, baby. How'd it go?
You rock her world?

372
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,309
It went good, it went good.

373
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:27,213
Yeah, I... I got Daisy the part.

374
00:20:27,665 --> 00:20:29,006
Hells, yeah!

375
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:30,774
You got Daisy the part.

376
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:33,026
'cause that's
how Charlie Runkle rolls.

377
00:20:33,186 --> 00:20:35,696
There's a little hitch.
It's just... It's a little one.

378
00:20:37,385 --> 00:20:38,566
I... I had...

379
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:42,598
You know, I had to... invest
50 grand in his movie.

380
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:47,375
Fifty five.

381
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:51,128
Or, all right, 60.

382
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:53,526
I had... I had to.

383
00:20:55,483 --> 00:20:57,509
I had to invest 100 grand
in his movie.

384
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:01,210
Well, fuck my rusty
Sheriff's badge.

385
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,514
Okay. I'll see you at home.

386
00:21:14,162 --> 00:21:16,512
Things got a little crazy
back there.

387
00:21:17,204 --> 00:21:20,056
Just your average,
typical, everyday Wednesday.

388
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:21,817
Tuesday.

389
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,349
So, you have a significant other
of some kind?

390
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:31,217
Once upon a time.

391
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:40,841
Well, you screw like you're trying
to get something out of your system.

392
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,536
Man, if you threw down like that
all the time, you'd be dead.

393
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:46,539
Or have a very sore pee-pee.

394
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:51,271
Kids?

395
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:53,847
What's with the 20 questions?

396
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:57,103
- They were two questions.
- Right.

397
00:21:57,223 --> 00:21:58,630
- So?
- Daughter.

398
00:22:00,355 --> 00:22:03,784
And it scares the shit out of me
to think that she might end up like you.

399
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:05,906
I mean, no offense,

400
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:07,403
but...

401
00:22:07,712 --> 00:22:11,249
you know, letting some guy order you
off the TV like you're Chinese take-out?

402
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:13,574
Is that really
what it's come to mean

403
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:16,938
to be a member of the fairer sex
in the City of Angels, circa 2008?

404
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:19,343
For someone as accomplished as you?

405
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:21,980
You're Chloe fucking Metz.

406
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:28,312
Fuck if I know.

407
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:31,329
I'm just glad my kid's a boy.

408
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,150
All right.

409
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:36,890
That's a good-enough answer.

410
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:41,499
I'd never have guessed
you just gave birth, either. You are...

411
00:22:43,156 --> 00:22:44,739
How do I put this delicately?

412
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:46,454
... tight for a new mom.

413
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:51,623
You know what?

414
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:54,461
I think that's the sweetest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

415
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,920
I'm not just saying it.
You're like a newborn kitten.

416
00:22:57,756 --> 00:23:00,289
- Fucking-A right I am!
- Not that I've ever fucked

417
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:01,830
a newborn kitten.

418
00:23:02,295 --> 00:23:05,777
- Well, I would hope not.
- I'm taking an imaginative leap.

419
00:23:07,224 --> 00:23:09,141
I kegel when I cook.

420
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:12,101
Okay, well,
that's reason number 357

421
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:15,313
to tivo the shit
out of <i>Cooking with Chloe</i>.

422
00:23:18,993 --> 00:23:20,459
Well, there's Mario.

423
00:23:21,114 --> 00:23:22,624
You gonna be all right?

424
00:23:22,744 --> 00:23:23,744
Yeah.

425
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,001
Yeah, he's a pussycat.

426
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:28,491
I'd hate to see him
when he gets mad.

427
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:39,977
- Hey, baby.
- You okay?

428
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:47,352
Mario, this is Hank.

429
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:49,762
Paisan!

430
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:52,017
You want a ride?

431
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:55,843
You and Mario go be together.

432
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:52,278
- Can I talk to her?
- She's out.

433
00:24:53,554 --> 00:24:55,330
- <i>Don't say it.</i>
- On a date.

434
00:24:55,756 --> 00:24:56,756
Shit.

435
00:24:56,952 --> 00:24:59,084
Kick a guy while he's down,
why don't you?

436
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:00,986
It's okay. It's just the movies.

437
00:25:01,106 --> 00:25:03,004
I'm gonna go get them
in a couple minutes.

438
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:04,841
Well, just...

439
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:08,301
You know, tell her to holla back.

440
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:09,461
I will.

441
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:13,411
I wish you'd seen her.

442
00:25:13,531 --> 00:25:16,226
She looked so cute.
She was really nervous.

443
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:17,386
Yeah.

444
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:20,021
What shade of black
did she go with?

445
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:22,451
Don't worry.
She looked beautiful.

446
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:25,822
I'm sure she did.
She takes after her mother that way.

447
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:29,538
Someone's sounding lonely tonight.

448
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,830
Always.

449
00:25:32,892 --> 00:25:34,244
What are you up to?

450
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,214
Nothing. Just...

451
00:25:41,244 --> 00:25:42,244
Reading.

452
00:25:43,586 --> 00:25:44,950
Well, sleep tight.

453
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:47,718
You too.
