00:00:00,762 --> 00:00:01,923
<i>Jericho...</i>

2
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:05,343
<i>A small town in Kansas that witnessed
a series of nuclear attacks</i>

3
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:07,724
<i>that destroyed 23 American cities</i>

4
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:09,639
<i>in a single day.</i>

5
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:16,855
<i>The attacks crippled and
fractured the U.S. government</i>

6
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:19,801
<i>and left our town cut off
from the world.</i>

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,857
- Please help us.
- If it's war, we need to know it.

8
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:29,458
<i>Even in the worst of times,
it's possible to find the best</i>

9
00:00:29,618 --> 00:00:30,846
<i> in ourselves...</i>

10
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:32,425
<i>and in others.</i>

11
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:35,749
<i>Robert Hawkins.</i>

12
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,418
<i>A covert agent who was supposed
to stop the attacks<i>

13
00:00:38,658 --> 00:00:40,795
<i>is now hunted by his former bosses</i>

14
00:00:41,244 --> 00:00:43,040
<i>for the secret he holds.</i>

15
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:44,723
<i>What is that?</i>

16
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:47,437
<i>A nuclear bomb.</i>

17
00:00:48,454 --> 00:00:50,693
Dozens of these things
were used in the attacks?

18
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:53,205
- And you have the last one.
- Evidence.

19
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:55,352
Smoking gun behind
the greatest crime

20
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:57,485
in the history of the world.

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,067
<i>Now, as we're about to be overwhelmed
by a hostile neighboring town,</i>

22
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,194
<i>a new government appears.</i>

23
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:06,279
Based out of Cheyenne, Wyoming.

24
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:10,169
<i>A government with a new face
flying a new flag.</i>

25
00:01:11,793 --> 00:01:12,911
Now!

26
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:16,555
<i>Previously on Jericho:</i>

27
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,252
<i>I'm Major Beck, 10th Mountain Division.</i>

28
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:24,085
The dispute between these two towns
is officially over.

29
00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:27,485
<i>As of this morning,
we've restored power to 70% of town.</i>

30
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:29,593
Jericho's on the fast track
to recovery.

31
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,491
I want you to be Jericho's sheriff.

32
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:34,073
I'd like to tell you not to worry,
but your trial by fire

33
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:36,886
as Jericho's sheriff
is coming sooner rather than later.

34
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:39,267
- How's that?
- The president's on his way.

35
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:55,120
Stanley?

36
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:07,421
Good morning.

37
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,525
What is this?

38
00:02:09,685 --> 00:02:12,653
It's a celebration for your
first day on the job at J & R.

39
00:02:14,457 --> 00:02:16,005
Could you be any sweeter?

40
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:17,905
Probably not.

41
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:22,496
This looks great.

42
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:24,530
I know. This is,

43
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,990
this is a big day.

44
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:30,289
You get to be an accountant again.
Count things, add things up,

45
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:32,512
may be even a little
subtraction, right?

46
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:35,333
I can't wait to work in that office.

47
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:38,367
You wouldn't believe how organized
the J and R people are.

48
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:40,505
Everything is bar-coded.

49
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,418
I have so missed bar codes
and spreadsheets.

50
00:02:43,658 --> 00:02:46,163
I mean, every component
and package and foodstuff,

51
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:48,092
every ounce is accounted for.

52
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:50,537
Where it's been, where it's going.

53
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:54,134
I'd forgotten how beautiful
order can be.

54
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:57,348
It's probably the most boring
story I've heard in months.

55
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,727
No, I love it.

56
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,939
Just a few weeks ago,
we were sitting at this table

57
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:08,470
trying to imagine how to defend our farm
from the next town over, and now...

58
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:12,384
we're sitting here, eating pancakes
with chocolate chips in them,

59
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:15,774
and you're... blabbing on
about tracking packages.

60
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:19,078
We're boring.

61
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:21,122
We are. We're boring.

62
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:22,976
Yeah, we are.

63
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,532
Stanley Richmond?

64
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,870
Ken Calley. I'm the president's
deputy communications director.

65
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:02,798
- The president?
- Yes, ma'am.

66
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:05,430
President Tomarchio wants
to address the nation today

67
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:07,094
From...

68
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:11,786
right here, on your front porch.

69
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:25,284
Let's get the rest of these
cars out of here, all right?

70
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,295
Sheriff Green.

71
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:36,243
Nice uniform.

72
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:39,881
- I'm pacing myself.
- Well, it's a start.

73
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,892
And for today,

74
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:43,663
you've to wear these credentials.

75
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,702
I got deputies rerouting traffic,

76
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:48,004
they going to keep an eye
for anything unusual.

77
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:50,509
Although I think the Secret
Service has got you covered.

78
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:53,882
What do you need me for?
Trying to keep an eye on me?

79
00:04:54,122 --> 00:04:56,642
Local intel always beats eye in the sky.

80
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:59,009
We want to know the
hazards in the area.

81
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:01,939
- Condor's going to be here soon.
- "Condor?"

82
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:04,005
Code name for the president.

83
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:06,142
Biggest bird in the west.

84
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,220
<i>The watchroom is in town hall.</i>

85
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,816
The president will make a stop
at J and R first

86
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:24,131
before heading out to the farm
for the speech.

87
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:26,478
How long's he scheduled
to be on Main Street?

88
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:27,680
20 minutes.

89
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,210
Shake some hands on the rope line,
meet the mayor

90
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,614
That's the best time for us
to make our move.

91
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:35,019
- You got the password yet?
- I will.

92
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:37,732
- How about evac?
- Okay.

93
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,150
Here...

94
00:05:40,197 --> 00:05:41,836
is your escape route.

95
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:43,860
Got transportation here.

96
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:46,476
Diversions here and here.

97
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:49,880
Should give you enough time
to get out on the open road.

98
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:53,066
Just wish we can do this
without getting you burned.

99
00:05:53,306 --> 00:05:55,554
Riding with the army
was for uncovering the truth,

100
00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:57,636
and the truth day is coming to us.

101
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:02,150
All goes well, by this time
tomorrow, I'll be in Texas,

102
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:04,079
and we'll be changing history.

103
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,171
Or we'll be dead.

JERICHO Season 2 - Episode 2

106
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,379
Transcript: www.sub-way.fr

107
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:18,679
Synchro: dmbmh

108
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,299
<i>"Condor"</i>

109
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:29,336
They call this
the White House on wheels.

110
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:32,293
It unloads and reloads
at every stop during the tour.

111
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:35,784
Command and control capabilities that
equals what we had before the attacks.

112
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:37,604
He could fight a war from here.

113
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:41,563
A change of plans.
The president has struck a stop.

114
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:44,708
That ETA of three hours
is now 28 minutes.

115
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,959
Copy that. Lieutenant Parker,

116
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:50,037
take a patrol out
and secure the routes one last time.

117
00:06:50,157 --> 00:06:52,212
Roger that. I'll send them out now.

118
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:54,117
No, I want you to do it, Parker.

119
00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:56,128
We need all eyes out there today.

120
00:06:57,388 --> 00:06:58,515
Yes, sir.

121
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,025
What took you so long?

122
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:14,888
Got a problem.

123
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:17,288
Secret Service cut the last stop short,

124
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:19,527
so the president
will be here in 30 minutes.

125
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:22,447
- We can handle that.
- That's not the problem.

126
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:24,699
Chavez got sent out on patrol.

127
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,269
- Did he get the password?
- I don't know.

128
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:31,748
I mean, if he did, he didn't
have a chance to give it to me.

129
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,749
- What if he's not back in time?
- I thought that he's not going to be.

130
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:41,529
So I'm going to have to do it myself.

131
00:07:42,138 --> 00:07:45,143
How, you'll never get
past all that security.

132
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:48,389
I got to get ahold of one of
their secure walkie-talkies.

133
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,857
I can get one.

134
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:55,473
Baby, this is not eavesdropping
or xeroxing some fax pages.

135
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:58,573
- This is the real thing.
- It's lifting a walkie-talkie

136
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,250
without being noticed.

137
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,898
I can do that.

138
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,908
I didn't realize how much
I let this place go.

139
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:15,855
The glare from the shell casings
really make the window treatments pop.

140
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:20,220
New grass?

141
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:23,134
I'm still trying to make
our wedding registry vital

142
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:24,628
to national security.

143
00:08:24,748 --> 00:08:27,260
You're already planning
our wedding registry?

144
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,059
Since I was 12.

145
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:31,879
And I've taken off the list luxury items
that we already have,

146
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,086
such as your
Star Wars collector glasses.

147
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:37,401
I hope your friends are buying
the high-ticket items because

148
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:40,607
I'm not inviting anybody
who can afford an espresso maker.

149
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:46,219
I'm going to go make sure that
they're not scratching up the floors.

150
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:06,345
It's facial recognition software.

151
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:08,298
Takes a 3D picture of every face,

152
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:11,381
checks them against
the database in the watch office.

153
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:14,559
The flagged ones will be prohibited
from secure areas today.

154
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,266
Since when does a criminal
database cross-reference

155
00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:20,690
people's voter registrations,
DMV files and library records?

156
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,549
September, 2006.

157
00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:25,128
Take a look through the ones we flagged.

158
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:27,608
You know these people better than I do.

159
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:30,491
Let me know if there's anyone
I need to be worried about.

160
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:34,011
I should warn you I might be in there.

161
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:35,585
You aren't.

162
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:37,368
You seen my file?

163
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:40,920
I don't know. A lot of files
come across my desk.

164
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:47,994
Gray, you got a minute?

165
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,610
Sure. I was just going to come
looking for you.

166
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,363
Mr. Calley has asked me
to greet the president.

167
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,985
And I was hoping, Eric, that

168
00:09:57,251 --> 00:09:58,936
you and Jake would join me.

169
00:10:01,592 --> 00:10:04,040
I'm sorry. Am I missing something?

170
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,181
Show him.

171
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:10,050
J and R just received a crate
of these new history textbooks.

172
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:12,450
They'll distribute
by the end of the week.

173
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:14,368
And why is this a problem?

174
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:16,412
Look at the chapter titles.

175
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:20,091
The section after W.W.II is called

176
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:21,999
The Decline and Fall
of the 1st Republic.

177
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:24,889
It talks about how the U.S died
because we got weak.

178
00:10:25,804 --> 00:10:29,331
That the Cuba's Crisis was a failure
because we didn't attack the Russians.

179
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:31,706
That we pulled out
of 'Nam in'75 too early.

180
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:34,338
- I mean, it goes on.
- How should we handle this?

181
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:36,275
I don't know.

182
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:38,484
You don't know?

183
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,594
What can I tell you?
Teach from it or not.

184
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:44,458
It's your classroom. Make a decision.

185
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,350
There's a bigger issue here, Gray.

186
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:48,817
This new government,
first they change the flag,

187
00:10:48,937 --> 00:10:50,321
now our history?

188
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:53,203
At what point is this a country
we don't even recognize?

189
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:55,743
These people have saved
this town from annihilation,

190
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:57,983
to say nothing of the millions of people

191
00:10:58,103 --> 00:11:00,414
who are still alive because of them.

192
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:03,495
I think that earns them
the right to a point of view.

193
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:24,452
Terrorists just keep getting
better looking, don't they?

194
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,948
Can I help you?

195
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,407
- Alex Utley.
- Jake Green.

196
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:32,947
"Modesto Bee", huh?

197
00:11:33,187 --> 00:11:35,241
Second largest paper in California now.

198
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:37,713
Though we had a little help
getting there.

199
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,477
Is that a joke?

200
00:11:40,286 --> 00:11:41,528
Guess not.

201
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:43,104
Friend of yours?

202
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,129
She's a school teacher.

203
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:47,758
Says she's flagged
because of her father.

204
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:49,884
Jonah Prowse.

205
00:11:50,354 --> 00:11:51,838
What did he do?

206
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:53,733
He runs a road gang in the area.

207
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:57,293
Though I'm not sure why
that makes her a threat.

208
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:01,248
Well, I think they'd say that there's
no such thing as being too careful.

209
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:05,605
You reporting on them or for them?

210
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:07,411
Yes.

211
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:25,957
<i>Break, break. Condor is arriving.</i>

212
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:27,583
<i>Condor is arriving.</i>

213
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:38,530
One seconde, sir!

214
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:49,697
Mr. President! Mr. President!

215
00:13:23,144 --> 00:13:24,499
- I got it.
- Okay.

216
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:28,020
I need you to give me as much time
as you can before you let them find it.

217
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,219
Okay, you head back to town hall.
I'm not far behind.

218
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,815
- What's going on?
- I don't know what you mean.

219
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:38,079
I just saw Darcy put something
in her purse, back in the watch office.

220
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:39,740
Now what are you up to?

221
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,068
Jake Green!

222
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:45,687
We're missing a secure walkie-talkie.

223
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:48,018
Did you take it from the watch office?

224
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:50,497
- No.
- Let's go. Turn around.

225
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:58,238
Utley, on your feet.
You were there as well.

226
00:13:58,358 --> 00:14:00,212
- I'll assume the position.
- Let's go.

227
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,917
Sir. Nobody told you to move.

228
00:14:09,793 --> 00:14:11,417
<i>The sheriff and the reporter are clean.</i>

229
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:12,629
Copy that.

230
00:14:13,512 --> 00:14:15,846
Mayor Anderson, good to
finally meet you.

231
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:17,064
Mr. President.

232
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,218
Eric Green.

233
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:21,578
My condolences on your loss.

234
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:23,576
Your father sounded
like a wonderful man.

235
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:25,327
Wish I could have known him.

236
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,314
Thank you.

237
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,939
I have to tell you guys,
I am truly humbled

238
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:32,144
at the sacrifices you've all endured.

239
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,321
I think the country
needs to hear this story.

240
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,031
Mayor...

241
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:38,548
would you consider
representing the area

242
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,915
at the upcoming
constitutional convention?

243
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:44,354
- Constitutional convention?
- We have an opportunity

244
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:47,308
to write the next chapter
in American history,

245
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,876
the triumph of democracy
over the forces of evil.

246
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,270
Think about it.

247
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,732
We'll need good men like you guys
to help keep this country strong.

248
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:57,359
Well, thank you, sir.
I'm... I'm honored.

249
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,847
Crash, Condor.
Repeat: crash, Condor.

250
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:03,146
<i>Crash, Condor. Crash, Condor.</i>

251
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:09,590
<i>- Condor is secure.</i>
- Yes, sir.

252
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:13,113
I've got confirmation.
Condor is secure at the Citadel.

253
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:15,699
Checkmate is moving
to Billboard, copy that?

254
00:15:16,378 --> 00:15:18,724
Schultz, please confirm
you have the new positions.

255
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:44,073
Darcy, hold it.

256
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:50,653
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

257
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:53,569
Just didn't want you wandering
outside the office. We're in a crash.

258
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:56,001
- What's a crash?
- Secret Service procedure.

259
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:59,126
If the principle's in jeopardy,
they freeze everyone where they are.

260
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,882
A secure walkie went missing
about 15 minutes ago.

261
00:16:02,122 --> 00:16:04,399
Until that's recovered,
we stay put.

262
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:35,363
Have a seat.
This will take a few minutes.

263
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,214
Isn't this something
you should be covering?

264
00:16:41,477 --> 00:16:44,258
No. Cheyenne doesn't like
incidents like this covered.

265
00:16:44,498 --> 00:16:46,260
And they control my credentials.

266
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:49,535
What the hell kind
of reporter are you?

267
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:51,525
The working kind.

268
00:16:51,903 --> 00:16:54,888
That's your idea of being a journalist,
not making waves?

269
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:58,460
Let me ask you this:
you heard of the Hudson virus?

270
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:01,242
Yeah, from the news.
They stopped it at the Mississippi.

271
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:03,727
They don't want a panic,
so they won't let us publish

272
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,991
reports that it's already
jumped the blue line.

273
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:08,355
- The blue line?
- Yeah, for the Mississippi.

274
00:17:08,475 --> 00:17:11,048
It's got U.N. peacekeepers
all up and down it.

275
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:16,431
So nobody's reporting the real news,
and that get you off the hook?

276
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:22,463
I was working for the L.A Times
before the attacks. I won 2 Pulitzers,

277
00:17:22,703 --> 00:17:25,017
so I got a good idea
about being a journalist.

278
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,301
And they don't exist anymore.

279
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:33,618
Is your mother going to come out
to the farm for the speech?

280
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:36,649
She just left.

281
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,325
Went to Cedar Brook

282
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:41,741
to stay with some family we contacted
after the roads were cleared.

283
00:17:42,734 --> 00:17:45,269
It couldn't be easy for
her to be around her anymore.

284
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:47,029
You should be glad she's not here.

285
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:49,740
She'd through that history book
in the president's face.

286
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,300
- Come on.
- He wasn't elected, Gray.

287
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:56,121
How does a government no one voted for
change the Constitution?

288
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:58,319
We found time to have an election.

289
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:02,621
Of all people, I think
you would remember that.

290
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:07,169
So you're a real reporter, huh?

291
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:11,253
The news also says that the attacks
were North Korean weapons

292
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:12,959
financed by Iran.

293
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,958
- Is that the whole story?
- Well, there's...

294
00:18:16,118 --> 00:18:18,248
plenty of theories
out there to pick from.

295
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,194
- What's yours?
- I'm not a conspiracy nut.

296
00:18:21,354 --> 00:18:24,036
Let me guess,
you know a guy who knows a guy...

297
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:28,514
Now, what if there were
more to that story? What if...?

298
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:32,241
What if we had nuked 2 countries
who had not attacking us?

299
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:35,011
What if a guy wrote an expose
about the appalling gaps

300
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:37,609
in port security,
three years before the attacks,

301
00:18:37,729 --> 00:18:41,145
and it ended up on page C-18
because it didn't have any zazz?

302
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:44,458
- People get the news they deserve.
- They get the news they're given.

303
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:46,779
It just takes someone willing
to give it to them.

304
00:18:49,765 --> 00:18:52,103
When I was a kid, two guys
took down the White House

305
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:54,972
with a typewriter
because people listened.

306
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,254
They got angry, they acted.

307
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,165
If I thought anybody was willing
to listen anymore, I'd be talking.

308
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:52,498
Ma'am, I'd like to take a look
inside your purse.

309
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:55,866
Is that really necessary?

310
00:19:57,211 --> 00:19:58,526
Yes, sir, it is.

311
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,876
You searched the entire office, huh?

312
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:57,235
All stations on the net.
This is Citadel Two.

313
00:20:57,642 --> 00:21:00,485
We found the radio.
Repeat: the radio is secure.

314
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:01,835
<i>Copy that.</i>

315
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,135
Crash is over.
They found the walkie-talkie.

316
00:21:07,255 --> 00:21:09,356
- Where?
- It was in the sheriff's office.

317
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:12,318
They're pretty embarrassed.
Had the whole group out looking.

318
00:21:14,242 --> 00:21:16,653
And a light staff at the watch office.

319
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:21,212
He caused the crash on purpose.

320
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:22,727
What?

321
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:02,105
Halt!

322
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:04,703
Hold it!

323
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:12,293
Find Hawkins.

324
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:49,060
You had a guy inside Beck's
camp, and you didn't tell me?

325
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,389
- He hurt one of my deputies.
- What makes you think that?

326
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:54,575
Before Beck arrested him,
he attacked me,

327
00:22:54,695 --> 00:22:56,263
and he told me to find you.

328
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:04,308
Check your pockets.

329
00:23:05,337 --> 00:23:06,460
Check them.

330
00:23:11,575 --> 00:23:12,671
Okay.

331
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:15,315
What's going on?

332
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:18,058
There were some very important
files in that watch room,

333
00:23:18,178 --> 00:23:19,423
and I copied them,

334
00:23:19,543 --> 00:23:23,215
but my guy inside, Chavez,
he couldn't get the password to me

335
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,164
to open them, so he gave it to you.

336
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:27,489
I told him if he was in trouble,
he could trust you.

337
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:29,121
This is all about files?

338
00:23:29,361 --> 00:23:31,845
A conspiracy this big
leaves footprints, Jake.

339
00:23:34,274 --> 00:23:35,276
Thank you.

340
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:38,951
You know, immediately after the attacks,

341
00:23:39,111 --> 00:23:41,444
the 23 blast sites were
tested by the military

342
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:44,486
to determine the origin of the
fissile material in the bombs.

343
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,972
The results said

344
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:49,711
the bombs were milled in North Korea.

345
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,771
Are you saying
they falsified the results?

346
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,342
Yes. But somewhere in here
are the original results.

347
00:24:05,224 --> 00:24:06,392
Here.

348
00:24:08,354 --> 00:24:10,370
The plutonium was
milled in Seversk.

349
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:13,045
That bomb wasn't from North Korea.

350
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,339
It's an ex-Soviet nuke.

351
00:24:17,968 --> 00:24:20,379
This is proof they lied
about the attacks.

352
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:23,050
Well, this is just the paper trail.

353
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,393
Your bomb is the hard evidence.

354
00:24:25,513 --> 00:24:28,057
Unfortunately, getting
that evidence out is impossible.

355
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,948
What do you mean out? Out where?

356
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,184
Texas. They're close to joining
Cheyenne, and if they do that,

357
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:35,708
Cheyenne is going to be
too strong for us to bring down.

358
00:24:35,828 --> 00:24:38,086
So we have to make sure
that that does not happen.

359
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:39,758
Now, where did they take Chavez?

360
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,778
They're holding him in a lockup for now.

361
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,436
I heard they were going
to transfer him to a place called

362
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:45,653
Loomer Ridge.

363
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:48,242
That is a supermax
prison in Colorado.

364
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:50,881
- A place you don't come back from.
- He's well-guarded.

365
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:53,721
I'm not going to risk the greater
mission trying to rescue him,

366
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:56,104
but Chavez had the contacts in Texas.

367
00:24:56,882 --> 00:24:58,969
I gotta find a way
of getting this information

368
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:00,879
to the right people by myself.

369
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:03,497
Are you going to drive
to Texas with a bomb

370
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:05,300
looking for someone you don't know?

371
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,563
You know, when you
put it like that, Jake...

372
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,860
There may be another way
to get the information out.

373
00:25:13,252 --> 00:25:15,727
- There's a reporter.
- The media is in Cheyenne's pocket.

374
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:17,465
This one may be different.

375
00:25:17,732 --> 00:25:20,685
Let me feel him out.
I'll keep you insulated, all right?

376
00:25:21,413 --> 00:25:23,344
Unless you can think of a better way.

377
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:28,046
I've been trusting you,
and now it's time you trust me.

378
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:35,499
That's a lot of information
to take on faith.

379
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,128
- You can't give me your source?
- No, not yet.

380
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:41,957
First you have to convince your paper
to publish the information.

381
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:45,121
I've got to know you're going
to follow this through to the end.

382
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:47,652
- I don't know.
- What don't you know?

383
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,929
God. This is the biggest news
story in American history.

384
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:53,306
It's going to make a god-awful mess.

385
00:25:53,546 --> 00:25:55,261
It is a god-awful mess.

386
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:00,271
All right, let me call my editors now.

387
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:02,849
On a government-issued phone?
Are you crazy?

388
00:26:04,617 --> 00:26:07,443
You have to leave the press pool.
You can't talk to anyone.

389
00:26:07,563 --> 00:26:09,427
Drive straight through to Modesto.

390
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,702
You want me to sit on the biggest
news in history for 2 days?

391
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,562
Yeah. That part's non negotiable.

392
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:16,504
But you can drive as fast as you want.

393
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:23,146
Are you in?

394
00:26:26,562 --> 00:26:28,400
Two guys and a typewriter, huh?

395
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:45,412
- Trish!
- Mr. Richmond.

396
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:48,703
Mr. Richmond's my dad. I'm Stanley.

397
00:26:48,863 --> 00:26:50,738
Stanley, I'm pretty busy.

398
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:53,825
Here's the thing.
I kind of need a favor.

399
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:59,789
No, he's not annoying.
I really in busy.

400
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:06,087
Yeah. It's mandatory for all
Jennings and Rall managers

401
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:09,639
to learn many languages,
so I picked sign language.

402
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,910
Okay, so, about this favor.

403
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,210
I hear you are really good
at tracking things, so I need...

404
00:27:28,556 --> 00:27:30,070
She scares me.

405
00:27:34,823 --> 00:27:36,660
Okay, so, what's the favor?

406
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:43,626
Stand down, gentlemen.

407
00:27:51,957 --> 00:27:54,148
What was in that room
that was so important?

408
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:01,619
This is probably your last chance
to tell me what's going on

409
00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:04,468
before somebody drops you
in a hole somewhere, Parker.

410
00:28:05,214 --> 00:28:06,773
If that's even your real name.

411
00:28:11,051 --> 00:28:12,529
We fought together.

412
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:14,622
At least tell me who you are.

413
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:18,706
I'm a dead man.

414
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,035
- Lieutenant!
- Sir.

415
00:28:27,652 --> 00:28:30,546
Send his prints to Camp Liberty.
We'll find out who he is soon.

416
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:31,654
Yes, sir.

417
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,915
I'm headed to the farm for the speech.
You want a ride?

418
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:47,245
I'll meet you out there.
What is all this?

419
00:28:47,405 --> 00:28:49,424
Some guy had a heart attack at Bailey's.

420
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:51,328
He was dead when we found him.

421
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:53,653
I'll see you there.

422
00:28:56,224 --> 00:28:57,278
Hold up.

423
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:21,375
Citizens of Jericho,

424
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:24,311
I am honored to be standing
here today with you

425
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,436
on this most hallowed ground.

426
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:29,592
Those who died here gave their blood

427
00:29:29,752 --> 00:29:31,811
to protect our lives and liberties.

428
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:34,559
And so we honor them.

429
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:38,735
Detail, present colors.

430
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:01,471
It's over.

431
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:05,173
He's dead.

432
00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:09,854
The reporter's dead.

433
00:30:43,814 --> 00:30:46,433
Accept this on behalf
of a grateful nation.

434
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,273
Arms port!

435
00:30:55,468 --> 00:30:57,659
Aim! Fire!

436
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,987
Aim! Fire!

437
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:06,460
Aim! Fire!

438
00:31:16,937 --> 00:31:18,137
They killed him.

439
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:21,830
Why didn't they kill me?

440
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,467
Well, if they suspected you were
a threat, they would have.

441
00:31:25,493 --> 00:31:27,650
Best guess, the reporter
called his paper

442
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,835
to prep them for the exposé
on the new government,

443
00:31:30,995 --> 00:31:32,801
and the call was intercepted.

444
00:31:35,836 --> 00:31:38,882
We need to get ahold of that phone log.
I want to know who he talked to.

445
00:31:39,002 --> 00:31:41,861
- And I want an autopsy.
- You will never see that body again,

446
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:45,403
and we're lucky he isn't alive,
'cause he would have given us up.

447
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:49,011
<i>You've lost loved ones,</i>

448
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:50,832
and here you are again.

449
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:53,710
Still strong, still proud.

450
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:56,822
This is the best of America.

451
00:31:58,487 --> 00:32:00,423
But infighting has left us weak

452
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:02,755
and vulnerable to our enemies.

453
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:07,555
Remnants of the old government
have fallen back to Columbus, Ohio.

454
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,545
After the attacks, that government

455
00:32:10,705 --> 00:32:13,400
endlessly debated our response.

456
00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:16,356
So, in a vacuum of leadership,

457
00:32:16,596 --> 00:32:18,456
I acted to the world know

458
00:32:18,616 --> 00:32:21,117
that America was down but not out.

459
00:32:24,957 --> 00:32:27,242
- We can't let them go with this.
- They already have.

460
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:29,963
I have got to figure out
what I'm going to do now.

461
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,596
You figure out what you're going to do,
I can't let this go.

462
00:32:34,892 --> 00:32:37,375
Jake, I need you not to be
my problem right now.

463
00:32:40,647 --> 00:32:42,993
<i>The federal government
of the eastern bloc states</i>

464
00:32:43,153 --> 00:32:46,338
no longer has any governing authority
beyond the Mississippi.

465
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:49,411
You've seen the flag.

466
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:52,225
This is the flag of a new country.

467
00:32:52,822 --> 00:32:55,420
Flying from the Mississippi
to the Pacific.

468
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:58,187
The 13 stripes of red and white

469
00:32:58,347 --> 00:33:00,372
still represent the 13 colonies,

470
00:33:00,698 --> 00:33:02,657
but they run in a new direction.

471
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:06,683
Just as we... must chart
a new direction for ourselves.

472
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:11,044
In a few short weeks,
Mayor Anderson will represent you

473
00:33:11,204 --> 00:33:14,264
as we ratify a constitution
for this new nation.

474
00:33:14,424 --> 00:33:16,952
That will be known to the world
by a new name.

475
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:19,080
"The Allied States of America."

476
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:25,504
And with this new name, a clean slate.

477
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:27,664
Our debts have been forgiven,

478
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:30,441
and we are open again for business.

479
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:33,718
That means jobs, stocked shelves,

480
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:36,185
a return to life as we knew it.

481
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:38,651
And in the fall, we'll have elections,

482
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:41,399
where we can all take part
in building a new government.

483
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:44,196
As a safer, stronger America.

484
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,765
God bless you, and God bless
the Allied States of America.

485
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,307
- Where are you taking him?
- He's being transferred.

486
00:34:05,605 --> 00:34:06,961
Son of a bitch!

487
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,674
Pull him off!

488
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:13,317
Get him out of here.

489
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:16,604
Nobody wants to do that more than me.

490
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:18,803
He put one of my men
in the hospital, too.

491
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:20,346
Oh, he'll get his due.

492
00:34:20,506 --> 00:34:21,934
I assure you.

493
00:34:33,936 --> 00:34:36,939
- Lieutenant.
- Sir, the info on Parker is back.

494
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:38,764
He's dead.

495
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,625
- What do you mean?
- I mean Parker's identity

496
00:34:41,785 --> 00:34:43,472
belong to a dead soldier.

497
00:34:43,632 --> 00:34:45,615
"RF Parker, US Army,
killed in action,

498
00:34:45,775 --> 00:34:48,740
"Jalabad, Afghanistan, 11 May, 2003."

499
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:52,661
He's black ops.

500
00:34:56,288 --> 00:34:58,417
Echo Three, this is Echo One, over.

501
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:02,055
<i>I need a SitRep now on the transport</i>

502
00:35:02,215 --> 00:35:04,054
<i>of Lieutenant Parker to Loomer Ridge.</i>

503
00:35:05,182 --> 00:35:08,761
<i>I repeat, Echo Three, this is Echo One.
Come in. Over.</i>

504
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:23,747
You left this at the farm.

505
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:33,577
You didn't even ask him one question.

506
00:35:34,168 --> 00:35:35,592
All you did was say yes.

507
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,823
Well, I want to go to that convention,

508
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:40,963
and interrogating the president

509
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:43,214
is a good way to make sure
that never happens.

510
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,723
Safe travels.

511
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:51,082
Eric, wait.

512
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,840
It was my dad's.

513
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:14,987
Hung in his old office before
the renovations.

514
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,141
I thought it was lost.

515
00:36:20,674 --> 00:36:23,686
Yeah, I found it in storage
when the army need the space.

516
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:25,822
I thought about

517
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:29,937
bringing down here and hanging it up,
but it just isn't...

518
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:32,585
... me.

519
00:36:36,373 --> 00:36:38,993
I'm going to Cheyenne
to ask those questions.

520
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,200
And I'm going to keep asking
the questions until I get some answers.

521
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:46,537
I just don't want them to see me coming.

522
00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:50,256
And I was hoping that

523
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:52,124
while I was gone,

524
00:36:52,284 --> 00:36:54,273
that you'd be willing
to act as mayor.

525
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:59,243
And try not to get us
into too much trouble.

526
00:37:03,997 --> 00:37:06,689
<i>What has happened today
is unacceptable.</i>

527
00:37:07,104 --> 00:37:08,596
I understand, sir.

528
00:37:09,105 --> 00:37:10,754
<i>How did your men lose him?</i>

529
00:37:10,914 --> 00:37:12,443
I don't know, sir.

530
00:37:12,683 --> 00:37:14,732
There's absolutely no record
of him existing.

531
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,310
Either through fingerprints or DNA.

532
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:20,756
Not to mention that every piece
of paper with his name or picture

533
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:22,450
has disappeared from my CP.

534
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:25,958
<i>How's your search for Sarah Mason going?</i>

535
00:37:28,597 --> 00:37:29,954
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

536
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:31,884
<i>You're overwhelmed.</i>

537
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:36,500
<i>I'm sending you a private contractor
who knows the area.</i>

538
00:37:37,403 --> 00:37:40,179
<i>He'll take care of the day-to-day
administration of the town</i>

539
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:42,741
<i>while you find the terrorist.</i>

540
00:37:57,741 --> 00:37:58,972
Jake.

541
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:05,101
I've been racking my brain,
trying to figure out

542
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:08,253
how a handcuffed prisoner

543
00:38:09,297 --> 00:38:12,086
guarded by three soldiers,
escape from the back of a Humvee.

544
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:16,735
Any ideas?

545
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:19,070
I heard he was as spook.

546
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,856
Figured he picked the lock on his cuffs
and fought his way out.

547
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:26,445
Sounds plausible.

548
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:28,138
I should have thought of that.

549
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:31,805
Thanks for your help today.
It's appreciated.

550
00:38:42,674 --> 00:38:44,177
A little help here.

551
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,040
What's going on?

552
00:38:56,677 --> 00:38:57,715
Tell me what?

553
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,775
Nothing, there's nothing to tell.

554
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,415
What did you find?

555
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:24,932
Nothing.

556
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,817
I mean, we found your
father's second cousin

557
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:30,998
on a census in Indiana, but the area
had already been evacuated.

558
00:39:31,546 --> 00:39:33,547
And there was a woman
with the same last name

559
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,336
in a nearby refugee camp.

560
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,196
But she wasn't related.

561
00:39:44,903 --> 00:39:46,096
Thank you.

562
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:50,396
I'm sorry.

563
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:55,757
Sorry. I really wanted you
to have your family at the wedding.

564
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,105
I will.

565
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:07,680
You're my family.

566
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:13,066
You and Bonnie...

567
00:40:13,226 --> 00:40:14,569
from here on in.

568
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:39,503
Thank Jake for me.

569
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:42,668
You were right about him.
He's got good hands.

570
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:45,702
Just wish he learned to pull
his punches a little better.

571
00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:46,822
Me, too.

572
00:40:48,266 --> 00:40:49,869
So Darcy scrubbed the office.

573
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,252
There have not pictures
to trace you with.

574
00:40:52,372 --> 00:40:55,252
- That's a good woman you got there.
- So she keeps telling me.

575
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:57,656
You got everything you need?

576
00:40:57,816 --> 00:40:59,472
A car, map?

577
00:40:59,632 --> 00:41:01,422
Actually, I got something for you.

578
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:05,077
Phone's clean.

579
00:41:05,237 --> 00:41:07,720
When I get to Texas and meet up
with my contacts, I'll call.

580
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,677
I'll be waiting.

581
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:14,130
Say, hey...

582
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:17,355
You ever heard of a project Boxcar?

583
00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:20,619
- No. What is it?
- There was a file on the flash drive.

584
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:23,133
It was the only thing
the password wouldn't open.

585
00:41:24,074 --> 00:41:26,990
That's strange. That password
should open everything on that disk.

586
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:30,863
I guess I'll keep working on it.

587
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:35,441
Remember when this job used to be easy?

588
00:41:36,485 --> 00:41:37,485
No.

589
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,239
Did you,

590
00:42:15,758 --> 00:42:17,308
did you hear about your brother?

591
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,964
Gray appointed me
acting mayor in his absence.

592
00:42:28,365 --> 00:42:29,795
Mayor Green.

593
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,418
Nice to hear that again, huh?

594
00:42:53,095 --> 00:42:54,378
Long day?

595
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:57,210
Yeah. Things with Beck
are getting pretty dicey.

596
00:42:58,658 --> 00:43:00,131
Well, we've dealt with worse.

597
00:43:00,462 --> 00:43:01,863
We're still here.

598
00:43:04,622 --> 00:43:05,900
We can handle it.

599
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,526
Major Beck, 10thMountain Division.

600
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:23,184
You Goetz?

601
00:43:23,497 --> 00:43:25,323
Tactical operations officer.

602
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:26,701
I'll take it from here.
