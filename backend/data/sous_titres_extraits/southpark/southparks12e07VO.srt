South Park - Season 12 Episode 7
"Super Fun Time"

2
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:35,447


3
00:00:35,707 --> 00:00:37,449
Kids, everyone together.

4
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:39,660
Welcome to Pioneer Village.

5
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,723
This is a recreation
of early Colorado days.

6
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:45,222
I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul.

7
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:47,674
Hi, kids, and welcome to my village.

8
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:51,671
I settled here in 1864
with my ma and pa.

9
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:56,468
Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange
clothes like you all are wearin'.

10
00:00:56,728 --> 00:01:00,594
And what's that fancy yellow
horse carriage you got out there?

11
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,110
This is gonna suck.

12
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,784
When you all are ready
just head up to the village.

13
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:08,770
All the townsfolk are
there to answer yer questions.

14
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,935
And welcome. To 1864.

15
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:13,174
Set 'em up!

16
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,915
Thank you, Pioneer Paul.
All right, kids, this is a big place,

17
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,385
so I want everyone to pick
a partner to hold hands with.

18
00:01:21,913 --> 00:01:24,742
- Let's be partners, Kenny.
- (No, I'm partners with Craig.)

19
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:25,862
Okay.

20
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,659
- Stan, let's be partners, dude.
- Naw, I'm with Wendy.

21
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:32,253
You wanna hold hands
with a girl? Gaywad!

22
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:38,194
- All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
- I hate you, remember?

23
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:41,513
- You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
- Jesus, what have I ever done to you?

24
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:45,016
Craig? Token? Who else needs a partner?

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,110
Uh who else needs a partner?

26
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,020
- Eric, partner with Butters.
- Goddamnit!

27
00:01:58,354 --> 00:02:01,327
- Hold Butters' hand, Eric!
- That isn't necessary!

28
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:03,839
Butters, you are not
to let go of Eric's hand

29
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,464
until you are both back on that bus!
Do you understand?

30
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,284
- I understand.
- All right, let's head in.

31
00:02:10,718 --> 00:02:12,798
- You can let go now, Butters.
- No.

32
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:14,718
- Butters, come on!
- No!

33
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:19,401
All right kids, go ahead and visit
the charming villagers and learn stuff.

34
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:21,371
Keep track of your partner!

35
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:26,144
Why howdy partners.
I'm the town blacksmith.

36
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:30,064
Are you folks settlers, or are you
just trappers passin' through?

37
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,075
Uh, look, can we just drop
the whole roleplaying thing?

38
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,657
I would play along,
but my girlfriend's here

39
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:36,449
and I don't wanna look like
a total dork in front of her.

40
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,985
- Thanks, Stan.
- These folks sure are strange, Smithy.

41
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:44,020
We ain't never seen them kind
of fancy hats in our time, have we?

42
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:47,203
That guy is wearing a digital watch.

43
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:49,021
Oh jeez.

44
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:52,516
- Damnit Chad!
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

45
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:56,087
Why howdy, partners,
I'm the town gunsmith.

46
00:02:56,461 --> 00:03:00,980
You see, in our time it's pretty
violent. See them holes in the walls?

47
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,679
That's so we can put rifles
through to protect us from Indians.

48
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:06,431
I wanna shoot an Indian.

49
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:09,949
Now some of you might wanna meet
Abigail at the candle-makin' house.

50
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:12,719
Or you can head over
to the general store.

51
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:18,698
- You see any Indians?
- Nah, it's just the city and-

52
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:21,196
Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.

53
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:25,033
"Super... Phun Thyme."

54
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:30,036
Dude, check it out! We're only
two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme!

55
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:32,040
They've got video games
and rides and everything!

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,827
Oh, that's cool. Well come on, Eric,
we need to catch up with everyone.

57
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:37,283
Dude, screw this place!
We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!

58
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:40,385
Oh no! I'm not sneaking out!
I'll get in trouble!

59
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:41,633
Fine, then let go of my hand!

60
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:44,119
Teacher said I can't let
go till we're back on the bus!

61
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,429
Well which is it gonna be, Butters?

62
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,264
Are you gonna ditch out with me
or disobey the teacher's stupid rule?

63
00:03:48,384 --> 00:03:49,984
I'm not letting go!

64
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,101
- Fine, then you're coming with me!
- No, Eric!

65
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,273
Butters, let go God-damnit!

66
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:56,992
No! Teacher! Teacher!

67
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:00,766
This here is our general store.

68
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:03,404
It's where I buy all
my supplies an' sich.

69
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:07,381
Howdy partners.
I own this here general store.

70
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,018
Look, Stan,
they had beef jerky back then.

71
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:12,183
What do you mean "back then"?

72
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:15,166
Don't forget, it's 1864.

73
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:20,082
- Right. Except for it really isn't.
- Sure it is. Just look around ye.

74
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:25,218
- What's that?
- Sounds like police sirens.

75
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:26,828
What's a si-rene?

76
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:30,682
We ain't never heard
of no sirene in 1864.

77
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:38,357
We lost them, we lost them!

78
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:40,650
- Damn pig cops!
- Close that gate!

79
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:45,192
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

80
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:47,412
Everyone down on the ground now!

81
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:51,051
Wuh-whoa now, I'm Sheriff McLawdog.

82
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:53,601
I settled here back in eighteen fif-

83
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:56,431
Jesus Christ!

84
00:04:57,248 --> 00:04:59,335
We've gotta call the police.
Where's your phone?

85
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:04,299
A phone? Why, what's a phone?
We ain't never hearda sich a thing.

86
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:06,342
- What?
- Come on, this is serious!

87
00:05:06,602 --> 00:05:10,534
Storehand, you ever heard
of this fancy smancy phone?

88
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:14,309
Uh, no. We ain't got
a phone in our time.

89
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:18,062
Dude, they just shot a guy in the face!
We've gotta call the cops!

90
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:22,592
If you mean the law, only law
around here is town sheriff McLawdog.

91
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:26,779
You see, 1864 is a time of
growth and development in the Old West.

92
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,990
This is not the time for that!

93
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:32,252
Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!

94
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:38,045
Butters, if you don't let go of my hand,
everyone here is gonna think we're gay!

95
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,965
Well, that's your problem!

96
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,249
All right Butters,
I've seriously had... enough!

97
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:47,426
Jesus Christ!

98
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:51,654
- One please.
- Make that two!

99
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:55,350
Aw, aren't you two cute holding hands.
Are you special little buddies?

100
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,782
No!

101
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:05,364
Dude, this place shreds!
What should we do first?

102
00:06:05,484 --> 00:06:08,435
We should get back to Pioneer Village,
that's what we should do!

103
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:11,386
Butters, we're going to get back
before anybody even notices we're gone.

104
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:13,456
Let's go hit the bumper cars!

105
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:17,748
Over here. This looks like an office.

106
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:23,628
- Here! Here's the phone!
- Well, what a strange contraption.

107
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:25,712
I can't get a dial tone.

108
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:28,620
- What's the number to dial out?
- "Dila out"?

109
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,386
Partner, them are some
funny words you're using.

110
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:33,262
Dude, do you understand
what's going on here?

111
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:37,672
Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean,
this is a special circumstance that-

112
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,812


113
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:42,456
Oh, I mean,

114
00:06:42,865 --> 00:06:45,407
this here room is, it sure is strange.

115
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,761
We have nothin' like these
fancy devices in our time.

116
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:49,946
I'll say.

117
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:53,574
- I got through. Hello, police?
- Nine one one, what's your emergency?

118
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,382
There's some terrorists or
bankrobbers or something

119
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,912
that have taken our class hostage!
- Taken hostage where?

120
00:06:58,172 --> 00:06:59,789
The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.

121
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:02,834
You mean that annoying place
where employees won't break character?

122
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:05,628
Sister, you don't know the half of it.

123
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:09,324


124
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:12,607
Check it out, dude, I'm a space man!

125
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:14,753
Space man, yes!

126
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:18,520
<i>I'm having a super fun time playing</i>

127
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,436
Get that guy! Shoot that guy!
Yeah, and then ever here!

128
00:07:23,124 --> 00:07:24,674
Oh, you got it. Nice.

129
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,642
<i>Super fun time, please don't go away</i>

130
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:35,634
What are you ogling at?

131
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:39,036
<i>No more worries or cares, super fun time</i>

132
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:40,705
- Oh man, whoa!
- Whoa!

133
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:44,169
<i>The answer to my prayers, super fun time</i>

134
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:48,491
<i>Super fun time, you're all I need</i>

135
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:51,249
Yeah, we're wired up!

136
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,926
<i>I'll have a super fun
time till I freaking bleed</i>

137
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,389
<i>I want you morning noon
and night, super fun time</i>

138
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:00,399
Yeah, bumper cars, sweet!

139
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:03,435
<i>You make my life so right,
super fun time</i>

140
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:05,687
That's it, Eric.
We have to be getting back!

141
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:07,822
- Aw, just a few more things.
- No!

142
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:10,307
If we don't leave right now,
we're gonna miss the bus,

143
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:12,481
and then they'll know we left!

144
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:15,239
I guess you're right, Butters.
All right, come on.

145
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:20,036
Set up the satellite relay, check
for alternate routes out of the area.

146
00:08:20,296 --> 00:08:22,477
Unfortunately, your police department

147
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:24,707
got wind of our robbery
and chased after us.

148
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:28,816
That is unfortunate for you, because
when I think it is clear to leave

149
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:31,223
we will now need
to take hostages with us

150
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,966
to ensure our goods get
to their final destination.

151
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:35,796
Please, if you must take anyone,

152
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,866
don't take me.
These kids are worth more to you.

153
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:42,058
How did they find us?

154
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:45,061
Get the loot out of the car
and stash it in that building.

155
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:53,081
All right, men, listen up! Looks like
our thieves are trying to hide out here.

156
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:56,072
They've got the employees
and some school kids held hostage.

157
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:58,047
Tucker, Dylan, set up a perimeter!

158
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:01,230
Everyone stay on your toes! These are
professionals we're dealing with here!

159
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,000
What did they rob, sir?

160
00:09:03,303 --> 00:09:04,541
A Burger King.

161
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:10,128
- All right, good. Is that all of it?
- No. Don't forget we've got these too.

162
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:14,234
Excellent. Now listen, everyone,
we're going to be all right.

163
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,300
This is only a small hitch in our plan.

164
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,030
I'd like to speak
with the chief of police!

165
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:23,646
Who is this?

166
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:26,821
This is the man who Is going to
kill an entire class of fourth graders

167
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,661
if he doesn't get exactly what he wants!

168
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:38,681
- Why aren't the cops coming in?
- They must be negotiating.

169
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:41,200
Them there bandits
sure look mighty strange.

170
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,119
And them pistols is
bigger than whats we gots.

171
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:46,907
- Will you shut up!
- Wait, you have guns here?

172
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:49,753
Sure. Sheriff got lots
of rifles in his office.

173
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:52,110
Well why don't you go get
them and bring them back here?

174
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,135
- All righty. Come on, storehand.
- Yepper!

175
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,783
Oh man, I can't wait to see
the look on Kyle's face

176
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:00,811
when we tell him we had super fun time,

177
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:02,650
while he was at the
dumb Pioneer Village.

178
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,670
We're not telling anybody!
I don't wanna get in trouble!

179
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,373
And I didn't have
a super fun time anyways.

180
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:09,991
Butters, you've gotta learn to chill.

181
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:13,240
Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't
stop and look around once in a while,

182
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,735
and do whatever you want all
the time, you could miss it.

183
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:18,255
Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.

184
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,466
- Crap, they called the cops on us.
- What?

185
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:26,371
- They called the cops?
- They must have realized we left. Damn.

186
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,414
Oh my God,
the police are looking for us!

187
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:30,827
- Butters!
- We're gonna get it now!

188
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:32,984
Butters, calm down!
I know a way out of this!

189
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:35,501
You just got me busted forever!

190
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,585
- Butters, listen to me, listen.
- No!

191
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,345
All we have to do is sneak back
inside without the cops seeing us.

192
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:44,278
Then we can say we
were inside all along.

193
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:48,868
You said they wouldn't notice
we were gone. You promised.

194
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,766
If we sneak back inside,
we can say we never left, all right?

195
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,733
All right, now let go of my hand.

196
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:00,027
- No.
- Butters?

197
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:04,497
You made me break one rule, I'm not
breaking the other! It's all I have now!

198
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:06,299
All right, come on!

199
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:09,810
Keep the hostages from
talking and search for holdouts.

200
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,291
Everyone check in
at two-minute intervals.

201
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:14,768
I hope you have good news, Orlich.

202
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:17,665
The police have us completely
surrounded on all sides.

203
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:20,411
There's no way we're getting
out above ground without being spotted.

204
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:21,756
Above ground?

205
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:24,470
Look, I found this
at the rear of the park.

206
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,656
It's an old mine shaft, but Pioneer
Village was sued when a kid died in it,

207
00:11:28,776 --> 00:11:30,244
so they closed it down and protected it

208
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:32,353
with a huge metal door
with a coded lock.

209
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:36,003
So if we can get into the shaft,
we can tunnel our way around the police.

210
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:37,123
Excellent.

211
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:41,696
One more thing, Franz:
I want my share of the take now.

212
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:44,824
What's the matter, Orlich?
Lose your sense of trust?

213
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,134
I was just thinking maybe
we get through that tunnel.

214
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:51,764
Then you take the loot to Berlin and
I never see you again. I want my cut.

215
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,791
Very well.

216
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:09,393
I'm going to ask you again,
what is the door code to the tunnel?

217
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:12,923
I told you, mister,
what would I know about a door code?

218
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:14,778
I'm just a simple blacksmith.

219
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:18,691
With my trusty forge I makes
all the metalworks for the village-

220
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:20,005
You are an employee here,

221
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,666
that means you are required to know
the door code for fire code reasons,

222
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:26,782
Mister David Palmer of Colorado Springs!

223
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:29,744
Huh my name ain't Palmer, it's...
Old Smithy.

224
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:32,246
Hand we ain't never
heard of no fire code, why,

225
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:35,116
we gots to put fires
out ourselves when the-

226
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,185
That's it! Tell me the code or you die!

227
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:44,213
One... two...

228
00:12:44,484 --> 00:12:46,325
- I...
- Yes?

229
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:51,886
I don't know nothin' about no fancy
door code. I'm just a simple blacksmith.

230
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:58,522
These Pioneer Village workers
are really committed to their jobs.

231
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,293
No. Please. Don't hurt me.

232
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,313
Give us the code to
that door and we can leave!

233
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:08,255
I've never heard of
something called a door code.

234
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,601
Please, can't you ask some other way?

235
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:14,648
I don't have time for your stupid game!
Tell me, or you die right now!

236
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:15,771
All right, all right!

237
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:19,580
Look, it's just, it's just one
of those... Jenkins home security locks.

238
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,950
You press the top button and then,
and then enter 5-2-

239
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:31,347
What he meant to say, kids, is that we
ain't never heard o'no fancy door code

240
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:35,164
'cause in our time, we gots to
rely on wood locks an' sich.

241
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:38,187
Goddamnit you people
are fucking insane!

242
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,737
- I don't believe it.
- Damanov, Vodski !

243
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:45,161
Find out if there are any employees
or students wandering about!

244
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:47,321
Bring them here or shoot them!

245
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:52,457
- Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on!
- Yeah. We've gotta get- get...

246
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:55,530
get the hell... outta here f-

247
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,650
fast.

248
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:00,668
Sector Bravo, no activity.

249
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,060
Jeez, cops are looking
for us everywhere.

250
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,716
Don't worry, they're not gonna
find us till we're safely back inside.

251
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:10,272
Look, see that traffic
signal down there?

252
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,518
If we can climb across that,

253
00:14:11,638 --> 00:14:13,754
we can jump to the tree branch,
and then we're home free.

254
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:15,006
That looks dangerous.

255
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:18,026
Not getting busted always is,
Butters. Come on.

256
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,402
Good, that's good. That's good.
Good, all right then. Let's head across.

257
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:32,044
- Go easy. Good.
- Oh gosh in heaven.

258
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:34,513
It's all right.
You've got it, no problem-

259
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:36,583
- Save me!
- I'm gonna fall!

260
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:45,068
Oh dude, lame.

261
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:50,766
Frolich, check in. Have you
found any other employees?

262
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:54,555
We found somebody. We found this
guy in the jail of the sheriff's office.

263
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:58,406
You let out Murderin' Murphy?

264
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:01,770
Y'are all gettin' it for
puttin' me in that there jail!

265
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,107
Stop it! Stop your bad
historical acting right now!

266
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:09,195
Tarnation. Why'd you let
Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.

267
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:11,229
I am the fucking bad man!

268
00:15:11,349 --> 00:15:15,429
You get that? Knock it off and
give me the mine shaft access code!

269
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,477
You're just gonna
have to kill us, mister,

270
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:19,637
'cause you ain't makin' no sense at all!

271
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:22,625
I won't kill you if you don't tell me.
I'll kill one of them!

272
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:25,873
Not me! Not me, not me!

273
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,493
(What? Hey, let go.)

274
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,694
You want to see a child die?

275
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:32,475
(No, they don't wanna see a child die!)

276
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:42,427
I am so disappointed in myself.

277
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:45,290
Teacher gave me a responsibility,

278
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,160
and I was just supposed to look
after my partner, and I blew it!

279
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:53,401
Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters.
You can't help being a douchebag.

280
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:55,021
Wait, Butters, look!

281
00:15:56,835 --> 00:16:00,185
This is it! This is our chance!
Swing over, Butters! Go!

282
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,668
Quick! Are you ready? We gotta jump!

283
00:16:05,928 --> 00:16:07,843
- Let's do it!
- Ready? Go!

284
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:17,636
What about you?

285
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:21,297
Will you tell us the access code
or do you want to see this kid die?

286
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,279
I'm sorry, I'm a woman and...

287
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,986
Women in our time ain't allowed to know
the carryin's on of the town proper.

288
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:28,190
God-damnit!

289
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:31,902
Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!

290
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:36,972
I can't let them do it.
I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice.

291
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,618
Stan?

292
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,954
Where are you going, Stan?

293
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:45,916
Wendy, I have to do something.
Please look away.

294
00:16:49,513 --> 00:16:52,590
All right, that does it!
On the count of three this child dies!

295
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,926
- One! Two!
- (Goddamnit, someone help me!)

296
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:57,886
Well howdy there, strangers.

297
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,253
Sorry to interrupt ye,

298
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:05,223
but I done come from Pagosa Springs
to buy me some wares an' sich.

299
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:08,522
Oh, welcome, partner.

300
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:10,441
- Howdy!
- Welcome!

301
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:11,828
What are you doing?

302
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,279
I heard you all had some difficulty with
a criminal getsin' out of your jail.

303
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,116
That's right, Murderin' Murphy.
He's crazy 'cause someone killed his pa.

304
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:20,951
They killed my pa!

305
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:23,694
I reckon that maybe
you could make a jail door

306
00:17:23,814 --> 00:17:28,463
that opened with numbers instead
of keys. You know, like a big safe.

307
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,579
Yeah, I understand that.

308
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:35,341
Finally, a fella that talks some sense.

309
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,380
If'n you all was to
have such a giant safe,

310
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,455
what would you villagers
want the number to be

311
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:43,140
to unlock that there jail door,
shuck 'em up?

312
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,548
Oh, well uh,

313
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:49,118
I reckon the easiest number to remember
for any big safe door lock would be...

314
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:51,367
1864.

315
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:55,141
Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is.

316
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:59,630
Eighteen sixty four. Orlich, we have
the door code! Start packing up!

317
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,466
- We'll take the hostages with us!
- No, you got your door code, let us go!

318
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:05,788
Copy that. What's the code, over.

319
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,918
Sweet, there's still
cops looking for us in here.

320
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:10,290
All right, follow my lead, Butters.

321
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,012
Oh man, hasn't this place
been fascinating, Butters?

322
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:14,380
Yeah, it sure has.

323
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,048
Oh, I just don't know
what I liked better:

324
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:18,695
the historical buildings
and artifacts or the, or the...

325
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:20,713
Or the witty anecdotes
of the townspeople.

326
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,805
Witty anecdotes, yes,
that's been awesome.

327
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:25,683
- Been a hoot all right!
- Get your hands behind your head!

328
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:27,559
What'd we do?
We've been here the whole time.

329
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:30,104
Shut up! Put your hands
behind your head! Do it now!

330
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:35,651
Let go of each other!

331
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:38,779
Do what I tell you!

332
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,865
Our teacher said we have to
hold hands the whole time we're here!

333
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,430
Let go or else I'll put a bullet
through your hands and make you let go!

334
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,266
- Butters.
- Now!

335
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:48,386
No!

336
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:55,462
Jesus Christ!

337
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:03,993
Go! Go take care of it!
I'll stay with the hostages!

338
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:07,641
Hey, Murderin' Murphy.

339
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:09,935
- You see that there feller?
- Yeah.

340
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:14,148
- He done killed yer pa.
- What? I'll rip his head off!

341
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:19,387
We've got a chance. Hostages are clear!

342
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:23,240
They are coming in!

343
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:35,685
Move, move, move!

344
00:19:36,102 --> 00:19:38,046
Hostages are secure
at the park entrance!

345
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:40,661
I got you now, Pioneer Paul!

346
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:44,181
They shoulda never let you out of jail,
Murderin' Murphy!

347
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:55,314
Freeze, scumbag! It's all over!

348
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:01,904
Murderin' Murphy's
gonna kill Pioneer Paul!

349
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:03,947
Stop right now! It's over!

350
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:11,043
<i>Howdy, partners. It's five o'clock.</i>

351
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:13,688
<i>Pioneer Village is
now closed for the day.</i>

352
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:16,728
<i>Head back to your wagons
and have a safe trip home.</i>

353
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,462
- We made it!
- We made it!

354
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,674
Oh God, I can't wait
to get out of this dress.

355
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:25,331
Whoa, that was great!

356
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:27,286
Uh, listen,
if anyone still wants to know,

357
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:29,860
the phone is in the administration
building, you dial 9 to get out,

358
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,344
and there's actually a back
exit behind the horse troughs.

359
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,345
Good night everybody, thanks
for coming. We did it, guys!

360
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:37,848
Let's go to TGI Fridays
and get some jalapeño poppers!

361
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:39,395
- Yeah, that'd be great!
- All right!

362
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:41,860
- Oh yeah. Jalapeño poppers.
- Let's go.

363
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:46,797
Stan, you were really brave in there,

364
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,713
but you did kind of
sound like a big dork.

365
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,722
- I know.
- Come on you!

366
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:52,913
- You're hurting my arm!
- Too bad!

367
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:55,916
You'll be going away for a long time.
Was it worth it?

368
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:59,760
In a way, it was. I might
not have gotten away, but...

369
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,934
at least I learned a lot
about Pioneer life in the Old West.

370
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,760
Those early settlers didn't have
the modern conveniences

371
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,719
we all take for granted today.

372
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,597
To think how difficult
it was back in those times

373
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:13,502
to do something as simple
as washing your clothes.

374
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:15,777
Pioneer Village has
a lot to teach us all.

375
00:21:15,897 --> 00:21:16,997
That's true.

376
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:20,461
Hey look.

377
00:21:35,821 --> 00:21:38,711
Teacher, my partner is back on the bus!

00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:35,447


3
00:00:35,707 --> 00:00:37,449
Kids, everyone together.

4
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:39,660
Welcome to Pioneer Village.

5
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,723
This is a recreation
of early Colorado days.

6
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:45,222
I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul.

7
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:47,674
Hi, kids, and welcome to my village.

8
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:51,671
I settled here in 1864
with my ma and pa.

9
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:56,468
Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange
clothes like you all are wearin'.

10
00:00:56,728 --> 00:01:00,594
And what's that fancy yellow
horse carriage you got out there?

11
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,110
This is gonna suck.

12
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,784
When you all are ready
just head up to the village.

13
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:08,770
All the townsfolk are
there to answer yer questions.

14
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,935
And welcome. To 1864.

15
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:13,174
Set 'em up!

16
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,915
Thank you, Pioneer Paul.
All right, kids, this is a big place,

17
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,385
so I want everyone to pick
a partner to hold hands with.

18
00:01:21,913 --> 00:01:24,742
- Let's be partners, Kenny.
- (No, I'm partners with Craig.)

19
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:25,862
Okay.

20
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,659
- Stan, let's be partners, dude.
- Naw, I'm with Wendy.

21
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:32,253
You wanna hold hands
with a girl? Gaywad!

22
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:38,194
- All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
- I hate you, remember?

23
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:41,513
- You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
- Jesus, what have I ever done to you?

24
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:45,016
Craig? Token? Who else needs a partner?

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,110
Uh who else needs a partner?

26
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,020
- Eric, partner with Butters.
- Goddamnit!

27
00:01:58,354 --> 00:02:01,327
- Hold Butters' hand, Eric!
- That isn't necessary!

28
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:03,839
Butters, you are not
to let go of Eric's hand

29
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,464
until you are both back on that bus!
Do you understand?

30
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,284
- I understand.
- All right, let's head in.

31
00:02:10,718 --> 00:02:12,798
- You can let go now, Butters.
- No.

32
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:14,718
- Butters, come on!
- No!

33
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:19,401
All right kids, go ahead and visit
the charming villagers and learn stuff.

34
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:21,371
Keep track of your partner!

35
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:26,144
Why howdy partners.
I'm the town blacksmith.

36
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:30,064
Are you folks settlers, or are you
just trappers passin' through?

37
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,075
Uh, look, can we just drop
the whole roleplaying thing?

38
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,657
I would play along,
but my girlfriend's here

39
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:36,449
and I don't wanna look like
a total dork in front of her.

40
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,985
- Thanks, Stan.
- These folks sure are strange, Smithy.

41
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:44,020
We ain't never seen them kind
of fancy hats in our time, have we?

42
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:47,203
That guy is wearing a digital watch.

43
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:49,021
Oh jeez.

44
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:52,516
- Damnit Chad!
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

45
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:56,087
Why howdy, partners,
I'm the town gunsmith.

46
00:02:56,461 --> 00:03:00,980
You see, in our time it's pretty
violent. See them holes in the walls?

47
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,679
That's so we can put rifles
through to protect us from Indians.

48
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:06,431
I wanna shoot an Indian.

49
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:09,949
Now some of you might wanna meet
Abigail at the candle-makin' house.

50
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:12,719
Or you can head over
to the general store.

51
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:18,698
- You see any Indians?
- Nah, it's just the city and-

52
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:21,196
Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.

53
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:25,033
"Super... Phun Thyme."

54
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:30,036
Dude, check it out! We're only
two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme!

55
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:32,040
They've got video games
and rides and everything!

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,827
Oh, that's cool. Well come on, Eric,
we need to catch up with everyone.

57
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:37,283
Dude, screw this place!
We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!

58
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:40,385
Oh no! I'm not sneaking out!
I'll get in trouble!

59
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:41,633
Fine, then let go of my hand!

60
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:44,119
Teacher said I can't let
go till we're back on the bus!

61
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,429
Well which is it gonna be, Butters?

62
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,264
Are you gonna ditch out with me
or disobey the teacher's stupid rule?

63
00:03:48,384 --> 00:03:49,984
I'm not letting go!

64
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,101
- Fine, then you're coming with me!
- No, Eric!

65
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,273
Butters, let go God-damnit!

66
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:56,992
No! Teacher! Teacher!

67
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:00,766
This here is our general store.

68
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:03,404
It's where I buy all
my supplies an' sich.

69
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:07,381
Howdy partners.
I own this here general store.

70
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,018
Look, Stan,
they had beef jerky back then.

71
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:12,183
What do you mean "back then"?

72
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:15,166
Don't forget, it's 1864.

73
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:20,082
- Right. Except for it really isn't.
- Sure it is. Just look around ye.

74
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:25,218
- What's that?
- Sounds like police sirens.

75
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:26,828
What's a si-rene?

76
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:30,682
We ain't never heard
of no sirene in 1864.

77
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:38,357
We lost them, we lost them!

78
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:40,650
- Damn pig cops!
- Close that gate!

79
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:45,192
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

80
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:47,412
Everyone down on the ground now!

81
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:51,051
Wuh-whoa now, I'm Sheriff McLawdog.

82
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:53,601
I settled here back in eighteen fif-

83
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:56,431
Jesus Christ!

84
00:04:57,248 --> 00:04:59,335
We've gotta call the police.
Where's your phone?

85
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:04,299
A phone? Why, what's a phone?
We ain't never hearda sich a thing.

86
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:06,342
- What?
- Come on, this is serious!

87
00:05:06,602 --> 00:05:10,534
Storehand, you ever heard
of this fancy smancy phone?

88
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:14,309
Uh, no. We ain't got
a phone in our time.

89
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:18,062
Dude, they just shot a guy in the face!
We've gotta call the cops!

90
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:22,592
If you mean the law, only law
around here is town sheriff McLawdog.

91
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:26,779
You see, 1864 is a time of
growth and development in the Old West.

92
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,990
This is not the time for that!

93
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:32,252
Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!

94
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:38,045
Butters, if you don't let go of my hand,
everyone here is gonna think we're gay!

95
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,965
Well, that's your problem!

96
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,249
All right Butters,
I've seriously had... enough!

97
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:47,426
Jesus Christ!

98
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:51,654
- One please.
- Make that two!

99
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:55,350
Aw, aren't you two cute holding hands.
Are you special little buddies?

100
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,782
No!

101
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:05,364
Dude, this place shreds!
What should we do first?

102
00:06:05,484 --> 00:06:08,435
We should get back to Pioneer Village,
that's what we should do!

103
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:11,386
Butters, we're going to get back
before anybody even notices we're gone.

104
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:13,456
Let's go hit the bumper cars!

105
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:17,748
Over here. This looks like an office.

106
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:23,628
- Here! Here's the phone!
- Well, what a strange contraption.

107
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:25,712
I can't get a dial tone.

108
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:28,620
- What's the number to dial out?
- "Dila out"?

109
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,386
Partner, them are some
funny words you're using.

110
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:33,262
Dude, do you understand
what's going on here?

111
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:37,672
Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean,
this is a special circumstance that-

112
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,812


113
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:42,456
Oh, I mean,

114
00:06:42,865 --> 00:06:45,407
this here room is, it sure is strange.

115
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,761
We have nothin' like these
fancy devices in our time.

116
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:49,946
I'll say.

117
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:53,574
- I got through. Hello, police?
- Nine one one, what's your emergency?

118
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,382
There's some terrorists or
bankrobbers or something

119
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,912
that have taken our class hostage!
- Taken hostage where?

120
00:06:58,172 --> 00:06:59,789
The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.

121
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:02,834
You mean that annoying place
where employees won't break character?

122
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:05,628
Sister, you don't know the half of it.

123
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:09,324


124
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:12,607
Check it out, dude, I'm a space man!

125
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:14,753
Space man, yes!

126
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:18,520
<i>I'm having a super fun time playing</i>

127
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,436
Get that guy! Shoot that guy!
Yeah, and then ever here!

128
00:07:23,124 --> 00:07:24,674
Oh, you got it. Nice.

129
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,642
<i>Super fun time, please don't go away</i>

130
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:35,634
What are you ogling at?

131
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:39,036
<i>No more worries or cares, super fun time</i>

132
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:40,705
- Oh man, whoa!
- Whoa!

133
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:44,169
<i>The answer to my prayers, super fun time</i>

134
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:48,491
<i>Super fun time, you're all I need</i>

135
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:51,249
Yeah, we're wired up!

136
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,926
<i>I'll have a super fun
time till I freaking bleed</i>

137
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,389
<i>I want you morning noon
and night, super fun time</i>

138
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:00,399
Yeah, bumper cars, sweet!

139
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:03,435
<i>You make my life so right,
super fun time</i>

140
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:05,687
That's it, Eric.
We have to be getting back!

141
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:07,822
- Aw, just a few more things.
- No!

142
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:10,307
If we don't leave right now,
we're gonna miss the bus,

143
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:12,481
and then they'll know we left!

144
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:15,239
I guess you're right, Butters.
All right, come on.

145
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:20,036
Set up the satellite relay, check
for alternate routes out of the area.

146
00:08:20,296 --> 00:08:22,477
Unfortunately, your police department

147
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:24,707
got wind of our robbery
and chased after us.

148
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:28,816
That is unfortunate for you, because
when I think it is clear to leave

149
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:31,223
we will now need
to take hostages with us

150
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,966
to ensure our goods get
to their final destination.

151
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:35,796
Please, if you must take anyone,

152
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,866
don't take me.
These kids are worth more to you.

153
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:42,058
How did they find us?

154
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:45,061
Get the loot out of the car
and stash it in that building.

155
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:53,081
All right, men, listen up! Looks like
our thieves are trying to hide out here.

156
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:56,072
They've got the employees
and some school kids held hostage.

157
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:58,047
Tucker, Dylan, set up a perimeter!

158
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:01,230
Everyone stay on your toes! These are
professionals we're dealing with here!

159
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,000
What did they rob, sir?

160
00:09:03,303 --> 00:09:04,541
A Burger King.

161
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:10,128
- All right, good. Is that all of it?
- No. Don't forget we've got these too.

162
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:14,234
Excellent. Now listen, everyone,
we're going to be all right.

163
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,300
This is only a small hitch in our plan.

164
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,030
I'd like to speak
with the chief of police!

165
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:23,646
Who is this?

166
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:26,821
This is the man who Is going to
kill an entire class of fourth graders

167
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,661
if he doesn't get exactly what he wants!

168
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:38,681
- Why aren't the cops coming in?
- They must be negotiating.

169
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:41,200
Them there bandits
sure look mighty strange.

170
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,119
And them pistols is
bigger than whats we gots.

171
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:46,907
- Will you shut up!
- Wait, you have guns here?

172
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:49,753
Sure. Sheriff got lots
of rifles in his office.

173
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:52,110
Well why don't you go get
them and bring them back here?

174
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,135
- All righty. Come on, storehand.
- Yepper!

175
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,783
Oh man, I can't wait to see
the look on Kyle's face

176
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:00,811
when we tell him we had super fun time,

177
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:02,650
while he was at the
dumb Pioneer Village.

178
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,670
We're not telling anybody!
I don't wanna get in trouble!

179
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,373
And I didn't have
a super fun time anyways.

180
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:09,991
Butters, you've gotta learn to chill.

181
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:13,240
Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't
stop and look around once in a while,

182
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,735
and do whatever you want all
the time, you could miss it.

183
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:18,255
Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.

184
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,466
- Crap, they called the cops on us.
- What?

185
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:26,371
- They called the cops?
- They must have realized we left. Damn.

186
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,414
Oh my God,
the police are looking for us!

187
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:30,827
- Butters!
- We're gonna get it now!

188
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:32,984
Butters, calm down!
I know a way out of this!

189
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:35,501
You just got me busted forever!

190
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,585
- Butters, listen to me, listen.
- No!

191
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,345
All we have to do is sneak back
inside without the cops seeing us.

192
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:44,278
Then we can say we
were inside all along.

193
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:48,868
You said they wouldn't notice
we were gone. You promised.

194
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,766
If we sneak back inside,
we can say we never left, all right?

195
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,733
All right, now let go of my hand.

196
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:00,027
- No.
- Butters?

197
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:04,497
You made me break one rule, I'm not
breaking the other! It's all I have now!

198
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:06,299
All right, come on!

199
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:09,810
Keep the hostages from
talking and search for holdouts.

200
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,291
Everyone check in
at two-minute intervals.

201
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:14,768
I hope you have good news, Orlich.

202
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:17,665
The police have us completely
surrounded on all sides.

203
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:20,411
There's no way we're getting
out above ground without being spotted.

204
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:21,756
Above ground?

205
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:24,470
Look, I found this
at the rear of the park.

206
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,656
It's an old mine shaft, but Pioneer
Village was sued when a kid died in it,

207
00:11:28,776 --> 00:11:30,244
so they closed it down and protected it

208
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:32,353
with a huge metal door
with a coded lock.

209
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:36,003
So if we can get into the shaft,
we can tunnel our way around the police.

210
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:37,123
Excellent.

211
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:41,696
One more thing, Franz:
I want my share of the take now.

212
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:44,824
What's the matter, Orlich?
Lose your sense of trust?

213
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,134
I was just thinking maybe
we get through that tunnel.

214
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:51,764
Then you take the loot to Berlin and
I never see you again. I want my cut.

215
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,791
Very well.

216
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:09,393
I'm going to ask you again,
what is the door code to the tunnel?

217
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:12,923
I told you, mister,
what would I know about a door code?

218
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:14,778
I'm just a simple blacksmith.

219
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:18,691
With my trusty forge I makes
all the metalworks for the village-

220
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:20,005
You are an employee here,

221
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,666
that means you are required to know
the door code for fire code reasons,

222
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:26,782
Mister David Palmer of Colorado Springs!

223
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:29,744
Huh my name ain't Palmer, it's...
Old Smithy.

224
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:32,246
Hand we ain't never
heard of no fire code, why,

225
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:35,116
we gots to put fires
out ourselves when the-

226
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,185
That's it! Tell me the code or you die!

227
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:44,213
One... two...

228
00:12:44,484 --> 00:12:46,325
- I...
- Yes?

229
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:51,886
I don't know nothin' about no fancy
door code. I'm just a simple blacksmith.

230
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:58,522
These Pioneer Village workers
are really committed to their jobs.

231
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,293
No. Please. Don't hurt me.

232
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,313
Give us the code to
that door and we can leave!

233
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:08,255
I've never heard of
something called a door code.

234
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,601
Please, can't you ask some other way?

235
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:14,648
I don't have time for your stupid game!
Tell me, or you die right now!

236
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:15,771
All right, all right!

237
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:19,580
Look, it's just, it's just one
of those... Jenkins home security locks.

238
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,950
You press the top button and then,
and then enter 5-2-

239
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:31,347
What he meant to say, kids, is that we
ain't never heard o'no fancy door code

240
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:35,164
'cause in our time, we gots to
rely on wood locks an' sich.

241
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:38,187
Goddamnit you people
are fucking insane!

242
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,737
- I don't believe it.
- Damanov, Vodski !

243
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:45,161
Find out if there are any employees
or students wandering about!

244
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:47,321
Bring them here or shoot them!

245
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:52,457
- Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on!
- Yeah. We've gotta get- get...

246
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:55,530
get the hell... outta here f-

247
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,650
fast.

248
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:00,668
Sector Bravo, no activity.

249
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,060
Jeez, cops are looking
for us everywhere.

250
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,716
Don't worry, they're not gonna
find us till we're safely back inside.

251
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:10,272
Look, see that traffic
signal down there?

252
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,518
If we can climb across that,

253
00:14:11,638 --> 00:14:13,754
we can jump to the tree branch,
and then we're home free.

254
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:15,006
That looks dangerous.

255
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:18,026
Not getting busted always is,
Butters. Come on.

256
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,402
Good, that's good. That's good.
Good, all right then. Let's head across.

257
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:32,044
- Go easy. Good.
- Oh gosh in heaven.

258
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:34,513
It's all right.
You've got it, no problem-

259
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:36,583
- Save me!
- I'm gonna fall!

260
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:45,068
Oh dude, lame.

261
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:50,766
Frolich, check in. Have you
found any other employees?

262
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:54,555
We found somebody. We found this
guy in the jail of the sheriff's office.

263
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:58,406
You let out Murderin' Murphy?

264
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:01,770
Y'are all gettin' it for
puttin' me in that there jail!

265
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,107
Stop it! Stop your bad
historical acting right now!

266
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:09,195
Tarnation. Why'd you let
Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.

267
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:11,229
I am the fucking bad man!

268
00:15:11,349 --> 00:15:15,429
You get that? Knock it off and
give me the mine shaft access code!

269
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,477
You're just gonna
have to kill us, mister,

270
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:19,637
'cause you ain't makin' no sense at all!

271
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:22,625
I won't kill you if you don't tell me.
I'll kill one of them!

272
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:25,873
Not me! Not me, not me!

273
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,493
(What? Hey, let go.)

274
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,694
You want to see a child die?

275
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:32,475
(No, they don't wanna see a child die!)

276
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:42,427
I am so disappointed in myself.

277
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:45,290
Teacher gave me a responsibility,

278
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,160
and I was just supposed to look
after my partner, and I blew it!

279
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:53,401
Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters.
You can't help being a douchebag.

280
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:55,021
Wait, Butters, look!

281
00:15:56,835 --> 00:16:00,185
This is it! This is our chance!
Swing over, Butters! Go!

282
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,668
Quick! Are you ready? We gotta jump!

283
00:16:05,928 --> 00:16:07,843
- Let's do it!
- Ready? Go!

284
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:17,636
What about you?

285
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:21,297
Will you tell us the access code
or do you want to see this kid die?

286
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,279
I'm sorry, I'm a woman and...

287
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,986
Women in our time ain't allowed to know
the carryin's on of the town proper.

288
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:28,190
God-damnit!

289
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:31,902
Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!

290
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:36,972
I can't let them do it.
I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice.

291
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,618
Stan?

292
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,954
Where are you going, Stan?

293
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:45,916
Wendy, I have to do something.
Please look away.

294
00:16:49,513 --> 00:16:52,590
All right, that does it!
On the count of three this child dies!

295
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,926
- One! Two!
- (Goddamnit, someone help me!)

296
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:57,886
Well howdy there, strangers.

297
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,253
Sorry to interrupt ye,

298
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:05,223
but I done come from Pagosa Springs
to buy me some wares an' sich.

299
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:08,522
Oh, welcome, partner.

300
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:10,441
- Howdy!
- Welcome!

301
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:11,828
What are you doing?

302
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,279
I heard you all had some difficulty with
a criminal getsin' out of your jail.

303
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,116
That's right, Murderin' Murphy.
He's crazy 'cause someone killed his pa.

304
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:20,951
They killed my pa!

305
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:23,694
I reckon that maybe
you could make a jail door

306
00:17:23,814 --> 00:17:28,463
that opened with numbers instead
of keys. You know, like a big safe.

307
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,579
Yeah, I understand that.

308
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:35,341
Finally, a fella that talks some sense.

309
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,380
If'n you all was to
have such a giant safe,

310
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,455
what would you villagers
want the number to be

311
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:43,140
to unlock that there jail door,
shuck 'em up?

312
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,548
Oh, well uh,

313
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:49,118
I reckon the easiest number to remember
for any big safe door lock would be...

314
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:51,367
1864.

315
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:55,141
Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is.

316
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:59,630
Eighteen sixty four. Orlich, we have
the door code! Start packing up!

317
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,466
- We'll take the hostages with us!
- No, you got your door code, let us go!

318
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:05,788
Copy that. What's the code, over.

319
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,918
Sweet, there's still
cops looking for us in here.

320
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:10,290
All right, follow my lead, Butters.

321
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,012
Oh man, hasn't this place
been fascinating, Butters?

322
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:14,380
Yeah, it sure has.

323
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,048
Oh, I just don't know
what I liked better:

324
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:18,695
the historical buildings
and artifacts or the, or the...

325
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:20,713
Or the witty anecdotes
of the townspeople.

326
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,805
Witty anecdotes, yes,
that's been awesome.

327
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:25,683
- Been a hoot all right!
- Get your hands behind your head!

328
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:27,559
What'd we do?
We've been here the whole time.

329
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:30,104
Shut up! Put your hands
behind your head! Do it now!

330
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:35,651
Let go of each other!

331
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:38,779
Do what I tell you!

332
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,865
Our teacher said we have to
hold hands the whole time we're here!

333
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,430
Let go or else I'll put a bullet
through your hands and make you let go!

334
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,266
- Butters.
- Now!

335
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:48,386
No!

336
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:55,462
Jesus Christ!

337
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:03,993
Go! Go take care of it!
I'll stay with the hostages!

338
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:07,641
Hey, Murderin' Murphy.

339
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:09,935
- You see that there feller?
- Yeah.

340
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:14,148
- He done killed yer pa.
- What? I'll rip his head off!

341
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:19,387
We've got a chance. Hostages are clear!

342
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:23,240
They are coming in!

343
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:35,685
Move, move, move!

344
00:19:36,102 --> 00:19:38,046
Hostages are secure
at the park entrance!

345
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:40,661
I got you now, Pioneer Paul!

346
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:44,181
They shoulda never let you out of jail,
Murderin' Murphy!

347
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:55,314
Freeze, scumbag! It's all over!

348
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:01,904
Murderin' Murphy's
gonna kill Pioneer Paul!

349
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:03,947
Stop right now! It's over!

350
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:11,043
<i>Howdy, partners. It's five o'clock.</i>

351
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:13,688
<i>Pioneer Village is
now closed for the day.</i>

352
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:16,728
<i>Head back to your wagons
and have a safe trip home.</i>

353
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,462
- We made it!
- We made it!

354
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,674
Oh God, I can't wait
to get out of this dress.

355
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:25,331
Whoa, that was great!

356
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:27,286
Uh, listen,
if anyone still wants to know,

357
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:29,860
the phone is in the administration
building, you dial 9 to get out,

358
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,344
and there's actually a back
exit behind the horse troughs.

359
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,345
Good night everybody, thanks
for coming. We did it, guys!

360
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:37,848
Let's go to TGI Fridays
and get some jalapeño poppers!

361
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:39,395
- Yeah, that'd be great!
- All right!

362
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:41,860
- Oh yeah. Jalapeño poppers.
- Let's go.

363
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:46,797
Stan, you were really brave in there,

364
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,713
but you did kind of
sound like a big dork.

365
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,722
- I know.
- Come on you!

366
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:52,913
- You're hurting my arm!
- Too bad!

367
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:55,916
You'll be going away for a long time.
Was it worth it?

368
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:59,760
In a way, it was. I might
not have gotten away, but...

369
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,934
at least I learned a lot
about Pioneer life in the Old West.

370
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,760
Those early settlers didn't have
the modern conveniences

371
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,719
we all take for granted today.

372
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,597
To think how difficult
it was back in those times

373
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:13,502
to do something as simple
as washing your clothes.

374
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:15,777
Pioneer Village has
a lot to teach us all.

375
00:21:15,897 --> 00:21:16,997
That's true.

376
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:20,461
Hey look.

377
00:21:35,821 --> 00:21:38,711
Teacher, my partner is back on the bus!

378
