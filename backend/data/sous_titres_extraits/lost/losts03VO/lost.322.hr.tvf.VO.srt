1
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:17,138
Would you put your seat back, please?

2
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:21,201
Would you fasten your seat belt, please?

3
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:23,403
Excuse me. Excuse me.

4
00:00:25,238 --> 00:00:27,035
Can I get another one of those, please?

5
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:29,614
I'm sorry, sir.
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

6
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:31,458
Well, 20 minutes is a long time.

7
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:33,293
How about a newspaper instead?

8
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:35,941
And if you could buckle
your seat belt, sir...

9
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:49,763
<i>Sorry about the bumps, folks.</i>

10
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:53,157
<i>We're just hitting a little warm air
as we make our descent into Los Angeles.</i>

11
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:54,888
<i>Please keep those seat belts fastened,</i>

12
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,863
<i>and we'll have you
on the ground shortly.</i>

13
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:20,398
It's me.

14
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:23,211
I...

15
00:02:26,724 --> 00:02:27,835
I just read...

16
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:40,586
Forgive me.

17
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,335
Mom! Mom!

18
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,586
Help!

19
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,664
You have everything you need?

20
00:04:25,793 --> 00:04:28,151
No, but I made the best out
of what we have.

21
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:32,085
Bernard and Jin?

22
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:35,802
They're both excellent shots
and highly motivated.

23
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:39,878
The dynamite's in place. We won't miss.

24
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:44,364
No matter what happens here,
I want you to keep moving.

25
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:46,196
Keep moving for that radio tower.

26
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:48,328
Don't turn back for any reason.

27
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:52,652
I'm willing to give my life
if it means securing rescue,

28
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,777
but I'm not giving it up for nothing.

29
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:57,009
You understand?

30
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:05,009
I understand.

31
00:05:10,174 --> 00:05:11,255
Then good luck.

32
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:13,882
You, too.

33
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:24,817
If I told you that I'd help you
with your "S.O.S." sign,

34
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:26,253
would you change your mind?

35
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:28,196
No, ma'am.

36
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,181
I want you to say it again.

37
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:31,847
Say it, Bernard.

38
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:34,383
I am a dentist.

39
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:35,884
I am not Rambo.

40
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,273
And don't you forget it.

41
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:56,683
Charlie's gonna be fine.

42
00:05:56,832 --> 00:05:59,169
Yeah. Of course he is.

43
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:23,559
Because...

44
00:06:23,962 --> 00:06:26,556
we have... to go... home.

45
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:45,342
Alright.

46
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:48,555
Let's do it.

47
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:40,451
Subtitles: swsub.com

48
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:07,399
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

49
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,194
What did you do for a living
before you became Moses?

50
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:13,135
I was a doctor.

51
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:14,650
Right. 'course you were.

52
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:17,396
Well, I need your attention
for a minute, doctor.

53
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:21,448
Is she okay?

54
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,940
Why wouldn't she be?

55
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:27,882
Because none of your people
trusts her. No offense.

56
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,645
Why don't you catch up to me
when you're done?

57
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:32,583
It's fine.

58
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:38,577
So I need to show you
how this wonderful gadget works

59
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:40,266
in case anything happens to me.

60
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:42,779
You need to be able to call my boat.

61
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:45,249
Okay. Show me.

62
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:46,551
It's actually simple.

63
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:47,700
Turn her on here.

64
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:50,185
This opens a direct channel
to the freighter.

65
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,812
Give her a tap here.

66
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,893
Wait for the beep and say hello.

67
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:56,331
- That's it?
- That's it.

68
00:08:56,947 --> 00:09:00,273
Once the rock star turns off whatever
underwater contraption is jamming us up,

69
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:02,469
this red light will turn
a lovely shade of green.

70
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:05,714
That'll be any time now, yeah?

71
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:08,199
Hopefully.

72
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:22,358
Who are you?

73
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:26,188
If you tell us how you got down here,
we won't hurt you.

74
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:30,908
I came in my invisible submarine.

75
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:32,045
Don't you see it?

76
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,272
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy? He's one of them.

77
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:39,100
Why are you here?

78
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,925
How did you find out about this station?

79
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:45,789
Juliet told us.

80
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:48,914
She's one of us now...

81
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,277
In case you haven't heard.

82
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:56,632
We gotta call Ben.

83
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Let's call Ben.

84
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:05,776
Come on.

85
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:20,835
<i>You're inside a room full of equipment.</i>

86
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:24,228
There's a blinking yellow light
above a switch.

87
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:26,133
<i>You flick the switch.</i>

88
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:27,695
Light goes off.

89
00:10:30,258 --> 00:10:31,258
And you drown.

90
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:46,733
<i>It's Bonnie.</i>

91
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:48,759
<i>Ben, are you there?</i>

92
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:50,967
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

93
00:10:54,057 --> 00:10:55,971
Why are you breaking radio silence?

94
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:57,459
One of them's down here.

95
00:10:57,859 --> 00:10:58,892
I'm sorry. What?

96
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,929
<i>We've got him tied up, but he's here.</i>

97
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,510
<i>One of them swam down here.</i>

98
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:03,872
Who? Which one?

99
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:05,132
He won't tell us.

100
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:06,385
It's Charlie!

101
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:07,897
<i>Tell him I said hi!</i>

102
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:09,696
How did...

103
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,825
<i>How does he know about the station.</i>

104
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:13,485
He said Juliet told them.

105
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:24,460
All right, sit tight. Don't do anything.
I'm sending help.

106
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,369
You need to go down
to the Looking Glass

107
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:29,552
and find out what Charlie Pace
is doing down there.

108
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:32,330
You told us the Looking Glass
was inoperable... flooded.

109
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:34,696
I lied.

110
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:37,488
Mikhail, I need you to go now!

111
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:40,144
I can be there by dawn.

112
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:44,284
But if Juliet told them
about the Looking Glass,

113
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:45,869
what else did she tell them?

114
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:54,424
Ryan, come in.

115
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:56,276
Ryan, are you there?

116
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:09,220
Are your walkies all off?

117
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:10,371
Yes, sir.

118
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:13,701
Did you get a good look?

119
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:16,187
The tents are marked with white coral
... three of 'em.

120
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,549
Juliet did her job.

121
00:12:18,173 --> 00:12:19,488
Alright. Let's do this.

122
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:18,216
It's empty!

123
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:20,227
Get away from the tent!

124
00:13:23,798 --> 00:13:25,483
- It's a trap! Move!
- Please, God.

125
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:30,205
Move, move!

126
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:33,664
The tree line!

127
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:47,941
I got your man!

128
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:49,705
Drop your weapons!

129
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:01,518
I got your man!

130
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:04,641
It's over!

131
00:14:06,894 --> 00:14:07,894
Don't.

132
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,413
Finger off the trigger.

133
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:23,425
There were supposed
to be three explosions.

134
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:32,223
It didn't work.

135
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:42,942
There you go. Good as new.

136
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:44,590
Thanks.

137
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:46,798
The news people
are waiting for you outside,

138
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:48,506
you being a hero and all.

139
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:50,443
Right.

140
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:53,723
The woman... how is she?

141
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:55,786
She's been stabilized.

142
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:58,067
Thank God you were on that bridge.

143
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:02,928
- Sorry.
- No visitors in E.R.

144
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:07,609
It's okay.

145
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:09,299
She's...

146
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:11,705
We used to be married.

147
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:14,361
Come on in.

148
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:19,360
What happened?

149
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,111
There was...

150
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:27,049
a car accident.

151
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,361
Are you okay?

152
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:34,419
Yeah, I'm fine.

153
00:15:36,206 --> 00:15:37,545
Were you drinking again?

154
00:15:41,146 --> 00:15:42,308
- Are you, Jack?
- No.

155
00:15:46,798 --> 00:15:48,587
Why did you come down here, Sarah?

156
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:52,641
I'm still listed
as your emergency contact.

157
00:15:59,514 --> 00:16:02,564
What were you doing
driving around at 2:00 in the morning?

158
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:24,167
Maybe you could give me a lift home?

159
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:31,109
I don't think that would be appropriate.

160
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:36,797
Well...

161
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,563
Thanks for coming down, Sarah.

162
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:44,738
Good-bye, Jack.

163
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:02,421
Why were there only two explosions?

164
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:04,906
Maybe they didn't have to blow
the 3rd tent.

165
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:06,727
But those gunshots...
What was that about?

166
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,490
- He's okay.
- Do you believe that?

167
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:11,386
Listen, they had no idea
that we were waiting for them,

168
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:13,709
and Sayid's with your husbands.

169
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:16,634
They're gonna be fine, and they're gonna
be a couple hours behind us.

170
00:17:16,756 --> 00:17:18,425
We should wait for them here.
You go...

171
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:20,830
No. No one gets left behind.

172
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:23,485
If you say,
"live together, die alone" to me,

173
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,222
I'm gonna punch you in your face.

174
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:28,361
Fair enough, Rose.

175
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:30,301
Fair enough.

176
00:17:31,423 --> 00:17:32,780
But we have a plan!

177
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:35,192
And for all we know, it worked.

178
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:39,692
It's gonna be okay.
Everything is gonna be all right.

179
00:17:41,536 --> 00:17:43,168
Let's just keep moving, okay?

180
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:56,354
It's okay. Let's go.

181
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,237
I'm gonna ask you this one more time.

182
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,458
Why are you here?

183
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:15,839
I'm here...
to turn off your jamming equipment.

184
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:19,447
In there,
next to the flashing yellow light.

185
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,581
- Now how'd you know about that?
- I know because I know.

186
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:26,268
Whatever you ladies do to me,
I'm going to turn it off.

187
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:28,210
- You are, huh?
- Most definitely am.

188
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:29,332
So what's the code?

189
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:32,271
What?

190
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:35,092
If you're gonna turn off
the jamming equipment,

191
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,385
you're gonna need the code,

192
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:38,320
and only three people know it.

193
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:40,821
Me, her and Ben.

194
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:48,395
Well...

195
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:50,770
Guess I won't need the code...

196
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:53,555
Since this entire station's
gonna be flooded anyway.

197
00:18:57,277 --> 00:18:58,891
Now just turn off your little jammer,

198
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:01,338
and the helicopters come
and rescue all my friends.

199
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:03,893
But if this station floods,

200
00:19:04,989 --> 00:19:06,245
what happens to you?

201
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:10,896
I die.

202
00:19:18,118 --> 00:19:19,714
- What?
<i>- They're all dead…</i>

203
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:22,068
<i>Diane, Ivan. All of them… dead.</i>

204
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:24,142
<i>It's Shephard and his people…
They're gone!</i>

205
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,469
Gone? Gone where?

206
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,418
I don't know. Did you hear me?

207
00:19:27,603 --> 00:19:29,182
They killed seven of us!

208
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:31,637
Calm down and tell him the good news.

209
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:32,979
What good news?

210
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:35,170
We caught three of them...

211
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,345
The ones that stayed behind
to blow up the tents.

212
00:19:37,713 --> 00:19:39,242
They knew we were coming.

213
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:40,602
It was Juliet.

214
00:19:41,353 --> 00:19:42,381
She betrayed us.

215
00:19:42,603 --> 00:19:45,185
- What?
- Just figure out where she is,Tom.

216
00:19:46,414 --> 00:19:47,414
Get up.

217
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:50,364
Okay, junior, where the hell did...

218
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:55,905
They're not talking.

219
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:57,048
Who do you have?

220
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,371
<i>Jarrah, Kwon and the dentist.</i>

221
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:00,922
Shoot Kwon.

222
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:03,976
- What?
<i>- You want them</i>

223
00:20:04,098 --> 00:20:05,680
to answer questions, kill Kwon.

224
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:06,806
<i>Do it now!</i>

225
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:11,109
I don't know what that means,
but I'm sure it's lovely.

226
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,031
No, wait, no...

227
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:14,427
- No talk.
- No, please.

228
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:17,527
Talk to me. Nobody will get hurt.
Now tell me where your people went.

229
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,503
He's lying. He's going to kill us all.

230
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:22,727
Where are they?

231
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:31,562
The radio tower.

232
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,703
They're hiking to a radio tower.

233
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,735
<i>Why in the hell are they going there?</i>

234
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:40,975
<i>A woman parachuted here.</i>

235
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,323
She has a satellite phone,
and they're gonna call her ship.

236
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,384
Juliet thought we were coming tomorrow,

237
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,975
so why were they waiting for us tonight?

238
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:52,185
You heard him.

239
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:53,746
How'd you know?

240
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:56,561
A kid

241
00:20:57,165 --> 00:21:00,394
<i>told us.
He came in a canoe and warned us.</i>

242
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:02,122
What kid?

243
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:04,857
Karl. He said his name was Karl.

244
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:07,052
<i>You heard that, Ben?</i>

245
00:21:10,408 --> 00:21:11,408
I heard.

246
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:21,206
<i>What do you want us to do?</i>

247
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:22,577
Kill them?

248
00:21:24,781 --> 00:21:25,781
No.

249
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:27,471
Not yet.

250
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:38,428
We're going to the radio tower?

251
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:39,932
Not we, Richard. Me.

252
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,098
You're going to take everyone
to the temple as planned.

253
00:21:43,493 --> 00:21:46,155
Now might not be the best time
to go tromping off on your own.

254
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,372
Really? And why not?

255
00:21:47,494 --> 00:21:49,198
Because people are asking questions,

256
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,957
about leaving home,
about what happened to Locke,

257
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:53,118
about Jacob.

258
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:56,496
Not to mention
the rapidly spreading rumor

259
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:58,729
that everyone
who went down to the beach is dead.

260
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:00,600
They're not all dead.

261
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,843
Where are you going?

262
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:13,988
- I asked where you were going.
- Well, I thought I might go for a walk,

263
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:16,258
see if I can't find Jack
and all his friends.

264
00:22:18,057 --> 00:22:19,109
I'm coming with you.

265
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:21,683
Alright.

266
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:23,981
- What?
- I said alright.

267
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:26,140
In fact, I think it's a good idea.

268
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:30,190
I mean, you do wanna see Karl again,
don't you?

269
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,518
Get your pack.
I'm leaving in ten minutes.

270
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:40,886
There're 40 of them,

271
00:22:42,031 --> 00:22:43,099
and you're alone.

272
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:45,871
They're gonna do whatever it takes
to get off the island.

273
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:48,359
What do you think
is gonna happen when you get there?

274
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,521
I'm gonna talk them out of it.

275
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:21,872
Something's wrong.

276
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:25,001
Lots of things are wrong.

277
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:28,520
Jin, Bernard, Sayid...
They should've caught up to us by now.

278
00:23:29,585 --> 00:23:30,754
I wanna go back to make sure

279
00:23:30,886 --> 00:23:32,472
- they're all right.
- 'course you do.

280
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,216
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means, Kate,

281
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:37,275
there's always someone to go back for.

282
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,951
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

283
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:42,086
- Nothing?
- I'm fine.

284
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,321
Why don't you just tell me
what happened?

285
00:23:51,408 --> 00:23:53,181
- What'd you do that for?
- To wake you up.

286
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:57,208
Ever since you got that tape from Lock,
it's like you've been sleepwalking.

287
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,231
You don't care about our friends, fine,

288
00:24:00,353 --> 00:24:02,971
but it's like you don't care
about anything anymore.

289
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,514
And since when did you
start calling me "Kate"?

290
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:12,921
You know...

291
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:16,992
They sent Juliet to check out Sun.

292
00:24:20,307 --> 00:24:23,007
But she was there to check
and see if I'm pregnant, too.

293
00:24:27,203 --> 00:24:28,682
Well, let's hope you're not.

294
00:24:44,163 --> 00:24:45,313
That light still red?

295
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:15,348
Bloody hell. You all right?

296
00:26:15,598 --> 00:26:18,361
Not for long if you don't
get out of here. You have to hide.

297
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:20,427
There's people in there.
Quick, hide, hide!

298
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:23,709
Who's he talking to?

299
00:26:29,817 --> 00:26:31,168
Who were you talking to?

300
00:26:31,362 --> 00:26:33,194
Wasn't talking to anyone.
I was just singing.

301
00:26:45,628 --> 00:26:46,628
Shut up.

302
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,599
Right, okay. You got it.

303
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:51,318
Come on.

304
00:27:28,257 --> 00:27:29,257
Can I help you?

305
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,143
Just checking her chart.

306
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:35,180
I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Hamill... Rob.

307
00:27:35,368 --> 00:27:37,564
The new chief of surgery.
I don't think we've met yet.

308
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:40,918
Dr. Shephard, the hero...

309
00:27:41,732 --> 00:27:42,819
Twice over.

310
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:46,319
You all right?

311
00:27:46,504 --> 00:27:48,979
After last night,
I'm surprised you'd even wanna come in.

312
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,385
Talk about right place, right time, huh?

313
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:54,317
This woman is very lucky you were there.

314
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,578
If she was lucky,
she wouldn't have a fractured back

315
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,481
that was impinging upon her spinal cord.

316
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:02,119
I'd like to...
operate first thing in the morning.

317
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,070
You wanna operate?

318
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:06,696
Yes.

319
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,685
I'm sorry, but this isn't your patient,

320
00:28:08,975 --> 00:28:10,446
and we are well aware of the issues.

321
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:12,883
Gary Nadler's doing
the surgery at 6:00 a.m.

322
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,536
With all due respect...

323
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:21,796
Dr. Hamill, I'd rather do it myself.

324
00:28:25,624 --> 00:28:26,681
Last night,

325
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:29,377
you pulled this woman's 8-year-old son
out of a flaming car,

326
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,808
then you went back for her.

327
00:28:33,937 --> 00:28:35,026
I think you've done enough.

328
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:36,399
I wanna do the surgery.

329
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,905
Look, everything's under control here.

330
00:28:41,314 --> 00:28:42,314
She'll be fine.

331
00:28:43,062 --> 00:28:44,908
Go home. Have a drink.

332
00:28:45,603 --> 00:28:46,603
You deserve it.

333
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:52,866
The chart, please.

334
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,212
You call me.

335
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:05,909
I wanna know what happens.

336
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:18,559
<i>... was shut down for several hours</i>

337
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:21,435
<i>in the wake of a fiery car accident
that left two injured.</i>

338
00:29:21,564 --> 00:29:24,570
<i>An unidentified
40-year-old woman and her son.</i>

339
00:29:25,103 --> 00:29:26,366
<i>Fortunately for the two of them,</i>

340
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:29,391
<i>Dr. Jack Shephard was near
the scene of the crash</i>

341
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:31,503
<i>and pulled both victims
from the burning wreckage</i>

342
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:34,306
<i>and treated them at the scene
until paramedics arrived.</i>

343
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:37,469
<i>The victims were later transported
to St. Sebastian hospital.</i>

344
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,506
<i>Further details of their conditions
have not yet been released.</i>

345
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:51,991
I'm going back.

346
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:55,531
- What?
- I'm going back to the beach.

347
00:29:55,987 --> 00:29:57,525
No way. We keep moving.

348
00:29:57,865 --> 00:29:59,233
I ain't asking permission.

349
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:08,262
Look, you got a job to do here.

350
00:30:08,488 --> 00:30:10,361
I ain't gonna stand in your way
of doing it,

351
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,892
but you sure as hell don't need me.

352
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:14,702
What do you think you're gonna get done,

353
00:30:14,866 --> 00:30:16,005
alone and unarmed?

354
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:18,218
He won't be alone. I'll go with him.

355
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,116
20 mins ago,
you weren't even interested in going,

356
00:30:25,238 --> 00:30:26,247
and now all of a sudden

357
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:28,810
- you're telling Jack...
- I didn't wanna go with you.

358
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:34,116
It's a suicide mission without guns.

359
00:30:34,405 --> 00:30:35,978
I know where there are some guns.

360
00:30:36,796 --> 00:30:39,022
There's a hidden cache
a couple of miles from here.

361
00:30:39,144 --> 00:30:41,574
I can take us back to the beach
on a route past it.

362
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:44,238
Juliet, you don't have to do that.

363
00:30:45,154 --> 00:30:47,321
Yeah, Jack, I kinda do.

364
00:30:56,723 --> 00:30:57,904
Let's do this.

365
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:05,034
Don't do anything stupid.

366
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,199
I won't if you won't.

367
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:18,778
Don't wait up.

368
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:39,653
I told you to shut up!

369
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:41,843
You know how you get a tune stuck
in your head?

370
00:31:42,077 --> 00:31:43,984
This song...
It just started coming to me.

371
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:45,259
It's almost finished.

372
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:46,602
Just need to find the bridge.

373
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,326
Get the speargun.

374
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,260
- What? Why?
- 'Cause I want it to hurt.

375
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,721
- No, Ben said we...
- You don't wanna get it? I will.

376
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:58,263
No. I'll... I'll shut up!

377
00:32:08,104 --> 00:32:10,382
I thought you two
were on assignment in Canada.

378
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,443
He made us promise not to tell anyone.

379
00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:20,205
- Hello again.
- Where is the other one?

380
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:23,292
- What?
- This idiot swam down from a boat.

381
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:25,516
I was just shooting at his friend.

382
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:27,566
He dove down here.

383
00:32:27,688 --> 00:32:29,670
- He's alone.
- Are you sure about that?

384
00:32:31,473 --> 00:32:33,579
Here's a better question
to ask, Cyclops.

385
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,220
Why did your little friend Ben
tell you people

386
00:32:36,342 --> 00:32:38,901
that this entire station
was flooded when it isn't?

387
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:42,840
Or, why these two have been
jamming transmissions off the island?

388
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:44,835
What?

389
00:32:45,868 --> 00:32:46,868
Is that true?

390
00:32:48,578 --> 00:32:50,150
- That's Ben.
- I'll get it.

391
00:32:56,807 --> 00:33:00,090
You have to understand.
Everything I did, I did for the island.

392
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:03,512
The island told you it was necessary
for you to jam your own people?

393
00:33:03,723 --> 00:33:06,883
Yes, it did.
You've always been a loyalist, Mikhail.

394
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:08,590
Now I'm asking you to trust me,

395
00:33:08,848 --> 00:33:11,267
<i>to trust Jacob who told me to do that.</i>

396
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:13,939
Why would Jacob ask you
to lie to your own people?

397
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,157
Because this island is under assault

398
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:18,606
by forces stronger
than anything it's had to deal with

399
00:33:18,728 --> 00:33:21,593
in many, many years,
and we are meant to protect it,

400
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,844
by any means necessary.

401
00:33:24,284 --> 00:33:26,616
The jamming was for everyone's security.

402
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:30,373
We are in a serious situation here.

403
00:33:32,788 --> 00:33:34,495
So why not trust me?

404
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:36,348
I made a mistake.

405
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:39,728
I should have told you, and I apologize.

406
00:33:43,163 --> 00:33:44,431
Mikhail, are you still there?

407
00:33:50,474 --> 00:33:51,474
Yes.

408
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:55,672
I need you to help me.

409
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,823
I need you to help me clean up
this mess that I've made.

410
00:34:03,535 --> 00:34:05,079
I need you to kill Charlie.

411
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,574
<i>Make sure that the jamming mechanism
continues to function at all cost.</i>

412
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:14,360
And we can't risk Greta and Bonnie
telling the others what we've done,

413
00:34:14,482 --> 00:34:16,285
so you'll have to take care
of them, too.

414
00:34:21,744 --> 00:34:24,282
How do I know you didn't say
the same thing to them about me?

415
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:27,256
Because if I had, Mikhail...

416
00:34:28,158 --> 00:34:29,315
you'd already be dead.

417
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:46,779
Out of those polar bear cages
and put us on the chain gang,

418
00:34:47,512 --> 00:34:50,214
what the hell did you have us
breaking all those rocks for, anyway?

419
00:34:50,334 --> 00:34:51,730
We were building a runway.

420
00:34:52,487 --> 00:34:53,832
A runway? For what?

421
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,923
The aliens.

422
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,364
I don't know what for.

423
00:34:59,486 --> 00:35:01,177
Do you think they told me everything?

424
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,825
Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.

425
00:35:05,243 --> 00:35:06,676
So you screwing Jack yet?

426
00:35:06,987 --> 00:35:08,332
No. Are you?

427
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:12,835
How far away are these guns?

428
00:35:13,298 --> 00:35:14,455
There aren't any guns.

429
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:17,112
What?

430
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,219
- I lied.
- You lied.

431
00:35:19,737 --> 00:35:21,842
It was the only way he'd let us go back.

432
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,728
So why are you going back?

433
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:31,801
Karma.

434
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:34,752
Why are you going back, James?

435
00:35:39,424 --> 00:35:40,499
Hey, guys! Wait up!

436
00:35:43,577 --> 00:35:44,937
What the hell do you want?

437
00:35:45,237 --> 00:35:46,434
I'm coming with you guys.

438
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:49,029
No way. Not a chance.

439
00:35:49,798 --> 00:35:50,850
Come on. I can help.

440
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:53,141
They're my friends, too, man.

441
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:55,302
Charlie wouldn't let me go with him,

442
00:35:55,842 --> 00:35:58,554
and Jack's too busy leading
to even talk to me.

443
00:36:00,986 --> 00:36:02,354
I just wanna help. Please?

444
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:06,743
For God sakes, Hugo, look at you!

445
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,818
You're just gonna get in the way.

446
00:36:10,674 --> 00:36:11,937
You wanna get us killed?

447
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:17,403
Come on.

448
00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:33,598
If we head north,

449
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:36,954
we should get to them
before they reach the tower.

450
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:38,918
Why did you let me come?

451
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,782
I let you come because
I'm delivering you to your new family.

452
00:36:44,312 --> 00:36:46,367
I let you come because you betrayed me.

453
00:36:47,657 --> 00:36:49,304
You locked Karl in a cage.

454
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:52,046
You put him in a room
and tried to brainwash him.

455
00:36:53,156 --> 00:36:54,837
I didn't want him to get you pregnant.

456
00:36:56,623 --> 00:36:58,138
I suppose I overreacted.

457
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:01,717
We'd better get going.

458
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:05,086
Why do you have to stop them?

459
00:37:06,155 --> 00:37:07,730
Why won't you just let them leave?

460
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,613
Because I can't, Alex.

461
00:38:54,471 --> 00:38:55,593
Don't, John.

462
00:39:03,296 --> 00:39:04,423
Put the gun down.

463
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:09,847
Walt?

464
00:39:10,029 --> 00:39:11,093
Now get up, John.

465
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,275
He shot me, and I can't...

466
00:39:18,282 --> 00:39:19,475
move my legs.

467
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:20,992
You can move your legs.

468
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:22,948
Now get out of the ditch.

469
00:39:24,844 --> 00:39:25,844
Why?

470
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:28,450
Because you have work to do.
