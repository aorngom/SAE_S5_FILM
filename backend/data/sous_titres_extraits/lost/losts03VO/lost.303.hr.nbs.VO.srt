Lost...

2
00:00:01,759 --> 00:00:03,334
Each one of us

3
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:05,116
was brought here for a reason.

4
00:00:05,416 --> 00:00:06,846
And who brought us here, John?

5
00:00:06,888 --> 00:00:07,903
The island.

6
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,204
It's destiny.

7
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:12,028
<i>You and your partner will observe</i>

8
00:00:12,069 --> 00:00:14,724
<i>a psychological experiment,
in progress.</i>

9
00:00:14,783 --> 00:00:16,811
<i>Your duty is to observe team members</i>

10
00:00:16,894 --> 00:00:18,448
<i>in another station on the island.</i>

11
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,232
<i>These team members are not aware
that they are under surveillance</i>

12
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:23,284
<i>or that they are the subjects
of an experiment.</i>

13
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:28,222
Every single second
of my pathetic little life

14
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:30,444
is as useless as that button!

15
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:32,863
As long as you push it,
we'll never be free.

16
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:35,931
If you're so sure it's not real,

17
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:37,584
then just stop pushing the button.

18
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,299
Well, I have, except, unfortunately,

19
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:42,463
someone else decided to start.

20
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:45,601
Tomorrow we're gonna find out
what happens

21
00:00:45,684 --> 00:00:48,084
if that button doesn't get pushed.

22
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:58,543
Who is he, Box Man...

23
00:00:58,594 --> 00:01:00,480
the man out there pounding on the door?

24
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:02,561
His name is Mr. Eko.

25
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:06,393
Why does Mr. Eko carry around
a stick covered in scripture?

26
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:07,927
Because he's a priest.

27
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:10,797
- We need to push the button.
- No, we don't!

28
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:13,522
It's all bloody real!
Now push the damn button!

29
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:17,602
- You've killed us all.
- No, I just saved us all.

30
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:22,318
<i>System failure.</i>

31
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:24,391
<i>System failure.</i>

32
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:33,793
I was wrong.

33
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,735
When John get back?

34
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:08,218
What's he doing?

35
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:14,953
Well, where's he been?
Where's everyone else?

36
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:16,787
Don't you think you should go find out?

37
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,772
So you're gone for a whole day

38
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:29,197
after a massive hatch detonation.

39
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:31,603
You don't call,

40
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:33,261
you don't write.

41
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,947
Sorry. Am I interrupting something?

42
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:43,080
What, you...

43
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:45,460
you can't speak, John?

44
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:46,683
You're mute?

45
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:50,759
I am sorry about that.

46
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:53,020
So where are Eko and Desmond?

47
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:56,356
Are they off being mute
and building structures as well?

48
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:00,204
I know. You can't speak.

49
00:04:01,814 --> 00:04:03,085
You need to speak.

50
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,753
To me? What do you want to...

51
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:11,547
The sand. You need to speak to the sand.

52
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,882
Trees. Yeah, I've heard
they're wonderful conversationalists.

53
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:21,546
I don't understand.

54
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:23,612
Who do you need to speak to?

55
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:26,637
The... church.

56
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:28,233
Sky.

57
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:31,800
Island.

58
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:40,223
You need to speak...

59
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:41,736
to the island.

00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,239
"I need your help."

64
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:17,664
Since when do you need my help?

65
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:31,016
"I need u 2 stand guard."

66
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:34,140
Oh, yeah, so you can talk to the island.

67
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:36,868
Yeah. Sounds dangerous.

68
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,619
Well, amusing
as the mute game invariably is...

69
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,925
You are aware, John,
that I detest you, aren't you?

70
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:50,215
You do remember
repeatedly punching me in the face

71
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:52,997
and accusing me of using heroin
when I was not?

72
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:59,070
What the sodding hell
is a "sweat lodge"?

73
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,038
Where you headed?

74
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:35,530
Eureka.

75
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:38,387
Well, I can get you
as far as Bridgeville.

76
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:40,974
Come on, hop in. Come on.

77
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:55,531
- My name's John.
- Eddie.

78
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,240
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

79
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,403
- Nasty day to be hitching.
- That's for sure.

80
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:05,014
If you don't mind my asking,
what's in Eureka?

81
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:07,996
I heard there was some work there,
cutting timber.

82
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:09,986
Is that what you do?

83
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:11,830
That might be what I do. I don't know.

84
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:14,393
All I know is that I had to get out
of where I came from.

85
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,506
Mom's dead, dad's a drunk.

86
00:07:23,398 --> 00:07:25,180
Hey, look at that. The rain is passing.

87
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,413
What, did you rob a bank?

88
00:07:34,806 --> 00:07:35,967
'Fraid so.

89
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:44,528
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

90
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,305
Was I speeding, officer?

91
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:47,382
Tail light's out.

92
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:52,419
Could you both please
step out of the vehicle?

93
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:00,741
What do you got back here?

94
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,746
Guns and groceries.

95
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,129
Now the transaction logs
and the paperwork

96
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:17,226
for all of 'em's in the red notebook
right there in that duffel.

97
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:24,528
So are we free to go?

98
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:30,080
I could still take you in
for picking up a hitchhiker.

99
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:31,738
Oh, that's my uncle.

100
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:35,766
I called him, and he picked me up.

101
00:08:43,598 --> 00:08:44,800
Get outta here.

102
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,536
So what is with all the guns...

103
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:01,589
uncle?

104
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:07,334
I like the indoor fireplace.

105
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:09,636
It's very snazzy.

106
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:13,611
What's that?

107
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,240
You're not...
taking drugs, are you, John?

108
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,064
I only ask because of the strict
zero-tolerance policy you've enacted.

109
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:26,801
I wouldn't want you to have
to start punching yourself in the face.

110
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:34,017
Yeah, I know. I get it. You're gonna go
in your little magic hut,

111
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:36,960
and I'm gonna stand out here
in case you devolve into a monkey.

112
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:43,131
"Don't... come in."

113
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:46,896
Okay. I get it.

114
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:42,867
Hi, John.

115
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,400
It's good to see you again.

116
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,833
What's that, John?

117
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:58,141
You're sorry.

118
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:00,152
That's okay.

119
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:02,618
I was the sacrifice the island demanded.

120
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:10,281
Don't worry.

121
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:12,914
You'll speak
when you have something worth saying.

122
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:15,914
I'm here
to help you find your way again,

123
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:18,569
so you can bring
the family back together.

124
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:22,435
Come on.

125
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,714
I want to show you something.

126
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,506
You're gonna need that.

127
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:59,410
John, someone in this airport
is in serious danger.

128
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:02,232
You are the only one who can save them.

129
00:12:07,414 --> 00:12:08,948
Not them. They'll be fine...

130
00:12:09,258 --> 00:12:10,398
for a while.

131
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:20,334
I think Sayid's got it.

132
00:12:21,661 --> 00:12:22,738
Next, please.

133
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:34,353
Not Hurley.

134
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,040
Forget it. He's helping himself.

135
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:14,358
There's nothing you can do for them,
not yet.

136
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:17,000
First,
you have to clean up your own mess.

137
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:19,331
<i>Clean up your own mess...</i>

138
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:22,313
<i>first,
you have to clean up your own mess.</i>

139
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:39,509
Come up here, John.

140
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:54,905
<i>Clean it up, John.</i>

141
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:56,743
They've got him.

142
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,406
You don't have much time.

143
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,311
What happened?

144
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:22,406
Are you all right?

145
00:14:39,115 --> 00:14:40,317
What are you doing?

146
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:46,045
I'm going to save Mr. Eko's life.

147
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:12,494
Eko's cross.

148
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,986
He was dragged this way.

149
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:15,581
Dragged?

150
00:15:16,577 --> 00:15:17,571
By what?

151
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:18,690
By the polar bear.

152
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:21,658
Sawyer killed the polar bear.

153
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:24,228
He killed a polar bear.

154
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:53,629
What's that, John, blood?

155
00:15:55,844 --> 00:15:58,435
I'm gonna go on alone, Charlie.
You go back to Claire.

156
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:00,763
Well, I'll take my chances.

157
00:16:00,797 --> 00:16:02,566
You don't want to go with me, Charlie.

158
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:06,813
Bad things happen to people
who hang around with me.

159
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:18,472
Hey, Bobby.

160
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,163
What's that?

161
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:45,085
That, Eddie, is our sweat lodge.

162
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:46,719
A what?

163
00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:49,766
Anybody who wants
can go in there and light a fire

164
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:52,379
and get it nice and hot and meditate.

165
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:53,561
Then what?

166
00:16:53,892 --> 00:16:56,291
And then you're supposed
to find what to do with your life,

167
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,422
you know, what-- what direction to take.

168
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:02,025
Go on in there and figure out
if you're a farmer or a hunter.

169
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:06,303
So which are you, John?

170
00:17:11,354 --> 00:17:12,369
Hey, John.

171
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:14,432
Hey, Mike. Jan, this is Eddie.

172
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,233
He's looking for some logging work,

173
00:17:16,274 --> 00:17:18,884
but I convinced him to come home
and have supper with us first.

174
00:17:18,957 --> 00:17:20,853
- Nice to meet you, Eddie.
- Nice to meet you.

175
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:23,340
Any friend of John's
is a friend of ours.

176
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,060
Right. John's a very special guy.

177
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:27,723
Grab a spot.

178
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:31,408
So you like Geronimo Jackson, huh?

179
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:33,758
Yeah, yeah. They're all right.

180
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:35,442
It's one of my dad's old shirts.

181
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:36,997
Your dad has excellent taste.

182
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:39,813
Listen up, people.

183
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,344
John brought a guest to supper.

184
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:45,519
So, everyone, this is Eddie.

185
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:48,585
- Hi, Eddie.
- Eddie, this is everyone.

186
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:51,803
Nice to meet you.

187
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:53,668
John, you want to say some grace?

188
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:54,808
Yeah.

189
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,868
Thank you, Lord.

190
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,226
Thank you for the food and the friends,

191
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:07,131
and thanks for the rain today,

192
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:10,218
so that Adam will stop
grumbling about the drought.

193
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:15,624
And for me, thank you
for helping me stop being so angry,

194
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,987
And... and for...

195
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,018
helping me find a real family.

196
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,008
Because they're a hell of a lot better

197
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:29,174
than the one I used to have,
so let's eat. Amen.

198
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:31,949
Let's dig in.

199
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:33,628
Potatoes?

200
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:37,182
Thank you. Thank you.

201
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:05,174
Is that the hatch?

202
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:06,666
What's left of it.

203
00:19:07,498 --> 00:19:08,574
What happened?

204
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:11,797
Looks like it...

205
00:19:11,982 --> 00:19:13,018
imploded.

206
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,257
What is that?

207
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:52,957
It's an active kill.

208
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:56,599
Meaning that whatever
was eating this is coming back for more.

209
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:58,983
If you want to say polar bear,
you can just say it.

210
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:04,932
All right. Polar bear.

211
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:12,292
Run!

212
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,203
Dude.

213
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,927
They kept Jack, Kate and Sawyer,

214
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,557
And they sent me back
to tell everyone else

215
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,547
that we can't ever go over there.

216
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:03,018
Oh, and that dude
we had in the hatch--

217
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:04,199
Henry?

218
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:06,956
He was there. He's, like, their leader.

219
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,505
So... what do we do?

220
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,156
Do what they told you.
Go back to the camp and tell the others.

221
00:21:19,415 --> 00:21:20,627
You're not gonna do anything?

222
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,477
I am doing something.
Go back to the beach, Hugo.

223
00:21:24,827 --> 00:21:26,298
Wait. Where are you guys going?

224
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,227
The island told Locke
he has to save Eko.

225
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,695
Save him from what?

226
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,489
Well, apparently a bear's got him.

227
00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:35,810
It's just made an active kill.

228
00:21:36,617 --> 00:21:38,006
You may want to hustle.

229
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:43,697
Bear?

230
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:49,475
What bear?

231
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,478
What's that, more fur?

232
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:05,292
This way.

233
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:13,257
When I used to get high,

234
00:22:14,386 --> 00:22:16,583
I'd watch nature programs on the "beeb."

235
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:19,764
Polar bears
are meant to be quite clever.

236
00:22:20,003 --> 00:22:21,143
Very clever.

237
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,830
They're like the Einsteins

238
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,033
of the bear community.

239
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,425
She likes you, man.

240
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:55,964
Oh, yeah, she does.

241
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:57,560
- She does not.
- Yeah, she does.

242
00:22:57,601 --> 00:23:00,150
She's like half my age, man.
You'd be better off with her.

243
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:02,514
No. Lizzie's too granola for me.

244
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:05,283
What she really wants is a daddy.

245
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:06,918
Like everyone else here.

246
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,369
You should take advantage of that.

247
00:23:08,431 --> 00:23:09,882
That's not real funny, Eddie.

248
00:23:12,745 --> 00:23:13,865
It was a joke.

249
00:23:14,362 --> 00:23:16,113
It was a joke! I'm sorry.

250
00:23:20,655 --> 00:23:22,769
How come you never talk
about your dad, John?

251
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:24,929
Nothing worth talking about.

252
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:33,355
What's going on
in that greenhouse over there?

253
00:23:35,491 --> 00:23:37,299
Maybe they need a hand
with that fertilizer.

254
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:39,268
No, no, they're okay. They're okay.

255
00:23:39,516 --> 00:23:41,087
Come on. We got orchard duty.

256
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:50,942
What's the big secret, John?

257
00:23:52,451 --> 00:23:53,476
Sorry?

258
00:23:53,828 --> 00:23:56,830
The greenhouse. What do you guys
got in there? What are you hiding?

259
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,148
'Cause every time I go near it,
you and everyone else acts all weird.

260
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,573
Look, you're a guest here.
These things take time.

261
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:04,809
I've been here for six weeks.

262
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:06,902
- Eddie, nothing's--
- I'm not blind, man.

263
00:24:07,151 --> 00:24:09,430
Did you forget that you had
a duffel bag full of guns

264
00:24:09,493 --> 00:24:11,586
- When you brought me here?
- Mike and Jan

265
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:14,352
welcomed you here with open arms.
They feed you.

266
00:24:14,394 --> 00:24:17,275
- They give you a place to stay...
- And Mike and Jan

267
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:19,741
fold their hands every night before chow

268
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:21,184
and talk about how we're family,

269
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:23,837
but your family's got too many secrets.

270
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:27,582
Now I see the fertilizer
going into that greenhouse.

271
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:29,550
I know what's going on...

272
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:32,088
and I want in.

273
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,507
In on what?

274
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:37,198
Whatever you guys are trying to blow up.

275
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:44,843
What's so funny?

276
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:47,683
Nothing.

277
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:51,237
I'll talk to Mike and Jan.

278
00:25:00,756 --> 00:25:02,622
You really think Eko's in there?

279
00:25:06,893 --> 00:25:08,364
Let's hurry up and do this.

280
00:25:08,468 --> 00:25:10,250
Maybe the bear's out
finishing his lunch.

281
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:12,610
- You're not going in there, Charlie.
- What?

282
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:14,898
I'm gonna do this alone.

283
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:17,525
You don't tell me
what I can't do.

284
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:19,063
If I want to,
I'll go in there.

285
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:20,093
- Why?
- What?

286
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,859
Why do you want to go in there?

287
00:25:21,983 --> 00:25:23,268
I don't need a reason.

288
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:25,336
- Then go back.
- Go back?

289
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:27,644
You don't have a good reason
to go in there, either.

290
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:30,591
I'm going in there because
I'm supposed to go in there.

291
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:36,483
If it all goes to plan,

292
00:25:36,545 --> 00:25:38,653
we probably won't even see
the bear, will we?

293
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,539
Hopefully he won't smell us.

294
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:46,261
Hair spray? Now I hate to be the one

295
00:25:46,365 --> 00:25:48,606
- to point this out to you--
- It's not for me.

296
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:39,431
Bear?

297
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:42,569
Is that you?

298
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,871
Who's there?

299
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:47,865
Are you alone, brother?

300
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:50,314
Yeah.

301
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,730
Dude. I'm not alone.

302
00:26:57,007 --> 00:26:58,582
The beach camp's right over there.

303
00:26:58,645 --> 00:26:59,971
Can you get me some clothes?

304
00:27:00,944 --> 00:27:02,167
What happened to yours?

305
00:27:05,638 --> 00:27:07,296
I woke up in the jungle like this.

306
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:09,882
So...

307
00:27:10,794 --> 00:27:12,203
like, the hatch...

308
00:27:14,582 --> 00:27:15,991
blew off your underwear?

309
00:27:17,857 --> 00:27:21,045
Fine. You wanna discuss this
in great detail right now, let's do it.

310
00:27:21,108 --> 00:27:23,411
No, no, that's okay.
I got something in here.

311
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:29,384
How do you feel about tie-dye?

312
00:28:28,527 --> 00:28:29,563
Hey, Kim.

313
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:31,854
Hey, Mike and Jan in?

314
00:28:32,534 --> 00:28:34,546
Yeah. They were looking for you.

315
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:38,597
Good, good. Good timing, then, huh?

316
00:28:41,075 --> 00:28:42,215
Go on in.

317
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,990
- You got all the cash?
- In the bag.

318
00:28:47,052 --> 00:28:49,063
- Which bag?
- The one with the money in it!

319
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:50,865
- What about the bank records?
- Leave 'em.

320
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:52,614
Shouldn't we sort out
what they can trace?

321
00:28:52,655 --> 00:28:54,127
There is no time, Mike.

322
00:28:54,552 --> 00:28:55,982
What's going on?

323
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,723
What does it look like?

324
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,523
I don't...

325
00:29:00,524 --> 00:29:02,700
you screwed up, John.
You blew it big time.

326
00:29:04,872 --> 00:29:06,188
What are you--
what...

327
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,536
What are you doing?

328
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:11,466
Are you leaving?

329
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:14,223
- Why?
- That is why, you idiot!

330
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:15,966
John, your friend's a cop.

331
00:29:16,078 --> 00:29:18,370
You know how much jail time
we'd get for this much weed?

332
00:29:18,412 --> 00:29:21,357
Nice picture, huh?
Got him fresh out of the academy.

333
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,118
No, he was--
He was hitchhiking.

334
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,669
He told me he was going to Eureka.

335
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:26,368
He was waiting for you, John.

336
00:29:26,493 --> 00:29:29,078
He has been here
for six weeks gathering evidence

337
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,559
because you brought him here.

338
00:29:30,622 --> 00:29:33,116
- No, Mike, that's impossible.
- He played you for a sucker.

339
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:34,311
Now it's over.

340
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:37,457
No. Wait.

341
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,462
Wait. No, wait, wait. Stop!

342
00:29:42,498 --> 00:29:43,949
We don't know what he's told 'em.

343
00:29:44,011 --> 00:29:45,616
He hasn't even been in here yet.

344
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,041
If he's still gathering evidence
and trying to make a case,

345
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,089
- then it's not too late.
- Not too late for what?

346
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:52,123
To protect us. To protect all of us.

347
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,858
It's not too late to fix this.

348
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:55,723
I can fix this.

349
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,052
How are you gonna do that, John?

350
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:17,526
Is he okay?

351
00:31:17,816 --> 00:31:18,936
He alive?

352
00:31:19,154 --> 00:31:20,957
- Is he all right?
- He's alive.

353
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:22,885
Turn him over, turn him over.

354
00:31:23,354 --> 00:31:25,033
Charlie, we gotta get outta here.

355
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:26,829
Okay. Let's get him up.

356
00:31:31,744 --> 00:31:34,210
So, when you say "turned a key,"

357
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:36,046
you mean, like, a key key?

358
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,984
It was a failsafe key.

359
00:31:38,585 --> 00:31:40,118
That seems kinda convenient.

360
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,356
I'm sorry?

361
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:45,632
I'm just saying, if you had
this magic key the whole time,

362
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:47,258
why didn't you, like, use it?

363
00:31:47,445 --> 00:31:48,926
I didn't know what would happen.

364
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:50,294
So what did happen?

365
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:52,311
Well, the failsafe key
must have detonated

366
00:31:52,353 --> 00:31:55,444
the electromagnetic anomaly,
made the hatch implode.

367
00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:57,827
But you didn't implode.

368
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:05,109
You're not gonna, like,
turn into the Hulk or something?

369
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:09,905
So is that what made the blender noise

370
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:11,385
and the sky turn purple?

371
00:32:11,488 --> 00:32:13,177
Afraid I missed that, brother.

372
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,086
Right. You were failsafing.
Well, F.Y.I.,

373
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:18,407
the whole island vibrated,

374
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,610
and Kate and Jack
and Sawyer saw it, too,

375
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:22,738
right before they had bags
pulled over their heads--

376
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:23,898
Don't worry.

377
00:32:24,312 --> 00:32:25,950
Locke's gonna go after them.

378
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:28,383
- He said so in his speech.
- What?

379
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:31,981
What speech?

380
00:32:32,402 --> 00:32:35,242
All he said was
he was gonna save Eko and kill bears.

381
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:38,815
Right.

382
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:41,084
Right, of course.

383
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:43,897
I'm sorry. I...

384
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:47,475
I'm just, uh, a bit shook up.

385
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:01,878
I burned that bear pretty good.

386
00:33:02,078 --> 00:33:04,150
I don't think
he's gonna be coming after us.

387
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,576
Now that we've survived
this suicide mission,

388
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,083
do you wanna tell me what you saw?

389
00:33:10,643 --> 00:33:11,655
What I saw?

390
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:13,778
In your spirit tent.

391
00:33:15,665 --> 00:33:16,888
I saw Boone.

392
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:20,544
Boone?

393
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:24,360
What did he have to say for himself?

394
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:26,938
He told me I had
to clean up my own mess.

395
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:30,002
Well, dead as he may be,

396
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:31,831
I agree with Boone.

397
00:33:32,204 --> 00:33:34,851
After all, if you kept pressing
that button like Eko told you to--

398
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:37,307
We wouldn't have had
to save him in the first place,

399
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,449
yeah, charlie, that's what cleaning up
your own mess means.

400
00:33:43,178 --> 00:33:46,100
Spoken like someone who's had
a few too many messes to clean.

401
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,672
No deer, huh?

402
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,359
You talk to Mike and Jan yet?

403
00:34:06,284 --> 00:34:07,714
Yeah, sure did.

404
00:34:08,244 --> 00:34:09,591
Yeah? What'd they say?

405
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:13,600
They said that I should bring you
by the greenhouse

406
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:16,741
tonight after supper
and that they would explain everything.

407
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,034
Cool.

408
00:34:19,201 --> 00:34:20,300
That's great.

409
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,033
What, did you see something?

410
00:34:37,445 --> 00:34:38,761
What are you doing?

411
00:34:38,823 --> 00:34:40,792
Did you know it would be me?

412
00:34:41,903 --> 00:34:43,416
- What?
- In the truck.

413
00:34:43,976 --> 00:34:45,799
Did you know it would be me driving?

414
00:34:47,022 --> 00:34:48,411
Did they choose me?

415
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:52,110
They? John, I have no idea
what you're talking about--

416
00:34:52,144 --> 00:34:53,549
I didn't load that one.

417
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:02,477
So how about you just
answer the question, Eddie?

418
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:04,498
Yeah.

419
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,119
They chose you, John.

420
00:35:10,363 --> 00:35:11,393
Why?

421
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:13,964
Because you hadn't been here long,

422
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:16,477
didn't have a criminal record,
and the psych profile said

423
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:18,687
you would be amenable for coercion.

424
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,778
Amenable for coercion--

425
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:25,907
Lower the gun, John.

426
00:35:27,156 --> 00:35:29,705
Okay? This isn't personal.

427
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:31,343
It's not personal?!

428
00:35:38,251 --> 00:35:39,453
Stop, stop.

429
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:41,844
I'm sorry, John,
but you're not gonna shoot me.

430
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:43,800
You're not a murderer.

431
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,350
You're a good man.

432
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,396
You're a farmer.

433
00:35:52,461 --> 00:35:53,580
I'm not a farmer.

434
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:56,735
I was a hunter.

435
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,429
I'm a hunter.

436
00:36:01,569 --> 00:36:03,372
I'm gonna walk away now, John.

437
00:36:30,102 --> 00:36:32,113
Hey, John. You hear something?

438
00:36:35,118 --> 00:36:36,711
- It sounds like a stream.
- Yeah.

439
00:36:37,952 --> 00:36:40,750
Let's put him down.
Maybe if we get some water in him.

440
00:36:53,734 --> 00:36:55,848
I'll go. You stay here.

441
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:15,843
I'm sorry.

442
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:19,442
Sorry I ever doubted you.

443
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:24,325
Sorry I gave up
on my faith in the island.

444
00:37:29,303 --> 00:37:30,671
I messed up.

445
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:34,626
Now our people are captured and...

446
00:37:36,728 --> 00:37:38,207
if I'd just listened to you,

447
00:37:38,435 --> 00:37:39,865
if I'd just let you...

448
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:42,471
keep pushing the button...

449
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,236
I could've gone with them,

450
00:37:47,446 --> 00:37:48,752
protected them.

451
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,943
I could've saved 'em.

452
00:37:54,936 --> 00:37:56,781
You can still protect them...

453
00:38:03,107 --> 00:38:04,620
you can still save them.

454
00:38:12,231 --> 00:38:14,242
I don't even know where they are.

455
00:38:14,594 --> 00:38:15,941
You will find them.

456
00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:21,646
After all...

457
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:24,234
you are a hunter, John.

458
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:33,090
- You say something?
- He's awake.

459
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:53,642
Maybe we should just...

460
00:38:54,337 --> 00:38:55,559
get him back.

461
00:39:02,003 --> 00:39:04,677
- You all right?
- Yeah. Just keep walking.

462
00:39:09,664 --> 00:39:10,680
What happened?

463
00:39:10,742 --> 00:39:11,841
We got him.

464
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:14,113
- Is he alive?
- We need Jack.

465
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,210
- Take him in.
- Jack's not coming back.

466
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,355
- They've got him.
- What?

467
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:20,661
What are you talking about?

468
00:39:20,717 --> 00:39:22,748
- Jack's gone?
- I don't understand.

469
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:25,368
Okay, when were you planning
on telling us, Hurley?

470
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,036
What do you mean, "they"? Who's "they"?

471
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:28,290
"They"

472
00:39:28,808 --> 00:39:30,155
are the others,

473
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:31,896
and yes, they've taken Jack...

474
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:34,010
and Kate and Sawyer.

475
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:35,933
How? What happened?

476
00:39:36,016 --> 00:39:38,145
What about Sun and Jin and Sayid?

477
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:40,010
- Are they okay?
- I don't know.

478
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:43,182
I'm gonna find our friends.

479
00:39:45,873 --> 00:39:47,893
I don't know how yet, but I will.

480
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,930
We're gonna find them--
all of them.

481
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,899
And then we're gonna bring them home.

482
00:39:54,927 --> 00:39:57,187
But first things first.
We've gotta look after Mr. Eko,

483
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,654
so, Paulo, Nikki,
bring towels and water.

484
00:40:00,043 --> 00:40:01,276
Claire, we gotta clean him up,

485
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,815
so bring all the first aid supplies you.

486
00:40:14,384 --> 00:40:15,669
Not a bad speech.

487
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:22,655
"Whoa," what?

488
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:27,308
Just got hit with, you know...

489
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:33,847
déjà vu.

490
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:40,561
Well, when that wears off,

491
00:40:40,644 --> 00:40:43,960
can you get, bandadges,
from the kitchen?
