1
00:00:00,805 --> 00:00:03,229
Previously on "Lost"... the others are coming.

2
00:00:03,274 --> 00:00:07,090
We have only three choices-- run, hide or die.

3
00:00:07,352 --> 00:00:08,487
We do have a plan.

4
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:10,576
Yeah, you're going into the jungle and get some dynamite

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,955
and blow open the hatch, and then you're gonna hide everyone inside.

6
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:14,899
No.

7
00:00:16,348 --> 00:00:18,870
Stop! Stop it!

8
00:00:18,963 --> 00:00:20,577
Stop it! We can't!

9
00:00:20,998 --> 00:00:22,467
Stop! Don't light it!

10
00:01:32,065 --> 00:01:35,639
Nobody can tell ya

11
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:39,924
there's only one song worth singin'

12
00:01:40,203 --> 00:01:43,154
they may try and sell ya

13
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:45,052
'cause it hangs them up

14
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:50,389
to see someone like you

15
00:01:50,434 --> 00:01:55,342
but you've gotta make your own kind of music

16
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:59,716
sing an old-fashioned song

17
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,191
make your own kind of music

18
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:10,295
even if nobody else sings along

19
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:15,129
you're gonna be nowhere

20
00:02:15,316 --> 00:02:19,510
the loneliest kind of lonely

21
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:22,123
it may be rough going

22
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:29,700
just to do your thing's the hardest thing to do

23
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:31,264
but you've gotta...

24
00:04:12,273 --> 00:04:14,568
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42

25
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:16,944
4, 8, we're dead, 15, doomed, dead...

26
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:18,460
Hurley, are you okay?

27
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:21,649
Oh, yeah, awesome. I just have to pee.

28
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:24,403
Great idea, you two-- go look in the burning death hole.

29
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:42,631
What is it?

30
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,087
Doesn't matter what it is.

31
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:49,062
We blew the door so we could get everyone inside this thing so they'd be safe.

32
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:50,817
That plan is not gonna work.

33
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,667
We'll never get everyone down in time.

34
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:06,606
- Water.
- Shallow. Sounds like a puddle.

35
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:08,836
- Like, what, 40 feet down?
- 50, tops.

36
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:11,021
We could use the wire we pulled from the fuselage,

37
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:11,965
rig up a harness.

38
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:16,300
- John. We're leaving now.
- Yes. Great idea. Let's do that.

39
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:18,389
We all went through a lot to get here, Jack.

40
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:19,983
The ladder's broken.

41
00:05:20,928 --> 00:05:23,116
You're gonna lower 40 people down there one by one?

42
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,005
They're waiting for us to come back and tell them what to do.

43
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:27,673
So let's forget about the harnesses.

44
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:28,302
Jack?

45
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,624
What?

46
00:05:30,558 --> 00:05:32,459
Why don't we all just calm down here?

47
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:34,507
Look, if you want to go exploring in the morning, that's fine.

48
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:36,065
But tonight, we're done.

49
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:40,505
I'm gonna go get the dynamite that we didn't use, and we're heading back to the caves.

50
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:44,952
How about you pack it up, John?

51
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,301
Sure. Of course.

52
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,660
Okay.

53
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:02,527
Why don't you want to go down there, Jack?

54
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,290
Female, late 20s, no I.D.

55
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:10,807
She coded twice on the way over here.

56
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:11,796
Where's the other one?

57
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,649
Right behind us. They're on their way.

58
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:15,644
Fire department had to use the jaws.

59
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,727
What do we got here?

60
00:06:16,822 --> 00:06:18,010
Female, late 20s.

61
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,845
What the hell is that thing?

62
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:21,392
Piece of the steering column.

63
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:23,769
All right, let's go. Keep that collar steady.

64
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:25,094
- Page my father?
- Already did.

65
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:26,275
- Tell me.
- Her tire blew.

66
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:28,720
Car jumped the divider, went head-on with an S.U.V.

67
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:29,416
BP's dropping.

68
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:31,873
- Was she driving?
- Yeah. Alone.

69
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:34,103
Where's the driver of the S.U.V.?

70
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:38,300
Adam Rutherford. 57. Chest trauma. No breath sounds.

71
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:41,541
- Tube Mr. Rutherford while I--
- I can't intubate. You got to.

72
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:44,443
Dr. Sheppard, her B.P.'s 80 over 60.

73
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:49,122
Okay. I need a syringe, a big one.

74
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:51,112
You, hold pressure.

75
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:59,333
88 over 52. No radial pulse.

76
00:06:59,382 --> 00:07:02,667
I know. I know. Sacs flooded.

77
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:05,452
- Where's that--
- Right here.

78
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:07,111
- Got it?
- Yep.

79
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:16,267
B.P. stabilizing.

80
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:20,375
Tme of death 8:15 a.m.

81
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:27,078
Okay. Get me a blood gas and a c-spine.

82
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,899
Get her up to I.C.U. and keep her immobilized.

83
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:38,188
I want to dance... wedding.

84
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:39,556
Did you hear that?

85
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:42,460
Sweetie, you need to take it easy, okay? Just relax.

86
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,117
What did she say?

87
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:46,255
She said she has to dance at her wedding.

88
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:01,530
Okay? No one is out there.

89
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,811
No one is coming.

90
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:04,233
But the french woman said--

91
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:06,781
the french woman is missing a bloody wing nut, you know?

92
00:08:06,873 --> 00:08:09,872
I mean, it was all bollocks. It was a ghost story.

93
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:11,819
She set the fire herself.

94
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:15,760
What?

95
00:08:16,765 --> 00:08:18,188
Nothing.

96
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:23,776
Has anyone seen Vincent?

97
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:27,560
The dog? Anyone seen him?

98
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:29,590
Has anyone seen the dog?

99
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,754
Where are you going?

100
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:36,571
I lost the damn dog.

101
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,590
Why'd you do that?

102
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:48,993
Why'd you light the fuse, man?

103
00:08:51,425 --> 00:08:53,278
Why wouldn't I light the fuse?

104
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,505
Uh, maybe because I was running towards you,

105
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:59,679
waving my arms, yelling, "don't do that"?

106
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:03,860
Well, you got a point there.

107
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,003
I guess I was just excited to get inside.

108
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:09,761
I mean, that's why we came here, isn't it?

109
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:11,657
That's why we went all the way out to "the black rock"

110
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:13,602
and why we got the dynamite to blow the hatch.

111
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,302
We did it so that we could get inside, Hugo.

112
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,200
And to save everybody's lives.

113
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:21,679
And to save everyone's lives.

114
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:25,196
Or maybe it was just our destiny. Right, John?

115
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,073
Maybe.

116
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,253
Guys, uh, it's the hatch door.

117
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:32,963
You'd better see this.

118
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:43,034
Vincent!

119
00:09:43,313 --> 00:09:44,161
This is not a good idea.

120
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:45,440
I saw him five minutes ago.

121
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:48,097
Besides, you're the one who said there wasn't anyone out here.

122
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,653
I said we didn't see anyone.

123
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:52,824
The dog will come back on his own. He always does.

124
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:57,084
Watching that dog was the one thing anybody ever asked me to do.

125
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:58,697
If something happens to him...

126
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:02,294
When was the last time you slept or had something to eat?

127
00:10:02,387 --> 00:10:03,810
You're exhausted.

128
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,374
I can't tell that kid I lost his dog 'cause I was exhausted.

129
00:10:14,885 --> 00:10:16,529
I'll circle around behind him.

130
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,122
Okay.

131
00:10:28,723 --> 00:10:29,812
Vincent!

132
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,316
Sayid!

133
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:41,664
Sayid!

134
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,661
Where are you?! Sayid!

135
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,049
Sayid?!

136
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:18,582
Walt?

137
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:22,022
Shh.

138
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:26,997
What are you doing here?

139
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,076
Shannon!

140
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:34,361
What is it?

141
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:40,690
What?

142
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:52,121
Why do you wanna get down there so bad?

143
00:11:52,302 --> 00:11:57,200
-Ly. Why do I want to get down there so badly?

144
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,595
Jack thinks I'm crazy, doesn't he?

145
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:04,361
Why, 'cause you want to drop into a hatch that's been locked from the inside

146
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:07,161
by a foot-thick steel door that says "quarantine"?

147
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:10,901
Well, look at the bright side-- the damage is done.

148
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:12,410
"Bright side."

149
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:16,391
And if Jack thinks I've lost it, I can't blame him, really.

150
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:20,283
Then again, five hours ago, I was pulled into a hole

151
00:12:20,376 --> 00:12:23,529
by what appeared to be a column of black smoke.

152
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,321
Did you see it, Kate?

153
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:31,957
Then I guess we're both crazy.

154
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,353
Wonder what Jack thinks he saw.

155
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:41,397
You should go ahead, man.

156
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:43,580
Don't want Locke making time with your girl.

157
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:45,370
Joke, dude.

158
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:47,308
Not really in the mood, Hurley.

159
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:50,903
Really? Wow. Usually you're like Mr. Ha ha.

160
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:53,531
There you go.

161
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:55,987
Life's not so bad, right?

162
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:58,800
I mean, sure, the others are coming to, like, eat us all,

163
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:02,015
and every once in a while someone blows up all over you,

164
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,821
but we do get to sleep in every morning.

165
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:07,196
Uh-huh. And the numbers?

166
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:10,521
What?

167
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:11,942
"The numbers are bad."

168
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:14,175
That's what you were yelling right when I tackled you.

169
00:13:15,906 --> 00:13:18,566
- Yeah, it's kind of a long story.
- I got time.

170
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:22,857
- You'll think I'm crazy.
- Try me.

171
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:30,352
A while ago, I was in this kind of psych ward,

172
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:31,930
and there was this guy Leonard.

173
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:34,476
And all the time I knew him, all he ever said were these numbers--

174
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:39,661
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, over and over and over again.

175
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:41,700
And they kind of got stuck in my head.

176
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,072
So when I got out--

177
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:45,681
well, actually, a couple months after I'd got out,

178
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:49,707
I was buying a frozen burrito, and I thought, "hey, I should play the lottery."

179
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,209
And I guess those numbers were still stuck in my head. So I played them,

180
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:57,494
and I won $114 million.

181
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:00,089
And that's when it started happening.

182
00:14:00,227 --> 00:14:01,554
My grandpa died.

183
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:03,687
My house caught on fire.

184
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:07,255
The chicken joint that I worked at got hit by a meteor--

185
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:10,688
well... actually, meteorite.

186
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:14,971
Okay, so tonight I see the same friggin' numbers on that hatch thing,

187
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:17,011
just written on the side.

188
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,661
And that's why I tried to stop it, because that thing is cursed, man.

189
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:27,423
You were in a psych ward?

190
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:32,191
- I'm not crazy.
- I'm not saying you are.

191
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:34,942
So? What, that's it? That's all?

192
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:37,663
- What do you want me to say?
- How about you believe me, man?

193
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,220
Hurley, they're numbers.

194
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:47,508
What's that thing where doctors make you feel better just by talking to you?

195
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:50,161
- Bedside manner.
- Yeah, that.

196
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:53,653
Yours sucks, dude.

197
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:09,440
What happened to him?

198
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:12,500
Just try to relax, okay?

199
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,407
The car that I hit.

200
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:18,540
The other driver was older.

201
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:20,427
He died in the E.R.

202
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:28,056
I can't feel anything.

203
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:30,308
I know.

204
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,525
What's happened to me?

205
00:15:37,676 --> 00:15:41,106
You have a fracture dislocation of your thoracic lumbar spine

206
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,102
with multiple crushed vertebrae.

207
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:46,833
Your back is broken.

208
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:52,736
Your spleen is ruptured and bleeding into your abdomen, and that has to be stopped.

209
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:54,403
I'm gonna perform surgery

210
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:56,099
and repair as much damage as possible,

211
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:58,618
but even the most optimistic result

212
00:15:58,898 --> 00:16:04,047
puts the likelihood of retaining any feeling or mobility anywhere below the waist at...

213
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:07,922
extremely unlikely.

214
00:16:10,884 --> 00:16:11,768
Oh.

215
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:14,411
Dr. Shephard?

216
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,099
May I have a word, please?

217
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:23,198
So? What did I do wrong?

218
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,667
You did something wrong?

219
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:26,359
You're frowning.

220
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,162
My face is always this way.

221
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,535
Dad, hey, come on.

222
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:31,752
Let's hear it.

223
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,863
You might want to try handing out some hope every once in a while.

224
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:44,204
Even if there's a 99% probability that they're utterly, hopelessly screwed,

225
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,856
folks are much more inclined to hear that 1% chance

226
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:51,698
that things are gonna be okay.

227
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:53,642
Her spine's crushed.

228
00:16:53,968 --> 00:16:55,869
I tell her that everything's gonna be okay,

229
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:58,362
that's false hope, dad.

230
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,249
But maybe. Maybe.

231
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,170
But it's still hope.

232
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:19,115
I know what I saw.

233
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:20,370
It was him. It was Walt.

234
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:22,460
Shannon, please lower your voice. You'll upset the rest of the group.

235
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:23,423
I heard whispers.

236
00:17:23,498 --> 00:17:24,584
- Where?
- Everywhere.

237
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,768
- What whispers?
- I don't know. Them.

238
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,905
Do you think something happened to the raft?

239
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:31,733
Nothing happened to the raft. Walt is with your husband--

240
00:17:31,757 --> 00:17:33,849
Sayid, I know what I saw.

241
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:35,881
They're back.

242
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,186
Uh...

243
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:55,092
Locke found, uh...

244
00:17:55,883 --> 00:18:00,125
a hatch in the ground about a half mile from here.

245
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:03,916
We left to blow it open so that we could hide inside,

246
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:07,574
so all of us could hide inside in case...

247
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:13,365
but that doesn't matter now because it's not gonna work.

248
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,314
There's no way for all of us to get down in there tonight.

249
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:17,305
Jack?

250
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,142
Where's Dr. Arzt?

251
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:24,859
Uh, he didn't make it.

252
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,938
Did you see them?

253
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:29,686
Did you see the others?

254
00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:33,577
Hey, Shannon, there are no others! We've already had this conversation!

255
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,577
Hey!

256
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,711
Everything's gonna be okay.

257
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:54,853
Let's just-- let's take it easy. We're gonna be all right.

258
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,396
We're gonna stay here tonight, okay? Together.

259
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:02,503
We've still got four guns. We'll put lookouts at all the entrances.

260
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:07,027
We're all gonna be safe as long as we stay together.

261
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,396
The sun comes up in three hours,

262
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:13,700
and we're all gonna be here to see that happen.

263
00:19:17,997 --> 00:19:19,081
I promise.

264
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,794
John, what are you doing?

265
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:34,398
I'm getting some cable.

266
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:36,516
What for?

267
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:40,448
It's for the hatch. I'm going in.

268
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:49,511
Do you really think that's the smartest thing to do right now, John?

269
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,863
I doubt it.

270
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:54,043
In fact, you're right.

271
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,937
Safest thing is to stay here,

272
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,067
wait for morning,

273
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,677
wait for these "others," to see if they ever show up,

274
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:05,897
wait for the brave folks on the raft to bring help.

275
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,197
But me, I'm tired of waitin'.

276
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:33,504
So do you believe it?

277
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:39,602
Believe what?

278
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:43,744
That everything's gonna be okay.

279
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,796
Yeah.

280
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:50,340
I do.

281
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:52,771
That's kind of unlike you.

282
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,440
The whole glass-half-full thing.

283
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,369
There's a glass?

284
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:07,219
You did a good thing, saying what you said...

285
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,468
and taking care of everybody and

286
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:14,147
just giving them something to count on.

287
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:19,789
If you weren't here, Jack...

288
00:21:25,508 --> 00:21:27,356
I'm going to the hatch.

289
00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:32,167
I understand why you can't go. I mean, they need you here.

290
00:21:32,328 --> 00:21:34,237
I get it. I do.

291
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:40,739
But Locke's going into that thing whether you like it or not.

292
00:21:42,065 --> 00:21:44,070
And if he falls and breaks his neck...

293
00:21:47,928 --> 00:21:49,656
Live together, die alone, right?

294
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:56,290
Right.

295
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,542
Your fiancée was seriously injured.

296
00:22:08,103 --> 00:22:11,198
It could take as long as 10, maybe 12 hours.

297
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:15,005
I won't know how extensive the damage is until I get inside.

298
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,450
She was going for a dress fitting and to look at tablecloths.

299
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:28,866
When is it-- the wedding?

300
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:31,191
Uh, it's eight months.

301
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,835
Well, I'm sure Sara will have recovered by then--

302
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:38,531
"Recovered," um...what does that mean?

303
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:41,874
There will be ongoing physical therapy. But if she works really hard--

304
00:22:41,954 --> 00:22:48,129
Will we be able to, uh... you know, make love?

305
00:22:51,684 --> 00:22:53,548
You need to know that there's a chance Sara

306
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:56,965
might very well need professional care for the rest of her life.

307
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:03,207
Like, she won't be able to go to the bathroom by herself?

308
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,033
Come here.

309
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:24,479
Come here.

310
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,697
I want to tell you a little secret.

311
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:33,371
Come on.

312
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:38,397
Closer.

313
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:45,217
It's okay.

314
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:50,756
I know I'm not gonna be dancing anymore.

315
00:23:57,977 --> 00:24:02,107
And I can still roll around at my wedding.

316
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:06,950
You're invited, okay?

317
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:14,512
I'm gonna fix you.

318
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,523
Expected to find you halfway down there by now.

319
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,544
I was waitin' for you.

320
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:04,666
So you want me to go down first?

321
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:06,213
Hell, you're lighter.

322
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:09,965
I can belay you down and bring you back up just as easy.

323
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:13,008
The shaft might get narrower down there, too.

324
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:17,035
You left out the part where you just want to see if I get eaten by something.

325
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:19,349
Yeah, well, that, too.

326
00:25:22,945 --> 00:25:24,850
- Not too tight?
- I got it.

327
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:32,514
Okay.

328
00:25:50,946 --> 00:25:51,683
Wait.

329
00:25:52,947 --> 00:25:54,720
What do I say if I need to stop?

330
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:56,796
"Stop."

331
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:02,168
Mmm. Right.

332
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:04,573
Okay. Let's go.

333
00:26:57,397 --> 00:27:00,594
Aah! Kate! Are you all right?

334
00:27:04,183 --> 00:27:05,227
Yeah!

335
00:27:05,496 --> 00:27:06,166
Uh...

336
00:27:07,744 --> 00:27:10,460
I dropped the light!

337
00:27:11,486 --> 00:27:12,527
Maybe we should...

338
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:16,176
Well, okay, then.

339
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:30,923
One.

340
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:34,721
Two.

341
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:37,233
Three.

342
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:40,050
Four.

343
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:43,994
Stop!

344
00:27:51,287 --> 00:27:52,280
What is it?

345
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:53,368
John!

346
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:55,279
I think there's something down--

347
00:28:04,746 --> 00:28:05,931
Kate, are you all right?!

348
00:28:24,132 --> 00:28:24,992
Kate!

349
00:28:26,198 --> 00:28:27,072
Kate!

350
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,494
Kate!

351
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:36,833
You're kidding, right?

352
00:28:37,862 --> 00:28:39,023
You're going back?

353
00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:40,405
Yeah.

354
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:43,516
What about all that stuff you said about waiting till morning

355
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:45,418
and watching the sunrise?

356
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:47,848
I changed my mind.

357
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:15,863
Kate!

358
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:18,221
Locke!

359
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:45,384
Ohh! Damn it!

360
00:30:46,293 --> 00:30:47,447
You all right, brother?

361
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:48,925
I'm fine. I'm fine.

362
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:50,726
Take it easy. Keep the weight off.

363
00:30:50,912 --> 00:30:52,406
Here, let me have a look.

364
00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:54,876
Does this hurt?

365
00:30:55,815 --> 00:30:57,403
Well, you haven't sprained it, then.

366
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:01,314
I don't fancy your chances of catching up with me tonight, though.

367
00:31:01,585 --> 00:31:02,964
I wasn't trying to catch up.

368
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:04,949
Aye, of course you weren't.

369
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,438
What do you know about sprains anyway?

370
00:31:09,555 --> 00:31:11,124
I was almost a doctor once.

371
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,176
Small world.

372
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:16,269
Are you a doctor, then?

373
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:30,921
So what's your excuse?

374
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,070
Excuse?

375
00:31:33,253 --> 00:31:34,938
For runnin' like the devil's chasing you.

376
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:40,040
My excuse-- I'm trainin'.

377
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:41,172
Training for what?

378
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:42,877
For a race around the world.

379
00:31:44,497 --> 00:31:46,054
Impressive, I know.

380
00:31:48,922 --> 00:31:51,090
So your excuse better be good, brother.

381
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:54,001
Just trying to work a few things out.

382
00:31:54,544 --> 00:31:55,989
Aha.

383
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,222
A girl, right?

384
00:32:00,182 --> 00:32:01,376
A patient.

385
00:32:01,985 --> 00:32:04,062
Ah, but a girl patient.

386
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:09,183
What's her name?

387
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,733
Her name's Sara.

388
00:32:14,443 --> 00:32:16,087
What did you do to her, then?

389
00:32:16,665 --> 00:32:17,833
Do to her?

390
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:21,012
You must've done something worthy of this self-flagellation.

391
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:26,018
I told her...

392
00:32:27,253 --> 00:32:29,015
I made a promise I couldn't keep.

393
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:32,245
I told her I'd fix her and...

394
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,419
couldn't.

395
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:37,401
I failed.

396
00:32:41,236 --> 00:32:42,792
Well... right.

397
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:45,821
Just one thing...

398
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:50,958
what if you did fix her?

399
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:52,418
I didn't.

400
00:32:52,576 --> 00:32:54,259
But what if you did?

401
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:56,396
You don't know what you're talking about, man.

402
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:57,911
I don't? Why not?

403
00:32:58,003 --> 00:33:00,825
Because with her situation, that would be a miracle, brother.

404
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,440
Ah. And you don't believe in miracles?

405
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,042
Right.

406
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:16,547
Well, then I'm going to give you some advice anyway.

407
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,388
You have to lift it up.

408
00:33:27,907 --> 00:33:29,236
Lift it up?

409
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:33,878
Your ankle.

410
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,100
You gotta keep it elevated.

411
00:33:39,247 --> 00:33:40,995
Well, it's been nice chattin'.

412
00:33:42,074 --> 00:33:43,202
Jack.

413
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:46,541
Jack. I'm Desmond.

414
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:48,585
Well, good luck, brother.

415
00:33:48,974 --> 00:33:50,685
See you in another life, yeah?

416
00:37:38,136 --> 00:37:39,503
I wouldn't do that.

417
00:37:41,715 --> 00:37:43,220
Where's Kate?

418
00:37:44,858 --> 00:37:46,246
What the hell did you--

419
00:38:05,276 --> 00:38:06,516
Am I alive?

420
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,806
Yeah. Yeah, you're alive.

421
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,244
You smell.

422
00:38:24,574 --> 00:38:25,755
Well, thank you.

423
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:28,023
Wow, you really smell.

424
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:33,442
Yeah, I, uh...I went for a run.

425
00:38:33,787 --> 00:38:35,884
You smell like you ran far.

426
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,459
Well, I showered. I mean, I guess I just didn't cool.

427
00:38:39,538 --> 00:38:45,317
I wanted to get back down here and check on you. It was a tour de stade.

428
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:48,159
What?

429
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,258
It's when you run all the steps in every section of the stadium up and down.

430
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:58,023
Why would you do that?

431
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:02,109
Um, I'm intense.

432
00:39:04,632 --> 00:39:06,000
Did you finish?

433
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:08,217
No. I hurt my ankle.

434
00:39:10,371 --> 00:39:11,913
That sucks for you.

435
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,193
Is Kevin here? My fiancé?

436
00:39:19,678 --> 00:39:21,379
I didn't see him.

437
00:39:22,768 --> 00:39:25,107
I'm sure he'll be back...

438
00:39:25,192 --> 00:39:28,267
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

439
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:32,945
Gonna tell me how it went?

440
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:44,963
Sara, the damage to your back was extensive.

441
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:53,228
I did everything that I could, but your spinal column-- I just...

442
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,764
I couldn't repair it.

443
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:06,042
You're gonna be paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of your life.

444
00:40:09,396 --> 00:40:13,684
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Sara.

445
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:20,496
You're yanking my chain, right?

446
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,096
No.

447
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:28,661
Then how come I can wiggle my toes?

448
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,324
Can you feel this?

449
00:40:54,608 --> 00:40:55,288
Yes.

450
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,151
Can you feel this?

451
00:40:59,903 --> 00:41:00,682
Yes.

452
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:02,125
This?

453
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:03,425
Yes!

454
00:41:06,608 --> 00:41:07,979
This?

455
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,175
Yes.

456
00:41:32,017 --> 00:41:34,954
Move, and I'll kill him.

457
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:37,491
Put the gun down.

458
00:41:38,255 --> 00:41:39,541
Where's Kate?

459
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,686
Jack, it's okay.

460
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:42,088
- I said drop it!
- Where's Kate?!

461
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:44,917
- She's fine. Just put down--
- I'm not putting down anything.

462
00:41:45,899 --> 00:41:47,674
Do you want him to die?

463
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:48,943
Put it down!

464
00:41:52,445 --> 00:41:54,445
Is this what you were talking about, Locke?

465
00:41:54,861 --> 00:41:56,511
Is this your destiny?

466
00:41:58,721 --> 00:42:01,386
- All roads lead here.
- Jack, calm down.

467
00:42:02,743 --> 00:42:06,889
Lower your gun, or I'll blow his damned head off, brother!

468
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:18,841
You.
