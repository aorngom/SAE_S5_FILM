1
00:00:00,472 --> 00:00:02,041
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:05,134
We were together
for only one week.

3
00:00:05,536 --> 00:00:07,107
They came.

4
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:11,509
They came and took her.

5
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:14,093
Alex...

6
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,674
They took my baby.

7
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:26,614
Somebody, please help me!

8
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:29,759
He had this-- this thing, like--
like a needle,

9
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,186
and he stabbed me with it.

10
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:34,899
He was trying to hurt my baby.

11
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,791
We got a problem.
The manifest--

12
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:39,684
the names of everyone
who survived--

13
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,710
I interviewed everyone.
One of them isn't in the manifest...

14
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:43,662
Hello there.

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,152
Ethan.

16
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:52,500
I think they've been taken.

17
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:53,560
Claire!

18
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,517
I don't remember Ethan.

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,894
I don't remember
what he did to me.

20
00:01:06,643 --> 00:01:08,021
Help me!

21
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:11,883
Don't believe a word he says!
He's one of them.

22
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:14,024
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

23
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,250
For a long time, he will lie.

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,208
I don't know why you're asking
me all these questions.

25
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:21,472
This is all a mistake.

26
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,457
Tell me the truth!
Tell me who you are!

27
00:01:24,924 --> 00:01:26,781
What if he's telling
the truth, John?

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,106
What if he's not?

29
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:34,299
Hey.

30
00:01:39,338 --> 00:01:41,241
Hey, it's okay, sweetie.

31
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,985
Shh.

32
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:50,133
Hey, sweetie, it's all right.

33
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:58,633
- John? John? Wake up.
- What, Claire? What?

34
00:01:58,913 --> 00:02:02,061
He's burning up,
and he's got a rash.

35
00:02:02,576 --> 00:02:04,527
And I need to find Jack.

36
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:07,432
He's, uh,
he's on shift at the hatch.

37
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:12,323
- Okay.
- Uh, uh, no, Claire, wait.

38
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:15,368
- Claire, wait.
- No, I can't, John, okay?

39
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:19,358
No, no, no. You're not walking through
the jungle in the middle of the night.

40
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:22,635
I'll go get Jack.
I'll send him right back here.

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,430
- Okay.
- Don't worry.

42
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:36,586
Jack.

43
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:40,437
What's going on?

44
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:42,518
The baby's got a fever.

45
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:46,356
- A fever?
- Claire was coming here.

46
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:52,292
- He asleep?
- Not a sound all night.

47
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:57,432
I'll get back here
as soon as I can.

48
00:03:11,863 --> 00:03:12,527
Shh.

49
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:16,812
Hey, hey, sweetie, it's okay.
It's okay.

50
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:21,822
Mommy's just gonna cool you down, okay?
Okay? Shh. It's okay.

51
00:03:22,617 --> 00:03:23,281
Jack?

52
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:31,042
What are you doing here?
You stay away from us!

53
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:33,273
He's infected, isn't he?

54
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:34,868
What?

55
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:39,844
Your child-- he's sick.

56
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:42,751
Just get away.
You get away from us!

57
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:47,283
You don't remember, do you?

58
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:54,262
It's a vaccine.
We don't want him to get sick.

59
00:03:56,787 --> 00:03:59,361
Hey, get back!
Get away from her!

60
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:01,180
What do you think
you're doing here?

61
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,540
What are you doing here?

62
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:05,429
Just get out of our camp.

63
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:15,094
What happened?

64
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:19,986
What did she say?

65
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:24,662
She said there's
something wrong with him.

66
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:46,190
It's just not like him.
He always sleeps through the night.

67
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:48,103
And this rash--
I mean, there's something wrong.

68
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,238
Babies get sick, Claire.

69
00:04:49,268 --> 00:04:51,041
Okay, what about
the fever and cough?

70
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,745
Perfectly normal.

71
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,454
And he hasn't been
eating at all, and--

72
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:56,536
Claire, he's okay.
It's probably roseola.

73
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:59,410
It's a typical virus that's
common in children his age,

74
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,910
and the rash is a sign of it.

75
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:02,900
Okay. What if it's not?

76
00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:05,137
What if he caught
something really bad?

77
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:08,388
Like some kind of infection?

78
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,903
Infection? Where did
you get that idea?

79
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:13,032
Rousseau was here.

80
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:17,687
What did she say to you?

81
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:20,688
She said she knew he was sick, okay?
That he's infected.

82
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:22,737
Claire, there is no infection.

83
00:05:22,962 --> 00:05:26,312
We've been on this island for two
months, and no one's gotten sick.

84
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:27,489
Rousseau's crazy.

85
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:30,109
We're gonna let the fever
just run its course.

86
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:33,333
It's gonna be fine, okay?
Trust me.

87
00:05:34,223 --> 00:05:35,458
I've gotta get
back to the hatch.

88
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:38,788
And I'll come back in a couple
hours and check on him again, okay?

89
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:41,270
-  Okay?
- Yeah.

90
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:53,197
Hey, I'm sure that if there was
something wrong, Jack would know.

91
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:01,249
Are you sure about this?
We don't really know her.

92
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:02,677
I think she can help me.

93
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:06,006
Hey.

94
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,933
Hey, guys.

95
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,640
So you're a shrink, right?

96
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:15,353
I'm a clinical psychologist,
but "shrink" works, too.

97
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:18,097
Can you help people
remember things?

98
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:21,752
I guess it depends on what
you need to remember.

99
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:26,621
So it was our second
week on the island.

100
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,612
I was out in the jungle,
and I--

101
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:31,401
I thought I was having the baby.
Charlie was with me.

102
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:34,037
And there was this man-- Ethan.

103
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,169
We thought he was one of us
from the plane, but he wasn't.

104
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:40,832
So he took me--
he took both of us. And...

105
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,062
I don't remember.
I don't remember anything.

106
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,779
When Jack and I found Charlie,
he was hanging from a tree by his neck.

107
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:49,415
I have no idea what happened,

108
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:51,872
and now I'm seeing
these flashes of things.

109
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:54,483
And, you know, I have amnesia.

110
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:57,083
There's two weeks
missing from my life.

111
00:06:57,268 --> 00:06:59,798
Claire, I don't think
you have amnesia.

112
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:02,615
You know, sometimes when
something terrible happens to us,

113
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:05,515
there's a little switch in
your head that flicks on to

114
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:08,267
protect us from having
to deal with it.

115
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:10,531
Maybe your memories
aren't gone.

116
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,156
Maybe you're just
blocking them.

117
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:18,739
Then I need you
to unblock them.

118
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,021
'Cause my baby's sick,
and they did something to him.

119
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:38,465
Do you have to go
to the bathroom?

120
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:38,861
No.

121
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:41,848
Well,  just let us
know when you do.

122
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,543
Yeah, I'll look
forward to that.

123
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,133
Thought you might like
something to read.

124
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:55,509
Dostoevsky. You don't
have any Stephen King?

125
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:58,390
The library's a
little outdated.

126
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:01,721
Right. Well, thanks.

127
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:09,005
What's with the book?

128
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:11,990
Just something to
pass the time.

129
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:19,075
Did you know that Hemingway
was jealous of Dostoevsky?

130
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:22,580
No, John, I didn't know that.

131
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:25,486
He wanted to be the
world's greatest writer but

132
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:29,472
convinced himself that he could never
get out from under Dostoevsky's shadow.

133
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:30,958
Kind of sad, really.

134
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:33,459
What are we doing, Jack?

135
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,721
What are we doing?

136
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:37,700
We can't hide him
down here forever.

137
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:40,741
Changing shifts around is gonna
get people asking questions.

138
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,534
I just want to know what
the long-term plan is.

139
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:47,662
Well, John,
let me ask you this--

140
00:08:47,755 --> 00:08:49,913
we don't have a long-term
plan for the button,

141
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:52,372
but we keep pushing it,
don't we?

142
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:59,170
Look, until we know who he is,
whether or not he's telling the truth,

143
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:02,309
we have to keep doing
what we're doing.

144
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:04,971
If you've got a better idea,
let's hear it.

145
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,294
How about you let me go?

146
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:19,240
Now we're away from all
the noises of the camp.

147
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:21,459
Just breathe.

148
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:24,825
Let your whole body relax.

149
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:26,705
Good.

150
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:28,596
Listen to the waves.

151
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:35,418
Good, in...

152
00:09:37,138 --> 00:09:40,717
and out slowly. Good.

153
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,347
Keep your eyes closed.

154
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:49,112
Very relaxed, Claire.

155
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:52,562
Just keep breathing.

156
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:57,684
Now I want you to visualize
yourself when you were pregnant.

157
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:00,463
Keep listening to my voice.

158
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,432
Think about what you see.

159
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:14,226
It's a vaccine.
We don't want him to get sick.

160
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:19,705
When was your last
checkup, Claire?

161
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:23,111
Oh, I haven't been in a while.

162
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:25,720
I've been busy, and...

163
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:28,141
I'm going to Los Angeles.

164
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:29,573
- Really?
- Yeah.

165
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:32,285
Traveling in your third trimester,
that's not usually recommended.

166
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:38,862
Uh, there's a family there. I'm,
uh, giving the baby up for adoption.

167
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:41,546
Oh, of course. I understand.

168
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,015
The sedative I gave
you is very mild.

169
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:48,453
I know these exams
can be very stressful.

170
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:52,660
I'm going to give you
a shot now, Claire.

171
00:10:55,793 --> 00:10:57,887
A little medicine
for your baby.

172
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:14,068
Don't worry.
You're just gonna feel a little pinch.

173
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:19,600
Aah!

174
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:22,768
It's okay. You're all right.
It's okay. It's okay.

175
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:25,748
It was Ethan! I saw Ethan!

176
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:28,459
I  saw him. It was Ethan!

177
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:31,293
- Claire, Claire, it's okay.
- No, it's not!

178
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,356
- You're all right.
- No, I'm not all right!

179
00:11:33,386 --> 00:11:34,149
It was Ethan!

180
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:35,530
- What happened?
- I don't know. She just--

181
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,392
- What did you do?
- Nothing, she just--

182
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:38,123
Do it again!

183
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:39,061
Do it again!

184
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:40,751
No, Claire, you were screaming.

185
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:42,323
But I remembered, okay?

186
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,366
- I saw Ethan.
- Claire...

187
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,136
He was there,
and he was giving me an exam.

188
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,657
What you saw could be
combining experiences of what

189
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:51,724
happened before the crash to the things
that happened here on the island.

190
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,366
No, okay, no! This was real!

191
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:54,583
I was drugged.

192
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,890
He did something to me.

193
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:59,316
Claire, you need to calm down,
all right? It's not good for you.

194
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:01,159
You know what?
Aaron is sick, okay?

195
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:02,864
I need to find that place!

196
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:05,578
That room--
it's real. It's real.

197
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:08,579
Okay, and there's medicine there.
For the baby.

198
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,364
I need to find it.
I need to find it.

199
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:18,806
Kate, Kate, please,
help me find it.

200
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:46,422
Hello?

201
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:52,527
Hello?

202
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,139
- What's the--
- Shh.

203
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:01,121
- Hello?
- Howdy.

204
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:05,625
Hello, John. You are alone?

205
00:13:06,092 --> 00:13:07,497
Not anymore.

206
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:10,066
- How many of you--
- Shut up.

207
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:14,504
I was hoping to borrow a saw.

208
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:19,185
Absolutely. Right this way.

209
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,875
I need a gun,
and you don't get to ask why.

210
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:43,136
Well,  Thelma, seeing as I got all
the guns, I do get to ask why.

211
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:45,756
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

212
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,498
Watch.

213
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,989
Why?

214
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:52,528
Just give me a gun, Sawyer.

215
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,162
Check it out.

216
00:13:55,723 --> 00:13:59,688
I found a new pair of glasses damn
near my prescription. You like 'em?

217
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:06,115
All right, I'm going into the
jungle to track down Rousseau.

218
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:09,099
The french chick? What for?

219
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,470
Claire thinks she knows where
there might be some medicine.

220
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:14,465
The baby's sick.

221
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:17,738
- Well, hell, I got medicine.
- She thinks he's really sick--

222
00:14:18,405 --> 00:14:20,060
as in "quarantine" sick.

223
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,539
What do you think?

224
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:25,569
I  think she's a
little too worried.

225
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,291
But she's going after
Rousseau with or without me.

226
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:31,769
No boys allowed, huh?

227
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:41,662
All right, what do you want?
9 millimeter or rifle?

228
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:50,466
I don't think this
is a good idea.

229
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:52,405
Maybe you should
listen to Jack.

230
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:54,211
But what if jack's wrong, okay?

231
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:57,258
Jack said the fever would break,
and it hasn't. He's getting worse.

232
00:14:57,288 --> 00:14:59,253
Just because it hasn't broken yet,
it doesn't--

233
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:01,383
Well, how long am I
supposed to wait, Sun?

234
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,208
A mother should not
leave her child.

235
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:12,815
I'm sorry. Are you a mother?

236
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,083
No...

237
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:16,729
I'm not.

238
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,607
Claire, are you sure
you want to do this?

239
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:28,694
What did you say?

240
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,880
Are you sure you
want to do this?

241
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:34,429
You need to be sure.

242
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,015
You have to get out of here--

243
00:15:44,436 --> 00:15:46,488
Do you have to put
that in my tummy?

244
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,101
'Cause it really, really hurts.

245
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:50,097
I know.

246
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,786
I wish there was another way.

247
00:15:54,331 --> 00:15:55,969
But the baby needs it, Claire.

248
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,566
Okay?

249
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:00,334
Okay.

250
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:16,170
There, all done.
That wasn't so bad, was it?

251
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,883
No.

252
00:16:20,408 --> 00:16:22,658
And now because you've
been such a good girl,

253
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:25,232
I think it's time
for a surprise.

254
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,691
Claire, this way. Here we go.

255
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:48,935
Over here.

256
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,023
What is this place?

257
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:03,942
- It's for your baby, Claire.
- Oh, it's amazing.

258
00:17:11,426 --> 00:17:12,563
Wow. Hey...

259
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:15,271
What-- what happened
to Charlie?

260
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:16,837
Charlie? Oh, he's fine.

261
00:17:16,978 --> 00:17:19,578
When we got far enough from camp,
I let him go back.

262
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:21,570
Oh.

263
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:24,793
So where did it all come from?

264
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,077
Well, I'd love to explain
everything to you, Claire,

265
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:31,167
but I'm afraid it would be a
little overwhelming right now.

266
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:35,433
What...

267
00:17:39,932 --> 00:17:41,462
Go ahead, turn it on.

268
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:58,566
Ethan?

269
00:17:59,686 --> 00:18:01,186
Wait here. I'll be right back.

270
00:18:02,892 --> 00:18:03,668
Okay.

271
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:10,178
What the hell happened?

272
00:18:10,526 --> 00:18:14,328
You were supposed to make the list
and then bring her in. Was I unclear?

273
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:15,510
It's not my fault.

274
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:18,459
They knew I wasn't on the plane.
They had a manifest.

275
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,805
Well, what am I
supposed to tell him?

276
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:26,473
You know what he's gonna do when
he finds out? Damn it, Ethan.

277
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,783
Get out.

278
00:18:35,508 --> 00:18:36,552
Get out of here.

279
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:41,291
Claire?

280
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:46,002
Claire, are you all right?

281
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:48,793
I, um...

282
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:56,022
Ready to go?

283
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:04,203
Hey, sweetheart, shh,
mommy's gotta go now, sweetheart, okay?

284
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:06,916
Shh, don't cry.
Don't cry. It's okay.

285
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,267
I'll be back really soon.
And I'll make you feel all better, okay?

286
00:19:10,297 --> 00:19:11,198
I promise.

287
00:19:17,411 --> 00:19:17,970
Thanks.

288
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:19,051
Okay.

289
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:30,669
- You okay?
- Yeah.

290
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:37,617
Are you sure this is her trail?

291
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:42,037
We started at the exact spot
where we chased her off the beach.

292
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,516
So what do you know
about Rousseau?

293
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:45,837
Not much.

294
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:49,094
You spent all that time with her when
you went out to "the Black Rock."

295
00:19:49,124 --> 00:19:50,974
You must have talked
about something.

296
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:53,446
Just about her ship
crashing here--

297
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,781
her and her research
team getting stranded.

298
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:57,714
What happened to them?

299
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:00,725
They died.

300
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:03,121
How?

301
00:20:05,044 --> 00:20:06,966
Tracks are gone.
Trail ends here.

302
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:09,367
Kate, how did they die?

303
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:12,396
She killed them.

304
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:13,319
What?

305
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,305
- Why-- why would she--
- Because they were infected.

306
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,377
You believe me now, don't you?

307
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,550
I want you to take
me back there.

308
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:27,853
Back?

309
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:29,622
- To where I scratched you.
- Claire--

310
00:20:29,652 --> 00:20:31,891
No, okay, she knows I remember.

311
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:34,074
I remember a lot of it now.

312
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:39,258
I remember the room,
the medicine, a teenage girl.

313
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:40,785
Okay, so don't lie to me

314
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:43,431
and make out you don't know
what I'm talking about.

315
00:20:43,438 --> 00:20:48,107
My baby is sick, and you're gonna take
me back there to get what he needs
right now.

316
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:53,151
It's not far from here.

317
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:08,583
Jack...

318
00:21:10,126 --> 00:21:11,604
may I have a word with you?

319
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:13,386
Sure.

320
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:17,005
Who is he?

321
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:18,524
What?

322
00:21:19,748 --> 00:21:22,357
The man that you are
keeping in the hatch.

323
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:28,820
Did Locke tell you--

324
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,047
Locke did not tell me anything.
Who is he?

325
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:33,795
We don't know.

326
00:21:35,723 --> 00:21:37,381
I wish to speak to him.

327
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,392
Speak to him about what?

328
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:42,235
I wish to speak to him alone.

329
00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:44,639
Can you arrange this?

330
00:21:46,865 --> 00:21:48,446
Why should I do that?

331
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:52,229
Because you wish to
keep this a secret.

332
00:22:15,494 --> 00:22:17,094
Why are we stopping here?

333
00:22:18,565 --> 00:22:20,447
This is where you scratched me.

334
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:23,757
But there's nothing here.

335
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,198
Where do we go next?

336
00:22:27,976 --> 00:22:29,187
Why are you asking me that?

337
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:30,720
You need to tell
me where to go!

338
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,176
Where is this room?!

339
00:22:32,527 --> 00:22:33,985
Look, how can you
be saying that?

340
00:22:34,015 --> 00:22:36,619
Okay, you grabbed me.
That's why I scratched you--

341
00:22:36,712 --> 00:22:38,712
because you were taking
me back to them!

342
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:40,661
Is that what you think?

343
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:44,244
You said you remembered.

344
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:46,605
That's why I brought you here.

345
00:22:47,684 --> 00:22:48,812
- You lied!
- Hey!

346
00:22:49,294 --> 00:22:51,432
Get your hands off of her.

347
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:05,514
Go ahead.

348
00:23:07,046 --> 00:23:07,897
Please.

349
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:09,746
Do it.

350
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,639
Claire!

351
00:23:28,103 --> 00:23:29,025
Claire!

352
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:46,034
Wake up.

353
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:49,592
How's it coming?

354
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:52,950
One down. One to go.

355
00:23:53,055 --> 00:23:55,705
Now all's we need is a little
foot to put it on, huh?

356
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:58,115
Tell you what--

357
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:01,350
what do you say we sneak
out of here and take a walk?

358
00:24:02,684 --> 00:24:03,807
Okay.

359
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:07,271
Whoa.

360
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:10,618
I'm sorry this is the first time
I've managed to get you out.

361
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:12,301
My friends are afraid
you'll run away.

362
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:14,599
Whoa-ho! Whoa!

363
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,048
- Don't tell on me, okay?
- Oh, okay.

364
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:18,705
Whoa. Easy now.

365
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:24,750
Easy. Easy! Whoa.

366
00:24:26,371 --> 00:24:27,070
Okay.

367
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:28,831
Okay, here. This'll help.

368
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:31,530
Thanks.

369
00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:36,322
- Mmm.
- What?

370
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:38,656
- That is really sour.
- Is it?

371
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:40,360
- Mmm.
- I hadn't noticed.

372
00:24:41,699 --> 00:24:42,422
Blah.

373
00:24:44,063 --> 00:24:44,921
Oh!

374
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:47,429
Hey--he's kicking.

375
00:24:49,174 --> 00:24:51,432
- May I?
- Yeah...

376
00:24:56,568 --> 00:24:58,662
Claire, can I tell
you a secret?

377
00:24:58,738 --> 00:24:59,257
Yes.

378
00:25:00,475 --> 00:25:03,243
I'm gonna miss you. I wi...

379
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:07,884
I wish you didn't have to go.

380
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:11,608
Maybe I don't have to go.

381
00:25:13,152 --> 00:25:15,016
We've been through
this, Claire.

382
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:17,959
There's not enough vaccine
for you and the baby.

383
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,092
But I'm not-- I'm not sick.

384
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:21,049
Thank god.

385
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:23,648
And once you've delivered,
you can go back to your friends,

386
00:25:23,678 --> 00:25:25,616
and hopefully you'll
stay that way.

387
00:25:28,516 --> 00:25:32,103
What... what if I
want to see the baby?

388
00:25:35,422 --> 00:25:40,366
Hey, nobody's going to take him from
you unless that's what you want.

389
00:25:40,484 --> 00:25:42,259
You have a choice.

390
00:25:47,352 --> 00:25:49,198
We're  good people, Claire.

391
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,485
We're a good family.

392
00:25:52,632 --> 00:25:54,882
But if you're gonna
trust us with your child,

393
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:58,997
I want you to be sure.

394
00:26:02,464 --> 00:26:03,466
Okay?

395
00:26:19,374 --> 00:26:20,196
Sure.

396
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:25,412
There you are.

397
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,594
Where are you going?

398
00:26:36,155 --> 00:26:38,664
I know this is it. It's here.

399
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:40,258
Claire!

400
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:46,582
Leave her alone.

401
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:48,792
- Excuse me?
- Let her look.

402
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:51,109
Look for what?

403
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:57,787
Claire!

404
00:27:01,332 --> 00:27:02,184
Claire!

405
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:10,469
Flashlights.

406
00:28:30,998 --> 00:28:34,405
There are lights. I'm gonna
see if I can turn the power on.

407
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:36,160
Are you okay?

408
00:28:42,568 --> 00:28:43,582
This way.

409
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:27,362
What is this place?

410
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:29,398
It's where they were
gonna keep him.

411
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:28,797
Wake up.

412
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:31,381
Wake up.

413
00:30:33,913 --> 00:30:36,360
- Who are you?
- Shh! They'll hear you.

414
00:30:37,074 --> 00:30:38,724
Look, you have to
get out of here.

415
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:39,158
What?

416
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:41,564
You have to get
out of here-- now!

417
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:45,096
- Wha-- no, no, no. I can't leave.
- Yes, you can. Come on.

418
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:48,479
I can't leave. No! Stop.
What are you doing?

419
00:30:57,302 --> 00:30:58,132
Don't scream.

420
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,820
They're gonna do it tonight.

421
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:04,540
What? Do what?

422
00:31:05,787 --> 00:31:07,666
What are you talking about? Ow!

423
00:31:07,756 --> 00:31:10,456
You're going to die.
They're gonna cut him out of you.

424
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,352
I can get you back to your camp,
but we have to leave now.

425
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:17,817
No, no, no! Hey, you're lying.
You're lying, okay? I'm sure about this.

426
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:21,254
Where's Ethan? I want to talk to Ethan.
Ethan wouldn't hurt me.

427
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,339
You'll thank me
for this one day.

428
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,527
It's a vaccine.
We don't want him to get sick.

429
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:32,937
It's here.

430
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:35,035
The medicine's here.

431
00:31:45,392 --> 00:31:46,414
Help me.

432
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:49,772
Help!

433
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:52,794
Kate! Come here!
I need some help!

434
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:55,169
Help me up with this.

435
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:56,753
What is it?

436
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,377
It's in here.
The vaccine's in here.

437
00:32:01,344 --> 00:32:03,363
- Okay. Come on.
- Okay.

438
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,935
One, two, three!

439
00:32:12,214 --> 00:32:12,777
Okay.

440
00:32:19,714 --> 00:32:22,289
It was in here.
The vaccine was in here!

441
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:24,951
It was in--
where is it, where is it, where is it?

442
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:27,320
The vaccine was in here!
Where is it?!

443
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:30,982
You were bringing me back here.
Where is it?!

444
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,660
You know where it is,
don't you?

445
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,158
Tell me! Tell me where it is!
Tell me!

446
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:05,673
Ethan?

447
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:07,579
Ethan?

448
00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:10,735
Ethan!

449
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:12,602
Ethan, I'm sure.

450
00:33:19,688 --> 00:33:20,587
Ethan!

451
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:24,718
Hey! Hey, Ethan!

452
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:26,393
Ethan!

453
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:30,593
I'm-- I'm sure I want--
I want you to take the baby.

454
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:32,440
Ethan!

455
00:33:40,493 --> 00:33:42,534
Who are-- who are you?

456
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:45,411
- Claire!
- Yeah! I'm here!

457
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:47,498
I can hear you! Where are you?

458
00:33:47,646 --> 00:33:48,709
Be quiet.

459
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,755
I'm here, Ethan! Be quiet.

460
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:54,110
No, no. It's okay.
I have to give him to them.

461
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,763
I have to give him to them
so he'll be safe, okay?

462
00:33:57,025 --> 00:33:59,517
Help! I'm here! Ethan!

463
00:33:59,985 --> 00:34:02,593
- Stop!
- No!

464
00:34:15,174 --> 00:34:19,437
You weren't...
trying to take me back, were you?

465
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:24,119
You were trying to save me.

466
00:34:25,985 --> 00:34:28,137
I carried you on my
back to your camp.

467
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:32,508
I left youwhere they
would find you.

468
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:37,134
I'm sorry.

469
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:46,001
Where are you going?

470
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:53,240
You're not the only one who didn't
find what they were looking for.

471
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:20,947
This is as far as I go.

472
00:35:26,382 --> 00:35:27,617
Your baby...

473
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:31,286
was it a girl?

474
00:35:33,058 --> 00:35:33,834
Yes.

475
00:35:34,494 --> 00:35:35,968
What was her name?

476
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,389
Alex...

477
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:42,792
Alexandra.

478
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,896
I remember a girl--
a girl with blue eyes?

479
00:35:57,837 --> 00:36:02,578
She, uh, she helped me.
She saved me... just like you did.

480
00:36:04,757 --> 00:36:10,935
She wasn't like the others.
She was good.

481
00:36:24,994 --> 00:36:26,594
I'm sorry

482
00:36:27,126 --> 00:36:29,905
that you didn't find what
you were looking for.

483
00:36:32,678 --> 00:36:36,276
And I hope your
baby's not infected.

484
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:41,190
But if it is...

485
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:47,310
I hope you know
what must be done.

486
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,072
Back for more tools?

487
00:37:20,218 --> 00:37:21,738
He knows, John.

488
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:25,970
Well, there you go.

489
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:30,894
Be careful what you say to him.

490
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:33,690
He's smart and curious.

491
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:35,933
Just give us a shout
when you're done.

492
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:37,582
And if the alarm goes off,

493
00:37:38,827 --> 00:37:40,666
don't tell him what it's for.

494
00:37:41,638 --> 00:37:43,094
What is it for?

495
00:38:02,743 --> 00:38:03,582
Hello.

496
00:38:11,302 --> 00:38:13,166
I am Mr. Eko.

497
00:38:16,763 --> 00:38:17,882
Henry Gale.

498
00:38:19,056 --> 00:38:20,974
Do you mind if I sit, Henry?

499
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:23,058
Okay.

500
00:38:34,074 --> 00:38:36,315
How long have you been in here?

501
00:38:37,187 --> 00:38:38,209
Two days.

502
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:40,585
Are they treating you well?

503
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,840
Treating me well?

504
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:48,661
I'm a... a prisoner.

505
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:52,539
And I don't know
why or for what--

506
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:56,290
You are a prisoner because
they are being careful.

507
00:38:57,012 --> 00:39:01,405
They are being careful because
they believe you are lying.

508
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,092
Why would I lie?

509
00:39:04,352 --> 00:39:07,721
They think I'm one of these...
"others"? Other what?

510
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,413
Please stop talking, Henry.

511
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:16,860
The first night I
spent on this island,

512
00:39:17,806 --> 00:39:21,642
I was dragged into
the jungle by two men.

513
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:27,083
They never spoke a word to me,
nor I to them.

514
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:32,003
I killed these men--

515
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:34,674
smashed in their
head with a stone,

516
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:37,000
felt their blood on my arms.

517
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:43,271
I need you to know

518
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:45,735
how sorry I am for this.

519
00:39:48,955 --> 00:39:53,416
I need you to know that I am
back on a righteous path now

520
00:39:53,687 --> 00:39:56,475
and that I regret my actions.

521
00:40:00,995 --> 00:40:03,619
I ask you for your forgiveness.

522
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,314
Why are you telling me this?

523
00:40:09,812 --> 00:40:12,767
Because I needed
to tell someone.

524
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,560
He looks good. Fever's broken.

525
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,857
The rash has even
started to fade.

526
00:41:08,623 --> 00:41:10,061
Thank you so much.

527
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:12,384
I didn't do anything.

528
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:15,285
I'll, uh,
check back in a couple of hours, okay?

529
00:41:15,482 --> 00:41:15,771
Okay.

530
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,015
Hey.

531
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:26,380
Hi!

532
00:41:39,276 --> 00:41:40,113
Look.

533
00:41:41,286 --> 00:41:46,978
Mommy made this for you when you
were still inside her tummy. Yeah.

534
00:41:54,902 --> 00:41:59,297
You know what?
I wanted them to take you.

535
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:07,487
But now I know--

536
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,417
now I know that we're
supposed to be together,

537
00:42:11,476 --> 00:42:12,544
you and me.

538
00:42:14,445 --> 00:42:17,554
We're supposed to take
care of each other, okay?

539
00:42:25,927 --> 00:42:30,868
You're mine, and I love you.
I love you so much.

540
00:42:31,672 --> 00:42:32,294
Yeah.

541
00:42:57,309 --> 00:43:00,706
- No cheeseburgers, huh?
- No cheeseburgers.

542
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:02,297
Bon appétit.

543
00:43:05,945 --> 00:43:08,398
Is that true what you
said about Hemingway?

544
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:15,345
- You have good ears.
- You have thin doors.

545
00:43:19,953 --> 00:43:21,905
- You read Hemingway?
- Sure.

546
00:43:22,496 --> 00:43:25,983
Guy ran with the bulls,
fought in the spanish civil war--

547
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,154
stuff I can wrap my brain around.
This I can't get through five pages of.

548
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,963
Hmm. Dostoevsky had
his virtues, too.

549
00:43:34,184 --> 00:43:35,973
He was a genius, for one.

550
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,006
Bullfighting isn't everything.

551
00:43:41,137 --> 00:43:42,519
So which one are you?

552
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:45,835
I'm sorry?

553
00:43:46,146 --> 00:43:47,721
Are you the genius?

554
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:52,338
Or are you the guy who always feels like
he's living in the shadow of
the genius?

555
00:43:54,888 --> 00:43:55,959
I was...

556
00:43:57,997 --> 00:44:02,074
I was never very muchinto
literary analysis.

557
00:44:08,664 --> 00:44:12,478
I just don't understand why you
let the doctor call the shots.

558
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:16,454
No one calls the shots.

559
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,880
Jack and imake
decisions together.

560
00:44:23,882 --> 00:44:25,206
Right. Okay.

561
00:44:31,292 --> 00:44:32,168
My mistake.
