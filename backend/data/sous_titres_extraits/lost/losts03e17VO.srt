<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:04,327
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything, Pal.

3
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:06,143
How do you know Claire was drowning?

4
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:24,784
I could hear her calling for help.

5
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:26,006
You...

6
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:28,353
Hear the lightning as well?

7
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:44,831
I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie.

8
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:46,523
I was saving you.

9
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,069
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,

10
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,855
you were electrocuted,

11
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:55,915
and when you heard Claire
was in the water...

12
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,056
You drowned trying to save her.

13
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:03,083
I've tried, brother,
I've tried twice to save you,

14
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:04,854
but no matter what I try to do...

15
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:09,338
You're gonna die, Charlie.

16
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:25,150
You're insane, mate.

17
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:28,519
Superman can fly
round the entire planet

18
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:30,110
in the blink of an eye.

19
00:01:30,145 --> 00:01:32,626
Dude,
if we're going by a pure foot race,

20
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,058
Supes would get dusted by the Flash.

21
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:38,524
But why would the man of steel
agree to a sodding foot race?

22
00:01:39,324 --> 00:01:40,611
Uh, for charity?

23
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:43,859
And Flash would totally win,
'cause he can, like,

24
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:45,765
vibrate through walls and stuff.

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,628
Vibration.

26
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:50,399
Well and what would Superman do
if he came against a wall?

27
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:52,193
Well, no smashing allowed.

28
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,652
No flying, no smashing.

29
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:56,659
Any other restrictions
I need to know about?

30
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:59,860
Perhaps we should fit superman
with a pair of kryptonite...

31
00:02:02,444 --> 00:02:03,542
The hell?

32
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,836
No, don't! Don't touch it.

33
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:15,277
- My God,my God!
- Just breathe.

34
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:17,142
Looks like it's homemade.

35
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:18,315
We've got to get back.

36
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:20,114
- No! You help!
- I can't help!

37
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:23,156
I'm sorry, mate.

38
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,417
<i>Here it is. Here it is.</i>

39
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:49,008
<i>Superman can fly around
the entire planet...</i>

40
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:23,531
Where's the wire?

41
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:27,297
Did you eat those mushrooms
Jack warned us about?

42
00:03:27,344 --> 00:03:28,344
Listen to me.

43
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,230
There's a wire,
a cable buried in the sand.

44
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:34,672
Do you know what I'm talking about?

45
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,091
This is future crap, isn't it?

46
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:38,862
The cable ! Do you know where it is?

47
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:42,451
- This is important.
- Why?

48
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:46,592
<i>Superman...</i>

49
00:03:52,656 --> 00:03:54,044
Because someone's coming.

50
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:05,515
Subtitles: swsub.com

51
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,218
God tests our faith in many ways.

52
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:53,012
So, as you well know,
we have our own test here...

53
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,130
A vow of silence that lasts
as long as we see fit.

54
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:00,655
This challenges both one's patience...

55
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,426
and his faith.

56
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:06,981
For some, it may last a week.

57
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,300
Those we're less sure about, a month.

58
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:13,065
Personally, Desmond,

59
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:15,642
I never thought you'd last...

60
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,410
and so now I stand corrected.

61
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:26,033
For whatever reason,
your path has led you here.

62
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:30,565
And now you're one of us.

63
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:35,735
Welcome, brother.

64
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:38,563
Thank you...

65
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:41,612
Brother.

66
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:50,051
Morning, Jack.

67
00:05:54,373 --> 00:05:56,648
Must be nice
to wake up in your own bed.

68
00:05:58,402 --> 00:06:00,196
Home, sweet home.

69
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:03,881
So I was wondering
if I could borrow your first aid kit.

70
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:07,049
I've...

71
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:08,611
twisted my ankle.

72
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:15,758
- You want me to take a look at it?
- No, you're all right.

73
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,526
I've taped my share of ankles.

74
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,612
Right.

75
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:25,598
Thanks.

76
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:30,090
Something wrong, Hurley?

77
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,889
No, just...

78
00:06:34,302 --> 00:06:35,614
keeping Desmond here company

79
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:38,964
'cause we're friends.

80
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,801
Bring that back when
you're done with it, okay?

81
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:44,802
Absolutely.

82
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:48,824
What the hell was that?

83
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:50,783
Do you want him to get suspicious?

84
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,915
Suspicious of what?

85
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:57,248
Oh, this is like when you knew
Claire was drowning, isn't it?

86
00:06:57,403 --> 00:07:00,016
That's why you got the first aid kit.
Someone's gonna get hurt.

87
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,759
- Is it me?
- No. It's just a precaution.

88
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:05,527
Look, dude, you want me
to take you to the wire?

89
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:06,750
I want an explanation.

90
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:18,140
I saw a sequence of events...

91
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:20,955
Things that are gonna happen.

92
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:22,528
What'd you see?

93
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:23,881
It was...

94
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:26,654
It was like a sort of jigsaw puzzle,

95
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:29,265
only I didn't have
the picture on the box,

96
00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:31,106
so I don't know
how the pieces fit exactly.

97
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,307
But one of the pieces.
The first one...

98
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,367
It was you,
pulling the cable out of the sand.

99
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:45,079
So what are the other pieces?

100
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,099
If I tell you that,
it'll change the picture on the box.

101
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:50,652
So what?

102
00:07:51,342 --> 00:07:52,553
Isn't that the point...

103
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:54,040
Preventing something bad?

104
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:55,719
Not this time.

105
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,978
So you're not trying to stop
something from happening.

106
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:02,195
You actually want it to happen.

107
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,895
More than anything.

108
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,202
Hey, Freckles, you home?

109
00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:29,971
Thought you weren't
allowed to use nicknames.

110
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:34,213
You weren't around
when I lost the bet,

111
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:35,778
so you're...

112
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:39,277
exempt.

113
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:45,654
What's up?

114
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:48,717
I wanted to ask you something.

115
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:53,843
I'm up here.

116
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:00,204
So did you tell him?

117
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:02,009
Did I tell who what?

118
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:03,843
You know.

119
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:06,054
Did you tell the doc...

120
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
about you and me?

121
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,719
But he knows.

122
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:17,954
He saw us on one
of their surveillance monitors.

123
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:19,396
She said the camera was broken.

124
00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:21,118
Well, they had another camera.

125
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:22,912
Perverts.

126
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:25,459
Anyway, he knows.

127
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:29,387
Well, now that that's outta the way...

128
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:33,496
How about a little afternoon delight?

129
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:38,560
That means sex.

130
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:40,879
Come on, Freckles, wait. Now...

131
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,400
Do you need me
to make you a mix tape?

132
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:44,956
Yeah, why don't you do that?

133
00:09:53,398 --> 00:09:55,220
Dude, you're gonna have
to tell me again.

134
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:56,802
What do we need Jin for?

135
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:58,578
Because he was there with us.

136
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:01,403
On the beach,
when I find the cable?

137
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,551
<i>This way. Here it is.</i>

138
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:06,275
That's right.

139
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,006
In one of your puzzle flashes?

140
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,342
Aye.

141
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,482
So... If he doesn't come,

142
00:10:16,543 --> 00:10:20,089
then neither does the someone
you won't tell me anything about.

143
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,223
That'd be the long and short of it,

144
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,217
but I've no bloody idea
how I'm gonna get him to come with us.

145
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,902
Watch the master.

146
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:39,318
- Camping?
- Yeah,

147
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:41,510
you know, like,
sleeping under the stars,

148
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:44,728
fire on the beach, marshmallows.

149
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:47,746
Camping.

150
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,658
Everybody likes marshmallows.

151
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:00,276
Good man.

152
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:01,684
Get food, water.

153
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:04,075
Where are you going?

154
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:05,152
We need one more.

155
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:09,777
How daft do you think I am?

156
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,031
This isn't a camping trip.

157
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:16,381
You've had another one
of your visions, haven't you?

158
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:19,320
What was it this time?

159
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:23,935
Someone's coming to the island.

160
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:25,839
Coming?

161
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:27,767
As in someone who's not already here?

162
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:29,560
How the hell is that gonna happen?

163
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:32,402
I can't tell you.

164
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:36,934
It's got nothing to do with me?

165
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:40,075
Well, you're a part of it, yeah,
as are Jin and Hurley.

166
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,962
Right, but with all due respect,

167
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:45,709
you haven't previously told
Jin or Hurley that they're gonna die.

168
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:50,594
Well, that's not gonna happen,
not this time.

169
00:11:58,682 --> 00:11:59,997
Can I bring my guitar?

170
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:02,778
Absolutely.

171
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,213
All right, I'm in.

172
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:10,215
You had me worried there for a second.

173
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:40,743
This is it.

174
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,894
Well, how can you tell?

175
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:48,098
'Cause that's exactly where
I followed the wire into the jungle.

176
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:49,741
Where is it, then?

177
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,890
Wait to go, dude§

178
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:00,642
Here it is !

179
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,599
<i>Here it is!</i>

180
00:13:05,065 --> 00:13:06,639
<i>The beacon fell this side of the rise.</i>

181
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Just one thing...

182
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:09,827
Last time I followed this wire
into the jungle,

183
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:13,035
I almost got kebabbed by one
of Rousseau's spiky death trap things.

184
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:16,502
<i>Cut her down.</i>

185
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,142
We're not going in the jungle!

186
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:19,201
Well, not yet.

187
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:23,524
It's getting late, so,
we'll camp here the night.

188
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:26,015
Camp.

189
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:31,174
So when do they get here...

190
00:13:32,787 --> 00:13:34,136
your mysterious someone?

191
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:36,598
Soon.

192
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,509
You do realize you are free
to talk again, brother Desmond?

193
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:54,070
Used to being quiet, I suppose.

194
00:13:55,977 --> 00:13:57,097
Moriah.

195
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,280
I find the name

196
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,549
the brothers have chosen
for the wine made here...

197
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,096
interesting.

198
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,144
And why is that, brother?

199
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,529
Well, Moriah is the mountain
where Abraham was asked to kill Isaac.

200
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:14,027
It's not exactly the most...

201
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,693
festive locale, is it?

202
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:18,081
And yet God spared Isaac.

203
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,486
Well, one might argue that...

204
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:24,551
God need not have asked Abraham
to sacrifice his son in the first place.

205
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,313
Well, then it wouldn't have been
much of a test, would it, brother?

206
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:32,533
Perhaps you underestimate
the value of sacrifice.

207
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,024
Brother Desmond!

208
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,864
I met this man waiting at the gates.

209
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,563
He says he needs
to have a word with you.

210
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:47,127
Sorry, sir.

211
00:14:56,637 --> 00:14:57,895
Forgive me, brother.

212
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:20,290
The oatmeal's awesome.

213
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:21,817
It is, huh?

214
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:26,128
It's strange, huh?

215
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,942
What's that?

216
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,301
Being back,

217
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:32,132
not...

218
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:34,940
looking for a way out of a cage,

219
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,856
not finding a reason to go running off
into the jungle again.

220
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,452
I almost don't know
what to do with myself.

221
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:43,063
Well, enjoy it.

222
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,057
I'm sure something
will go wrong soon enough.

223
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:54,319
Well, my big, dangerous
adventure for tonight

224
00:15:54,377 --> 00:15:57,609
is gonna be
doing the dishes in the ocean.

225
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:00,557
- Well, be careful.
- I'll try.

226
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:05,652
Can I borrow that spoon?

227
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:16,026
Thanks.

228
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:25,855
Good night.

229
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:27,376
Yeah, good night.

230
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:58,193
What, my doorbell busted again?

231
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:01,886
What the hell are you doing?

232
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:04,606
Shut up and don't talk.

233
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,067
You crying?

234
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:16,632
I said shut up.

235
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:25,626
You got it.

236
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:20,864
Dude, I love the part about the bird.

237
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:22,785
It was a bird, right?

238
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:24,128
- You.
- Me?

239
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:29,490
Have you heard the one
about the chupacabra?

240
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:31,625
Chupa?

241
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:33,969
Yeah, it's like a bear with spines,

242
00:18:34,498 --> 00:18:35,531
but Mexican...

243
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:36,565
Thanks.

244
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Who's that?

245
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,315
Her name's Penny.

246
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,066
That's not bad, Des, not bad at all.

247
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:57,188
So how did you manage
to leave her behind and come here?

248
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:01,351
Because I'm a coward.

249
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:04,298
Sorry.

250
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:07,166
You and me both, pal.

251
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,871
You know,
I tried to run away from her, and she...

252
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:13,053
She tracked me down.

253
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,279
"With enough money and determination,

254
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,719
you can find anyone," she said.

255
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,761
You know,
I used to get through my nights

256
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:28,286
thinking that she actually meant it,
that she never gave up...

257
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,509
that maybe she spent
the last three years...

258
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:35,811
looking for me.

259
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:46,798
What's that?

260
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,286
Is that a helicopter?

261
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:01,750
Rescue.

262
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:13,424
Is that how a helicopter's
supposed to sound?

263
00:20:37,263 --> 00:20:38,474
We gotta go out there.

264
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,336
- Out there?
- Well, yeah.

265
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,810
In what?

266
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:43,431
Well, we gotta do something.

267
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:46,253
Look.

268
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:48,624
Look!

269
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,060
My god.

270
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,302
No dude, it's not a food drop.
You saw the beacon thing.

271
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:14,712
Someone, like, ejected.

272
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:16,185
Yeah, but that was a helicopter.

273
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:18,074
You can't eject from a helicopter.

274
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:21,619
Well, maybe they jumped.
All that matters is that they're here.

275
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,891
"They"?
How do we even know it's a person?

276
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:26,241
Because he said "someone" was coming.

277
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:30,072
Where are you going?

278
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:31,601
Out to where it fell.

279
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:34,244
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, slow down.

280
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,811
We're not gonna trudge out
into the jungle

281
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:38,726
- in the middle of the night.
- Yes, we are.

282
00:21:38,918 --> 00:21:42,429
Were you even listening to Hurley
when he mentioned Rousseau's death trap?

283
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:44,647
Now it's gonna be light in two hours.

284
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:46,498
- We'll wait until...
- She can't wait.

285
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:48,685
She?

286
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:50,170
They. Whoever it is...

287
00:21:50,937 --> 00:21:51,937
could be hurt.

288
00:21:52,448 --> 00:21:54,345
We have to go all four of us now.

289
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:56,127
Why?

290
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,982
Because that's the way
it's supposed to happen.

291
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:04,866
Right. Well, I guess
it's supposed to happen without me.

292
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,131
<i>Superman...</i>

293
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:25,456
We'll leave at first light, then...

294
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
together.

295
00:22:31,472 --> 00:22:32,524
Terrific.

296
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,059
Is your sister in?

297
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:47,217
Leave. Now.

298
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:50,745
Let him be, Derek.

299
00:22:57,558 --> 00:22:58,558
Hello, Ruth.

300
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,538
So you're a monk now, are you?

301
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,242
Well, technically
I'm still what they call a novice,

302
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,927
- till the abbott says...
- Why are you here, Desmond?

303
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,460
Well, now that my initiation is done...

304
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:19,371
I felt like I owed you an explanation.

305
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:26,076
You can never begin
to explain what you did.

306
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,115
You left one week before the wedding.

307
00:23:29,244 --> 00:23:31,508
Everything was planned,
bought and paid for.

308
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,550
You just disappeared completely.

309
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:36,058
I had a calling.

310
00:23:37,088 --> 00:23:40,290
We dated for six years,
and the closest you ever came

311
00:23:40,325 --> 00:23:43,564
to a religious experience
was Celtic winning the cup.

312
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,398
Yes, I was scared about the wedding,

313
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:50,393
so I had a few pints, too many, maybe.

314
00:23:52,936 --> 00:23:56,126
I raised my eyes, and I asked,

315
00:23:58,184 --> 00:23:59,795
"am I doing the right thing?"

316
00:24:00,994 --> 00:24:02,764
And that's the last thing I remember.

317
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:05,618
And when I woke up,
I was lying on my back

318
00:24:05,702 --> 00:24:08,275
in the street,
and I don't know how I got there.

319
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:12,242
And there was this man standing over me,

320
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,924
and he reached out his hand
and he said to me,

321
00:24:17,996 --> 00:24:19,498
"can I help you, brother?"

322
00:24:20,437 --> 00:24:22,094
And the first thing I noticed was...

323
00:24:22,437 --> 00:24:24,205
the rope tied around his waist,

324
00:24:25,294 --> 00:24:26,571
and I looked at him and...

325
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:28,896
I knew...

326
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,512
I was supposed to go with him.

327
00:24:32,946 --> 00:24:34,317
I was supposed to leave...

328
00:24:36,498 --> 00:24:38,275
everything that mattered behind.

329
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:40,969
Sacrifice all of it...

330
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:43,967
for a greater calling.

331
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,895
Well, it's a good thing
a bloody shepherd didn't help you up,

332
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:54,981
or I suppose you'd be off
with the sheep, wouldn't you?

333
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:00,449
Next time you want to break up
with someone, Des,

334
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:03,522
don't join a monastery.

335
00:25:04,684 --> 00:25:08,094
Just tell the girl
you're too bloody scared.

336
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,354
You a doctor or a carpenter?

337
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:22,312
What, your dad never taught you
to use a hammer?

338
00:25:23,057 --> 00:25:24,945
No, my dad taught me how to drink.

339
00:25:25,496 --> 00:25:27,055
Well, at least it's something.

340
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,564
Hope I'm not interrupting.

341
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:35,350
You two arguing over
who's your favorite other?

342
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:37,496
What do you want, Sawyer?

343
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,995
Oh, what I wanted, doc,
was to inform you

344
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:42,632
there's been some developments
since you were A.W.O.L.

345
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:45,311
So tell me...

346
00:25:49,436 --> 00:25:50,547
how's your backhand?

347
00:25:54,477 --> 00:25:55,623
Where'd you get the table?

348
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:57,084
Don't you recognize it?

349
00:25:57,372 --> 00:26:00,138
It fell out of the purple haze
when the hatch went blammo.

350
00:26:00,797 --> 00:26:02,530
If we don't play every 108 minutes,

351
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:04,903
the island's gonna explode.

352
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,350
Finally, something I can beat you at.

353
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,347
You know, considering
I haven't played since I was 12,

354
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:17,185
I wouldn't be too proud.

355
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,388
What is that, 18-point?

356
00:26:22,673 --> 00:26:23,911
It's kinda strange, huh...

357
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,490
being back?

358
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:29,548
Something funny?

359
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:33,055
Kate said the same thing
in the kitchen last night.

360
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,721
- She did?
- She did.

361
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,250
19-point.

362
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:47,919
So you guys ate together, huh?

363
00:26:48,504 --> 00:26:50,607
No, Juliet and I had dinner together
last night.

364
00:27:02,377 --> 00:27:03,599
Best two out of three?

365
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:06,626
You got it.

366
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:11,496
So what's next?

367
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,625
Next?

368
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:16,433
Yeah, you saw the wire,
the flashy thing falling out of the sky.

369
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,004
Now what?

370
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:19,918
- Maybe I can help you find...
- That's it.

371
00:27:20,143 --> 00:27:21,253
There is no next.

372
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:23,246
We find the beacon.

373
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,197
Why are you lying to me, mate?

374
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,436
Look, mate,

375
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:29,316
I've saved your life three times now.

376
00:27:29,956 --> 00:27:32,463
If that hasn't bought me your trust,
I don't know what will.

377
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,005
Let's move.

378
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:45,740
Dude...

379
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:48,381
seriously, I'm gonna have a coronary.

380
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:51,000
Actually, you're not,
and if you don't get a move on,

381
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:53,085
we're not gonna make it
before nightfall...

382
00:27:53,831 --> 00:27:54,941
Look at this!

383
00:27:58,098 --> 00:27:59,310
It can't be Rousseau's.

384
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:02,676
If it was Rousseau's, a massive rock
would be flying at my head right now.

385
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:05,782
Don't move.

386
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:07,597
- What are you doing?
- Don't move.

387
00:28:16,424 --> 00:28:18,997
Did that come down
with the flashing red light thingy?

388
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:23,776
Walkie-talkie.

389
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:29,095
No, dude, that's a satellite phone.

390
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,501
Crap, it's dead.

391
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:36,209
Shocker.

392
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:45,013
My God.

393
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:46,968
Is that you?

394
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:53,237
Then who's she?

395
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:56,608
That would be Penny.

396
00:29:13,494 --> 00:29:14,494
What's this?

397
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,855
Your mix tape.

398
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:22,436
Well, you gonna take it, or ain't you?

399
00:29:24,944 --> 00:29:26,388
"The best of Phil Collins," huh?

400
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:27,517
Don't get picky.

401
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,729
And if Bernard asks,
I don't know a thing about it.

402
00:29:31,323 --> 00:29:32,393
Thanks, James.

403
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:36,596
So why'd you jump me last night?

404
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,319
What?

405
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,956
Was it 'cause you saw the doc
hanging out with Juliet?

406
00:29:44,468 --> 00:29:45,632
It is not like that.

407
00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:47,007
It's not?

408
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:50,867
You ain't gotta use me, Freckles.

409
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:53,285
All you gotta do is ask.

410
00:30:05,464 --> 00:30:06,872
You think it's her, don't you?

411
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,384
Who?

412
00:30:10,524 --> 00:30:12,731
Your girl... Penny.

413
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:17,274
You think it's actually her
who bailed out of the helicopter.

414
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,001
Earlier I hoped it.

415
00:30:20,756 --> 00:30:21,756
Now I know it.

416
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:26,979
Why didn't you tell us?

417
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,028
Would you come if I had?

418
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:30,883
Of course.

419
00:30:31,008 --> 00:30:32,008
Why wouldn't I?

420
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:35,296
I didn't wanna tell you because...

421
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:38,878
I didn't want anything to change.

422
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:40,772
Fair enough.

423
00:30:41,761 --> 00:30:44,633
Look, if whatever you're seeing
leads to your girl getting us rescued,

424
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,756
why would we want to change anything?

425
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:48,068
Right?

426
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:50,321
Right.

427
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,068
Right.

428
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:09,394
Thanks for the heads-up
about bringing an umbrella, dude.

429
00:31:35,203 --> 00:31:36,360
Brother Desmond?

430
00:31:37,368 --> 00:31:38,478
What are you doing?

431
00:31:39,735 --> 00:31:43,605
Well, I believe I'm...
getting pissed on our lovely wine.

432
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,642
That bottle of our lovely wine
fetches over 100 quid.

433
00:31:49,844 --> 00:31:52,091
We've only bottled 108 cases this year.

434
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:56,848
It's just as well we've taken
a vow of poverty then, isn't it?

435
00:31:57,423 --> 00:31:59,311
We've also taken a vow of charity.

436
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,359
Right.

437
00:32:13,174 --> 00:32:16,344
Something tells me, Desmond,
that you're not cut out to be a monk.

438
00:32:17,676 --> 00:32:20,052
Well, you know, I've had a tough week.

439
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,636
I'm sorry for the wine.

440
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:32,236
I'll take the penance.

441
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:35,464
I'm afraid
you're beyond penance, Desmond.

442
00:32:37,234 --> 00:32:38,234
Brother Desmond.

443
00:32:40,171 --> 00:32:41,171
Not anymore.

444
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:46,122
Are you firing me?

445
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,048
I am indeed.

446
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:51,548
You can't do that.

447
00:32:52,323 --> 00:32:54,601
- I heard the call.
- I'm sure you did hear the call,

448
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,794
but the abbey clearly isn't where
you are meant to end up.

449
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,707
I have little doubt that God
has different plans

450
00:33:00,763 --> 00:33:03,617
than you being a monk, Desmond...
bigger plans.

451
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:05,678
- Aye, sure he does.
- He does.

452
00:33:07,378 --> 00:33:09,374
You've just spent
too much time running away

453
00:33:09,468 --> 00:33:11,788
to realize
what you may be running toward.

454
00:33:31,234 --> 00:33:32,845
What am I supposed to do now?

455
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:35,846
Whatever comes next.

456
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:51,859
Who's Penny?

457
00:33:52,674 --> 00:33:54,618
She's a chick Desmond used to date,

458
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:57,090
and now he thinks she fell from the sky.

459
00:33:57,234 --> 00:34:00,554
So we're gonna go save her life,
and she's gonna get us rescued.

460
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:09,398
Dude, even if I spoke korean,
it wouldn't make any sense.

461
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:11,924
We'll move faster if we stop talking.

462
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:13,114
She might be hurt.

463
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,410
I'm moving as fast as I can.

464
00:34:15,976 --> 00:34:18,728
In case you haven't noticed, dude,
I'm not exactly the Flash.

465
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,274
The Flash is pathetic.

466
00:34:21,802 --> 00:34:24,252
You got something
against the fastest man alive?

467
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:26,161
You're insane, mate!

468
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:29,784
Superman can fly around the entire
planet in the blink of an eye.

469
00:34:29,927 --> 00:34:32,145
Dude, if we're going
by a pure foot race,

470
00:34:32,426 --> 00:34:34,176
Supes would get dusted by the Flash.

471
00:34:34,336 --> 00:34:37,707
But why would the man of steel
agree to a sodding foot race?

472
00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:39,303
Uh, for charity?

473
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:41,417
The Flash would totally win,
'cause he can, like,

474
00:34:41,431 --> 00:34:42,854
vibrate through walls and stuff.

475
00:34:42,926 --> 00:34:44,111
Vibration!

476
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:46,642
And what would Superman do
if he came up against a wall?

477
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,454
Well, no smashing allowed.

478
00:34:50,787 --> 00:34:52,909
No flying, no smashing.

479
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:55,285
Any other restrictions
I need to know about?

480
00:34:57,467 --> 00:35:01,344
Perhaps we should fit Superman with
a pair of kryptonite ballet slippers...

481
00:35:04,213 --> 00:35:05,265
The hell?

482
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,164
Charlie, duck!

483
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:21,504
Dude.

484
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,910
This way.

485
00:35:34,994 --> 00:35:36,753
No, the beacon
fell this side of the rise.

486
00:35:36,805 --> 00:35:37,805
No, there.

487
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:40,471
How about we split up?

488
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:42,856
Me and Charlie'll go that way.
You and Jin go around,

489
00:35:42,948 --> 00:35:44,723
and we'll meet up
at that ridge over there.

490
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:47,124
You and Jin.

491
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:48,828
I'll stick with Desmond.

492
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:00,544
You said "duck."

493
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:03,939
- Sorry?
- You shouted, "duck."

494
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:08,455
You knew, even before we set off.

495
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:10,804
- You knew all this time, didn't you?
- Aye.

496
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:12,562
Then, why didn't you say anything?

497
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,983
Because if I told you the truth,
you wouldn't have come.

498
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:18,713
Oh, you need me to come
'cause I was part of your vision.

499
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:21,146
You thought the only way
you could get your girl back

500
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:22,695
was if took an arrow in the head.

501
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,415
You were gonna sacrifice me.

502
00:36:25,491 --> 00:36:28,111
If the flashes don't happen exactly
as I saw them,

503
00:36:28,993 --> 00:36:30,104
the picture changes.

504
00:36:32,627 --> 00:36:34,655
I was supposed to let you die, Charlie.

505
00:36:34,994 --> 00:36:36,266
What's that supposed to mean?

506
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:38,043
It means it's bloody pointless.

507
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:42,302
I keep saving your life,
and what good has it done?

508
00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:44,678
It's just gonna keep happening
again and again.

509
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:45,918
Maybe that's the point, yeah?

510
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:48,040
- Maybe it's a test.
- A test?

511
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,686
Like God testing Abraham,
except I failed...

512
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:53,974
Because I changed what I saw.

513
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,277
Hey, can you hear me?

514
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:20,493
Dude, she's not moving.

515
00:37:23,905 --> 00:37:24,905
I'm sorry, Penny.

516
00:37:26,651 --> 00:37:27,651
I'm sorry.

517
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,148
I was afraid you'd left
without saying good-bye.

518
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:46,964
No.

519
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,942
I nearly took this with me.

520
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:56,558
If you're not in a hurry,

521
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,242
brother Martin's
heading into town in a few hours.

522
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:00,568
He can give you a ride.

523
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:04,664
That is, if you don't mind
doing some heavy lifting.

524
00:38:07,153 --> 00:38:09,003
All ten cases are ready to go.

525
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:12,173
Desmond there
is just getting the last one.

526
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:15,294
Thank you,
and my father sent the check in advance?

527
00:38:15,402 --> 00:38:17,679
And please thank him
for his generous donation.

528
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:19,578
Always a pleasure to see you.

529
00:38:23,054 --> 00:38:24,155
Good-bye, Desmond.

530
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,301
I think we should be able
to fit it all in the back,

531
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:36,204
and if not,
we'll put the rest in the front.

532
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,840
Is that all right?

533
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,340
Absolutely.

534
00:38:56,154 --> 00:38:57,563
You'd better drive safe, miss.

535
00:38:58,348 --> 00:39:01,341
This vineyard only makes a limited
number of these cases each year.

536
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:03,320
Is that so?

537
00:39:03,367 --> 00:39:05,334
Aye. It's because the monks are lazy.

538
00:39:06,662 --> 00:39:09,263
You know, it's easier
making grape jelly than wine.

539
00:39:10,022 --> 00:39:12,097
And how do you know so much
about monks?

540
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,355
I'm an ex-monk.

541
00:39:13,493 --> 00:39:14,528
Really?

542
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,590
As of last night.

543
00:39:17,215 --> 00:39:18,215
I was fired.

544
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:21,906
Well, it wasn't that funny.

545
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:24,169
I'm sorry. I've never... I've...

546
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:26,037
I didn't know monks could be fired.

547
00:39:26,278 --> 00:39:27,278
Oh, they can.

548
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:30,432
You know, I was told
in no uncertain terms

549
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,521
that the abbey
wasn't where I was meant to end up,

550
00:39:33,965 --> 00:39:34,965
just a...

551
00:39:36,013 --> 00:39:37,177
step along the path.

552
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:39,919
You know,
God allegedly has bigger plans for me.

553
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,891
Something tells me
you don't entirely believe that.

554
00:39:47,957 --> 00:39:49,421
I suspect that's because I don't.

555
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:51,233
Well, maybe they're right.

556
00:39:51,268 --> 00:39:52,963
I just think,
if you hadn't gotten fired,

557
00:39:52,964 --> 00:39:54,433
we wouldn't have met,
and then...

558
00:39:54,789 --> 00:39:58,048
how could you possibly help me
unload these crates in Carlisle?

559
00:39:59,737 --> 00:40:01,757
Did I say
I was coming to Carlisle with you?

560
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:03,674
Not yet.

561
00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:17,132
I mean, of course,
if an ex-monk already has plans...

562
00:40:17,237 --> 00:40:19,671
You know, I don't usually get into cars
with strangers.

563
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:21,818
Well, in that case, I'm Penelope.

564
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:25,799
Penny.

565
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:28,861
Desmond.

566
00:40:31,674 --> 00:40:33,061
Very nice to meet you, Penny.

567
00:40:43,798 --> 00:40:44,798
She's alive.

568
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:48,141
Stand back!

569
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:50,236
Get away from her!

570
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,663
I'm here. I'm here, Penny.

571
00:40:55,223 --> 00:40:57,176
- Be careful.
- Just get off, Charlie.

572
00:40:57,669 --> 00:40:59,285
Sorry, Penny. Sorry.

573
00:41:07,346 --> 00:41:08,426
Desmond?
