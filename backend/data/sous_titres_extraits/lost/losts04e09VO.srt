1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,410
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,140
Miles here and three of his people

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,050
Came to the island about a week ago.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,440
Share with us exactly why they're here. we're here for him.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,470
Problem solved. how soon do we turn him over?

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,560
We can't turn him over. once they have me,

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,390
Their orders are to kill everyone else on the island.

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,160
He won't even tell us who his spy on the boat is. it's michael.

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:22,950
Pull!

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,630
What are you guys doing? we're shooting things.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,380
This is a map to the temple. it's a sanctuary.

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,400
It may be the last safe place on this island.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,420
If you leave now, you can get there in a day and a half.

14
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,780
Your mother will protect you.

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,560
Karl? no!

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,290
Come on. come on. he's gone. no! no!

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,880
Wait! wait! don't! I'm ben's daughter!

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,780
I'm his daughter!

19
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,970
You got a prescription for that?

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,240
Yeah.

21
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,570
I wrote it myself.

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,590
You look terrible.

23
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,280
Well, thanks.

24
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,620
What are those?

25
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,750
Antibiotics. I just got a...

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,960
A stomach bug.

27
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,580
You should eat some crackers.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,010
Crackers always make me feel better.

29
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,120
Why aren't they back from the boat yet, jack?

30
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,900
Well, sayid said the engine was down.

31
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,970
My guess is they're trying to fix it

32
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,650
And wondering why the hell they can't get in touch with us.

33
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,300
And you're not worried? no.

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,870
My gut says we're getting off this island.

35
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,680
I thought your gut was sick.

36
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,650
Help! I need some help! help!

37
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,580
Help! I need help!

38
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,100
I need some help down here!

39
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,960
The dog was barking. I didn't see him.

40
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,820
I got him. flip.

41
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,760
Do you know who this is?

42
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,140
He was on our boat.

43
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,630
He's the doctor.

44
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,840
We're all gonna die.

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,610
Calm down, chicken little.

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,640
The sky ain't falling just yet.

47
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,860
This is exactly what he wants-- to fight amongst ourselves.

48
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,310
You're making a big mistake, dude. it's his to make, hugo.

49
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,440
Let's get on with it.

50
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,750
Right.

51
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,890
I'm attackin' siberia.

52
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,820
Sorry.

53
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,120
Can't believe you're just giving him australia.

54
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,960
Australia's the key to the whole game. says you.

55
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,320
Stop here. on your knees.

56
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,570
Get on your knees.

57
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,830
Hey. turn this thing off.

58
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,500
P-please.

59
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,570
There's a baby with them.

60
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,050
Just promise you won't...

61
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,620
Turn the fence off.

62
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,790
Okay. it's off.

63
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,280
Code 14-j.

64
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,040
Code 14-j.

65
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,660
Code 14-j.

66
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,500
Who is it?

67
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,750
Code 14-j. I think it's for ben.

68
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,270
What's "code 14-j"?

69
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,270
Where did you hear that?

70
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,130
The phone rang. I picked it up.

71
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,440
A voice kept repeating, "code 14-j."

72
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,720
We need to get to the other house.

73
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,710
It's easier to fortify,

74
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,380
And we'll have better position on the tree lines.

75
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,420
What are you talking about?

76
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,760
They're here.

77
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,910
Hello.

78
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,620
No, no, no, no. wait.

79
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,090
Wait. I can explain. d-do you speak english?

80
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,830
Sure. sure.

81
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,720
Ah. okay.

82
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,310
Okay. okay.

83
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,860
Okay.

84
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,500
This...

85
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,570
Surrender! surrender!

86
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,240
Oh, so you do speak english.

87
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,040
Yah!

88
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,120
Let me guess. "14-j" ain't the code for the pizza boy.

89
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,170
It's an early warning system.

90
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,490
Warning for what? somebody tripped

91
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,250
The panic switch at our security fence.

92
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,630
That means one of my people's been captured.

93
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,880
How long did you guys debate amongst yourselves

94
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,950
Whether or not to ask me why the phone rang?

95
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,880
Five minutes.

96
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,460
Well, so much for our head start.

97
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,270
Hold up. if we're hunkerin' down,

98
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,410
I gotta grab frenchie and the kids. don't bother. they're safe.

99
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,800
I sent rousseau, alex and karl away yesterday. away where?

100
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,150
Whatever. claire's still sleepin'. I'll grab her.

101
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,580
There's no time.

102
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,950
I'll make time.

103
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,320
It's very important that you survive

104
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,470
What's about to happen here, john.

105
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,780
So I need you to stay close to me. and why would I do that?

106
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,940
Because the people that are coming won't risk hurting me.

107
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,560
You want to live? I'm your best chance.

108
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,880
His throat was slit.

109
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,780
Know anything about that?

110
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,940
No. uh, he was fine when I last saw him.

111
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,330
Which was when?

112
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,580
When?

113
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,750
"when" is kind of a relative term.

114
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,270
We don't know anything about this.

115
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,200
Any luck fixing the sat-phone?

116
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,960
Uh, yeah. sorry, no.

117
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,790
The, uh, mike was... smashed pretty good.

118
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,830
Best-case scenario,

119
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,010
We'd only be able to broadcast tone squelch--beeps and boops. well, yeah,

120
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,850
But you could still use it as sort of a telegraph, right?

121
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,410
If I had some strips of ferrous metal,

122
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,840
Uh, a 9-volt battery clip

123
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,330
And some... wiring.

124
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,240
We got a bunch of stuff that we salvaged from the plane. great.

125
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,500
I'll show you where it is.

126
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,620
Bernard, you got a second?

127
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,910
These people who are coming--

128
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,270
You're scared of 'em, aren't you? that's right, john. I am.

129
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,270
What's going on?

130
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,730
Get away from the window, hugo.

131
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,810
How's sawyer gonna get back in? he's not.

132
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,650
Hey. you see if claire left her house this morning?

133
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,910
What's going on? why do you have that?

134
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,850
Just get back inside and wait until--

135
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,670
Get back inside! aah!

136
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,600
Get inside!

137
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,970
Claire!
Claire!

138
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,080
Claire!
Claire!

139
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,390
Claire!
Claire!

140
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,650
Good afternoon, sir.

141
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,590
Good afternoon. I'd like a room, please.

142
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,440
Of course, sir. is this your first time in tunisia?

143
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,580
No, but it's been a while.

144
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Your name?

145
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,890
I'm actually a preferred guest.

146
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,570
It should be under "dean moriarty."

147
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,830
Certainly, mr. moriarty.

148
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,500
May I help you with anything else?

149
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,210
Yes. um, today's date is...

150
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,580
October 24th, sir. 2005?

151
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,260
Yes, sir. 2005.

152
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,020
Thank you.

153
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,340
...Sayid Jarrah...
...sayid jarrah...

154
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,690
...Sayid Jarrah...
...sayid jarrah...

155
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,300
Please. I just want to bury my wife in peace.

156
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,010
Right now I need you to tell me what's going on.

157
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,630
I think the technical term is "shock and awe."

158
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,900
They're trying to frighten me into surrendering.

159
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,460
Well, why did they stop shooting?

160
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,340
Was that claire's house? claire was there.

161
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,530
Hugo, get the baby away from the window.

162
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,280
Put him in the back room.

163
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,900
You said I need to survive this. why?

164
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,860
Because there's only one person that can help us now,

165
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,340
And that's jacob, and we have to go to him together.

166
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,490
What makes you think I can find him?

167
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,420
I-i don't even know where the cabin is.

168
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,390
I know, but hurley does.

169
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,110
Claire£¡
Claire!

170
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,920
Claire
Claire!

171
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,320
Claire
Claire!

172
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,380
Claire
Claire!

173
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,490
Are you okay?

174
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,300
Claire
Charlie?

175
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,500
Okay. okay. okay. where's aaron? where's aaron?

176
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,220
He's with us. it's okay. we're gonna move now.

177
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,670
Let's go.

178
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,260
Open the front door!

179
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,920
Hugo, you don't want to do that.

180
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,440
Open the damn door!

181
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,210
Open the door!

182
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,480
Open the damn door!

183
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:09,820
Careful.

184
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,940
Is she all right?

185
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,120
She got her bell rung, but she's gonna be all right.

186
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,390
They just started shooting. why?

187
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,560
Why slaughter people without even telling us what they want?

188
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,670
Those people were murdered to make you angry, james.

189
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,030
So you'd be more likely to come storming in here

190
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,950
And throw me to the wolves. yeah, what's wrong with that?

191
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,560
Sounds like a great plan to me. what do you say, on three?

192
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,650
I wouldn't if I were you.

193
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,630
Shut up!

194
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,670
Miles?
Miles?

195
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,710
Who the hell let you out?

196
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,280
The people who gave me this.

197
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,420
They want to talk.

198
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,190
You vultures, you followed me to tikrit... to spy on me?!

199
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,050
What are you doing here?

200
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,760
I'm here to find the man who murdered your wife.

201
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,100
How did you get here?

202
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,970
I came across the syrian border.

203
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,990
It's really not as difficult as you might-- how did you get off the

204
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,120
Island?

205
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,560
Your friend desmond had a boat.

206
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,410
Remember? "the elizabeth."

207
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,050
I followed a heading to fiji.

208
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,760
Then I chartered a plane.

209
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,440
Why now?

210
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,200
You remember the name charles widmore, don't you?

211
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,240
The man who tried to convince the world

212
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,010
That your plane was on the bottom of the ocean?

213
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,500
What does it have to do with me? with nadia?

214
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,810
There was a man at her procession.

215
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,780
He goes by the name of ishmael bakir.

216
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,120
He's one of widmore's men.

217
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,740
Bakir was last seen five days ago

218
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,130
In los angeles,

219
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,510
Caught by a traffic camera,

220
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,410
Speeding away from the corner of la brea and santa monica.

221
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,540
That's three blocks from where nadia was killed.

222
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,390
Why would these people want to murder her?

223
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,540
I don't know.

224
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,860
But they did.

225
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,700
How many of 'em are there?

226
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,680
Maybe six. I'm not sure.

227
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,530
The hell you mean, you ain't sure?

228
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,490
You came over on the same boat with 'em, didn't ya?

229
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,130
They told me they were just security.

230
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,480
Security for what? for him.

231
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,140
Once they got him, to escort him back to the mainland.

232
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Well, miles, sounds like

233
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,860
You're not gonna collect your $3.2 million.

234
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,760
Just take it.

235
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,420
Why would I talk to them?

236
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,790
Because they have a hostage.

237
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,040
Well, then they've badly miscalculated,

238
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,600
Cause every single one of my people

239
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,630
Is prepared to die in service to this island. it's your daughter!

240
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,310
Hello?

241
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,160
Am I speaking to benjamin linus?

242
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,360
That's right.

243
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,110
My name is martin keamy.

244
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,400
I'm an employee of charles widmore.

245
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,550
Who's charles widmore? later.

246
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,690
I'd like you to go look out your east window

247
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,950
So we can talk about this face-to-face.

248
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,310
To the left.

249
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,370
You see me?

250
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,670
Yeah, I see you.

251
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,640
All right, mr. linus, these are my terms.

252
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,240
You're gonna step out the front door,

253
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,390
Put your hands above your head,

254
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,120
And you're gonna walk straight to me.

255
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,190
Once I have you in my custody, then I promise you

256
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,270
That no one else in that house will be harmed.

257
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,680
You and I both know that once you have me,

258
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,730
There's nothing to stop you

259
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,820
From killing everybody else on this island.

260
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,280
What kind of guy do you think I am?

261
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,220
Martin christopher keamy
Martin christopher keamy--

262
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,020
Former first sergeant, united states marine corps,

263
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,110
Served with distinction from 1996 to 2001,

264
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,080
But since then,

265
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,190
You've worked with a number of mercenary organizations,

266
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,640
Specifically in uganda.

267
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,880
So I know exactly what kind of man you are, mr. keamy,

268
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,970
And we can dispense with the formalities.

269
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,070
Okay, ben. you got it.

270
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,580
Get down.

271
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,800
Get your ass out here right now...

272
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,920
Or I'm gonna kill your daughter.

273
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,750
I'd like to present a counterproposal.

274
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,230
I'm listening.

275
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,290
You and your friends...

276
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,780
You turn around.

277
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,060
Walk back to your helicopter.

278
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,410
You fly away and forget you ever heard of this island.

279
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,260
Tell your daddy good-bye.

280
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,870
Dad...

281
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,380
They're serious.

282
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,580
They killed karl and my mother.

283
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,420
Alex...
Alex...

284
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,930
I have this under control.

285
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,450
Everything's gonna be okay.

286
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,220
Please, daddy!

287
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,660
Please. Please.

288
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,720
You have ten seconds, Ben.

289
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,320
Okay, listen.

290
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,560
Nine...

291
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,110
She's not my daughter.

292
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,550
Eight...

293
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,310
I stole her as a baby from an insane woman.

294
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,810
She's a pawn, nothing more.

295
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,700
She means nothing to me.

296
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,010
I'm not coming out of this house.

297
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,070
So if you want to kill her, go ahead and do it--

298
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,790
I don't see 'em.

299
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,710
They just left her body there and disappeared into the jungle.

300
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,110
They won't be gone for long.

301
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,280
It's gonna be dark in about 20 minutes,

302
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,870
And then they're gonna come for him.

303
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,720
Then let's just hand him over.

304
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,080
I don't think these people have any intentions

305
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,200
Of letting us walk of here alive, James,

306
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,680
No matter what we do.

307
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,810
Well, I ain't got no intention of dyin'.

308
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,400
He changed the rules.

309
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,790
What? who?

310
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,800
What rules?

311
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,550
You know I'm right.

312
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,870
Our best chance here is to toss him out and fend for ourselves.

313
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,780
Hey! Where you goin'?

314
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,180
Open this damn door!

315
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,690
Open up!

316
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,550
Walk.

317
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,130
Who are you and why are you following me?

318
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,520
My name is Benjamin Linus.

319
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,050
And I need you to take a message to Mr. Widmore for me.

320
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,050
And what message is that?

321
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,510
That should do it.

322
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:40,970
Wait.

323
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,100
Where do you think you're going?

324
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,380
We're finished here, Sayid.

325
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,720
Turn around and walk away.

326
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,560
Mourn your loss. get on with your life.

327
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,690
I have no life. they took it from me.

328
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,590
Go home, sayid.

329
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,060
Once you let your grief become anger,

330
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,650
It will never go away.

331
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,140
I speak from experience.

332
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,220
This is my war. It's not yours.

333
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,510
I spent the last eight years of my life

334
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,820
Searching for the woman I love.

335
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,130
I finally found her and I married her.

336
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,930
And I buried her yesterday.

337
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,700
So don't tell me this is not my war.

338
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,030
Benjamin...
Benjamin...

339
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,360
Who's next?

340
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,080
I'll be in touch.

341
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,220
Open the damn door!

342
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
Son of a bitch just left us here.

343
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,380
Open the damn door! what's going on?

344
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,770
Claire?
Claire?

345
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,080
You all right, sweetheart? yeah, a bit wobbly, but, uh, I'll live.

346
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,740
Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that.

347
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,090
Excuse me, James.

348
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,040
Excuse you?

349
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,350
What were you doing in there?

350
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,020
Okay, listen to me very carefully.

351
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,170
I need all of you to do exactly as I say.

352
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,850
In a minute, we have to run from this house as fast as we can.

353
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,790
At that moment, when I give the order, I want you to head

354
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,460
Straight for the tree line.

355
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,030
You mean towards the guys with guns?

356
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,640
No, we want to be as far away from them as possible.

357
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,300
Okay, outside. outside now!

358
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,990
What did you do?!

359
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,770
Did you just call that thing?

360
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,070
Fall back!

361
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,260
Go! go, go!

362
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,480
Head for the trees. I'll catch up with you.

363
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,840
Hey, where are you going?

364
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,520
I have to say good-bye to my daughter, John.

365
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,940
I can't believe it.

366
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,350
Might actually have a signal.

367
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,860
What are you sending?

368
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,510
"what..."

369
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,710
"happened...

370
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,950
"to...

371
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,890
The... doctor?"

372
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,970
Okay. they didn't exactly say what happened to the doctor,

373
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,690
But your friends are fine,

374
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,670
And the helicopter's coming back in--in the morning.

375
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,660
Well?

376
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,860
He's lying.

377
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,990
What the message said was, "what are you talking about?

378
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,280
The doctor is fine."

379
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,330
You know morse code.

380
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,960
What does that mean--

381
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,810
"the doctor is fine"?

382
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,500
I don't know.

383
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,980
Why are you lying?

384
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,470
Why did you say

385
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,820
That the helicopters are coming back?

386
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,910
Jack
Jack.

387
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,850
Were you ever... gonna take us off this island?

388
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,100
No.

389
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,300
No.

390
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,790
-Jack. -No.

391
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,400
I think your chopper buddies ran that way,

392
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,770
If you wanna catch up.

393
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,110
Yeah, I think I'll stay with you guys for--for now.

394
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,300
Sorry about your daughter.

395
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,330
Thank you, John.

396
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,570
That being said, you lied to me.

397
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,660
You told me you didn't know what the smoke monster was.

398
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,590
You can ask Jacob all about it when we go to the cabin.

399
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,340
Hang on. "Jacob"?

400
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,270
Who the hell's Jacob?

401
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,250
He's the man that's gonna tell us what to do next, James.

402
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,070
You know what? I'm done with all this.

403
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,000
I never should have followed you wackos in the first place.

404
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,650
I'm goin' back to the beach, and Claire and the kid

405
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:34,860
Are comin' with me. you good with that?

406
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,470
Yeah, I'm good with that.

407
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,460
I'm coming with you.

408
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,080
Let's go. You, too, Hurley.

409
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,840
Have you lost your mind?

410
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,380
Hugo stays with us.

411
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,460
-Not a chance. -Wait. Leave me out of this.

412
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,820
I'm sorry, Hugo. we need you to find the cabin.

413
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,110
He ain't goin' anywhere with you,

414
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:11,670
-You crazy son of a bitch. -Stop! put the guns down. I'll go with Locke.

415
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,140
-Hugo. -It's okay, Sawyer.

416
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,340
Please, put your gun down.

417
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,720
You, too.

418
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,950
You don't have to do this.

419
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,200
You guys go back to the beach. I'll catch up sooner or later.

420
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,190
You harm so much as one hair on his curly head...

421
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,520
I'll kill you.

422
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,090
Fair enough.

423
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,700
Let's go. Go. Move.

424
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,460
Which way?

425
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,880
Thank you.

426
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,450
Good evening, Sir. May I help you?

427
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,560
Oh, yes. I'm here to see Mr. and Mrs. Kendrick in 4e.

428
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,820
At this hour, sir?

429
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,750
They're expecting me.

430
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,660
Feel free to call up.

431
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:59,270
No need, sir. Good night, sir.

432
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,620
Wake up, Charles.

433
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,840
I wondered when you were gonna show up.

434
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,280
I see you've been getting more sun.

435
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,580
Iraq is lovely this time of year.

436
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:23,360
When did you start sleeping with a bottle of scotch by the bed?

437
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,950
When the nightmares started.

438
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,150
Have you come here to kill me, Benjamin?

439
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,280
We both know I can't do that.

440
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,220
Then why are you here?

441
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,990
I'm here, Charles,

442
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,040
Because you murdered my daughter.

443
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,290
Don't stand there, looking at me

444
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,220
With those horrible eyes of yours

445
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,880
And lay the blame for the death of that poor girl on me

446
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,860
When we both know very well

447
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,740
I didn't murder her at all, Benjamin.

448
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,270
You did.

449
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,580
No, that's not true.

450
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,310
Yes, Benjamin, it is.

451
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:23,620
You creep into my bedroom in the dead of night like a rat

452
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,010
And have the audacity to pretend that you're the victim?

453
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,510
I know who you are, boy...

454
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,260
What you are.

455
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,420
I know that everything you have you took from me.

456
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,420
So... once again I ask you,

457
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,460
Why are you here?

458
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,420
I'm here, Charles,

459
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,550
To tell you that I'm going to kill your daughter.

460
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,220
Penelope, is it?

461
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,740
And once she's gone...

462
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,000
Once she's dead...

463
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,580
Then you'll understand how I feel.

464
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,500
And you'll wish you hadn't changed the rules.

465
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,360
You'll never find her.

466
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,170
That island's mine, Benjamin.

467
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,010
It always was. It will be again.

468
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,120
But you'll never find it.

469
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,390
Then I suppose the hunt is on for both of us.

470
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,260
I suppose it is.

471
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,720
Sleep tight, Charles.
