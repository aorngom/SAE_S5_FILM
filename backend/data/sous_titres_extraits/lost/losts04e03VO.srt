1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,250
Previously on Lost

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,250
You killed Naomi

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,150
She want's her people to come here

4
00:00:07,151 --> 00:00:08,550
and trust me, when they do

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,250
We had better be far away from here.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,510
If you want to live,you need to come with me.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,550
Who are you?

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,050
Daniel faraday. I'm here to rescue you. so this is the team?

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,380
These are the wrong people for a mission like this.

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,250
None of them have field experience,military training.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,580
You can't just drop them in unprotected.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,350
There's only so much I can do.

13
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,115
Where's the chopper? where did it crash?  crash?

14
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:41,380
what kind of pilot you think I am?

15
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,850
I put her down safe and sound right over there.

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,400
Get up. you're coming with us. well,

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,680
we need to stay where we are so that they can find us.

18
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,010
See,there's your problem. we don't want to be found.

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,850
You wanted to know why we're here?

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,380
I'll tell you why we're here. we're here for benjamin linus.

21
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,550
Now where is he?

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,560
Did ben ever mention anything

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,500
About knowing anyone off the island?

24
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,160
You're sure of that? no.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,000
Look,this is real simple.

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,300
Do you know where he is or don't you?

27
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,300
What do you want with him? I wanna locate him.

28
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,700
The people who hired me told me his name's benjamin linus.

29
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,700
They gave this picture,and that's all they told me.

30
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,430
They said,"find him." and for what they're paying me,

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,100
I don't need to know anything else.

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,660
Do you?

33
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,030
You want ben?

34
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,530
Okay,he's with locke and your friend...

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,100
-Charlotte  -Charlotte
Charlotte. charlotte.

36
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,860
Locke's got her,too,and we know where he's heading.

37
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,260
Locke's the guy that killed naomi?

38
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,700
Give me back my gun,shephard.

39
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,600
You want your gun back. I want answers.

40
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,600
You don't trust me. I don't trust you.

41
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,600
In fact,you're supposed to be dead.

42
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,700
But am I asking a billion questions? no.

43
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,760
We both have the same problem-- this locke guy.

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,930
Even if locke has your friend,

45
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,930
You can't just waltz in there and grab her.

46
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,060
They're armed.

47
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,060
Well,how about that? so are we.

48
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,060
So why don't we move out and--

49
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,260
You're not going anywhere. will that helicopter fly?

50
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,360
What she does.

51
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,060
Then you can take me to your ship. sayid,wait a second.

52
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,930
We did call these people to get us off this island,

53
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Didn't we?

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,930
Well?

55
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
I burned a lot of fuel coming in.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,060
I can't carry much weight.

57
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,730
I'll take three of ya.

58
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,230
In case you zoned out while you were tweezing your goatee,

59
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,230
One of these yahoos took charlotte prisoner.

60
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,430
I can bring her back safely.

61
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,860
And if I do...

62
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,730
Will you take me to the ship?

63
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,100
Absolutely.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,360
You bring charlotte back safe,

65
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,900
And I will take you off this island.

66
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,860
Good morning.

67
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,130
Morning.

68
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,130
It's a long walk to the next hole.

69
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,800
Do you need a ride?

70
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,260
Thank you,but no. my ball is right here.

71
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,260
You know,

72
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,130
You're the first person I've seen out here all morning.

73
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,130
I believe we're paying quite a premium

74
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,630
For that kind of privacy.

75
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,130
Indeed we are.

76
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,830
Is this your first time in the seychelles?

77
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,660
Unh-unh. I'd use the 5-iron.

78
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,130
I think I'll stick with the 7.

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,130
Tell you what.

80
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,260
50 euros says mine goes closer to the pin with a 5.

81
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,730
Let's make it 100.

82
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,700
Eccellente.

83
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,960
Amazing,huh,

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,500
How a wager makes just about anything more fun?

85
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,760
Not bad.

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Not bad.

87
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,000
So...

88
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,730
What do you do for a living,my friend?

89
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,700
I do nothing.

90
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,700
"nothing" doesn't pay for a vacation here.

91
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,200
I was the recipient of a large settlement.

92
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,360
Corporate merger?

93
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,130
Actually,a plane crash.

94
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,760
Oceanic airlines flight 815.

95
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,160
I'm sayid jarrah.

96
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,600
One of the oceanic six.

97
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,530
Ah,that's...

98
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,360
That's--that's amazing. uh...

99
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,530
I remember reading all about it.

100
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,430
Take your shot,my friend.

101
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,560
It appears you were right about the 5 iron.

102
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,760
Enjoy you round,and,uh,don't worry about the wager.

103
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,760
It's all in good fun.

104
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,660
No,you won. allow me to pay you.

105
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,500
It's fine,thank you. it's...

106
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,030
I insist,mr. avellino.

107
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,430
"is it free?" was the full extent of my german.

108
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,260
What are you looking for?

109
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,160
I love europe. everyone speaks english.

110
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,100
I'm looking for potsdamer platz.

111
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,130
Well,you don't need a map.

112
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,660
It's one block down,right across the street.

113
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,930
Thank you.

114
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,460
I'm elsa.

115
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,130
Sayid
Sayid.

116
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,330
Could I have an espresso,please?

117
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,060
What sort of business brings you to berlin?

118
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
I'm a headhunter.

119
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,630
A corporate recruiter.

120
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,930
My employer is an economist. he works in emerging markets.

121
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,700
Actually,i-i don't really understand what he does,

122
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,130
Which doesn't matter since all I do is shop for him.

123
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,060
And if this goes off,

124
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,900
I'm at his side instantly,

125
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,560
Which is wonderful

126
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,560
Since he's only in berlin once or twice a year.

127
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,400
Which is why you're enjoying

128
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,400
A luxuriously long midday coffee.

129
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,060
Yes.

130
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,260
Thank you.

131
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,830
Do i...

132
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,230
Know you from somewhere?

133
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,630
I'll tell you exactly where you know me from...

134
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,230
If you let me take you to dinner.

135
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,160
This is the restaurant you're taking me to tonight.

136
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,530
8:00.

137
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,100
Well... if you can find it.

138
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,630
Hello?

139
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,130
I made contact.

140
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,500
Good.

141
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,930
Take a look at this.

142
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,860
Naomi had it with her.

143
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,930
She was looking for desmond.

144
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,530
Whatever their real agenda is,

145
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,700
It's clear they're not sharing it.

146
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,000
Maybe desmond can shed some light on this.

147
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,830
How long would it take to get to the beach and back?

148
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,000
Couple of hours.

149
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,330
You mind?

150
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,430
Anything I can do to help.

151
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,600
Sayid
Sayid.

152
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,960
So how we gonna do this?

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,630
You're not the best candidate for this kind of mission.

154
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,730
Well,and what kind of mission is that?

155
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,730
I'm going to make locke release charlotte,

156
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,060
And I'm going to do it without any bloodshed.

157
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,500
As opposed to the way I'd do it?

158
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,500
The last time you encountered him,

159
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,460
You put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.

160
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,700
That's not good diplomacy.

161
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,130
Hey. jarrah.

162
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,730
You think you're going after charlotte without me?

163
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,400
Of course not.

164
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,500
Well,good.

165
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,760
Is there anything else?

166
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,100
Yeah. give me my gun back.

167
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,460
We leave in ten minutes.

168
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,900
Ready to give us a name,gizmo?

169
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,200
He's not gonna tell you who his spy is on their boat,james.

170
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,860
Yeah? why not?

171
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,400
Because that's the only thing that's keeping him alive.

172
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,100
Well,here's an idea.

173
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,600
Why don't we take a gun,point it to his big toe

174
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,600
And send that little piggy to market?

175
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,400
And if he still doesn't want to tell us,

176
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,030
We'll move on to the roast beef. now why don't we do that?

177
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,260
Because then we'd have to carry him.

178
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,560
Hey,john,how much further is it? i-i need to feed aaron.

179
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
It should be here... the cabin.

180
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,560
Maybe we got turned around. it could be anywhere.

181
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
No,it was here.

182
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,300
Well,what's in this cabin that's so important anyway? 

183
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,560
John's looking for somebody to tell him what to do next. 

184
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,660
I guess I was mistaken. 

185
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,660
It doesn't... doesn't matter. 

186
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,400
Plan's the same. we keep movin'. the barracks aren't far. 

187
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,130
If her team is with jack's group, 

188
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,330
They know we're going to the barracks. 

189
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Yeah,and red here was wearing a vest. 

190
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,500
Which means her posse's gonna come 

191
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,860
Expecting themselves a gunfight. if all they want is her, maybe we should just let her go. 

192
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,360
I mean,i thought we were just gonna go hide. 

193
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,360
Why do we need to take prisoners? 

194
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,200
We're keeping her because she's gonna be valuable. how is she gonna be valuable? 

195
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,030
He means as a hostage,luv. 

196
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,630
Unh-unh. no,this is not what I signed up for. 

197
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,630
What did you sign up for,hugo? look,i'm just saying I think we-- 

198
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,000
If we let her go,they'll look at it as a sign of good faith. 

199
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,330
They'll look at it as an act of foolishness, 

200
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Which is what it would be. I'm just trying to come up with some sort of compromise-- 

201
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,030
We're beyond compromise. 

202
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,700
And right now,hugo,i'm making the decision. 

203
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,460
Is that gonna be a problem for you? 

204
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,360
Kinda sucks,huh?  

205
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,200
what's that? 

206
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,200
Being told not to come along. 

207
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,330
Now you know what it feels like to be me. 

208
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,730
Does that mean I should wait 20 minutes and ago anyway?  

209
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,930
touch? 

210
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,400
You should go with them,kate.  

211
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,100
you're serious?

212
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,360
yeah. 

213
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,500
What,don't you trust sayid? 

214
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,260
I don't trust locke. 

215
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,430
So what's preventing him from doing to me 

216
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,300
What he did to naomi? 

217
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,430
Sawyer won't let him. 

218
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,700
Got room for one more? 

219
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,700
Oh,yeah,she gets a gun. 

220
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,700
The gun's a last resort,kate 

221
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,100
You give locke that same speech? 

222
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,160
Hey! let's move out. 

223
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,800
This guy sayid-- where's he from?  

224
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,930
iraq. 

225
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,630
iraq. 

226
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,800
So he's just gonna go and work everything out? 

227
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,460
What was he,a diplomat?  

228
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,600
no.

229
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,760
No,he was a torturer. 

230
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,960
Naomi-- were you close to her? 

231
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,960
Nope. met her on the boat. 

232
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,630
You don't seem particularly affected by her death. 

233
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,630
Sure I'm affected. she was hot,and I dug her accent.  

234
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,260
nice. 

235
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,230
And this woman--charlotte. 

236
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,500
You don't really care about her,do you?  

237
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,800
define "care."

238
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,730
So much for camaraderie. 

239
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,730
Yeah,gee,who's the one going after 

240
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,730
One of their crash buddies with guns? 

241
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,730
Actually,i do care about locke. 

242
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,400
Maybe you can tell me 

243
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,900
How he managed to split your happy little family in half. 

244
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,530
There was a fundamental debate 

245
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,530
As to whether your people were coming to rescue us  

246
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,760
or kill us. 

247
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,930
And which side did you land on? 

248
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,300
I'll let you know when I decide. 

249
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,400
You look fantastic. 

250
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,060
This is why I wanted to take you to the opera. 

251
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,700
If a man can't wear his tuxedo by the fifth date,why bother? 

252
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,600
you know what? 

253
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,530
I'm not bringing it. 

254
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,530
If tonight's the night he calls,  

255
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,330
so be it.  

256
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,730
i'll carry it. 

257
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,200
If he does call,i don't want you fired over me. 

258
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,260
You should tell your employer that there is newer technology. 

259
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,830
Well,i've tried. he's very old-fashioned. 

260
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,530
You know how bosses can be. 

261
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,230
Do you have a boss? 

262
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,860
Everyone has a boss,elsa. 

263
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,260
Come on. we don't want to be late. 

264
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,530
Why are you still here? 

265
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,430
I mean,when we met, 

266
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,560
You said you would only be in berlin for one week. 

267
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,760
The job I'm on is proving harder to accomplish than I thought.  

268
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,000
oh.

269
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,100
right.

270
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,060
I was hoping it was because of me.

271
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,130
Let's go.

272
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,030
Strauss awaits.

273
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,430
What's his story?

274
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,260
Daniel? ah,couldn't tell you.

275
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,830
Half the stuff he says is way over my head.

276
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,160
The other half goes way,way over.

277
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,600
Hey,uh,frank? can i,uh-- ooh. sorry to interrupt.

278
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,660
May I please use the phone just for a second? for what?

279
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,200
I just wanna call regina on the boat,

280
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,200
Cause I figure since we're waiting,

281
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,700
Maybe I could just,you know,try to-- what is it,daniel?

282
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,200
I'd just like to do an experiment. just--just a--

283
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,330
Okay. you just keep it to that science stuff,all right? yeah.

284
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,665
If minkowski gets on there, you hang up right away. yeah. thank you.

285
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:48,200
thank you.

286
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,900
Hello?

287
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,700
Regina? hey--hi,it's dan. hang on.

288
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,730
Can you hear me? yeah.

289
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,730
Yeah? okay. hang on.

290
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,230
I'm,uh,all... yes.

291
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,600
I am all set here.

292
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,630
I have a fix. are you locked in?

293
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,500
Getting your signal pretty clear.

294
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,430
Oh. okay,great. then... okay.

295
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,100
Fire the payload.

296
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,430
Payload away!

297
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,100
Don't sweat it.

298
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,830
He does this kind of stuff on the boat all the time.

299
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,730
40 kilometers to beacon.

300
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,430
30 kilometers to beacon.

301
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,230
20 kilometers to beacon.

302
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,960
10 kilometers to beacon.

303
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,600
Regina
Regina?

304
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,360
I don't have it.

305
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,800
That's... weird.

306
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,830
That is far more than weird.

307
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,060
What's with the swing set? these people have day care?

308
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,860
You think they're here yet?

309
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,560
Let's find out.

310
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,160
It's coming from in there.

311
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,830
Let me go! help me!

312
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,630
Hurley,what happened?

313
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,150
They left me.

314
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,130
Locke's gone off the reservation,man.

315
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,130
I mean,he took this one chick hostage,

316
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,300
He said walt was the one

317
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,600
Who told him to kill the other chick,and he-- walt?

318
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,560
Dude,don't ask. I was,like,just trying to argue with him

319
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,623
So he would just,like,you know,chill,but,

320
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:39,300
uh-- how about you stop babbling,

321
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,560
Just tell us what happened to them? where are they? who are you?

322
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,260
Where the hell did they go,tubby?

323
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,660
Oh,awesome. the ship sent us another sawyer.

324
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,500
Hurley,where did they go?

325
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,630
L-look,i guess they were too busy tying me up to tell me.

326
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,160
I don't know. and so they all left,all together?

327
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,160
Yeah,they were freaked. locke said that the people on the ship

328
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,160
Were coming to rescue charlotte and then to kill us.

329
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,860
So... are you?

330
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,760
Not yet.

331
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,660
Did they say anything

332
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,800
That suggested where they were going next?

333
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,460
Uh,locke said they were

334
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,030
Gonna go by ben's house before they took off.

335
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,360
Why would he go there? for all I know,

336
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,500
They could've locked ben up in the closet,too. where's ben's house?

337
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,600
Mind if I ask you a question?

338
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,960
Shoot.

339
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,500
The red sox really win the series?

340
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,200
Hey,don't get me started on that,all right?

341
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,230
My dad's from the bronx. I bleed yankee blue.

342
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,460
I can't believe

343
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,460
It's been a hundred days since I've seen a game.

344
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,530
It's the payload.

345
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,500
It's finally here.

346
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,060
What is that?

347
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,430
It's a rocket.

348
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,200
Oh,no.

349
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,900
This is not good.

350
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,560
Your friends are back.

351
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,530
Look at that.

352
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,430
Look for anything that might show where they've gone.

353
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,560
I'll start in here.

354
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,600
Sayid!
Sayid!

355
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,360
Don't worry. kate's fine.

356
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,560
Good job,hugo.

357
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,430
Sorry,dude.

358
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,400
I'm sorry,sayid. nothing personal.

359
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,930
Where's locke?

360
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,930
Talking to that angry chinese guy.

361
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,760
I'm not going to hurt you,hurley.

362
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,260
Yeah... I saw you snap that guy's neck

363
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,830
With that break-dancing thing you do with your legs.

364
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,860
I think I'll hang back here.

365
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,860
Well...

366
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,400
I guess they're running out of jail space

367
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,330
I lost a dollar,you know.

368
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,000
How'd you manage that?

369
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,500
I bet john that you wouldn't be stupid enough

370
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,730
To fall for your friend as bait.

371
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,430
What do you know about friendship?

372
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,460
I know it's no use having friends you can't trust.

373
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,360
So what I'm your prisoner?

374
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,900
If that sorta thing turns you on.

375
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,000
What are you doing here with locke?

376
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,500
I'm not with him. yeah,you are,james.

377
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,930
Then what are you doing with jack? I went with jack because I believe

378
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,300
He can get us off this island.

379
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,160
Then I guess that's the difference between us.

380
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,730
I ain't lookin' to leave.

381
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Why not?

382
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,160
Cause I ain't got nothin' back there for me.

383
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,660
And what's here that's so much better?

384
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,360
Why do you wanna go back,kate?

385
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,330
Seem to recall you being shuttled off to jail

386
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,160
Before we landed here.

387
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,200
So if you think there's anything waitin' for you back home

388
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,860
Other than handcuffs,

389
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,930
Then you really don't know how the world works.

390
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,660
Look around us,freckles.

391
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,830
We got roofs over our heads...

392
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,500
Electricity,showers,beds.

393
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,830
How long,sawyer?

394
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,460
How long do you think we can play house?

395
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,360
Why don't we find out?

396
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,260
Iced tea.

397
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,760
I thought you might be thirsty.

398
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,260
I'm thirsty.

399
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,030
I'm sorry about all the theatrics,

400
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,200
But,uh,i didn't know how many of you there would be

401
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,630
Or whether you'd be armed.

402
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,800
I had to... cover my bases.

403
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,760
What have you done with miles and kate?

404
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,200
Kate's with sawyer,and miles is somewhere else.

405
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,600
He's fine. all I did was ask him some questions.

406
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,430
Did he answer any? no.

407
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,600
Did you have more luck with the woman you captured?

408
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,500
Not particularly.

409
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,260
Then why don't you turn her over to me? and why would I do that?

410
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,260
I agree that these people are liars.

411
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,460
And they're certainly not here to rescue us.

412
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,460
But if I return safely with charlotte,

413
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
They'll take me to their ship.

414
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,200
It's our best chance at finding out who they are

415
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,760
And what they really want.

416
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,760
Well,then,i can save you a lot of trouble,sayid,

417
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,960
Because ben says he's got a spy on the boat.

418
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,030
Who?

419
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,530
It's a secret.

420
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,030
Forgive me,but the day I start trusting him

421
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,500
Is the day I would have sold my soul.

422
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,430
Give me charlotte,

423
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,930
Allow me to do things my way,

424
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,530
Or a war is coming which we will both be powerless to stop.

425
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,600
Why would I give you charlotte for nothing?

426
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,900
Oh,i think you misunderstood me.

427
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,160
I never expected you to give her to me for nothing.

428
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,860
Should we get dressed?

429
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,560
No

430
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,630
Well  we're gonna have to get out of this bed

431
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,300
At a certain point

432
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,360
Why?

433
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,760
Well,for one thing,

434
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,960
Because I know that eventually

435
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,500
You're gonna have to go to that job of yours.

436
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,060
You know,the one you never talk about.

437
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,560
There's nothing to talk about. it's just a job.

438
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,760
I know nothing about you.

439
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,830
I understand you don't want to talk about the crash,

440
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,060
What happened to you.

441
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,000
But what about life now?

442
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,000
What about you?

443
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,030
That's what you do when you're in love,right?

444
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,830
In love?

445
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,560
Yeah.

446
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,760
Okay.

447
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,430
No more secrets.

448
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,830
What do you want to know?

449
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,960
He's here...

450
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,960
My boss.

451
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,630
I,uh...

452
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,160
I have to go. now?

453
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,430
Where?

454
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,760
Hotel adlon.

455
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Where's my dress?

456
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,760
Elsa? 
Elsa?

457
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,600
You have to leave berlin.

458
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,160
What?

459
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,030
You can't be here anymore.

460
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,760
What do you mean? why would i--

461
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,760
People will be asking questions soon

462
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,030
About what happened to your employer.

463
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,260
And you can't be around to answer them.

464
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,430
My employer?

465
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,000
This... this is about my boss?

466
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,030
Who are you?

467
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,300
It has nothing to do with how-- the cafe...

468
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,700
You meant to meet me there?

469
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,830
You used me to get to my boss?

470
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,420
What did you say--people will ask what happened to him?

471
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,630
it's best you don't know.

472
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,160
Are you gonna kill him?

473
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,500
You're gonna kill him?

474
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,830
Do you even know him?

475
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,260
His name is on a list.

476
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,830
A list?! what list? you--you have a list? my employer's.

477
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,100
Who is that? it doesn't matter who he is!

478
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,360
So you just kill people 'cause they're on a list?

479
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,200
Innocent people? the man you are working for is not an economist.

480
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,850
You were supposed to page me at ten-thirty.

481
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,850
No, I didn't kill him.

482
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,750
He's not going to give up the name now.

483
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,850
Why should I keep him alive?

484
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,450
No. He had no idea.

485
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,850
All right, all right.

486
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,850
I'll bring him to you.

487
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,850
Leave the hotel.

488
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,850
I'll meet you at the safe house.

489
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,830
What do you think you're--

490
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,460
Hey,i'm gonna ask you one last time.

491
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,460
Why was naomi carrying this picture of me?

492
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,460
Look,man,you gotta understand something.

493
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,130
She was senior management.

494
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,130
It's not like we hung around the cafeteria together.

495
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,730
She stayed on her own-- look, naomi told me you people were hired by her.

496
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,430
So you look me right in the eye

497
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,860
And tell me you've never seen or heard of penelope widmore.

498
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,800
Fine.

499
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,800
You don't want to tell me the truth?

500
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,460
I'll find someone who will.

501
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,760
See,when that takes off,i'm on it.

502
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,460
He's back.

503
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,860
Where's kate?

504
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,130
She decided to stay.

505
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,130
What happened to miles?

506
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,130
I traded him. traded him?

507
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
I promised you charlotte. here she is.

508
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,860
You cheated.

509
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,960
Did i? yes,you did.

510
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,500
Lucky for you,that guy's nothing but a pain in my ass.

511
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,830
You all right?

512
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,860
All right,that gives us room for one more.

513
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,030
Charlotte?

514
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,630
Go back,with all the fun I'm having here?

515
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,660
No. I've got work to do.

516
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,760
Seat's your if you want it,daniel.

517
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,400
I--no,thank you.

518
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,000
I think I should probably just stay with charlotte.

519
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,500
All right.

520
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,930
Hey,frank.

521
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,260
Frank£¿
Frank?

522
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,730
Just--just... just one thing.

523
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,530
Just be sure

524
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,200
That you follow

525
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,200
The same exact bearing that we came in on,okay?

526
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,830
No matter what.

527
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,800
By that,i mean no matter what. just... stay on it.

528
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,230
Roger that.

529
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,430
Okay.

530
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,030
Be careful.

531
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,300
I don't have to talk you out of coming.

532
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,460
As much as I like helicopter rides,

533
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,960
I think you got this one under control.

534
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,630
Wish me luck.

535
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,060
Good luck.

536
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,700
Send me a postcard.

537
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,930
You said we have room for one more?

538
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
Yeah. why?

539
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,360
You should bring naomi home.

540
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,400
Take your shirt off.

541
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,300
Is she dead?

542
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,360
Yes.

543
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,800
Why didn't she kill you?

544
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,360
She was trying to get information from me.

545
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,900
What sort of information?

546
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,700
She wanted to know who I worked for.

547
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,730
She wanted to know about you.

548
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,430
Of course she did.

549
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,400
Are you crying because it hurts,

550
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,960
Or because you were stupid enough to care for her?

551
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,160
These people don't deserve our sympathies.

552
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,300
Need I remind you what they did

553
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,430
The last time you thought with your heart instead of your gun?

554
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,330
You used that to recruit me to killing for you.

555
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,260
Do you wanna protect your friends or not,sayid?

556
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,300
I have another name for you.

557
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,760
But they know I'm after them now.

558
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,330
Good.
