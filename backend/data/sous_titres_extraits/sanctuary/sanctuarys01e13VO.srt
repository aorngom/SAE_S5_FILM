1
00:00:00,332 --> 00:00:02,084
<i>Previously on</i> Sanctuary.

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:03,335
<i>The war has begun.</i>

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,464
<i>Abnormals in the path of the agent
are showing rapid onset</i>

4
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,966
<i>of clinical paranoia
and extreme aggression.</i>

5
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:11,260
<i>Pitting humans against abnormals,</i>

6
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,220
<i>deciding who lives and who dies.</i>

7
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:14,847
<i>The Cabal has to be stopped.</i>

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,224
It's why I started this mission
more a century ago.

9
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:21,312
Dr Watson? Not as in James Watson,
who's a member of The Five?

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,148
- Why are you here, Druitt?
- To save the world as we know it,

11
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:28,319
and, time allowing, to reassert
my superiority in our battle of wits.

12
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:32,948
Nigel Griffin is dead but his powers
passed on to his granddaughter, Clara.

13
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,328
I just know that we only have days
to stop the destruction

14
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:40,150
of every abnormal on Earth.

15
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:42,640
It may well be the source blood
could stop the disease

16
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:44,877
in the form of
a synthesized antitoxin.

17
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:47,671
- Where did Gregory hide the vial?
- The lost city of Bhalasamm

18
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:49,048
in the Indian Himalayas.

19
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:53,052
He made sure that only the five of us
acting in concert could retrieve it.

20
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:56,550
<i>Which is a bit of a problem
if, in fact, I have killed Tesla.</i>

21
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:57,905
Hello Nikola.

22
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:01,519
- It's all been destroyed.
- It's over.

23
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,479
There has to be a way
into the labyrinth.

24
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:07,233
<i>Your mother and her colleagues
will no doubt try to stop us.</i>

25
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,318
I promise you they'll fail.

26
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:13,685
They'll fail because you're going
to help us complete our plan.

27
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:20,405
Where's Henry?

28
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:22,945
Not far.

29
00:01:24,445 --> 00:01:27,419
- If you hurt him, I swear...
- Oh, we will hurt him.

30
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,420
In fact, the quality and quantity
of what remains of his life

31
00:01:30,545 --> 00:01:32,007
very much depends on you.

32
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:35,710
I'll tell you what you want.
Just let him live.

33
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:38,980
Is that who you think we are?
Killers, murderers?

34
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:42,690
That bioweapon you set off?
Not exactly charity work.

35
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:45,187
In fact that's exactly what it is.

36
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:46,897
A helping hand to the humans,

37
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:50,943
so that they can clearly see the threat
to the very survival of our species.

38
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:54,180
- You're starting a war.
- We're controlling our destiny.

39
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:57,050
Most of the abnormals out there
are peaceful. They aren't a threat.

40
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:59,827
Every abnormal we don't control
is a threat, Ashley,

41
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:02,535
despite your mother's propaganda.

42
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:06,000
How many so-called peaceful
abnormals have you destroyed?

43
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:10,445
You know,

44
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:13,815
I like your mother.

45
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,010
There was a time I even admired her.

46
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:18,600
But we're fighting for
humanity's survival

47
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:20,681
and she's chosen the wrong side.

48
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:23,935
Are you ready to choose yours?

49
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,895
The Team Projet-SG

50
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,188
presents:

51
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,400
Sanctuary - Season 1 Episode 13
Revelations - Part 2 (v. 1.00)

52
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,904
Timing by: Arrow,
nitrogenc, Salomon

53
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:55,048
http://projet-sg.net

54
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,885
Where's the amazing lost city?

55
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:02,635
The temples, the archives...

56
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:04,933
A decent restroom?

57
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,190
It's gone.

58
00:03:06,315 --> 00:03:07,875
Destroyed long ago.

59
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,140
By the age of
this vegetation, I'd say,

60
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:13,984
- I don't know, 50, 60 years?
- 100 years,

61
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:16,510
<i>if the growth pattern of this header
is any indication.</i>

62
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:17,915
Destroyed how?

63
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:20,985
Looks like some sort of
massive bombing.

64
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:23,200
It couldn't have been
from the air, though.

65
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:26,700
There were no planes that could carry
that kind of ordnance hundred years ago.

66
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:28,916
Four days
of constant bombardment.

67
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:32,002
Hundreds of men,
their heaviest weaponry.

68
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:35,047
Cannon placements
there and there.

69
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,560
Long and short range.

70
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,719
Likely a combined effort between
Russian, French and Spanish forces.

71
00:03:41,165 --> 00:03:43,900
I thought by that point in history,
all the vampires were wiped out.

72
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:44,931
They were.

73
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,768
They retreated here to preserve
what was left of their culture.

74
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:50,854
They'd been culled to within
a hair's breath of extinction.

75
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,981
They weren't a threat
to anyone.

76
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:54,380
This was a slaughter.

77
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:56,350
Gregory's instructions
mentioned

78
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:58,580
a hall of records
as a starting point.

79
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,405
They also mentioned a city,

80
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:01,915
fully intact.

81
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:05,550
For all we know, the caverns below
have been destroyed as well.

82
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:08,080
Sorry, John, are you suggesting
that we just give up?

83
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:10,123
Oh, don't bait me.
I'm not in the mood.

84
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:14,540
Perhaps if we were looking for
some nubile lady of the night

85
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:16,280
for you to slaughter,

86
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:19,710
then you'd suddenly perk up
and become incredibly helpful!

87
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:21,535
Gentlemen, enough.

88
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:25,245
Good work, old boy.

89
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:28,105
Another test of my loyalty.

90
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:30,035
Just checking.

91
00:04:44,135 --> 00:04:45,659
What do you want from me?

92
00:04:47,735 --> 00:04:48,845
Talk to me!

93
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:52,335
How long have you known
of your condition?

94
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:54,125
It's not a condition.

95
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,379
Do you know the exact geographical
region where you were found?

96
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:01,410
What kind of treatments has
Dr. Magnus prescribed for you?

97
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,440
Can you elaborate
on their effectiveness?

98
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:05,955
Length of transformative episodes?

99
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:07,855
What are you doing?

100
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,977
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Don't! Don't!

101
00:05:13,425 --> 00:05:15,647
We simply want to
help you get better.

102
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,395
I'm not sick.

103
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:19,360
This is not a condition!

104
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,862
You are a class nine
hyper-accelerated protean lifeform.

105
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,195
Fairly rare,

106
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,960
as is the control you seem to possess
over mutative stress triggers.

107
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:30,195
No, please.

108
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:33,210
You do not want to make that happen.

109
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,709
On the contrary, we very much do,

110
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:39,085
although I can understand
why you would resist.

111
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:44,050
- I am not ashamed of who I am.
- I certainly hope not,

112
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:47,775
because we intend to bring out
your alter ego permanently.

113
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,307
The knowledge we gain from you
will be invaluable.

114
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:54,019
Your kind have been hiding in
the shadows for far too long, Mr. Foss.

115
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:57,105
We're going to...

116
00:05:57,435 --> 00:05:59,232
... bring you out into the light.

117
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:08,015
Anything?

118
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:09,760
Nothing for miles.

119
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:12,130
No other entrances to the mountain.

120
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:13,371
It'll be dark soon.

121
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:15,540
We should head back
and start fresh tomorrow.

122
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:17,000
No, no, no, you go.

123
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:18,752
Yeah, I'm staying too.

124
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:21,254
There has to be something,
a sense of...

125
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,145
Scale.
Yeah, exactly.

126
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:28,636
- There.
- What?

127
00:06:30,785 --> 00:06:33,030
I know it's from a distance, but...

128
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:36,853
the location of this central ziggurat
should be that area right there.

129
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:41,035
Assuming the city
was built around it, absolutely.

130
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,782
Which mean that
the hall of records is located...

131
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,095
27 meters southeast
of our current position.

132
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:06,257
This is the main thoroughfare,
the central meeting hall.

133
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,926
It's the wall defenses,

134
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:10,155
and the hall of records.

135
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:13,348
It took me a while
to locate the right markers.

136
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:17,280
You totally got that.
You saw everything.

137
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:21,022
- Very clearly, Will, very clearly.
- Well, then, let's have at it.

138
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,245
Time.

139
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:27,810
You factored in time.

140
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:30,410
The shifting architectural patterns
as the city grew.

141
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:32,425
Time is a constant, Will.

142
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,960
All visual clues have to be measured
against multiple parameters,

143
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:39,475
time often being the most telling.

144
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:41,600
Like another dimension.

145
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:45,620
Yeah, it's just one of many, and once
you understand the way they interact,

146
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:48,758
you'll find that very few mysteries
will confound you.

147
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:53,265
- Man, that is killer stuff.
- Yes, I've always thought so.

148
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:55,865
Are you certain?

149
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,550
This should be the main foyer
for the Bhalasaam hall of records.

150
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:03,470
My father's instructions mentioned
a passageway or corridor

151
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:05,358
leading to
subterranean caverns below.

152
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,026
We have no idea

153
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,363
what the original interior
of this building looked like...

154
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:13,199
Let alone where
an access point may be.

155
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:31,134
Well done.

156
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:35,655
I'm seriously geeking out right now.

157
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:37,225
As am I.

158
00:08:58,235 --> 00:09:02,125
Why would the vampires build a cavern
beneath a hidden city?

159
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,975
It seems kind of redundant,
don't you think?

160
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:09,590
Even though they were the conquerors,
the rulers, the overlords,

161
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,495
they advanced civilization
by centuries.

162
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:16,180
Their knowledge, their technology,
was far more advanced

163
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,600
than anyone could have
imagined back then.

164
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,445
So they kept their secrets
well hidden.

165
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:25,635
Well, they knew the world
had turned against them, John.

166
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:30,335
They would have calculated
for the possibility that...

167
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:33,975
Bhalasaam might one day be found

168
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:35,950
and pillaged.

169
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,995
Lest their wealth of knowledge
fall into the wrong hands.

170
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:43,145
Miss me?

171
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:53,007
I know he's difficult to kill,
but I'm sure there are ways.

172
00:09:53,645 --> 00:09:56,135
Is that before or after
you retrieve the blood?

173
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,720
Because frankly,

174
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,538
good luck with that if I'm dead.
You know,

175
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:02,720
you can't do it without me.

176
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:03,945
Nice move

177
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:06,479
last time we met, Johnny.

178
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,660
- It took me a while to get over it.
- Not long enough, old boy.

179
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:14,445
- Care for another helping?
- What are you doing here, Nikola?

180
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:22,286
Isn't it obvious?

181
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,499
The Cabal want to turn the world into
a war zone. Only the blood can stop it.

182
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,877
Yes, I do keep abreast
of current events, thank you.

183
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:32,590
Yet you refused to answer
any of our communiques.

184
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,715
My dear James.
You're looking... older.

185
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:38,800
- Feeling your age?
- Ever the gentlemen, I see.

186
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:40,136
And what have we here?

187
00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:44,850
I'm guessing that one of you must be
a blood relative of Nigel Griffin,

188
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:47,770
otherwise why would you have been
brought here? I hope you're up to this.

189
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,300
- Damn straight I am, skinny.
- You, I like.

190
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:53,255
- You, I don't know.
- I'm Dr. Zimmerman.

191
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:56,065
- I work with Dr. Magnus.
- A protégé.

192
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:00,110
The mission's necessary
disposable item...

193
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:01,635
Stop this, Nikola.

194
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,090
You know what we're facing.
Why not make contact?

195
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:06,038
Firstly, I prefer to work alone.

196
00:11:06,235 --> 00:11:10,084
Secondly, I don't trust any of you
any more than you trust me.

197
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:13,010
That's why I skipped
the orientation part of the tour.

198
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:15,200
- How did you get here?
- There's another entrance,

199
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:19,045
far side of the mountain, just have
to know where to look, which I do.

200
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:20,725
Now, follow me.

201
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:24,825
Magnificent, isn't it?

202
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,765
All that remains of my ancestors.

203
00:11:28,065 --> 00:11:29,175
Their work.

204
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:33,295
10,000 years of knowledge and power,

205
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:35,515
hidden from the world.

206
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:38,525
You've been coming here
for decades, haven't you?

207
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,440
This is where you got the idea
to revive vampires as a race.

208
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:42,665
Your father,

209
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:44,868
he did his job well.

210
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:47,275
Despite my best efforts,

211
00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:49,920
we can only retrieve the blood
as one.

212
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:52,130
- None of us can do it alone.
- Tell me, Nikola,

213
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:55,390
if we do succeed, will you actually
allow us to take it away?

214
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,375
We all know you have
such wonderful designs for it,

215
00:11:58,565 --> 00:12:01,340
an army of newborn vampires
being just the start.

216
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:04,135
I may want to see
my ancestors reborn,

217
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:07,516
but that can't happen if the abnormals
become a global threat to humans.

218
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:11,562
None of us could withstand
the chaos that that would bring.

219
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:15,645
But tell me, John,

220
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,445
are the rest of us to trust you
once all is said and done?

221
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,430
You, who once put your own daughter
in harm's way

222
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:24,241
for just a drop of Helen's blood?

223
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:26,485
Oh, yes.

224
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:29,320
Having that vial all to yourself
would certainly solve

225
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:32,325
your health problems
for a long time,

226
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,060
wouldn't it?

227
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:36,855
Gentlemen...
We are here for a reason.

228
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:41,795
- Lives are at stake.
- This way.

229
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:48,225
Thank you.

230
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,100
What the hell was all that about?

231
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:57,165
Well, the guy who invented radio
just dissed Jack the Ripper.

232
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:02,130
What are you doing, Dana?

233
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:04,955
You haven't asked me
one real question yet.

234
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:10,954
We have a lot more to discuss,
so please...

235
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:17,961
If I wanted you dead, there are more
effective ways than a poisoned drink.

236
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:25,905
I want to see Henry.

237
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:27,471
Now.

238
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:32,615
I assure you, he's fine.

239
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:38,105
Satisfied?

240
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:55,123
Thank you. I'd like to keep you
alert and cooperative.

241
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:57,083
Well, one out of two ain't bad.

242
00:13:57,935 --> 00:13:59,544
If you put a truth serum in this,

243
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:02,445
I will do a tap routine
on this floor

244
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:04,895
rather than tell you anything.

245
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:09,012
To tell you the truth, I'm a terrible
poker player. I never bluff.

246
00:14:09,335 --> 00:14:10,945
As for what we want,

247
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,641
information's not the only thing,

248
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:16,675
not when you have
so much more to offer us.

249
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:44,325
It won't work.

250
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,717
You've been off your medication
for almost a day.

251
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:50,110
The safeguards
have left your system.

252
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:53,360
The pain you feel will end
when you stop resisting the change

253
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:56,870
- to your natural state.
- No, if I change, you'll kill me.

254
00:14:56,995 --> 00:15:00,230
True, but we'll have learned
so much in the process.

255
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:04,845
This will be a noble end for you.

256
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,654
Think of it as an organ donation
after your death.

257
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:12,345
What we learn from your alter-ego
may eventually save lives.

258
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:15,045
Another 10 cc's.

259
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,155
This place goes on forever.

260
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,375
It's a labyrinth.

261
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:31,260
It's designed to keep valuable secrets
from those who would steal them.

262
00:15:31,385 --> 00:15:33,605
- Was that aimed at me?
- Yes.

263
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:55,705
Some sort of a numeric code.

264
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:58,035
My mother's birthday.

265
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:01,755
My father's favorite password.

266
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:14,721
- It's his handwriting.
- Latin?

267
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:16,380
His favorite language.

268
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:19,315
It's a caveat,
addressed to all five of us.

269
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:23,410
A warning that the blood should only
be sought by all of us, or not at all.

270
00:16:23,535 --> 00:16:25,189
Only for the most
altruistic reasons.

271
00:16:25,357 --> 00:16:28,318
Saving civilization from global chaos
and war seems worthy,

272
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:30,155
but he's your father.

273
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:32,280
It's a map of the labyrinth.

274
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,580
Look, there's five notations here.

275
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:35,909
Yes, five tests.

276
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:38,202
Each has one of our names beside it.

277
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,980
What kind of tests?

278
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:42,370
Designed specifically
for each of our gifts.

279
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,292
Impenetrable to anyone else.

280
00:16:45,385 --> 00:16:47,710
My father knew that
in order to prevent any one of us

281
00:16:47,835 --> 00:16:49,660
from trying to access
the blood alone,

282
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:53,410
he had to use the technology vampires
left behind to safeguard their secrets.

283
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:56,262
- Even you couldn't find a way around.
- I know. Nervous yet?

284
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,490
And at the end of each test
there's a key.

285
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:01,559
- Once we have the five keys...
- We can access the vial.

286
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:05,563
My father loved the metaphor of keys.
As symbols for the unlocking of secrets.

287
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:09,567
We can assume that none of these tasks
will be simple and easy?

288
00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:11,710
Knowing my father, absolutely.

289
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:13,112
- May I?
- Oh, yes.

290
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:20,015
Will, take Clara to Griffin's test.
That's here.

291
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:23,247
Watson, yours and John's markers
are close together,

292
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:25,440
down there.
Work as a team.

293
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:28,250
- We'll meet back here with our keys.
- That leaves you and...

294
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,650
Nikola. Your tests are marked
for the same area.

295
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:33,466
I guess your father liked us
best as a couple.

296
00:17:35,565 --> 00:17:37,178
- If you can wait...
- ll be fine.

297
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:38,715
Such chivalry.

298
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:43,225
If any harm comes to her,

299
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,890
accidental or otherwise...

300
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:48,480
I have no reason to do her any harm,
but you...

301
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:50,441
I'm finding more reasons
by the minute.

302
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:51,750
Honestly...

303
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,568
I am surrounded by adolescents.

304
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:02,045
Let's go.

305
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:23,285
Seems we go down this way.

306
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:35,115
This room was marked "Griffin".

307
00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:43,125
Doesn't seem so bad.

308
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:54,535
Okay, this is bad.

309
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:04,215
I believe this is our stop.

310
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:09,855
Two Latin inscriptions almost...

311
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:12,045
... identical in meaning.

312
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:15,355
Almost?

313
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:16,986
"Truth lies".

314
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:18,863
"Lies truth".

315
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,908
A slightly different turn of phrase.

316
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,145
Both doors

317
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:28,705
apparently with no means
of opening them, and yet,

318
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:31,855
behind each of these doors lies

319
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:33,315
our keys,

320
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:35,740
- logically.
- Logically.

321
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:37,145
Both our names

322
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:39,230
were set for these doors,

323
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:41,635
which implies that Gregory
intended for us to work together.

324
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:45,065
So we cannot retrieve
one without the other?

325
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,160
Putting the analytical genius

326
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:52,146
and the cold-blooded killer
in the same place.

327
00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:56,340
There must be a reason
beyond cruel irony.

328
00:19:56,465 --> 00:20:00,465
When he designed this, he knew us
as friends, James, not as enemies.

329
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,830
- It was before I...
- Yes, yes.

330
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:08,412
Doors that won't open,

331
00:20:09,745 --> 00:20:10,831
yet their shape...

332
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:14,335
They suggest
something exists beyond,

333
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:15,930
a chamber, perhaps.

334
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:19,455
Which I alone could access,
but which door do we believe?

335
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,261
Perhaps both?
Neither?

336
00:20:26,245 --> 00:20:28,390
I don't know,
but I am convinced of one thing...

337
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:32,455
If we choose wrongly,
and you teleport behind the wrong door,

338
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:36,690
I'm sure you will find...
solid rock.

339
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,115
Well, then.

340
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:43,275
We'd best choose carefully...

341
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:46,408
Old friend.

342
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:59,305
- This is insane.
- No, no, it makes sense.

343
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:01,570
Whenever light reflects off
anything visible,

344
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:04,045
- we lose ground.
- Yeah, literally.

345
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:08,480
So all you have to do is make it from
here to there without casting a shadow,

346
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:10,933
and we'll get the key.
You can do this.

347
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:15,805
No, I can't.

348
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:18,750
Clara, this is just adrenaline
triggering anxiety in your brain.

349
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,194
You got to take the focus off yourself,
forget everything except for the goal.

350
00:21:22,362 --> 00:21:23,779
Yeah? How?

351
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:26,810
Well, how did you focus
when you used to steal?

352
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:29,576
I'd...
I'd picture the store clerk naked.

353
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:33,770
- It helped me not feel so...
- Vulnerable, perfect. Okay, so...

354
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:35,245
picture me naked.

355
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:43,420
- It's not working.
- You've done this a thousand times.

356
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:45,830
We're in a labyrinth,
in the Himalayas.

357
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:47,895
I am going to die here.

358
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:49,555
Look at me, look at me.

359
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:51,640
What can I do to help?

360
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:57,275
Well, if I have to do it,
so should you.

361
00:22:00,095 --> 00:22:02,665
What? Well, people can see me.

362
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:07,125
You can see me. That's not fair.
I mean, that... I shouldn't have to...

363
00:22:14,414 --> 00:22:15,645
Okay, fine.

364
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:20,895
This is ridiculous.

365
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:30,012
Satisfied?

366
00:22:31,135 --> 00:22:32,135
Clara?

367
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:35,285
Don't drop my clothes.

368
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:38,895
Sorry.

369
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:46,955
- Your test.
- Yeah.

370
00:22:47,435 --> 00:22:49,750
You said you tried to steal
the blood once before.

371
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,784
- It means you've already done the test.
- No, I tried to steal it.

372
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:55,537
I never succeeded
in actually getting the key.

373
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:00,615
You're afraid.

374
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:04,015
Your father managed
to rig this tunnel here

375
00:23:04,405 --> 00:23:06,923
with a massive geomagnetic current.

376
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:09,340
Voltage derived
directly from the Earth.

377
00:23:09,465 --> 00:23:12,390
Do you have any idea
how much electricity that is?

378
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:14,515
He knew you were hard to kill.

379
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:16,266
Well, this just might do it.

380
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:01,285
Awesome.

381
00:24:46,975 --> 00:24:50,402
- Your father really didn't like me, no?
- You're an acquired taste.

382
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:01,175
The seventh girl you murdered,

383
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:06,735
April 1888, they found her body
under a bridge near Wapping.

384
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,670
Why move her from Whitechapel?

385
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,798
It's tormented me.

386
00:25:12,575 --> 00:25:16,575
Why taint your calling card?
Why change the rules?

387
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,222
I remember...

388
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,610
I asked your opinion

389
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:24,727
at the time over brandys
at the Reform Club, and you said:

390
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:29,925
"Perhaps the old boy is losing
his taste for the sport".

391
00:25:31,877 --> 00:25:32,777
Were you?

392
00:25:35,345 --> 00:25:37,515
My actions were not of my own,

393
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:41,545
but thrust upon me...

394
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:45,039
By an irresistible force.

395
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:54,424
It must've been the blow to your ego
when you finally learned the truth.

396
00:25:54,592 --> 00:25:58,592
It was not just that I failed
to see the clues laid out before me.

397
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:02,807
It was that it was you, John.

398
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,825
For God's sake...

399
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:08,615
It was you!

400
00:26:12,465 --> 00:26:15,540
Veritas iacet. "Truth lies".

401
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:18,364
Lacet veritas. "Lies truth".

402
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:22,110
Now, the subtle but vital difference

403
00:26:22,235 --> 00:26:26,050
is that this epigram
translates as "lies buried",

404
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:28,345
as in "dead".
Whereas this...

405
00:26:29,185 --> 00:26:31,590
This means "lies at rest",

406
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,713
a much more benign expression,

407
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:37,325
and thus it follows
that we must choose between life...

408
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:39,645
... and death.

409
00:26:41,071 --> 00:26:41,971
That's it?

410
00:26:42,595 --> 00:26:44,098
That's your unassailable logic?

411
00:26:44,355 --> 00:26:46,310
Gregory and I
shared a passion for Latin.

412
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:48,650
It follows
that he would hide the clues

413
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,521
in the subtleties of the language.

414
00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:53,515
So...

415
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,449
Either a chamber lies beyond that,

416
00:26:58,574 --> 00:27:00,264
or a perfect chance

417
00:27:00,615 --> 00:27:03,615
for you to exact your revenge
for my...

418
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:04,975
past actions.

419
00:27:08,675 --> 00:27:10,895
Care to reconsider your choice?

420
00:27:28,435 --> 00:27:29,815
The second key

421
00:27:30,195 --> 00:27:33,064
is undoubtedly within the second door.
Indeed, this key may

422
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:35,355
unlock it outright...

423
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:41,113
In which case,
you might leave me here to die.

424
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:44,825
Yes.

425
00:27:46,435 --> 00:27:47,435
I might.

426
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:52,333
Well, why don't you?

427
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:55,825
Well, as I once said...

428
00:27:57,925 --> 00:27:59,925
I have lost the taste

429
00:28:00,835 --> 00:28:02,093
for the sport.

430
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:21,295
Release the first key,

431
00:28:22,465 --> 00:28:24,615
the second is freed as well.

432
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:29,735
- Elementary, my dear Watson.
- Shut up.

433
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:36,544
There should be adequate
cellular penetration by now.

434
00:28:37,105 --> 00:28:39,555
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

435
00:28:44,345 --> 00:28:45,625
You may begin.

436
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:52,975
Cut the power.

437
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:55,505
Thought you didn't bluff, Dana?

438
00:28:57,545 --> 00:29:00,595
It has been an absolute pleasure
talking with you.

439
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:02,745
I wish we had more time,

440
00:29:03,015 --> 00:29:04,530
but it's time to say goodbye.

441
00:29:05,855 --> 00:29:08,885
- What did you do to me?
- What we had to.

442
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:12,329
Turns out it actually was
as simple as quenching your thirst,

443
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:15,207
and I'm afraid I did lie to you.

444
00:29:16,575 --> 00:29:18,965
You're going to die today, Ashley.

445
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:42,595
You felt...

446
00:29:43,295 --> 00:29:45,487
Genuine concern for me.

447
00:29:45,755 --> 00:29:46,855
Admit it.

448
00:29:47,615 --> 00:29:48,715
Nonsense.

449
00:29:49,735 --> 00:29:53,685
- You still like me, it's so obvious.
- You tried to kill me.

450
00:29:54,715 --> 00:29:58,167
But, you know,
we all hurt the ones we love.

451
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:02,504
Your turn.

452
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:14,040
- Clara, don't stop.
- I can't do this, Will.

453
00:30:14,165 --> 00:30:16,518
- You're almost there.
- This is crazy!

454
00:30:25,445 --> 00:30:26,987
- Just keep going.
- I can't!

455
00:30:27,155 --> 00:30:30,370
Focus on the goal! Don't think about
anything else! It's just a key.

456
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,165
- This is crazy!
- You're doing great.

457
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:16,328
- Not much of a test.
- You're a total daddy's girl.

458
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:18,645
Helen!

459
00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:26,525
All right, father.

460
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:36,098
"Two by two".

461
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:37,635
All right.

462
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:48,145
Keep going!
You're doing fine!

463
00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:54,410
I've got it!

464
00:31:54,535 --> 00:31:58,036
Come on! We don't have a lot of time,
so bring it back!

465
00:31:58,665 --> 00:32:00,455
Two times two, two plus two,

466
00:32:00,623 --> 00:32:03,208
two to the power of two,
and therefore four.

467
00:32:04,385 --> 00:32:05,544
That is too easy.

468
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,255
Will, I can't make it across!

469
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:11,240
You're going to have to jump!
All right? Just don't think about it!

470
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:12,592
You got to jump!

471
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:17,585
Come on!
Come on!

472
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:21,725
- Where are you?
- Will, come on!

473
00:32:23,135 --> 00:32:24,370
Two by two.

474
00:32:24,495 --> 00:32:25,855
Two by two...

475
00:32:27,755 --> 00:32:30,475
It's not an equation.
It's a reference.

476
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:33,015
Noah's ark, right?

477
00:32:33,355 --> 00:32:35,740
Your favorite metaphor
for your work.

478
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:37,185
All right.

479
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:41,205
So, what's the permutations
of abnormal life?

480
00:32:43,015 --> 00:32:44,405
They're endless.

481
00:32:45,235 --> 00:32:46,535
Therefore...

482
00:32:48,195 --> 00:32:49,505
It's infinity.

483
00:32:53,225 --> 00:32:55,265
All right, infinity.

484
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:07,875
Thank you.

485
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:16,695
Nice, but I think
somebody must have screwed up.

486
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:22,195
Bloody hell!

487
00:33:24,805 --> 00:33:26,583
Move your legs, old man!

488
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,065
She was right with me.

489
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:38,075
Relax, Will, I'm right here.

490
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:42,590
I asked you not to drop my clothes,
and look, they're filthy.

491
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:44,055
Nice job, Will.

492
00:33:44,602 --> 00:33:45,775
Interesting.

493
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:48,021
Well done, William.

494
00:33:48,455 --> 00:33:49,655
Thanks.

495
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,825
Where's Helen?

496
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:06,595
Well done...

497
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:09,105
Shall we?

498
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:30,215
There is something.

499
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:36,319
Finally.

500
00:34:42,335 --> 00:34:45,245
- I haven't seen this in a while.
- Is that it? That's the blood?

501
00:34:46,035 --> 00:34:48,615
The power in that vial...

502
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:52,355
It could change history.

503
00:34:52,985 --> 00:34:55,463
Create any kind of future we choose.

504
00:34:55,631 --> 00:34:57,470
- "We"?
- Don't worry.

505
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,645
I intend to see this through...

506
00:35:00,405 --> 00:35:02,025
Antivirus and all.

507
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:12,375
Oh, my God...

508
00:35:13,385 --> 00:35:14,575
What happened?

509
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:17,819
The inevitable, I'm afraid.

510
00:35:17,987 --> 00:35:20,071
The suit, it stopped working.

511
00:35:20,925 --> 00:35:23,615
It's been failing for some time.
It hasn't...

512
00:35:23,845 --> 00:35:26,327
really worked
since we left the Sanctuary.

513
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,045
I knew...

514
00:35:29,305 --> 00:35:32,060
This was a mission
I would not return from,

515
00:35:32,185 --> 00:35:35,878
and it was worth
one last challenge, Helen.

516
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:53,265
You I shall miss.

517
00:36:02,823 --> 00:36:03,823
There...

518
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:06,520
There is something
that we are not seeing.

519
00:36:06,645 --> 00:36:07,827
This was too easy.

520
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:10,110
There is something else

521
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:13,535
happening, something going on
that we're not seeing.

522
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:17,365
You must find the missing piece.

523
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:21,075
What? What is it?

524
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:23,225
What's the missing piece?

525
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,005
Find it.

526
00:36:56,805 --> 00:36:59,128
Stay down.
It's me. It's Henry.

527
00:36:59,575 --> 00:37:01,810
It's Henry.
We're almost there.

528
00:37:01,935 --> 00:37:03,520
Listen, are you okay?

529
00:37:03,645 --> 00:37:05,895
You were out cold when I found you.

530
00:37:06,835 --> 00:37:08,665
- I need a gun.
- Here.

531
00:37:10,555 --> 00:37:12,400
Cell phone.
Awesome.

532
00:37:12,525 --> 00:37:13,525
This way.

533
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:16,900
- What happened to you?
- I don't want to talk about it. You?

534
00:37:17,025 --> 00:37:19,200
- Me neither.
- What about the codes for Lazarus?

535
00:37:19,325 --> 00:37:20,425
I'm on it.

536
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:23,950
I found a network interface
in this lab here.

537
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,405
Rock star.

538
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:39,794
Anything?

539
00:37:39,962 --> 00:37:43,735
There's a whole data encryption package
here. Looks like a lot of code.

540
00:37:44,655 --> 00:37:47,200
One of them should control
the dispersal unit remotely.

541
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:50,596
I'm going to download the whole file
to a jump drive.

542
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:53,682
- How long?
- Just need a couple more seconds.

543
00:37:54,595 --> 00:37:56,310
Mom, we're ready for dust-off.

544
00:37:56,478 --> 00:37:58,610
<i>- Trace this cell signal?
- Good. Stand by.</i>

545
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,148
Come on, come on, come on...

546
00:38:01,316 --> 00:38:02,316
I got it.

547
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:04,068
Easy-peasy.
Let's roll.

548
00:38:15,475 --> 00:38:17,365
This is so not good, Ash.

549
00:38:17,735 --> 00:38:19,885
Just give him a few more seconds.

550
00:38:25,007 --> 00:38:26,607
Hey, mom...

551
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:28,551
It was good timing.

552
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:32,435
Thank you.

553
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:38,135
Crap.

554
00:38:39,605 --> 00:38:41,495
Get her to the infirmary.

555
00:38:43,025 --> 00:38:45,210
- What the hell happened to her?
- I don't know.

556
00:38:45,335 --> 00:38:47,335
We were separated a long time.

557
00:38:53,675 --> 00:38:55,825
See, you're supposed to say,

558
00:38:56,155 --> 00:38:58,455
"Hey, Clara, you did great.

559
00:38:58,605 --> 00:39:00,575
"Way to conquer your fears."

560
00:39:00,985 --> 00:39:02,535
I'm sorry, I'm just...

561
00:39:03,145 --> 00:39:04,645
thinking about stuff.

562
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:06,725
You did do great.

563
00:39:08,255 --> 00:39:10,405
Thanks for taking off your pants.

564
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,515
You never have to thank me for that.

565
00:39:16,925 --> 00:39:19,065
I can't believe this place.

566
00:39:20,665 --> 00:39:23,165
I thought I was a one-off.
A freak.

567
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:30,185
Clara, why don't you stay here?

568
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:33,440
I mean, just for a while,
just to see what it's like

569
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:35,265
to be part of something.

570
00:39:36,325 --> 00:39:39,825
Yeah, I don't know.
Being connected to...

571
00:39:40,095 --> 00:39:41,405
places and...

572
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:42,855
people...

573
00:39:43,165 --> 00:39:44,877
It's not really my style.

574
00:39:45,275 --> 00:39:48,295
That's because neither was accepting
of who you are.

575
00:39:48,745 --> 00:39:50,575
I think that's gonna change.

576
00:40:02,445 --> 00:40:03,687
I had to do that.

577
00:40:06,555 --> 00:40:09,055
The view is just way too romantic.

578
00:40:10,895 --> 00:40:12,595
Yeah, I know what you mean.

579
00:40:16,225 --> 00:40:17,375
How is she?

580
00:40:19,905 --> 00:40:21,405
She's unconscious.

581
00:40:22,535 --> 00:40:24,035
Something's wrong.

582
00:40:24,415 --> 00:40:26,610
Her blood pressure's elevated.
I need to run more tests.

583
00:40:26,735 --> 00:40:28,735
They've done something to her.

584
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:31,655
She'll be all right, John.

585
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:33,675
She's strong.

586
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:38,155
I'd like to stay close,
if you don't mind.

587
00:40:40,725 --> 00:40:41,785
Of course.

588
00:40:47,135 --> 00:40:48,135
Thank you.

589
00:41:02,355 --> 00:41:03,705
<i>What is it, Will?</i>

590
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:07,225
Something Watson said
before he died.

591
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:10,520
About it all being too easy,
that we'd missed something.

592
00:41:10,645 --> 00:41:13,090
We got the blood.
It seems like a win to me.

593
00:41:13,215 --> 00:41:14,385
Yeah, but...

594
00:41:15,155 --> 00:41:17,765
I just can't shake the feeling
that he's right,

595
00:41:17,965 --> 00:41:21,175
that there's something else going on
that we just can't see.

596
00:41:25,825 --> 00:41:27,575
I have to talk to Magnus.

597
00:41:42,665 --> 00:41:43,765
What...

598
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:53,615
Doc, the drive we brought back,
it's all fakey ghost data.

599
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,740
There's no codes, there's no info,
there's nothing we can use. Doc?

600
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:02,850
Isn't this just like you, John.

601
00:42:02,975 --> 00:42:05,934
Steal what we need the most,
and then stick around to gloat about it.

602
00:42:06,102 --> 00:42:08,205
I have been here the whole time.

603
00:42:25,775 --> 00:42:28,105
The whole thing, it was a set-up.

604
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:30,655
Something else is going on.

605
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:33,415
We're too late.

606
00:42:56,535 --> 00:42:58,040
Thank you, Ashley.

607
00:42:58,165 --> 00:43:00,955
You've been everything
we could have hoped for.

608
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:03,775
Welcome to your rebirth.
