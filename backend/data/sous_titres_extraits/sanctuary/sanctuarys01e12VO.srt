1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,667
<i>Previously on Sanctuary...</i>

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,461
We were a part of something,

3
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:05,421
something we called "the Five,"

4
00:00:05,546 --> 00:00:08,549
a small group dedicated to expanding
our knowledge of the physical world.

5
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:10,259
Your mother was able to procure

6
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:11,844
a very rare sample

7
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,639
of ancient untainted vampire blood,

8
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:18,434
blood that supposedly possessed
miraculous properties.

9
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:20,269
After each of us was injected,

10
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:23,022
we received unique gifts
as a result.

11
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,939
Griffin's molecules
became photosensitive.

12
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:27,652
Watson's mind grew to new heights,

13
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:30,863
and Tesla's reaction
was the most dramatic.

14
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:35,076
Your name is Gregory Magnus,
and you're my father.

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,535
You were the leading
scientific light of your day.

16
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,707
The Cabal are a powerful
shadow organization bent on

17
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:44,250
controlling all abnormal life
on the planet.

18
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:47,255
They threaten
everything we stand for.

19
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:56,574
Roy...

20
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:59,452
You scared the living crap
out of me.

21
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,205
Did Jack swing by
and return your boat?

22
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:04,457
He should've been back by now.

23
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,461
What's going on?

24
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,756
Are you feeling all right?

25
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,758
Yeah.

26
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:16,552
I'm okay.

27
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,761
What are you doing?
Roy...

28
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,557
It's me. George.

29
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:24,934
The Team Projet-SG

30
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,644
presents:

31
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,857
Sanctuary - Season 1 Episode 12
Revelations - Part 1 (v. 1.00)

32
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:34,360
Timing by: Kujathemas,
nitrogenc, Salomon.

33
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,589
http://projet-sg.net

34
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:03,349
We thought these reports of sudden,
unexplained violent behavior

35
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,893
among abnormals,
were isolated incidents,

36
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:09,021
but Henry's data analysis
clearly tells us otherwise.

37
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:11,482
It's getting hairy.
Those yellow clusters,

38
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:14,902
63 incidents in the last five days,
almost all of them against humans.

39
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:16,528
There's 20 dead so far.

40
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,323
These aren't exactly
high-population centers.

41
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:21,992
- The Yukon-Alaskan border?
- What's particularly troubling

42
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:23,702
is the pattern of distribution,

43
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:27,456
starting in the north at Mount Logan
and then following the upper airstream.

44
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:30,417
How could this abnormal-on-normal
violence be following the wind?

45
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,087
- Unless it's something in the air.
- My worry is what happens

46
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,881
when it reaches population centers.
Abnormals surfacing

47
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:38,592
in significant numbers
will undoubtedly trigger reprisals.

48
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,511
You think it could be insect-borne?

49
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:42,638
Given the cold climate,
it seems unlikely,

50
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:44,765
but certainly
a pathogen could be involved.

51
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,142
Viruses have been known
to cause mass psychosis.

52
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:51,021
What we need to find out is whether this
was a naturally occurring phenomenon,

53
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:53,857
or something
that was intentionally released.

54
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:12,124
Not often I use a front door.

55
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:14,503
Quite the novelty.

56
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,756
You're not welcome here, Druitt.

57
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:19,258
You know that.

58
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:21,802
I bring critical information,
my hirsute friend,

59
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:24,136
about the troubles in the north.

60
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:52,625
Forgive my skepticism, John,

61
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,878
but your history of altruism
is just behind a scorpion's.

62
00:04:56,003 --> 00:05:00,174
Had I not dispatched Tesla, your reign
over the Sanctuary may well have ended.

63
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:03,467
- Why is he here?
- Please. I am your father.

64
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,722
Then you should start acting like one,
and that does not mean kidnapping me

65
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:10,559
- when you spend some quality time.
- That is part of why I'm here.

66
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,812
I'm guessing it's not about
visitation rights.

67
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:15,606
You have frostbite.

68
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:18,732
It's certainly no reflection
on your hospitality.

69
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:22,696
- Perhaps you can guess where I've been.
- The Yukon.

70
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:26,533
I saw the carnage first-hand.

71
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,577
Traced the epidemic...

72
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:30,661
To its origins.

73
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,871
Mount Logan.

74
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,377
Not to worry.

75
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,797
It's all been sealed to proper
BSL-3 protocols. Et cetera, et cetera.

76
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,758
I wasn't aware that epidemiology
was one of your specialties.

77
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,012
Well, that's why I've come to you.

78
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:49,221
I found these fragments

79
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,016
at ground zero,

80
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:55,646
and I believe you, Mr. Foss,
will find these of particular interest.

81
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,651
These look like fragments
from a dispersal mechanism.

82
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:06,615
Henry, prepare a level-three
residential cell for introduction

83
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,493
- of a possible bio-hazard.
- Better than some I've been called.

84
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:11,702
What's the point?
He will teleport out of there.

85
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,707
- I give you my assurances I will not.
- Let me back up those assurances

86
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,793
with an EM-shield.
You teleport, you die.

87
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,628
Are we supposed to believe that
you came here to fight the outbreak?

88
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:23,257
The war has begun.

89
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,427
Humans versus abnormals,

90
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:29,305
and I will not stand idly by

91
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,308
while the Cabal imposes its chaos.

92
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,775
Well, John was right
about one thing.

93
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,612
His body shows no presence
of any viral or bacterial anomaly.

94
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,946
Fortunately, neither do any of ours.

95
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:51,285
- You want to take him out of isolation?
- I think we should wait for a bit.

96
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,662
There might be a latency factor
that we should allow for.

97
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:55,706
I'm prepping the machine
for a full work-up.

98
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:58,375
There's only so much I can tell
from the fragments.

99
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,835
It's way sophisticated.

100
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,837
This is stuff they tested
at Fort Dietrich

101
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:04,590
when they were researching
biological weapons for...

102
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,258
"defensive" purposes.

103
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:08,218
Your biosafe room
is scrubbed and ready.

104
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,386
- Thanks. I'll let you know what I get.
- Thank you.

105
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:14,765
Something the Cabal
could have built.

106
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,184
Well, we know their access
to technology is unrivaled.

107
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,897
Yeah, and I just got schooled
on their willingness to experiment

108
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,733
- on humans as well as abnormals.
- Telegram.

109
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,109
Telegram?
What is this, 1890?

110
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,656
Our Dr. Watson tends only to trust

111
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,906
the more established forms
of communication.

112
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,159
Dr. Watson?

113
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:36,914
Not as in James Watson,
who's a member of the Five?

114
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,959
Yeah, and head of the UK Sanctuary.

115
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,795
"Helen, a matter
of the utmost urgency.

116
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,089
"Will be arriving at the Sanctuary
tomorrow.

117
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,384
"Will be bringing everything we need
to get to the bottom of this new menace.

118
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,552
"Your trusted colleague, JW."

119
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,474
Do you have an update, doctor?

120
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,894
The field test is going very,
very well.

121
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,146
Better even
than our models suggested.

122
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:05,442
Abnormals in the path of the agent are
showing rapid onset of clinical paranoia

123
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:07,485
and extreme aggression.

124
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:11,281
How far is this dispersal
expected to spread?

125
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:14,826
We put sustainability at four days
before it wanes of its own accord.

126
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:18,246
The reaction to the abnormal uprising
is exactly what we hoped for.

127
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:20,749
Anger, scapegoating, retribution.

128
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:23,126
That's your real vector
of transmission.

129
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:24,628
What about the Sanctuary?

130
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:28,298
Two of the five, Druitt and Watson,
have already made contact with Magnus.

131
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:31,801
I want hourly updates.
Every communication in and out.

132
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:34,638
We really can't take
anything for granted.

133
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:38,266
You said that we were dealing with
the most brilliant minds on the planet.

134
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:41,770
Brilliant, yes, but they have no idea
what they're facing.

135
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,563
I have some good news.

136
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,871
James...
It's so good to see you.

137
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:04,209
You haven't changed a bit.

138
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:08,880
- Since last fall in London?
- No, since spring of 1886.

139
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:12,425
Coming from such a keen observer,
I'll take that as a compliment.

140
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,761
Now, I will need help.

141
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:17,180
I have a driver and a truck
at the loading dock.

142
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:19,391
- I brought some things.
- Things?

143
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:20,725
Corpses, Helen.

144
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,562
You didn't expect me to arrive
without a gift, did you?

145
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,775
Dr. James Watson,

146
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,152
Ashley and Henry
you know, of course.

147
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,488
Lovely to see you again, my dear.

148
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:36,656
Henry, the new servers
are working perfectly.

149
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,492
- Oh, thanks, doc. I try.
- And my new colleague,

150
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,578
- Dr. Will Zimmerman.
- Hello.

151
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:43,623
The protégé.

152
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:45,834
Yes, I've heard quite a bit
about you.

153
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,500
- All good, I hope.
- Some.

154
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:51,921
Profiler, right?

155
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:55,886
Yes.
Yes, Dr. Magnus told you?

156
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:58,636
No, actually, I was
watching you looking at me.

157
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:01,975
- Really?
- A profiler looks, listens,

158
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,935
gauges, senses,
calculates, compares.

159
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,853
Am I really a doctor?
Am I really who I say I am?

160
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:09,274
The tells, the giveaways.

161
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,900
The twitch of an eye,
the odd unnatural pause...

162
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,320
You have dirt under a single fingernail.
Did you scratch at something?

163
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,033
- Did I?
- I think so.

164
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:21,828
Something green.
Verdigris...

165
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:25,665
Oxidized bronze.

166
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,834
The door knocker.

167
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:29,292
To test its age.

168
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,929
Reproductions are rampant.
I would have been so disappointed.

169
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:43,139
- From that, you got "profiler"?
- More your immediate threat assessment.

170
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:44,849
Is that a bomb on his chest?

171
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:47,685
Is the accent authentic? Is he casing
the room? That said "profiler".

172
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:52,067
- I'm impressed.
- Yes, of course you are.

173
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,692
And people tell me
I sound like Sherlock Holmes.

174
00:10:55,695 --> 00:10:56,947
Actually, Will,

175
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:58,740
that's exactly who he is.

176
00:11:07,622 --> 00:11:10,751
So you don't mean that your
Dr. Watson really is Sherlock Holmes?

177
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:13,420
Not the literary figure,
of course, but yes,

178
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:17,507
Conan Doyle did model the character
after James' brilliant deductive mind.

179
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:20,552
So why did he get relegated to
the sidekick in the stories?

180
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,053
At Watson's insistence.

181
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:24,222
He preferred to let
Holmes take center stage

182
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:26,558
while he played the fawning
acolyte in the wings.

183
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:27,726
His genius...

184
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:30,729
Was exponentially increased
when he became one of the Five.

185
00:11:31,563 --> 00:11:33,398
What about the bodies
he brought here?

186
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:36,276
They're being prepared for an autopsy
in a biosafe environment.

187
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:39,821
You know, if this disease really does
turn abnormals into psychotic killers,

188
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:43,366
then in theory, you, Henry, the big guy,
are all potentially susceptible.

189
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:45,327
Ashley, too, in theory.

190
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:49,206
Anyone with that DNA could suddenly
be stricken with psychotic aggression.

191
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:52,084
I've done that dance with you once
a half a mile under the ocean.

192
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:54,753
- I'm not anxious to do it again.
- Nor am I, Will.

193
00:11:58,256 --> 00:12:00,675
Body is that of a male abnormal,

194
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:03,553
<i>Odobenus Rosmarus Sapien.</i>

195
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:07,891
A genetic melange
of human and walrus.

196
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:09,684
Koo-koo-ka-choo.

197
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:13,563
Cause of death,
multiple gunshot wounds

198
00:12:13,688 --> 00:12:16,024
suffered during a reported
fire-fight

199
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:20,112
after the subject allegedly slaughtered
three out of four family members.

200
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,488
What you mean is,

201
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,533
the abbie went psycho
and then got shot to bloody hell.

202
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:27,035
You always did have
the gift for brevity.

203
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:29,246
It's not the ballistics
we're interested in.

204
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:31,248
We'll need samples of every organ.

205
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:34,251
The scalpel is yours, doctor.

206
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:35,961
Thank you.

207
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:41,049
You know, James, you really are
a walking medical miracle.

208
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:44,094
I think "walking"
is a bit of an exaggeration.

209
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:47,514
Without these exoskeletal
powered braces,

210
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,641
I fear I would be confined
to a wheelchair.

211
00:12:50,142 --> 00:12:52,686
Nothing to be ashamed of at 160.

212
00:12:53,728 --> 00:12:56,273
Anyway, if I am a miracle,
what does that make you?

213
00:12:57,649 --> 00:12:59,359
My gift was longevity.

214
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:01,153
Yours was far more profound.

215
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:04,072
Care to switch?

216
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:18,336
How's the serum transaminase going?

217
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:20,881
Inconclusive levels.

218
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:25,802
The fact that behavioral changes
are the first clinical presentation

219
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:28,013
make this diagnosis very prickly.

220
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:31,808
Well, John was unaffected despite
being exposed to ground zero,

221
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,394
which suggests that the special
qualities of the Five

222
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,646
might well provide
an immunity factor.

223
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:39,274
Until the tests come back,
I'll be looking at my own blood

224
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,651
- to combat the disease.
- I'll tell you the results,

225
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:44,696
- or would you rather be surprised?
- A man-made pathogen.

226
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:49,367
A psychosis-inducing agent that affects
only abnormals has to be by design.

227
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:53,121
John believes
the Cabal is behind it.

228
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:56,792
Well, John draws his insights
from an affinity with evil.

229
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:59,252
I have great faith in his analysis.

230
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:02,089
I've released him from isolation.

231
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:04,382
Now if you could
only release yourself.

232
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:05,675
I'm sorry?

233
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,969
Our contacts are too seldom,
too brief,

234
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:12,557
considering I'm the leader of
your largest satellite operation.

235
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:15,519
It's out of respect for your autonomy
as much as anything else.

236
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:18,730
Most people go back to their oldest
contacts for solace, Helen.

237
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:21,775
You defy that convention,
but then, you always have.

238
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:24,694
We're together now, aren't we?

239
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:28,406
If only the circumstances
were more agreeable.

240
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,284
So, what is that?

241
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,870
A necessary component
for my survival.

242
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:39,251
There's not much we can do till
the results come in in the morning...

243
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,380
Not that I think Helen
will sleep very much.

244
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:47,384
Tell me, young man,
what is it like to work for a woman?

245
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:52,264
A woman like Dr. Magnus?

246
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:53,682
It's a privilege.

247
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:56,810
What Watson means is,
what's it like for someone

248
00:14:56,935 --> 00:14:59,354
who hasn't been dragged
by his scruff into the 21st century?

249
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:01,815
And the century before that.

250
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,151
Most men's failures
haunt them for a lifetime.

251
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:05,986
Mine have haunted me for two.

252
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:07,487
What failure?

253
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,115
The Ripper case.

254
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:12,117
It confounded me like no other.

255
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:14,369
You came close, James.
You don't know how close.

256
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:17,414
Night after night,
I poured my insights out to you,

257
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:20,625
never knowing that the target of
my manhunt was the man

258
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,836
who dissected my suppositions.

259
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:25,714
I was in the grip of something
I couldn't control. You know that.

260
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,884
The fact remains,
you gave the lie to all my bravado.

261
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:33,138
You shattered my belief that I could see
beyond what a mere mortal could.

262
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:36,475
A little sensitivity here.
We're in the presence of a mere mortal.

263
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,269
Young Will here has the makings of
a decent detective.

264
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:44,107
Perhaps he would have seen
what I could not.

265
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:49,112
I'm sorry.
It's just, it's amazing to me.

266
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:51,865
Sherlock Holmes, Jack the Ripper...

267
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,743
The fact that you two
can sit here together...

268
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:56,119
Time is a great healer.

269
00:15:58,205 --> 00:15:59,372
Redemption,

270
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:01,583
that requires a little more.

271
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:05,712
You ooze judgment, doctor,
like a weeping sore.

272
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,381
In a life devoted to justice, sir,

273
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:11,593
it is a constant burr on my backside
that you have avoided it.

274
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,845
Justice is meted out in many ways.

275
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:16,054
You're not the only one haunted.

276
00:16:17,724 --> 00:16:20,934
You've got to believe that fate has
brought you two together for a reason.

277
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:22,769
Yes, why are you here, Druitt?

278
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:24,606
To save the world as we know it,

279
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,900
and, time allowing,

280
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:30,445
reassert my superiority
in our battle of wits.

281
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:47,546
It's really hard to know
how this sucker worked.

282
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:49,506
So much chop and so little suey.

283
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:51,299
But you think cryo was involved.

284
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:55,011
Well, it looks like the bio-agent was
cooled way down before being vaporized.

285
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,388
The latest data suggests that
the rate of infection is slowing.

286
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,892
That's a good thing?

287
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:03,478
This first dispersal was a test,
a dry run. I'm certain.

288
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,230
To measure the effectiveness of what
I think is some sort of neurotoxin.

289
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:10,068
A dispersal device of sufficient size
could well blanket the globe.

290
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:12,696
We need to find out
what their capabilities are.

291
00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:15,365
Our intelligence has
the Cabal's weapons laboratories

292
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,033
in several far-flung places.

293
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:18,952
Including one very close to home.

294
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,788
Like just outside of New City,
if I remember right.

295
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,373
Hang on a second.

296
00:17:23,498 --> 00:17:25,876
- I think I got somethin' here.
- What is it?

297
00:17:28,754 --> 00:17:31,214
Looks like one of the microcapsules
survived detonation.

298
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:33,925
It's a pure sample of the agent.

299
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:36,301
Put it in a biosafe
container, Henry.

300
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,388
Just be very, very careful.

301
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:43,268
You know those little mechanical arms
that pick up stuffed toys at arcades?

302
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:45,145
Four-time state champion.

303
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:53,320
We're looking at one of
the most dangerous pathogens

304
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:55,111
the abnormal world has ever seen.

305
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:58,158
It functions very much
like a prion on steroids.

306
00:17:58,283 --> 00:18:00,535
The rogue protein
found in mad cow disease.

307
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,079
It replicates inside the abnormal's
brain, causing pathological aggression.

308
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,041
And eventually a very painful death.

309
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,709
According to the tests,

310
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:10,921
we can say with certainty that the mode
of transmission is not person-to-person.

311
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:13,381
It's not communicable.
That's the good news.

312
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:16,134
But the susceptibility
to antivirals is nil.

313
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,970
The fact is, prion disease
is largely incurable.

314
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,099
I still think our best hope is
to find something in our own blood,

315
00:18:22,224 --> 00:18:24,518
possibly an antigen
that could inhibit the disease.

316
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:26,853
That would explain
why we are apparently immune.

317
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:28,853
Because you all injected
the source blood.

318
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:30,899
That's pretty powerful stuff.

319
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,902
Even if we can't find something
in our individual blood

320
00:18:34,027 --> 00:18:35,529
that could stop the disease,

321
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:37,739
it may well be
that the source blood could,

322
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:39,739
in the form of
a synthesized antitoxin.

323
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:42,951
Except that the ancient blood
was used up over 120 years ago.

324
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,287
Not all of it.

325
00:18:46,415 --> 00:18:47,457
What?

326
00:18:52,421 --> 00:18:54,923
My father wanted to destroy
what was left.

327
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:58,176
Eventually he agreed to set aside
the unused portion of the vial

328
00:18:58,301 --> 00:19:01,012
only to be tapped
in the most dire of emergencies,

329
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,473
and he made sure that only the five of
us acting in concert could retrieve it.

330
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:08,478
Which is a bit of a problem if,
in fact, I have killed Tesla.

331
00:19:08,603 --> 00:19:10,730
Even if Nicola managed to survive,

332
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:13,773
the last of the Five, Nigel Griffin,
could not possibly be enlisted.

333
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:15,986
Because?

334
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:19,614
Because Griffin died
half a century ago.

335
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,990
The situation may not be
as hopeless as you think.

336
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:25,245
You have the power to revive the dead?
Now, that would impress me.

337
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,371
Before he died, in the early '60s,
Griffin wrote me a letter

338
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,168
declaring that his legacy
had been passed on.

339
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:33,044
He has a daughter, Anna.

340
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:35,422
Now, with any luck,
we could track her down

341
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:38,008
and convince her to take on
her father's role in our mission.

342
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,217
Hold on a second.

343
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:42,552
You said that only the Five acting
together could retrieve the blood.

344
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:45,430
The powers of the Five,
to be more accurate.

345
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:47,474
So, what's Griffin's power?

346
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:49,267
Nigel Griffin?

347
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:51,477
He was the invisible man.

348
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:39,776
I don't understand.

349
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:43,030
If the epidemic stopped in its tracks,
how did he get the disease?

350
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,408
Well, Watson and Druitt may have
come back clean in their blood work,

351
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:49,620
but that doesn't rule out
the microorganism being brought in on

352
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:51,997
their clothing
or their personal items.

353
00:20:52,122 --> 00:20:54,833
So it's only a matter of time
before every abnormal in the Sanctuary

354
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,251
comes down with it.

355
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:57,586
Including me.

356
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:02,674
I could offer you assurances, Henry,

357
00:21:03,258 --> 00:21:04,885
but they'd be hollow.

358
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:09,973
What's his prognosis, doc?

359
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:13,893
Well, I suspect every species
of abnormal reacts differently,

360
00:21:15,687 --> 00:21:18,232
but if the reports
are any indication,

361
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:21,443
he'll become increasingly
irrational and violent,

362
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:23,862
then turn against human beings,

363
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:26,949
and eventually,

364
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:28,367
he'll die.

365
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:51,598
We appear to have been successful
in getting the toxin into the Sanctuary.

366
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:55,727
By now I'm quite sure our friends there
will have correctly concluded

367
00:21:55,853 --> 00:21:58,939
that the biologic wildfire we started
has all but burned itself out.

368
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:00,899
I wouldn't sound so cavalier.

369
00:22:01,483 --> 00:22:03,652
Remember the problems
we encountered with her father.

370
00:22:03,777 --> 00:22:07,281
Gregory Magnus helped us engineer
the consummate soldier for our army.

371
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,908
Yes, but his information
on the whereabouts of the source

372
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:11,284
proved utterly erroneous.

373
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:14,788
Perhaps what Gregory didn't disclose,
the Five will.

374
00:22:17,124 --> 00:22:20,335
I've checked with every source I have.
Every contact in the abnormal community.

375
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,337
They're all saying the same thing.

376
00:22:22,462 --> 00:22:24,506
The Yukon test was a dry run.

377
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:27,843
A popgun compared to what happens
three days from now.

378
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:29,928
A big bang that'll blanket
the entire planet.

379
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:33,974
Three days? Why three days?
Why not launch the biowar right now?

380
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:38,395
Changing weather patterns, wind shear,
patterns of the trade winds.

381
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:41,773
Telling you, there's something wrong.
It doesn't fit. It doesn't make sense.

382
00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:44,109
Yeah, well, genocide rarely does.

383
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,529
You told me the lengths
the Cabal went through

384
00:22:47,654 --> 00:22:49,865
to build the perfect soldier
for the ethnic cleansing.

385
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,659
My father became an unwitting
accomplice to those ends.

386
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:57,331
Why engineer an army of abnormals if
your real line is an invisible pathogen?

387
00:22:57,456 --> 00:23:00,751
Perhaps to fend off any re-emergence of
abnormals once the decimation complete.

388
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:03,378
Who's to say that your own army
won't be susceptible?

389
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:06,173
You've got to believe that they've built
an immunity into their design.

390
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,969
They knew it would be possible
to immunize after the fact.

391
00:23:12,221 --> 00:23:14,014
The source blood is the key.

392
00:23:14,264 --> 00:23:17,476
Even if we do find this Anna Griffin,
we still don't have Tesla.

393
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:20,062
What's the point if you don't have
the last member of the Five?

394
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:22,231
I know how my father thought.

395
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:25,526
Now, if he'd anticipated that one
or more of the Five might have died,

396
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:28,028
he may well have built in
some sort of safety mechanism

397
00:23:28,153 --> 00:23:30,280
- so we could still crack the code.
- Same old Helen.

398
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:34,074
"I'm just going to jump off this cliff
and hope that I sprout wings."

399
00:23:35,953 --> 00:23:37,663
Where did Gregory hide the vial?

400
00:23:37,788 --> 00:23:40,165
In one of the most inaccessible places
on the planet.

401
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:43,919
The lost city of Bhalasamm
in the Indian Himalayas.

402
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:46,463
The seat of the original culture
of ancient vampires.

403
00:23:46,964 --> 00:23:48,590
So, not Transylvania?

404
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:51,760
Its unique topography
keeps everything well-hidden.

405
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:54,553
Trust me, Will,

406
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:57,264
this makes the other wonders
of the ancient world pale.

407
00:23:57,434 --> 00:24:01,603
- He what, hid it like a pirate's chest?
- There's a labyrinth beneath the city.

408
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:03,939
My father placed
five keys within it,

409
00:24:04,064 --> 00:24:07,359
each impossible to release without
the properties acquired by the blood.

410
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:09,152
And what's your power,

411
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:11,738
just showing up for the meeting
after 135 years?

412
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:13,073
Like to see you do it.

413
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:17,284
Okay, so I did a full cavity search
on the Internet for this Anna Griffin.

414
00:24:17,454 --> 00:24:19,621
She went by a different name,
so that slowed me down,

415
00:24:19,746 --> 00:24:21,582
but then I tracked her
to Baton Rouge.

416
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,543
- 3 years ago, she drops off the earth.
- Could she simply have died?

417
00:24:24,668 --> 00:24:27,419
If you believe the obit, she did,
but it didn't pass the sniff test.

418
00:24:28,465 --> 00:24:30,465
The certificate of death
was an outright forgery.

419
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:32,426
Somebody wanted us
to think she'd kicked.

420
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:34,720
Like it was, like,
a witness protection or something.

421
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:37,306
So I was lucky to find a few
fragments that they missed.

422
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:38,765
I found an address. So,

423
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:41,852
somebody better wake up Druitt, 'cause
we ain't got time to take no fast train.

424
00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:43,687
- "We"?
- You can't send Druitt alone.

425
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:46,940
He's all hearts and flowers one day,
next, he's turning a girl into a canoe!

426
00:24:49,193 --> 00:24:51,361
Despite his goodwill as of late,

427
00:24:51,737 --> 00:24:54,196
there are definitely
warring sides to his personality.

428
00:24:57,244 --> 00:24:59,369
- Keep Druitt company.
- What?

429
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:03,914
Why me? I'm supposed to tell
Jack the Ripper to fetch?

430
00:25:04,124 --> 00:25:05,459
Just remember...

431
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:08,420
His sharpest implement is his mind.

432
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:33,987
Can I help you guys?

433
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:38,867
Yeah, as a matter of fact.
We're looking for Anna Thayer Griffin.

434
00:25:39,993 --> 00:25:41,034
Who's asking?

435
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:43,121
We're friends of the family.

436
00:25:43,247 --> 00:25:45,330
Then I'm surprised
you don't know she's dead.

437
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:46,834
Is she?

438
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:49,211
Yes, she is.

439
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,713
I went to her funeral.
She died three years ago.

440
00:25:52,422 --> 00:25:53,924
Where's she buried?

441
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:59,304
We'd like to pay our respects.

442
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,058
Whispering Pines.

443
00:26:05,143 --> 00:26:06,186
Thanks.

444
00:26:09,606 --> 00:26:10,897
Just give me a second...

445
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,947
Every experiment where I tried to create
an anti-toxin from one of us has failed.

446
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:18,907
We've no choice but to go
to the source.

447
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:20,409
You do have a choice, mom.

448
00:26:20,534 --> 00:26:22,826
We find a way to stop
that bioweapon from going off,

449
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:26,039
- you don't need the damn source.
- You want me to send you into the heart

450
00:26:26,165 --> 00:26:28,542
of the Cabal's weapons factory
and do it all on your own.

451
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:30,586
Henry said he'll go with me.

452
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:36,592
No offense, but you don't graduate from
Eagle Scout to James Bond overnight.

453
00:26:36,717 --> 00:26:39,094
- I was green as Gumby, too.
- I can do this.

454
00:26:39,219 --> 00:26:40,594
What, Gumby?
I'm Gumby now?

455
00:26:40,764 --> 00:26:44,183
Odds are, the device will be triggered
from their network of weapons labs.

456
00:26:44,308 --> 00:26:47,769
Which is why we need to break in there
and find a way to stop the detonation.

457
00:26:47,895 --> 00:26:48,937
Just like that?

458
00:26:49,062 --> 00:26:51,356
- I didn't say it'd be easy.
- I didn't say you could go.

459
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:53,565
Mom, we don't have a lot of time.

460
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,403
We can do this.

461
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:03,492
Get in.

462
00:27:03,662 --> 00:27:05,243
Get what you need, and get out.

463
00:27:05,412 --> 00:27:07,164
No unnecessary risks.

464
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,833
- Let's go, Gumby.
- Thank you.

465
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:11,583
Thanks.

466
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:13,921
- Ashley...
- Yeah?

467
00:28:01,218 --> 00:28:03,512
Someone's been visiting the grave,

468
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:04,972
empty or not.

469
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:07,180
If the gift was passed on
to the daughter,

470
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:09,101
why not an offspring?

471
00:28:50,684 --> 00:28:52,060
She went that way.

472
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:57,065
- How could her clothes be invisible?
- She's not wearing any.

473
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:18,585
I thought so.
You're Anna's daughter, aren't you?

474
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:20,172
Clara.

475
00:29:21,632 --> 00:29:23,800
She was afraid she'd be called.

476
00:29:24,384 --> 00:29:27,179
You're the people she was
worried about, aren't you?

477
00:29:27,304 --> 00:29:29,473
Yeah, well, she's off the hook.

478
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,100
We'd like you to take her place.

479
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:42,693
I don't know about the Sanctuary,
and I don't know who you guys are.

480
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:45,070
You just said your mother was afraid
she'd be called on.

481
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:47,865
She obviously talked to you about
your grandfather. His unusual past.

482
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,618
I have to go.

483
00:29:51,577 --> 00:29:53,537
Why did you follow us
out here, Clara?

484
00:29:53,662 --> 00:29:55,039
Before she went into hiding,

485
00:29:55,164 --> 00:29:57,917
she must have told you that
the responsibility would fall to you,

486
00:29:58,042 --> 00:30:00,794
- that you'd have to use your gift.
- I do use it.

487
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,838
I can reach into any till I want.

488
00:30:02,963 --> 00:30:05,507
- That's not what it was made for.
- Why did she fake her death?

489
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:07,927
Because she was sick
and tired of running,

490
00:30:08,052 --> 00:30:09,345
living in fear.

491
00:30:10,596 --> 00:30:14,183
She wanted to disappear for good,
so she made everyone believe she died.

492
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,853
The irony is,
is two years later, she did die,

493
00:30:17,978 --> 00:30:20,439
and she was the only one who understood
what it was like for me,

494
00:30:20,564 --> 00:30:22,274
and now there's no one.

495
00:30:22,816 --> 00:30:25,486
I never wanted it,
what you guys call a gift.

496
00:30:25,694 --> 00:30:27,071
But you have it,

497
00:30:27,655 --> 00:30:30,241
and right now, you could be
the only person that could help us

498
00:30:30,366 --> 00:30:32,785
stop something terrible
from happening.

499
00:30:42,336 --> 00:30:45,130
Let me out!

500
00:30:53,806 --> 00:30:57,351
Let me out now!

501
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:12,491
Helen... Helen...

502
00:31:13,325 --> 00:31:15,452
Don't let me out.

503
00:31:26,088 --> 00:31:30,175
Pitting humans against abnormals,
decided who lives and who dies...

504
00:31:30,593 --> 00:31:32,011
The Cabal has to be stopped.

505
00:31:32,136 --> 00:31:34,763
It's why I started this mission
more than a century ago.

506
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:36,557
I just didn't know it.

507
00:31:36,724 --> 00:31:38,934
Well, you have four of the Five,

508
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,438
but I don't think Clara can do
what we need her to do.

509
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:45,065
- You said you saw her go invisible.
- Yeah, but...

510
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,860
Look, she talks a tough game,
but she's afraid of her own shadow,

511
00:31:47,985 --> 00:31:49,111
when she has one,

512
00:31:49,236 --> 00:31:51,238
and she thinks we're a cult.

513
00:31:51,697 --> 00:31:53,657
I just don't think
she has it in her.

514
00:31:53,782 --> 00:31:57,119
Well, you have till mid-day
tomorrow to convince her.

515
00:31:57,703 --> 00:31:59,455
And what if she can't pull it off?

516
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,665
What if we can't find Tesla's key?

517
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,876
What if my father gave up
the source to the Cabal

518
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:05,876
when they had him
under their thrall?

519
00:32:06,212 --> 00:32:08,130
You can't answer
every "what if", Will.

520
00:32:08,255 --> 00:32:10,799
I just know that we only have days
to stop the destruction

521
00:32:10,925 --> 00:32:12,843
of every abnormal on earth.

522
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:38,118
Prisoner visiting hours
are 10:00 till 2:00.

523
00:32:38,911 --> 00:32:40,538
You're not a prisoner.

524
00:32:40,663 --> 00:32:42,413
Oh, so, I can leave, then?

525
00:32:43,123 --> 00:32:45,249
When we go, you can go with us.

526
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:52,841
You got a real trophy,
didn't you, Dr. Z?

527
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:55,302
That's not what's happening here.

528
00:32:55,427 --> 00:32:56,804
Invisible girl?

529
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:58,097
Come on...

530
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:01,934
Tell me your band of creature hunters
scores like that every week.

531
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:04,560
Clara, I need you to understand
the stakes here.

532
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,688
- I know it could cost me my life.
- I don't think it will come to that.

533
00:33:08,357 --> 00:33:09,692
You don't think?

534
00:33:10,276 --> 00:33:11,692
I don't want to sugarcoat it.

535
00:33:12,945 --> 00:33:15,070
This mission is going to
be dangerous as hell,

536
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:18,949
and you're gonna have to use your power
in a way that's never been used before,

537
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:21,078
and if you fail, if we fail,

538
00:33:21,495 --> 00:33:23,954
then thousands if not millions
of lives will be affected.

539
00:33:24,123 --> 00:33:25,332
You finished?

540
00:33:30,337 --> 00:33:31,922
Except to say that...

541
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,759
- I believe that you can do it.
- Oh, please.

542
00:33:36,886 --> 00:33:38,552
You don't know who the hell I am.

543
00:33:38,804 --> 00:33:41,682
I don't think you know
who the hell you are.

544
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:45,309
I mean, you've spent
half your life hiding.

545
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:50,190
You have no idea
what it's like to disappear.

546
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,614
People look into your eyes,
and they don't see anything.

547
00:33:58,449 --> 00:34:00,451
You're a... a phantom,

548
00:34:00,868 --> 00:34:01,994
a mirage.

549
00:34:03,372 --> 00:34:05,329
You don't matter,
and you don't exist.

550
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:07,499
Yeah, but you can do something.

551
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,001
I mean, you can do something
that maybe nobody on earth can do.

552
00:34:13,088 --> 00:34:14,924
You sound like my mother.

553
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:18,093
So she did talk to you
about your destiny.

554
00:34:18,262 --> 00:34:19,553
Yeah, she...

555
00:34:20,221 --> 00:34:23,224
said the power was passed on
for a reason.

556
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,309
First to her, and then to me.

557
00:34:26,644 --> 00:34:28,938
I've never wrapped
my head around it.

558
00:34:31,815 --> 00:34:33,359
I don't know, Will.

559
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:36,737
I have never done
anything like this before.

560
00:34:40,115 --> 00:34:42,159
I don't think any of us have.

561
00:34:50,459 --> 00:34:52,211
How long before
the sedation wears off?

562
00:34:52,336 --> 00:34:53,712
Three, four hours.

563
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:57,591
I've managed to increase
the antigen levels in our blood samples

564
00:34:57,716 --> 00:34:59,260
by a factor of two.

565
00:35:00,052 --> 00:35:01,426
We need a factor of 100.

566
00:35:03,931 --> 00:35:07,851
If I draw his blood and inject myself,
my levels would spike that high.

567
00:35:07,977 --> 00:35:10,437
- You'll most likely kill yourself.
- My blood will protect me,

568
00:35:10,563 --> 00:35:12,771
- I'll bet my life on it.
- That's what you'd be doing.

569
00:35:12,982 --> 00:35:14,608
If we don't find the source,

570
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:16,777
we need to find some way
to fight this disease.

571
00:35:16,902 --> 00:35:19,905
Helen, for God's sake,
you have no protection!

572
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,792
Are you mad?

573
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:35,504
Just desperate.

574
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,599
I warned you.

575
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:09,328
It's me, Helen.

576
00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:11,497
There's no need to harm me.

577
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:44,030
Okay, so if this isn't the back entrance
to an evil lair, I don't know what is.

578
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:48,076
Okay, the barbed wire's easy.

579
00:36:48,785 --> 00:36:52,330
- How do we get rid of the lasers?
- I blind them, with this.

580
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,755
- What would boys do without their toys?
- Can you stop with the boy thing?

581
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:02,966
If we're gonna do this,
I need a modicum of...

582
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:04,134
Respect.

583
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:06,594
Henry, you're Indiana Jones
with cooler toys.

584
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,930
Thank you. See?
Was that so hard?

585
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:15,895
John will teleport us two at a time

586
00:37:16,021 --> 00:37:18,648
to a wooded area just below
the rim of the outlook.

587
00:37:18,773 --> 00:37:20,692
We make the modest descent
to the ridge

588
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:23,820
and enter the lost city
via the eastern approach.

589
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:27,490
Can't you just teleport us
into this labyrinth thing?

590
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:30,076
My powers are formidable,
I'll allow,

591
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:33,288
but as I haven't seen
what's down there...

592
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:37,123
Rematerializing inside a granite boulder
would not be a comfortable way to die.

593
00:37:38,043 --> 00:37:39,210
No, true.

594
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:40,920
Absolutely.

595
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:42,380
I prefer to walk.

596
00:37:42,505 --> 00:37:44,341
Once inside
the subterranean passages,

597
00:37:44,466 --> 00:37:47,093
we'll each be responsible
for securing our designated keys.

598
00:37:47,218 --> 00:37:49,135
Does no one else see
the madness in all this?

599
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,057
You believe
I can't accomplish Nicola's task.

600
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:53,765
He had the powers of a vampire.

601
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:56,478
And, he fell asleep in Edison's
electric chair at full current.

602
00:37:56,603 --> 00:37:58,686
I don't see your skill sets
overlapping.

603
00:37:58,938 --> 00:38:00,523
My father always said

604
00:38:00,732 --> 00:38:04,192
no problem has a single solution.
There are always alternatives.

605
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:07,238
All right, then, in the unlikely event
that we find all five keys...

606
00:38:07,407 --> 00:38:09,032
We'll be led to an inner sanctum

607
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:11,868
where our keys will be inserted,
and the vial containing the source

608
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:13,036
will be released.

609
00:38:13,161 --> 00:38:14,911
You know, it's not
the mission, Helen.

610
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,622
What worries me
is that gleam in your eye.

611
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:20,460
Suck it up, Jimmy.
We're going to India.

612
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,899
Kind of quiet.

613
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,943
That's good.
We don't have a lot of time.

614
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:48,154
We need to get in, get what we need,
and get out.

615
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:54,577
Okay, they're leaving.
Let's move.

616
00:38:55,453 --> 00:38:56,705
Come on...

617
00:39:09,343 --> 00:39:11,511
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

618
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:35,243
This is my father's worst nightmare.

619
00:39:35,452 --> 00:39:38,204
That we would try
and retrieve the source.

620
00:39:38,955 --> 00:39:40,248
You going to tell him?

621
00:39:40,373 --> 00:39:43,084
If I find out where he's holed up,
and if the time is right...

622
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:44,252
No.

623
00:39:57,641 --> 00:39:59,267
Who the hell are you?

624
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:01,478
Relax, Mr. Foss.

625
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:04,648
I'm your doctor.

626
00:40:42,811 --> 00:40:45,480
Hello, Ashley.
It's good to finally meet you.

627
00:40:45,689 --> 00:40:48,441
- Go to hell.
- I apologize for this,

628
00:40:49,734 --> 00:40:51,444
but your reputation
does precede you,

629
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:53,446
and I have yet to meet
an intelligent being

630
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:55,907
that doesn't respond
to the proper stimulation.

631
00:40:56,116 --> 00:40:57,742
What did you do to me?

632
00:41:00,245 --> 00:41:02,205
Taming wild creatures
is what we do best.

633
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,791
We haven't even touched on
me getting wild yet.

634
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:07,544
- I think you'll like it.
- My name is Dana Whitcomb,

635
00:41:07,669 --> 00:41:09,838
director of logistics
and operations here.

636
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:11,381
Nice job title.
Long hours?

637
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,885
You and your colleague, Mr. Foss,
came here with the intent

638
00:41:16,011 --> 00:41:19,055
of trying to stop the release
of a bioweapon, codename Lazarus.

639
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,559
Very ambitious, not to mention
incredibly brave of you.

640
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:24,936
It was also incredibly foolish.

641
00:41:26,104 --> 00:41:27,897
Well, foolish is
kind of how we roll.

642
00:41:28,315 --> 00:41:31,568
Well, despite your efforts,
Lazarus will be released.

643
00:41:31,693 --> 00:41:34,988
Its effects will be a thousand times
more devastating than phase one.

644
00:41:35,113 --> 00:41:36,489
When the dust settles,

645
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:38,825
it will bring a new day for humans,

646
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,994
and what's left of abnormals.

647
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,289
Yeah, well, we'll see, won't we?

648
00:41:45,624 --> 00:41:49,085
Your mother and her colleagues
will no doubt try to stop us.

649
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,129
I promise you they'll fail.

650
00:41:51,713 --> 00:41:53,423
They'll fail because...

651
00:41:54,382 --> 00:41:57,135
You're going to help us
complete our plan.

652
00:42:10,398 --> 00:42:13,360
We're about to see the ninth wonder
of the ancient world,

653
00:42:13,485 --> 00:42:16,863
- and I didn't even bring a camera.
- You brought your mind, didn't you?

654
00:42:16,988 --> 00:42:18,907
Damn, you know,
I knew I forgot something.

655
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:29,668
Dear god.

656
00:42:30,335 --> 00:42:32,128
It's all been destroyed.

657
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:43,181
There has to be a way down there.

658
00:42:43,556 --> 00:42:45,392
There has to be a way
into the labyrinth.

659
00:42:45,517 --> 00:42:46,559
It's over.

660
00:42:47,894 --> 00:42:50,355
No access, no source.
No source, no vaccine.

661
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,607
No vaccine, no way to stop the Cabal

662
00:42:52,732 --> 00:42:54,985
from taking over human evolution.
