00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:09,561
Hello ?

1
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:25,038
Good morning, Dr. Weir.

2
00:01:25,207 --> 00:01:28,199
- l’m Dr. Adam Fletcher.
- Where am l ?

3
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:31,126
You’re in the Acute Care Unit
of Willoughby State Hospital.

4
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:37,686
Willoughby.
That’s-- That’s a psychiatric hospital.

5
00:01:38,207 --> 00:01:39,925
Outside D.C., yes.

6
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,882
l’m on Earth ?

7
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:43,876
Yes.

8
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:46,839
When did l get back ?

9
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,123
You mean, back to Earth ?

10
00:01:50,247 --> 00:01:52,397
Dr. Weir, you never left.

11
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,676
You had just begun mediating
a treaty for the U.N...

12
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:00,725
... when you collapsed mid-speech.

13
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:07,364
You’ve been under
a tremendous amount of stress recently.

14
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:09,563
The treaty negotiation
was the final straw...

15
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:13,276
... that triggered what is known as
a brief reactive psychosis.

16
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:16,803
l know you’re confused.

17
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:18,520
This disorder can be frightening.

18
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:21,400
The good news is your condition
is most likely transitory.

19
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:25,282
These episodes usually pass
within a number of days.

20
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:29,157
l’m sorry, but how did l get here ?

21
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:32,486
You were transported by ambulance
to a hospital in D.C. --

22
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,126
No, l mean, from Atlantis.

23
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:39,156
l don’t remember coming back.

24
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:41,196
Atlantis ?

25
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:44,763
What’s your security clearance ?

26
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:47,996
Did you wanna talk to someone
regarding the treaty ?

27
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:50,806
The U.N. accord.

28
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:54,007
Non-nuclear proliferation
in North Africa.

29
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:56,482
That’s what you were mediating
when you collapsed.

30
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:01,880
l negotiated that treaty
well over two years ago.

31
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:03,076
No.

32
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,200
Three days ago.

33
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:08,040
Since then, you’ve been here...

34
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:11,040
... in a severely depressed
and near-catatonic state.

35
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:12,916
No.

36
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:16,807
No, l was in my office...

37
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:20,357
... and l was reading over
a mission report and--

38
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:24,885
This-- This can’t be real.

39
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:26,958
Dr. Weir, l assure you...

40
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:29,439
... it is real.

41
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:33,122
Okay. Okay, then, yes.

42
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:37,678
There is somebody l need to speak with
regarding the treaty...

43
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:38,996
... right away.

44
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:49,038
Oh, thank God.

45
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:51,243
General O’Neill.

46
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:53,086
Dr. Weir.

47
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:54,885
Thank you so much for coming.

48
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:58,039
Hopefully you’Il be able
to help sort out this entire mess.

49
00:04:58,247 --> 00:04:59,965
Anything l can do to help.

50
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,204
- Would you like me to-- ?
- Oh, please.

51
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:07,846
- -sit ?

52
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,605
It is a relief just seeing a friendly face.

53
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:15,042
Yeah, l was going for friendly.

54
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:20,519
This is all very confusing for me.

55
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,917
The last thing l remember...

56
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:25,647
... l was in Atlantis
and everything was fine.

57
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:28,037
And next thing l know,
l wake up here.

58
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:32,357
Everything was fine...

59
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:34,320
... in Atlantis ?

60
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:38,799
The problem is my memory.
l have no memory of coming back.

61
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:41,037
l don’t know
if l came through the stargate...

62
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,721
... or aboard the <i>Daedalus</i>, or--

63
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:45,396
What ?

64
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:52,600
Dr. Weir, l’m not quite sure l’m qualified
to be in this conversation.

65
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,836
Oh, please.

66
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:55,440
You ran Stargate Command.

67
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:58,565
You are probably
the most qualified person on this planet.

68
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:00,046
Yeah, okay.

69
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:03,923
- Why are you doing this ?
- What ?

70
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:05,839
l’m not trying to do anything.

71
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,963
If you don’t know
what l’m talking about...

72
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,118
... then you’re not really Jack O’Neill.

73
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,959
Oh, l’m Jack O’Neill, all right.

74
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:16,164
That’s the one thing
in this conversation l am sure about.

75
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,605
l met you a few months ago...

76
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:23,045
... when we first approached you to help
broker this nonproliferation treaty.

77
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:26,199
l don’t know anything
about » Atlantis »...

78
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:29,683
... except that it was a fairly mediocre
Donovan song.

79
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,485
Not one of my favorites.

80
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:36,324
Now, this Stargate program
l’m supposed to have run--

81
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:38,682
A facility inside Cheyenne Mountain,
Colorado.

82
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,442
- That would be NORAD.
- Underneath NORAD, yes.

83
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:44,006
And the stargate ?

84
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:49,238
It’s a portal that allows
intergalactic travel.

85
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:51,637
The program’s been in operation
for over 10 years.

86
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:55,482
You started the whole thing
when you first encountered--

87
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:01,046
What ?

88
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:05,436
Look, why don’t l get
Dr. Fletcher in here ?

89
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:07,918
No, just...

90
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:09,636
Just leave.

91
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,801
- Please.
- All right.

92
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:14,646
Listen...

93
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:17,480
... for what it’s worth,
l hope you get better soon.

94
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,759
We need you.

95
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:51,678
No, let me go ! No, please let me go !

96
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,599
Let me go ! No !

97
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:58,319
Let me go !

98
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,599
No, no !

99
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:03,078
No !

100
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:24,164
l’ve spoken with several people
at the Pentagon.

101
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:26,840
They assure me...

102
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,124
... there is no such thing
as the Stargate program.

103
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:35,564
No Atlantis base in another galaxy.

104
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:38,715
And no Department
of Homeworld Security.

105
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:41,199
l’m sorry.

106
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:46,720
So you are telling me that l dreamt up
the last two years of my life ?

107
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:51,959
Sometimes when a person experiences
a significant emotional trauma...

108
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:56,245
... their mind just decides to shut down
to escape the pain.

109
00:08:56,607 --> 00:09:00,122
l have brokered dozens of treaties.

110
00:09:00,487 --> 00:09:03,604
Many of them very stressful, yes...

111
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:06,607
... but none of them bad enough...

112
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,841
... to cause significant
emotional trauma.

113
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,282
The treaty negotiation
was just the trigger point.

114
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:16,762
We believe the actual trauma
you suffered occurred three weeks ago.

115
00:09:19,887 --> 00:09:23,721
You were riding in a car
with a man named Simon Wallis.

116
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:30,317
- You remember Simon ?
- Yes, of course l do.

117
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:34,799
- We’re no longer in a relationship, but--
- You were coming home from dinner.

118
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:40,083
A car ran a red light and broadsided you,
impacting the driver’s side door.

119
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:44,436
Simon was killed instantly.

120
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:51,285
You suffered only minor injuries
in the crash...

121
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,125
... made a quick recovery.

122
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:55,323
But in the days
following Simon’s funeral...

123
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:58,524
... several of your colleagues
noticed your behavior changing.

124
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:00,877
Clear signs of depression.

125
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,203
- Confusion.
- No.

126
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:06,524
It culminated in your collapse
at the negotiation.

127
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:09,724
No. l’m sorry, l don’t believe you.

128
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:12,799
Sometimes the mind’s only way
to cope with tragedy...

129
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:15,720
... is to completely erase it
from memory.

130
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:20,085
And on rare occasions, supplant it with
something else. In this case, something--

131
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:26,636
You all right ?

132
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:48,680
Hello, sweetheart.

133
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:50,640
Mom.

134
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:56,605
l don’t understand
what’s happening to me, Mom.

135
00:10:57,207 --> 00:11:02,918
l feel as if-- As if l’m asleep
or l’m in a dream.

136
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:06,439
Look at me.

137
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:08,999
Do l look like a dream ?

138
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:12,164
My hand.

139
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,356
Does it feel like a dream ?

140
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:19,076
No.

141
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:23,646
But neither did the last two years
of my life.

142
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:28,645
l just-- l can’t believe
it was all a figment of my imagination.

143
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:31,686
Give it time.

144
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:34,315
The doctors here
will help you get through this.

145
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:36,998
The accident...

146
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:43,207
Getting that phone call
was the worst night of my life.

147
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:47,644
We all miss Simon terribly...

148
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:50,920
... but l don’t know what l’d do
if l lost you.

149
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,357
Oh, wait. l have something.

150
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,076
Your father’s watch.

151
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:05,998
l found it a few months ago.

152
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:10,399
- He’d always meant to give it to you.
- l know. l mean...

153
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,796
l mean, l took this with me.

154
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:26,321
It’s all right, sweetheart.

155
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,844
You’re safe now.

156
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:31,483
You’Il be fine.

157
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:34,436
l’Il make certain of it.

158
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:04,396
Hello ?

159
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:33,599
Someone-- !

160
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:36,601
What’s wrong, what’s wrong ?
What’s wrong ?

161
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,402
l’m going to prescribe
some additional medications for you.

162
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,683
A mood stabilizer, an antidepressant...

163
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:54,001
... and also stronger
antipsychotic medications.

164
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,921
These should help reduce
the acute symptoms you’re experiencing.

165
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:00,960
Wipe out the last two years
of my life.

166
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,239
l talked with your mother.

167
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:05,836
She told me how, as a child,
you had a brief phase...

168
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:08,726
... where you dreamed
of being an astronaut.

169
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:12,203
She and your father even bought you
a telescope for your 12th birthday.

170
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:13,880
It’s true.

171
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:17,079
Sometimes childhood fantasies
can offer a peaceful refuge...

172
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:19,886
... from the harsh realities of adult life.

173
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:24,406
So you’re saying when Simon died...

174
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,718
... my mind shut down
and went to another galaxy ?

175
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:30,721
It traveled as far as it could
to escape the pain.

176
00:14:30,927 --> 00:14:33,157
And in the matter of three days...

177
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:36,364
... l managed to live out
an entire two years of my life ?

178
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:39,286
Time is relative in a dream state.

179
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:43,157
People live out entire lifetimes
in the blink of an eye.

180
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:47,119
Imagine you were in my position,
listening to your story.

181
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:49,716
Traveling to another galaxy
through a stargate...

182
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:54,677
... leading an expedition
to the lost city of Atlantis.

183
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:57,960
Would you believe it ?

184
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:20,556
Dr. Weir ?

185
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:25,920
Your medications.

186
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:30,679
Thanks.

187
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:48,758
Have you gone
out to the garden today ?

188
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:52,806
No. l was going to,
but they’re out there...

189
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:55,959
... so l decided
it would be better to wait.

190
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:59,915
- The others ?
- Yes. Four of them.

191
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:04,603
- Did they see you ?
- Of course. They were waiting for me.

192
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,325
- Did you speak to them ?
- Yes.

193
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,481
l told them what you told me to say...

194
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:13,526
... that my blood
isn’t theirs for the taking.

195
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:16,446
Good for you, Enid.
That was very brave.

196
00:16:16,647 --> 00:16:17,682
Excuse me ?

197
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:20,840
What others ?

198
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:25,235
The invaders, dear,
from one of the moons of Saturn.

199
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:27,165
They’re cold-blooded, you see.

200
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:29,881
So they need our warm blood
for theirs.

201
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,555
You have to be very careful.

202
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:35,921
Dr. Fletcher
doesn’t think they’re real...

203
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:37,636
... but l know the truth.

204
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:42,081
Dr. Weir,
would you like to speak next ?

205
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:45,120
Perhaps you can tell the group
about your experience in Atlantis.

206
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:47,636
No.

207
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,118
Sometimes, when we share
these experiences--

208
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:53,165
l said, no.

209
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:44,079
Go away.

210
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,044
Go away !

211
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:36,523
- Hello.
- Hi.

212
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,678
Oh, please.

213
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,765
Will l ever remember the accident ?

214
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,121
l don’t know.

215
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:54,879
Often in cases like this,
the memory of the trauma never returns.

216
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:58,241
Maybe it’s the mind protecting itself.

217
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:00,836
l suppose it’s a good thing, really.

218
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:04,119
l mean, there’s pain enough,
even without remembering it.

219
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,082
What ?

220
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:12,045
It’s just, you’re doing great.

221
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,523
l’m impressed.

222
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:17,322
You’re sleeping well ?

223
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:20,604
Yes. l’m sleeping better
than l can remember.

224
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:23,645
Good. l think you’re ready.

225
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:26,526
Ready ?

226
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:39,363
Well, is it how you remember it ?

227
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,035
It’s exactly how l remember it.

228
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:50,406
Oh, Sedgewick. Hey, sweetie. Hey.

229
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,756
Hey.

230
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:53,758
Welcome home, sweetheart.

231
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:07,921
Hello, hello.

232
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:11,756
- General.
- Enough with the » general, » okay ?

233
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:13,076
It’s Jack.

234
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:15,118
But which Jack is it ?

235
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:16,796
What ?

236
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,397
l’m sorry. l was just trying
to have some fun at my own expense.

237
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,400
Too soon, maybe.

238
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:27,196
- So you all settled back in ?
- Getting there.

239
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:29,963
So l hear you’re going back
to teaching.

240
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,601
Yeah, my poli-sci class
at Georgetown.

241
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:35,042
They’re holding it open for me
for the fall.

242
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:39,802
Have you given any thought
to coming back to the negotiating table ?

243
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,442
That nonproliferation treaty...

244
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:46,963
... you kind of left us hanging
mid-sentence there.

245
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:50,682
Sure be nice to hear
the punch line someday.

246
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:55,318
And the U.N. would be okay with that ?

247
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:59,082
Not just okay, they’re insisting.

248
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:01,119
Really ?

249
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:03,039
When you’re the best,
you’re the best.

250
00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:05,641
Even if you’ve had a little...

251
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:10,005
... setback, so to speak.

252
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,683
He said awkwardly.

253
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,559
It’s only if you feel
you’re ready to go back.

254
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,276
Well, actually, yeah.

255
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:27,637
l think l am.

256
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:43,440
Hey.

257
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:46,237
It’s good to be home.

258
00:22:30,287 --> 00:22:32,198
What do you got, doc ?

259
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:34,525
It’s getting worse.

260
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:36,957
It’s not just her brain anymore.

261
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:39,277
It’s spreading throughout her body.

262
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:42,318
We’re losing her.

263
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:48,435
Those are all nanites ?

264
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:51,246
Aye. They’ve spread
throughout her entire body.

265
00:22:51,407 --> 00:22:52,806
How did they get inside her ?

266
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:56,323
Niam. He attacked her
in the Puddle Jumper.

267
00:22:57,767 --> 00:23:00,520
In that one moment,
he managed to infect her with nanites...

268
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:02,439
... that began replicating immediately.

269
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:05,600
Now they’re multiplying exponentially,
consuming her.

270
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:09,362
- How much time does she have ?
- l don’t think their intention’s to kill her.

271
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:12,799
If that were the case,
they could have easily done it already.

272
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:15,561
l don’t think there’s enough
to survive on their own.

273
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,877
They need Élizabeth’s body
as raw material.

274
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:21,244
They’re attempting to assimilate her,
transform her into one of them ?

275
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:25,366
Until they reach numbers to form a viable
independent entity, l would say so, yes.

276
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:27,085
This is how they replicate ?

277
00:23:27,247 --> 00:23:30,683
l doubt it’s the normal way.
It may be a last-ditch attempt to survive.

278
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:32,917
- How do we stop them ?
- EMP.

279
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:35,920
Hit them with the electromagnetic pulse
like we did last time.

280
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:38,806
l’m afraid we’re well beyond
that possibility now, colonel.

281
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:43,245
Nanites have bonded to neurons and cells
throughout her central nervous system.

282
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:47,116
If we attempt to disable them, we’Il
likely end up killing her along with them.

283
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:48,720
Then how do we help her ?

284
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:52,084
In a petri dish, her white blood cells
attack individual nanites...

285
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:55,523
... as though they were a bacterium
or a virus, quite successfully.

286
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:59,163
For some reason, inside the body,
there’s almost no immune response.

287
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:03,321
It’s as if the nanites themselves convinced
her immune system they pose no threat.

288
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:05,796
- How do they do that ?
- l have no idea.

289
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:09,998
l’ve begun administering drugs
to help boost her immunities.

290
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:12,444
- Doesn’t seem to be working.
- Not yet.

291
00:24:12,647 --> 00:24:14,285
l just increased the dosage.

292
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:18,437
For the moment,
we’re losing this battle.

293
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:32,043
Hey. Right on time. You all set ?

294
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:34,482
- l think so.
- Did you get some sleep ?

295
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:37,957
Yes. But still,
l’ve been really tired lately.

296
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:40,846
Maybe you’ve gotta work yourself
back into playing shape.

297
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:45,201
Spend time doing some short shifts
before you jump up to the first line.

298
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:48,677
l’m sorry. l don’t know
a thing about football.

299
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:52,127
Nor hockey, apparently.

300
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:54,800
Thanks.

301
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:57,237
Strange, Jack, l’m...

302
00:24:57,407 --> 00:24:59,477
l feel kind of numb.

303
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:02,605
- You know, l feel like that all the time.
- l’m serious.

304
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,519
Did you talk to Dr. Fletcher about it ?

305
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:06,763
Yes. He says
probably just my medications.

306
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:10,078
He’s gonna adjust the doses,
dial them back, see if that helps.

307
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:12,317
Probably just a matter
of balance then, eh ?

308
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:14,246
All right.

309
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:17,195
Now, just to be sure
we’re on the same page...

310
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:20,279
... we’re against the proliferation
of nuclear weapons, right ?

311
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:21,482
Got it.

312
00:25:34,007 --> 00:25:36,362
Do you think she’s aware we’re here ?

313
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,445
How can she be ? She’s unconscious.

314
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:43,160
You may be right.

315
00:25:43,327 --> 00:25:46,399
You could try talking to her.
Tell her to keep fighting.

316
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:48,956
And that will help exactly how ?

317
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:52,642
In a coma, one’s sense of hearing
is the last to go and the first to return.

318
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:56,523
There are cases where patients
were able to hear others talking to them.

319
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:59,485
Were these comas caused
by nanites invading peoples’bodies ?

320
00:25:59,647 --> 00:26:01,797
No, but there are indications
she’s thinking.

321
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:03,764
- You mean dreaming.
- More than that.

322
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:07,041
Her mind is extremely active
for someone in a coma.

323
00:26:07,207 --> 00:26:10,358
Her EEG reads almost as if
she were going about her daily life...

324
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:13,365
... which suggests
she may well be able to hear us.

325
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:15,717
What the hell are they doing to her ?

326
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:16,916
l wish l knew.

327
00:26:18,447 --> 00:26:21,245
The immune-boosting drugs
are having no effect.

328
00:26:22,687 --> 00:26:25,076
Aggressive little bastards.

329
00:26:27,447 --> 00:26:29,517
- What ?
- What ?

330
00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:31,803
That’s the same look l get
when l have an idea.

331
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:35,357
- How would you know how you looked ?
- It’s happened in front of a mirror.

332
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:36,642
Carson, what is it ?

333
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:40,757
l don’t know about brilliant,
but it just might...

334
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:42,918
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing ?

335
00:26:44,647 --> 00:26:46,478
If Carson’s right
and you can hear me...

336
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,923
... l suppose l should say
something profound.

337
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,642
Okay, l’m not so good at profound...

338
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:58,559
... but you should know...

339
00:26:58,727 --> 00:27:01,366
... we’re doing everything we can
to get you through this.

340
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:34,205
These nanites, l don’t know
what they’re putting you through.

341
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:36,198
l don’t know
what they’re doing to you...

342
00:27:37,847 --> 00:27:39,360
... but don’t let them get to you.

343
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,681
We’re doing everything we can
to bring you back...

344
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:49,838
... but you’ve got to do your part.

345
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:51,440
You gotta fight this.

346
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,360
l’m sure this is just a result...

347
00:28:04,527 --> 00:28:06,836
... of the adjustment l made
to your medications.

348
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:10,205
l think l may have
dialed them back too far.

349
00:28:10,407 --> 00:28:13,285
It’s all a question of balance.

350
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:16,439
That’s what General O’Neill said.

351
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:19,042
Yes. Well, he’s right.

352
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:22,879
Don’t worry.
We’Il get you back to normal.

353
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:28,085
<i>Élizabeth...</i>

354
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:33,361
What do you want ?

355
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:12,006
No. Wait. No.

356
00:29:12,207 --> 00:29:15,324
Let go of me ! No !

357
00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:31,246
Hey.

358
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:35,005
How you feeling ?

359
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:40,603
Why am l back here ?

360
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:42,122
They’re worried.

361
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:45,036
Frankly, so am l.

362
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:51,921
Look, obviously, l’ve been pushing you
a little hard on this treaty thing.

363
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:53,520
No.

364
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:56,360
- l feel fine.
- Well, you’re not.

365
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:00,401
You’re gonna be here
until you get better.

366
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,396
<i>Okay.</i>

367
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:11,000
We think we’ve found a way...

368
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:14,204
... to uncouple the nanite cells
from Élizabeth’s cells.

369
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:15,595
-« ou » ?We« ou » ??
- How ?

370
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:18,759
We create a distraction.

371
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,718
It finally occurred to me
why l wasn’t having any success.

372
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,117
What were the nanites originally
designed to do ?

373
00:30:25,327 --> 00:30:28,160
- Fight the Wraith.
- That’s what we’Il get them to do now.

374
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,524
By implanting a small amount
of Wraith tissue into Dr. Weir’s body--

375
00:30:31,687 --> 00:30:33,598
- Just like a tumor.
- A small tumor, yes.

376
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,723
- The nanite cells will--
- Will attack it.

377
00:30:35,887 --> 00:30:37,605
It’s what they’re programmed to do...

378
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:40,884
... which will draw them away
from Élizabeth’s cells, unbinding them.

379
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,926
It will only last a few seconds before
the nanites attack the Wraith tissue...

380
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:47,203
- ... and return focus to Dr. Weir.
- All we need.

381
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:51,246
Distraction to draw them away from her
so we can zap them with the EM pulse.

382
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,156
Okay. Let’s do it.

383
00:30:57,327 --> 00:30:58,680
Rodney, come here a minute.

384
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:50,677
Wait a minute. Aren’t we supposed
to turn off all Earth-based equipment...

385
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:52,360
... in the room before we do this ?

386
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:54,802
The EM pulse will be directed
through the scanner.

387
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:56,685
The other equipment should be fine.

388
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:05,478
l keep seeing these symbols.

389
00:32:06,487 --> 00:32:09,047
- Eight of them.
- Do they mean something to you ?

390
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:12,964
This is the dialing sequence
for the stargate.

391
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,078
From Earth to Atlantis.

392
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:17,005
« Dialing sequence« ou » ??
Like a phone number ?

393
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:20,245
Look, l know
you think l’m delusional...

394
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:22,997
... but l can’t shake
the overpowering feeling...

395
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:28,799
... that something or someone
is trying to communicate with me.

396
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:33,080
- And what are they trying to say ?
- That Atlantis is real.

397
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:35,642
And that l have to get back there.

398
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:37,156
And...

399
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:40,241
So we’re the fantasy ?

400
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,799
- Yes.
- You know...

401
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:48,757
... l don’t mind being fantasized
about occasionally...

402
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:51,641
... but come on, we’re right here.

403
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:53,276
How would you get there ?

404
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:56,322
Go to Stargate Command.

405
00:32:57,447 --> 00:32:59,756
So now you just wanna waltz
into NORAD, is that it ?

406
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:01,519
l know what you told me.

407
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:06,239
But l also know what l feel.

408
00:33:06,647 --> 00:33:10,959
Atlantis is real.
And l will get back there.

409
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:12,322
And it’s working.

410
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:17,916
They’re moving fast.

411
00:33:18,087 --> 00:33:20,647
- Get ready with the EM pulse.
- l’m ready on your mark.

412
00:33:21,247 --> 00:33:23,363
And now.

413
00:33:29,527 --> 00:33:31,279
l thought you said that--

414
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:35,682
- It worked.
- Carson, you might be an absolute--

415
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,203
Oh, no. We didn’t get them all.

416
00:33:39,407 --> 00:33:40,760
How is that possible ?

417
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:43,162
l don’t bloody know.

418
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:45,716
They’ve been using organic material
to replicate...

419
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:47,957
... which rendered them immune
to the EM pulse.

420
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,276
So now what ?

421
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,724
They’ve started replicating again.

422
00:33:56,807 --> 00:33:58,718
You spit out your pills again,
didn’t you ?

423
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:02,884
You disappoint me, Élizabeth.

424
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:04,759
The pills are not gonna help me.

425
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:06,878
Not if you won’t let them.

426
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:10,041
You leave me no other choice.

427
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:13,525
No !

428
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:24,001
Don’t do this.

429
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:27,802
This will hurt.

430
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:35,523
- What do we do now ?
- Zap her again.

431
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:37,200
Keep it up till they’re gone.

432
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,927
A number of nanites
have migrated into the arteries...

433
00:34:40,087 --> 00:34:42,521
... that supply blood flow
to functions of her brain.

434
00:34:42,687 --> 00:34:44,405
They’re telling us they can kill her.

435
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:46,364
Switch her over
to 100 percent oxygen.

436
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:48,882
Start her on norepinephrine,
five mics per minute.

437
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:52,756
Reducing blood flow to parts of her brain
will put her into cerebral hypoxia.

438
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:54,320
What will that do ?

439
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:57,399
Render her essentially brain-dead,
which makes no sense.

440
00:34:57,607 --> 00:34:59,518
Unless she’s fighting it.

441
00:35:02,287 --> 00:35:04,642
It’s the only thing that makes sense.

442
00:35:04,927 --> 00:35:06,838
The replicators see us
as organic machines.

443
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:09,601
They’re trying to take control
of the machine they’re in.

444
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:12,156
You mean,
replace Élizabeth’s consciousness ?

445
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:14,477
Maybe when we zapped her
with the EMP...

446
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:16,683
... we killed enough
of them to even the odds.

447
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:18,883
Gave her a fighting chance
at stopping them.

448
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:22,796
Reality check. There are
microscopic robots in her brain.

449
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:24,161
How does she fight that ?

450
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:27,399
You said her mind was active,
like she was thinking, living life.

451
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:30,280
What if this was the only way
they could get to her ?

452
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:34,042
What if they were trying
to force her to give up ?

453
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:36,801
- A battle of wills ?
- Exactly.

454
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:40,318
Her neural activity supports
Colonel Sheppard’s hypothesis, Rodney.

455
00:35:40,887 --> 00:35:42,366
So, what, we can’t do anything ?

456
00:35:42,527 --> 00:35:46,884
l can increase the oxygen levels
in her blood, give her a little more time...

457
00:35:47,087 --> 00:35:51,922
- ... but yes, she’s on her own.
- No. She’s not.

458
00:35:55,047 --> 00:35:57,117
You’re not alone.
We’re right here with you.

459
00:35:57,287 --> 00:35:58,481
You have to fight this.

460
00:35:58,647 --> 00:36:00,205
<i>Fight this. Fight this...</i>

461
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:55,119
Dr. Weir ?

462
00:36:56,327 --> 00:36:57,316
It’s okay.

463
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:00,404
You’re safe now.

464
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:01,802
Where am l ?

465
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:04,166
Stargate Command.

466
00:37:05,247 --> 00:37:06,805
It’s okay.

467
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,520
Follow me.

468
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,046
Élizabeth.

469
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:14,199
Don’t listen to them.

470
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,156
What’s wrong ?

471
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,005
This way.

472
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:24,158
l’m not going to hurt you.

473
00:37:25,247 --> 00:37:27,442
The hell you aren’t.

474
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:42,365
They’ve begun to spread faster.
We’re losing her.

475
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,245
Not yet we’re not.

476
00:37:44,447 --> 00:37:45,596
What are you doing ?

477
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:48,358
What are you, crazy ?
She could infect you.

478
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:50,159
Élizabeth.

479
00:37:52,047 --> 00:37:53,560
John.

480
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:56,201
You’ve been infected by nanites.

481
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,875
They’re trying to take control
of your mind and body.

482
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:01,161
Don’t let them do it.

483
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:04,198
You have to fight them.

484
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,556
So fight.

485
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,405
Élizabeth.

486
00:38:08,727 --> 00:38:10,285
You have to come with us.

487
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:13,286
l’m sorry.

488
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:16,201
You know which way you have to go.

489
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:18,646
Run.

490
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:26,485
Get him out of there.

491
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,442
Put him into isolation
and run a scan immediately.

492
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:49,446
l can’t let you go.

493
00:38:49,647 --> 00:38:51,399
You’re not General O’Neill.

494
00:38:52,327 --> 00:38:53,840
Élizabeth, listen to me.

495
00:38:54,047 --> 00:38:56,197
You see that ? That’s the stargate.

496
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,722
And yes, leaving
is exactly what l plan to do.

497
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:00,406
l won’t let you go.

498
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:02,120
You can’t stop me.

499
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:05,918
On the contrary. l already have.

500
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:08,802
l made your friend disappear,
haven’t l ?

501
00:39:09,207 --> 00:39:10,196
That’s right.

502
00:39:10,407 --> 00:39:14,036
He can’t help you now.
And you can’t possibly get past me.

503
00:39:14,807 --> 00:39:16,035
So you see...

504
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,115
... you’ve lost.

505
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:37,920
Where am l ?

506
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:41,085
The infirmary. How you feeling ?

507
00:39:45,607 --> 00:39:47,165
l’m back in Atlantis.

508
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:49,799
You never left.

509
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:09,039
Still up, huh ?

510
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:10,726
Oh, hey.

511
00:40:11,727 --> 00:40:14,525
Yeah, l wasn’t all that keen
to go back to sleep just yet.

512
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:15,876
Understandable.

513
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:18,203
l’m glad you’ve been released
from quarantine.

514
00:40:18,407 --> 00:40:19,886
Yeah.

515
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:22,476
Well, l guess the nanites
were too focused on you...

516
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:23,796
... to spread to me.

517
00:40:26,247 --> 00:40:29,922
l now realize just how insidious
they really are.

518
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:32,921
If such a small number
of them could do that to me...

519
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:34,918
Let’s just take it as a win right now.

520
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:36,759
All right. Still...

521
00:40:37,527 --> 00:40:39,757
... l can’t believe l was only out
