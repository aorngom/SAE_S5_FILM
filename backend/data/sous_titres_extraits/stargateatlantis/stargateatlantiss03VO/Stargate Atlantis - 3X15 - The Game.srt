00:00:03,647 --> 00:00:06,366
Let me ask you a question.
Say there’s a runaway train.

1
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:10,520
It’s hurtling towards ten people
standing in the middle of the tracks.

2
00:00:10,687 --> 00:00:13,076
Only way to save those people
is to flip a switch...

3
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,796
... send the train down another set
of tracks. The only problem is...

4
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:19,640
... there is a baby
in the middle of those tracks.

5
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:21,877
Why would anyone leave a baby
in a harm’s way ?

6
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:24,356
l don’t know. That’s not the point.
It’s a dilemma.

7
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:26,279
Katie brought it up the other night.

8
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:30,360
The question is, is it appropriate
to divert the train and kill the one baby...

9
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:31,642
... to save ten people ?

10
00:00:32,807 --> 00:00:34,877
Wouldn’t the people
see the train and move ?

11
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:36,315
No, they wouldn’t see it.

12
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:40,442
- Why not ?
- Look, l don’t know. Say they’re blind.

13
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:42,080
- All of them ?
- Yes, all of them.

14
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:44,283
Why don’t you call out
and tell them to move ?

15
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:47,285
- Because they can’t hear you.
- What, they’re deaf too ?

16
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:50,162
- How fast is the train ?
- The speed doesn’t matter.

17
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:54,240
It does. If it’s going slow, you could
outrun it and shove everyone to the side.

18
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:57,598
- Or better yet, go get the baby.
- For God’s sake, l was trying to--

32
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,922

How did your face get on that flag ?

38
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:04,087
Oh, l don’t know.
Here’s the thing, though.

39
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:06,715
That flag’s similar to the one
l designed in our game.

40
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,082
It’s exactly the one you designed
in our game.

41
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:11,238
- What game ?
- The game Rodney and l play.

42
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:13,398
- We didn’t tell you ?
- Been playing a while.

43
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,684
Yeah, off and on in our spare time,
at night, between missions.

44
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:19,680
- l could’ve sworn we told you about it.
- What game ?

45
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:21,876
It started a while ago.

00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,555
McKAY : <i>A few months after we arrived,</i>
<i>we were exploring...</i>

47
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:27,719
<i>... checking out labs on the east pier,</i>
<i>when we discovered a room.</i>

48
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:30,082
<i>There were several Ancient consoles</i>
<i>and screens.</i>

49
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:31,726
<i>It’s quite an impressive layout.</i>

50
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:35,118
<i>As usual, everything sprang to life</i>
<i>as soon as we entered.</i>

51
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:42,117
<i>First we thought</i>
<i>it was a geological facility.</i>

52
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:45,723
<i>There was a screen with a map that we</i>
<i>assumed was off the Lantian mainland.</i>

53
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:48,242
Yes, l remember you briefing me
about that.

54
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:51,007
- We did tell you.
- You mentioned nothing about a game.

55
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:54,165
Because we didn’t know what it was.
Rodney studied more closely.

56
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,602
SHEPPARD : <i>He realized</i>
<i>it wasn’t a geological lab at all.</i>

57
00:03:56,767 --> 00:04:00,282
McKAY : <i>No, it turns out it was,</i>
<i>in fact, a kind of Ancient game room.</i>

58
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:03,883
<i>The map was a fictional civilization.</i>
<i>It was part of a simulated world.</i>

59
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:05,361
Sweet.

60
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:08,405
What you do is, you take
these countries in a database...

61
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:10,159
... and you assume control of them.

62
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:12,238
Two societies, separated by a river.

63
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:14,398
Sheppard took one country.
l took the other.

64
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:17,041
First thing Rodney did
besides renaming his country...

65
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:19,163
... was to put his face all over the flag.

66
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:24,002
l think you need to check
this planet out.

67
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:37,636
So the ancestors created this game ?

68
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:39,604
Yes, but this is no ordinary game.

69
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:42,235
l mean, it is incredibly challenging,
instructional.

70
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,921
The sheer number of options
built into it. Staggering.

71
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:47,999
- How does one play it ?
- Figure out a way to run your country.

72
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:50,596
Yeah, you build roads,
you establish laws...

73
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:53,440
... mould it to your own
specific ideology.

McKAY :
<i>You can control everything.</i>

75
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:58,644
<i>Proper sanitation systems,</i>
<i>water delivery, transportation.</i>

76

<i>can be manipulated.</i>

- So how do you win this game ?
- It’s not really about winning.

80
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:16,644
McKAY : <i>It’s more about whose society</i>
<i>outshines the other’s.</i>

81
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:20,806
l mean, who creates a better
infrastructure, who’s better at trade.

82
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:24,999
What ? Hey, don’t start.
l tried to negotiate with you.

83
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:29,399
Making a list of demands and not giving
anything in return is not negotiating.

84
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:32,679
- l offered you a crop of beans.
- l don’t need beans. l need lumber.

- Geldar ?
- It’s the name of Rodney’s country.

He named it after a girl
he stalked in college.

of some kind of mythological land.

00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,964
Yes, yes. It is an amazing
piece of technology.

166
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:55,324
It appears to be a sociological
experiment designed by the Ancients...

167
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:59,036
... to help them as they were seeding
civilizations throughout Pegasus.

168
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:00,879
l’ve had a chance to look at it.

169
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:03,800
There are many more civilizations
in the game’s database.

170
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:07,004
Really ? l thought Rodney
said there were only the two.

171
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:10,756
That’s what he thought. The countries
that he and Colonel Sheppard...

172
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:13,157
... are controlling
are on this specific planet...

173
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:17,559
... but l’ve been able to access the codes
to unlock additional levels to the game.

174
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:20,516
l mean, to the experiment.

175
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:24,316
l discovered countries on planets
throughout the galaxy.

176
00:11:24,807 --> 00:11:26,718
Some have been idle for 10,000 years.

177
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,162
They’re waiting instructions
from the Ancients...

178
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:33,485
... but some have managed to develop
on their own, even flourish.

179
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:35,797
Some have been destroyed by war...

180
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:38,481
... and others have been
completely wiped out.

181
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:44,524
Not that Rodney’s and Colonel
Sheppard’s societies are on this path.

182
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:50,924
So much power at one’s fingertips.

183
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:55,476
It’s amazing,
the attraction of this game.

184
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:04,644
We’ve managed to achieve propulsion
through hand-powered propellers...

185
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,844
... but now, we’re undertaking tests
of steam-powered propulsion.

186
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:11,283
Only this morning, l completed
a test that proved quite promising.

187
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:13,722
Really ? That’s great.

188
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,764
- You’re pleased ?
- Yes.

189
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:18,760
Yes. l mean, this is--
This is quite an achievement.

190
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:25,356
What’s he doing here ?

191
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:27,800
It wasn’t my idea.

192
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:30,478
Dr. Rodney McKay...

193
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:32,200
... meet Baden.

194
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:34,716
Oh, your guy.

195
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,481
- My guy.
- Yeah, it figures.

196
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:39,598
l should have you arrested
for trespassing.

197
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,687
- Go ahead and try.
SHEPPARD : Easy now.

198
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,879
l brought him here because we need
to have a little discussion.

199
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:47,366
l have nothing to say to him.

200
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:50,039
- Fine with me.
- Yeah, maybe not.

201
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:54,000
But we definitely have something
to say to you.

202
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:58,643
So his story is pretty much
the same as Nola’s.

203
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:02,083
His ancestors received instructions
from their oracle...

204
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:04,238
... who disappeared
for thousands of years...

205
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:07,683
... only to suddenly resume
communicating a few years ago.

206
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,560
McKAY : Let me guess. He told you
to double the size of your army.

207
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:13,520
Yes, he has a capable army
and some nice villages.

208
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:16,605
No people riding bicycles,
or hot-air balloons...

209
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,156
- ... because we weren’t cheating.
- l didn’t cheat.

210
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:21,124
Have you come to agree
to our proposals ?

211
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:22,561
BADEN :
You mean demands ?

212
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:24,722
Never.

213
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:30,001
- Then l refuse to sit at the same table--
- Look, look. Please, just sit.

214
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:34,286
Thank you.

215
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:38,076
This hostility between you.

216
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:41,876
Have your people lived like this
for thousands of years ?

217
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,999
No. There was once peace
between our lands.

218
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:48,436
Oh, no.

219
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:53,556
So this hostility,
did it start a few years ago ?

220
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:57,760
Yes, shortly after the Oracle
resumed communicating with us.

221
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:07,005
So they’re starving ?

222
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:10,796
Well, not as of yet. If they don’t change
their approach to agriculture...

223
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:13,242
... it won’t be long
before their people go hungry.

224
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:16,245
The frustrating thing is,
there is a piece of fertile soil...

225
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:20,764
... in the south of the country that would
be ideal for tuber cultivation, you know ?

226
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,922
- l’m sorry, tuber ?
- Tuber, yeah. Tuber.

227
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:26,476
It is indigenous to the planet.

228
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:28,603
It’s like a potato.

229
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:31,358
So why didn’t you say potato ?

230
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:34,724
Because it’s not a potato, it’s larger.

231
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:38,516
It has the same texture
and nutrients as a potato...

232
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:40,524
... but it’s like a cantaloupe.

233
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:45,398
- That’s a pretty big potato.
- It is a big potato.

234
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:49,037
- If they plant this thing there, it’Il grow ?
- Yeah, whole fields of it.

235
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:52,040
l mean, they could sustain
an entire village...

236
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:54,004
... but they are oblivious to it.

237
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:58,039
Well, tell them. Anonymously.

238
00:14:58,447 --> 00:14:59,436
Oh, come on, doc.

239
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,962
You can either stand here
and let the people die...

240
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:04,482
... or you can help them out.

241
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:06,763
Sounds like a no-brainer to me.

242
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:14,446
As soon as we input the instructions
into our console, they are relayed back...

243
00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:17,963
... to this device by a number
of satellites in orbit over your planet.

244
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:21,244
Once you’ve carried out the instructions,
the satellites transmit...

245
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:24,365
... the real-time results
back to us on our home world.

246
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:29,001
So you’re saying this is a game ?

247
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:34,036
No. No. l mean,
we thought it was a game, but--

248
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:37,523
We didn’t know there were real people
on the other end.

249
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,405
You are the Oracle ?

250
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,922
l’m your Oracle, yes.

251
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:46,046
- That doesn’t sound right.
- This is difficult to absorb...

252
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:48,846
- ... but it is all true.
DEX : You flew in the Puddle Jumper.

253
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:52,238
- You know they have the technology.
- l’m not listening to this.

254
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:54,318
Just hold on here.
We can prove it to you.

255
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:55,562
BADEN :
How ?

256
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,085
Let’s go for a ride.

257
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:17,320
Baden. Nola. This is Dr. Weir,
the leader of our expedition.

258
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:19,639
Welcome to Atlantis.

259
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:23,197
If these two gentlemen haven’t done
so already, let me please offer you...

260
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:26,803
... our sincerest apologies
for this intrusion into your lives.

261
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,804
- Intrusion ?
- Imposition, maybe.

262
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,286
And a benevolent one at that.

263
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:33,206
If you could see the villages
compared to when we started--

264
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:34,760
WEIR :
Rodney.

265
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,517
Now, why don’t you take them
to your game room ?

266
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:39,598
Show them what you two
have been up to.

267
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,041
Right.

268
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:42,996
Shall we ?

269
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:53,398
So this is Geldar and this is Hallona.
Look, two weeks ago...

270
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,683
... l instructed you
to start digging a well...

271
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:59,317
... for the new settlement
on the eastern slope, and look here.

272
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:01,364
There. See ?

273
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:06,523
Construction’s already begun.

274
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,640
Yes.

275
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:10,840
l gave the order myself.

276
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:15,606
Our lives are just a game.

277
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:21,484
Well, now, no. They’re not games
to you, and in our defense...

278
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:23,478
... we were trying to improve your lives.

279
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:26,002
Everything we did,
every instruction we gave...

280
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,158
... was to better conditions
for your people.

281
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:31,439
- Even if that meant cheating.
- Okay, enough with that already.

282
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:38,158
McKAY : Is the room okay ?
NOLA : It’s fine.

283
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:43,405
Well, then, if you need anything at all,
don’t hesitate to ask, okay ?

284
00:17:44,527 --> 00:17:47,360
You hungry ? Because we could walk
across to the mess hall.

285
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:50,325
They’ve got, l think,
it’s Salisbury steak today.

286
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:55,078
It’s very good. They have a gravy
that they put on the steak part...

287
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:57,960
The Oracle was a god to us.

288
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:02,486
l believed in his teachings.

289
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:05,036
So much so that my people
elected me leader...

290
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:07,675
... because of my passion
for scientific advancement.

291
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,003
Well, they obviously made
the right choice.

292
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:13,279
Now l must resolve myself
to the fact...

293
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:16,241
... that the Oracle is only a man.

294
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,486
Yeah.

295
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,645
Sorry about that.

296
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,443
It’s like l said, though, l did what l did
with the best of intentions.

297
00:18:24,607 --> 00:18:25,881
To win a game.

298
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:31,002
No. No, no. It is not about
winning or losing.

299
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,398
The information l gave you
and your people is very real, very useful.

300
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:36,035
l’ve set you on a course...

301
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:39,244
... that will allow you to develop
into a modern society.

302
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:41,796
Where were you two years ago ?
You were a primitive...

303
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:44,527
... disparate cluster
of villages stalled in development.

304
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:46,240
Now you’re making dirigibles.

305
00:18:46,447 --> 00:18:48,563
Do you have any idea
how momentous that is ?

306
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,237
The Oracle once said :

307
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:57,480
« Ask not what Geldar can do for you,
but what you can do for Geldar. »

308
00:18:58,727 --> 00:18:59,796
Those were your words.

309
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,117
Um-- Give or take.

310
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:03,879
They are very wise.

311
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:06,000
Yes.

312
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:08,320
Yes, they are.

313
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:13,080
SHEPPARD : Now that you know the truth,
you can go back to living your own lives.

314
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:15,243
We won’t bother you anymore.

315
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:18,205
No. You must still help us.

316
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:21,002
You don’t need our help.
You’Il be fine.

317
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:22,242
We need more weapons.

318
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:25,763
The flying machine
you brought us here in.

319
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:28,763
You called it a Puddle Jumper.

320
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:30,201
Our army could use it.

321
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,803
No. We can’t do that.

322
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:36,160
But you encouraged me
to increase the military.

323
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:41,202
In response to McKay, the other oracle,
doing things that l thought were--

324
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:46,805
Aggressive ? Arrogant ?
Demeaning to me and my people ?

325
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:50,516
l will give you arrogant
and demeaning, but--

326
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:53,639
The people of Geldar have started
digging beneath our borders...

327
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:56,605
... to exploit coal resources on our land.

328
00:19:57,287 --> 00:19:58,276
Really ?

329
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:01,157
It was only confirmed yesterday.

330
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:04,842
This, after several diplomatic attempts
to reach a compromise.

331
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:06,838
Yeah, we couldn’t come
to an agreement...

332

[EXPLOSION]

666
00:37:58,047 --> 00:38:01,323
Hundreds have died. How can you
stand by and let this happen ?

667
00:38:01,527 --> 00:38:03,518
[EXPLOSIONS]

668
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:08,045
- Nola’s army has surrounded the village.
- Get to the Jumper.

669
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:09,646
They just destroyed it.

670
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:16,364
[EXPLOSIONS]

671
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:19,159
We’re being overwhelmed.

672
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:20,965
What should we do ?

673
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:22,276
[EXPLOSION]

674
00:38:43,807 --> 00:38:45,286
Game over.

675
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:51,125
SHEPPARD :
<i>Rodney, are you there ?</i>

676
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:55,600
Yeah, we hear you. l’Il give you a call
when we’re ready to be picked up.

677
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,200
<i>Got it.</i>

678
00:38:57,607 --> 00:38:59,484
l don’t understand.

679
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:01,242
What’s going on ?

680
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:06,043
What you just witnessed is what
l would call another level to the game.

681
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:08,198
See, we were beamed up earlier
to our ship.

682
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:10,597
The <i>Daedalus,</i> in orbit over your planet.

683
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:13,679
While we were there, l had Dr. McKay
hack into the two devices.

684
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:16,805
Upload doomsday scenarios
for your countries into the game.

685
00:39:17,007 --> 00:39:20,477
Everything you saw just now
was transmitted from the <i>Daedalus.</i>

686
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:23,399
You mean...

687
00:39:24,087 --> 00:39:25,645
... none of this was real ?

688
00:39:26,527 --> 00:39:28,836
No. No one was hurt.
No one was killed.

689
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:31,483
All just part of the simulation.

690
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:35,242
In reality your two armies are standing
down, awaiting further instructions.

691
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:38,242
But we heard explosions. We felt them.

692
00:39:38,447 --> 00:39:43,282
Thanks to some pinpoint shots
from our friends in the <i>Daedalus.</i>

693
00:39:43,807 --> 00:39:45,718
Really added to the realism, didn’t it ?

694
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,558
l’m sorry that we had to do that...

695
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:55,000
... but you needed to see
how this could end.

696
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,956
Feel what a real war is like.

697
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:10,564
You still think it was the right path
for your people ?

698
00:40:20,247 --> 00:40:22,044
Thanks, Melanie.

699
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:26,360
Gentlemen.

700
00:40:26,527 --> 00:40:28,006
SHEPPARD :
How’s it going ?

701
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:30,078
It’s still going.

702
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:31,966
We’re just taking a break.

703
00:40:32,127 --> 00:40:34,277
There’s a lot of animosity
to be unraveled...

704
00:40:34,447 --> 00:40:37,644
... but l think they are finally willing
to try to make it work.

705
00:40:37,807 --> 00:40:39,399
It’s about time.

706
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,080
Yeah. And you two ?

707
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:43,635
Called a truce yet ?

708
00:40:44,047 --> 00:40:45,605
Yeah, sure, we’re good.

709
00:40:45,807 --> 00:40:47,763
We’re gonna stick to chess
from now on.

710
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:50,925
- As long as Rodney doesn’t cheat.
- Please, like l need to cheat.

711
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:53,163
Okay, l’Il leave you to it then.

712
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:55,202
Ha.

713
00:40:57,807 --> 00:40:58,796
Ha.

714
00:40:58,967 --> 00:41:00,241
Checkmate.

715
00:41:00,407 --> 00:41:04,400
- What ? Oh, no. What happened there ?
- What happened is l kicked your ass.

716
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:07,400
No, no, l was distracted.
She was-- Okay, we’re going again.

717
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:09,205
Best of 10.
