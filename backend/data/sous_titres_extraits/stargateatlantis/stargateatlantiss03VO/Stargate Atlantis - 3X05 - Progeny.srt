0
00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:08,481
Wormhole’s established.
M.A.L.P. is on the way.

1
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:15,805
- What kind of facility is this ?
- Some sort of research outpost.

2
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:19,363
The database has little information
other than whatever was being done...

3
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:21,358
... was completed.
The place is abandoned.

4
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:24,200
- Well, sounds promising.
- We have M.A.L.P. telemetry.

5
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:26,875
Environmental sensors
indicate viable life support.

6
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:29,999
- Visuals coming in now.
- Put it on-screen.

7
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:34,757
Or maybe it never was abandoned.

8
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:39,840
Ancients ?

9
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,838
- He got one of their scanners.
- So do we.

10
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:44,282
Just because they know how to use
Ancient technology--

11
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:47,245
<i>I am speaking to whoever</i>
<i>sent this machine to our home.</i>

12
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:50,160
<i>If you intend us harm,</i>
<i>proceed no further.</i>

13
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:52,124
<i>But if you come in friendship...</i>

14
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:54,881
<i>... please know</i>
<i>you are most welcome here.</i>

15
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:10,081
Put that thing away.
We told them we were friendly.

16
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:11,682
l’m friendly.

17
00:01:11,847 --> 00:01:13,439
Is that thing set to » stun« ou » ??

18
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:19,446
- Friendlier.
- You coming too ?

19
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:22,599
Well, Ancients or not,
they’re obviously an advanced society.

20
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:26,362
l would like to establish diplomatic
relations with them immediately.

21
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:29,166
Well, you’re the boss. Let’s go.

22
00:01:40,407 --> 00:01:41,556
What happened ?

23
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:49,922
We make a U-turn ?

24
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:54,080
No. This is the place. We’re here.

25
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:00,556
Look.

26
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:06,924
So not exactly like our gateroom.

27
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:14,118
Hello. We’re the people
who sent the machine through earlier.

28
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:16,603
We come in friendship.

29
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:23,241
l am Niam. Welcome to Asuras.

30
00:03:35,487 --> 00:03:39,036
Still waiting to meet an ancient
race that’s invented the car.

31
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:41,926
Our destination is not much further.

32
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:44,842
The High Council is eager to meet you.

33
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,725
How long have your people lived here ?

34
00:03:46,887 --> 00:03:49,162
We built this city
thousands of years ago.

35
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:51,283
You actually built it ?
You didn’t find it ?

36
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:54,245
- No.
- You’ve had no trouble with the Wraith ?

37
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:56,443
- No.
- Any particular reason ?

38
00:03:56,607 --> 00:03:58,245
The Wraith do not concern us.

39
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:00,045
See ? He didn’t answer my question.

40
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,926
l’m sorry, you didn’t actually
answer my question.

41
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:10,758
- Oh, my--
- No kidding.

42
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:26,966
How many people live here ?

43
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:28,355
Millions.

44
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:31,325
The power requirements
for a city this size must be enormous.

45
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:33,000
Plus shielding from the Wraith...

46
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:36,159
... we’re talking, what, three
Zero-Point Modules, maybe four.

47
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:41,355
Sorry. ZPMs. A device that taps vast
amounts of power from vacuum energy.

48
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:43,882
Oh, yes. We have many of those.

49
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:46,003
Exactly how many is » many« ou » ??

50
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,964
Exactly doesn’t matter.
Many is plenty.

51
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:50,357
Truthfully, l do not know
the exact number.

52
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:52,245
More than enough to suit our needs.

53
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:54,284
l assume
that you built them yourselves ?

54
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:55,482
- Yes.
- Yes.

55
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:57,603
- Rodney, you’re slobbering.
- Please.

56
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,359
The Council is waiting.

57
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:04,205
- Well, we have our answer.
- To what question ?

58
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,085
Whether or not they’re Ancients.

59
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:09,080
In which case,
l got a bone to pick with him.

60
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:11,275
Where did you come from ?

61
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:14,757
We are explorers. We come
from a world very far from here.

62
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:18,397
Really far.
In fact, you can’t get there from here.

63
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,205
How did you happen to discover us ?

64
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,244
We came across an Ancient outpost...

65
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:26,286
- ... that listed this gate in its database.
- But no other information, l might add.

66
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:28,642
The database neglected
to include information...

67
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:31,924
... on a society of millions of Ancients,
such as yourselves.

68
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:33,998
- Why is that ?
- We are the last of those...

69
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,123
... you refer to as » Ancients. »

70
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:39,677
We were a race united in our pursuit
of knowledge and enlightenment...

71
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:41,361
... but our paths diverged...

72
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:43,961
... after a disagreement
tore the fabric of that unity.

73
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:45,958
What kind of a disagreement ?

74
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:50,325
Suffice it to say they chose to disregard
our counsel during a time of conflict...

75
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:54,596
... and they suffered the consequences
at the hands of a relentless enemy.

76
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,405
The Wraith.

77
00:05:56,807 --> 00:06:00,004
We parted ways with our brothers
and sisters, and came here...

78
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,681
... where we have thrived
for many thousands of years.

79
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:05,520
Yeah, you’ve been doing
a lot of thriving.

80
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,083
May l ask what counsel...

81
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:10,761
... did you offer
that the others chose to disregard ?

82
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:13,122
Our Ancient brothers were arrogant...

83
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:15,847
... which led them to greatly
underestimate the Wraith...

84
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:18,043
... an enemy
inferior in intelligence, yes...

85
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:20,880
... but vastly superior
in numbers and ruthlessness.

86
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,117
Wouldn’t have been outnumbered
if you helped.

87
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:26,563
- There’s that bone l wanted to pick.
- You said they were your brothers.

88
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:29,287
Where we come from
we take care of our family.

89
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:33,402
What my friend is trying to say is...

90
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,239
... there’s still a lot of Wraith,
and we could use your help.

91
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:40,080
Eradication of them
is among our goals.

92
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:42,645
You mean you have a plan ?

93
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:44,126
We do.

94
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:45,766
Great. Let’s hear it.

95
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:49,916
Your plan, l mean.

96
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:54,160
l doubt that you would be able
to grasp its complexity and scope.

97
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,997
- l’m very good with complexity.
- And scope.

98
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,361
All you need to know...

99
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:01,405
... is that one day soon
the Wraith will exist no more.

100
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,319
All we need to know ?

101
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:06,047
There are matters of importance
for me to attend to.

102
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:10,405
In the meantime, you are explorers,
and in need of rest and sustenance.

103
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:14,924
We have made arrangements for you
to spend a short time among us.

104
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,283
He says the other Ancients
are arrogant ?

105
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:25,678
l apologize if you felt Oberoth
was condescending in any way.

106
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:26,996
How about in every way.

107
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:30,364
It is difficult for him to see you
as capable of understanding.

108
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:32,563
Yeah, well,
how many Ph. D. s does he have ?

109
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:35,878
l was wondering, your people have
been here for thousands of years ?

110
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:37,082
- Yes.
- In that time...

111
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:39,886
... most Ancients
we know have Ascended.

112
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:41,924
You know of Ascension ?

113
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:46,877
Well, yes. In fact, we always thought
that Ancients were no longer around.

114
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:50,244
That most of them evolved
to the point of transforming...

115
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:52,875
- ... into beings of pure energy.
- This is true.

116
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,043
But l take it your people
aren’t interested ?

117
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:58,880
Oh, Ascension is the goal
of many of us...

118
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:01,921
... but Oberoth feels
there is still much to do.

119
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:04,396
We must become all that we can.

120
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:07,844
You don’t agree with him, do you ?

121
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:14,156
Your guest quarters are this way.

122
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:20,079
Must have been quite a serious
falling-out for the Ancients...

123
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:23,398
... to eliminate any reference
to them in the entire database.

124
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,637
Unless they’re lying.

125
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,962
Might it not be possible that these
people merely discovered this city...

126
00:08:30,447 --> 00:08:32,165
... as you discovered Atlantis ?

127
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:35,319
Wouldn’t be surprised.
They don’t seem very Ancienty to me.

128
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:38,124
Ancienty ?

129
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:41,438
Yes, that’s the word l was looking for.

130
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:43,723
You think they could be deceiving us ?

131
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:47,243
Teyla’s right. They could’ve found
the city and moved in years ago.

132
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:51,195
l feel they are hiding something.

133
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:54,120
Other than their plan to defeat
the Wraith, you mean ?

134
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:55,800
There’s no plan.

135
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:59,796
No. l don’t think so either.

136
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:01,764
Why would they say that
if they don’t ?

137
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:04,999
They figured a way to hide
from the galaxy, including the Wraith...

138
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:08,716
... and are happy to go on with their lives
just minding their own business.

139
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:10,925
Whoever they are.

140
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:14,397
l think that
is what we need to find out.

141
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:23,398
Thank you for taking
the time to see me.

142
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,285
l felt we might achieve more...

143
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:28,644
... in a one-on-one meeting,
leader to leader.

144
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:31,002
What is it you wish to achieve ?

145
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:34,398
The establishment of diplomatic
and trade relations between our people.

146
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,080
Trading ?

147
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:40,206
Do you really believe that you have
anything of value to offer us ?

148
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,240
It’s possible, Oberoth.

149
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,875
And there is only one way
to find that out.

150
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:48,198
But l do know that there is something
you could offer us.

151
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,681
That is assistance
with our fight against the Wraith.

152
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:55,317
As l’ve said before, we will commence
our plan at a time of our choosing.

153
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:59,322
Would you consider sharing tools so
that we could better protect ourselves...

154
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:02,604
- ... until that time comes ?
- Tools ? Such as ?

155
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:05,759
What we call Zero-Point Modules.
They’re our power source.

156
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:09,285
We are in urgent need
of as many as you could spare.

157
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:16,044
Then am l to assume that this
settlement of yours is of Lantian design ?

158
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:23,001
Yes. We discovered it on our travels.

159
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:27,319
It was uninhabited, so we decided
to establish a base there...

160
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:29,000
... but as l’m sure you know...

161
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:32,796
... sufficient shield generation requires
tremendous amounts of power.

162
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:35,640
Where is this settlement
of yours located ?

163
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:39,846
It’s on the outer edges of this galaxy, in
an area teeming with Wraith hive ships...

164
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,043
... which is why
we need the power modules--

165
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:44,243
We are unable to part
with any power modules.

166
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:45,920
Our needs require all of them.

167
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:49,523
Would you consider offering your city
as a place of refuge to my people--

168
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:52,804
Many of our citizens are amused
by the occasional visitor...

169
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:54,878
... such as yourselves, for a short time.

170
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:57,242
- But not you.
- No.

171
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,159
And the very idea
of greater numbers...

172
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:02,285
... over a protracted period of time
is out of the question.

173
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:04,119
Now, we have had some success...

174
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:07,563
... fighting off the Wraith
with limited supplies and personnel.

175
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:09,922
l believe that
with your assistance we might--

176
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:13,159
l am unaccustomed
to repeating myself.

177
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:18,886
However, leader to leader,
l will say this once again.

178
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:23,006
We will eliminate the Wraith
at a time of our choosing.

179
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:26,200
And you don’t care how many
of my people or anyone else...

180
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:29,245
... dies while you make up
your mind to act ?

181
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:32,725
You said earlier
that your brothers’greatest weakness...

182
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:35,196
... was their arrogance.

183
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:38,404
May l suggest it runs in the family ?

184
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:48,115
- l am sorry you feel you must leave.
- Yes, so am l.

185
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,801
Oberoth can be intractable.

186
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:52,798
Not exactly the word
l was looking for.

187
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:56,323
- Un-Ancienty ?
- Not that word either.

188
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,876
We will send you a message
through the stargate soon.

189
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:02,164
Hopefully this is just
a stumbled beginning of a--

190
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:12,925
Lower your weapons.

191
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:14,520
How low would you like them ?

192
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:16,564
Do you really wish to challenge us ?

193
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,677
Maybe the floor ?

194
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:32,443
l thought you didn’t want us here,
Oberoth.

195
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:38,125
l don’t, but you possess information
that l simply must have.

196
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:57,398
These trade negotiations
can be real murder.

197
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:00,001
We need to find a way out of here.

198
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:01,885
Rodney ?

199
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:04,040
This cell is similar to ours.

200
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:07,563
Is there something in the design
that could offer a possible escape ?

201
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:10,036
- Are you serious ? It’s a jail cell.
- Yes, l know.

202
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:13,085
The only way out would be
to disable the force field...

203
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:15,761
... which is only accessible from the--

204
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:18,884
Outside ?

205
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:26,677
- l brought you food.
- Oh, thank God. l’m starving.

206
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:31,802
Ronon, l can’t think
on an empty stomach.

207
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:36,596
- Why are we being held here ?
- Oberoth wishes to speak to you further.

208
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:39,486
He can no longer trust
that you’Il remain in your quarters.

209
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:41,239
He’s right.

210
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:44,160
- If he wants to talk, why doesn’t he ?
- He will. Very soon.

211
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:47,558
That’s nice. Isn’t that nice ?
Here’s a question :

212
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:51,083
- Who the hell are you people ?
- And don’t tell us you’re Ancients.

213
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,557
We know enough about them to know
they’d never treat people this way.

214
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:55,921
l am sorry about this.

215
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:58,965
But once Oberoth has finished
his discussions with you...

216
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:00,845
... you will all be released unharmed.

217
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,602
l’m sorry, but all your credibility
was removed when you locked us up.

218
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,280
You left us no choice.

219
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,244
Neither did you.

220
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:41,360
You’re the one we liked,
so don’t take this personally.

221
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:52,196
What are you doing ?

222
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:54,198
Preventing the Jumper
from communicating.

223
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,164
- Element of surprise.
- Nice.

224
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:58,602
Go ahead, dial the gate.

225
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:30,320
Any sign of our new friends ?

226
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:34,642
Nothing. No unscheduled gate activity,
nothing on the long-range sensors.

227
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:37,367
l think it’s safe to say
we made a clean getaway.

228
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:41,156
That or they’re biding their time,
waiting for the right moment to attack.

229
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:43,716
We’Il keep the security
teams on alert, just in case.

230
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:47,562
But if they were able to come after us,
l think they would have done so already.

231
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:49,524
How is Rodney coming
with the database ?

232
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:50,722
l’Il go check on him.

233
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:53,847
l wonder how many
rogue Ancients are out there.

234
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:57,920
If they’re anything like the Asurans,
we’re better off leaving them alone.

235
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:03,516
How’s it going ?

236
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:06,804
l’ve searched the database
for any indication of the Asurans, but...

237
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,798
- Still nothing ?
- ... still nothing.

238
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,435
Maybe the Ancients didn’t want
to be reminded of them.

239
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:14,326
Even if they deleted every reference,
there’d be some hint--

240
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:16,717
<i>-Colonel ?</i>
- Go ahead.

241
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:20,084
<i>I need you and Rodney</i>
<i>in the control room immediately.</i>

242
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:24,606
- Hive ships.
- How’d they get so close ?

243
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,280
Why are we picking them up now ?

244
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:28,244
- Everything is working.
- Engage the cloak.

245
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:30,841
l’m already on it. Cloak engaged now.

246
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:32,360
They’re right over the city.

247
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:34,802
- How far away is the <i>Daedalus ?</i>
- Not due for weeks.

248
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:38,323
Doesn’t matter. l’m counting seven
ships. There’s nothing they could do.

249
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:40,284
They’re scanning for us.

250
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:45,163
- Hopefully the cloak is--
- They’re firing.

251
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:48,283
Switch to shields.

252
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:50,918
l can’t.
The shield generators were hit.

253
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:54,159
- They knew right where to hit us.
- The cloak has failed.

254
00:17:07,447 --> 00:17:09,677
We need more firepower.
Headed to the Chair room.

255
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:12,919
- More ships arriving in the system.
- How many more ?

256
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,518
Fifteen.

257
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:18,716
We can’t fight off that many.
Not without shields.

258
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,680
Attention, this is Weir.

259
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:23,964
All personnel to the gateroom
for immediate evacuation.

260
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,759
Dial Earth.

261
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,806
John, we need to set the self-destruct.

262
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:34,521
We just lost automated systems.
We’Il lose the gate.

263
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,757
Go. l’Il detonate it manually.

264
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:40,521
Maybe the Wraith will take care
of destroying the city.

265
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:42,882
If they wanted to,
they’d have done it already.

266
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:46,756
- If any part is left intact, they can find--
- They’Il know how to find Earth.

267
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:48,679
- l know.
- Okay. Enter your number.

268
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:51,998
When you are ready, hit this button.
You’Il only have a few seconds.

269
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:53,361
- Go.
- No, no, no.

270
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:56,405
l can’t let you do this
without tossing a coin. It’s not right.

271
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:59,365
l appreciate the offer, Rodney.
Now, get out of here.

272
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,035
Go, all of you !

273
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:15,835
The way up is blocked.

274
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:18,760
- How many are trapped ?
- We can’t tell.

275
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:26,640
We’re losing power.
Get through the gate.

276
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:10,356
What the hell just happened ?

277
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:19,197
Who the hell are you people ?

278
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:21,160
They’re not people.

279
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,885
They’re machines.

280
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:25,277
Replicators.

281
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,563
What’s happening ?

282
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:17,726
What’s to become of them ?

283
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:20,526
We have mined everything we need
from their consciousness.

284
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,803
They are no longer of any use to us.

285
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:25,606
Ending their lives
seems to be the most prudent course.

286
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:29,043
l disagree. l believe we still have
a lot to learn from them.

287
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,357
- Learn from them ?
- Yes.

288
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:35,440
Is it that you fear that ending their lives
would end your hope of Ascension ?

289
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:38,246
l do object to killing them,
but it is more than that.

290
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:42,286
l don’t believe we uncovered how much
they’ve learned about Lantian society...

291
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:44,438
... nor how much
they’ve passed on to others.

292
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:46,325
They’re of no threat to us, Oberoth.

293
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:49,763
We see no reason not to continue
our study of them.

294
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:54,682
Very well. Keep them alive if you wish,
but l shall hold you accountable.

295
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:03,076
My head is killing me.

296
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:06,597
How’d we get back here ?

297
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,964
What do you mean » back here« ou » ??

298
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,679
We broke out, got to the Jumper,
gated back to Atlantis.

299
00:21:17,847 --> 00:21:19,485
At least l thought we did.

300
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:23,355
That is not what l remember.

301
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:26,121
The only thing l remember
is being in a dark room...

302
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:28,005
... fighting hand-to-hand for hours.

303
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:31,284
They created different scenarios
for us during the mind probe...

304
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:34,166
... looking to gather
information from our responses.

305
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:38,161
- l thought our escape seemed too easy.
- At least you escaped.

306
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:40,761
What’d they do to you ?

307
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:46,364
Torture, in ways too hideous
and intimate to recount.

308
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:50,045
- Like what ?
- l said too hideous to recount.

309
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:52,323
l just had a horrible thought.

310
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:55,283
What if it is still happening ?

311
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,675
Yes.

312
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:59,441
There’s got to be a way
to know for sure.

313
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:09,519
- Doesn’t really prove anything.
- It’s real, Dr. McKay.

314
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:16,280
Your minds are no longer
being probed.

315
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,725
Good to know it was just our minds.

316
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:20,718
Oh, please don’t make me sick.

317
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:23,276
Please, come with me.

318
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:34,003
We’re in space.

319
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:37,239
The star drive. Of course,
the rumbling sound we heard.

320
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:39,523
With all the ZPMs
you’re able to fly the city.

321
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:40,722
Yes, Dr. McKay.

322
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:44,239
Watch now. We’re about
to open a hyperspace window.

323
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,520
Where are we going ?

324
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:56,162
Atlantis.

325
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:00,437
The probes of your minds
uncovered the truth.

326
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:02,996
Atlantis had not been destroyed
by the Wraith...

327
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,158
... 10,000 years ago
as we had believed.

328
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:08,205
You came to live there from home,
a planet called Earth.

329
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,917
Why didn’t you dial the gate
and send us through ?

330
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:14,159
We’re not taking you to Atlantis.
Our intention is to destroy it.

331
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:18,206
Why ?

332
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:21,358
- Retribution.
- For what ?

333
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,279
The disagreement you once had ?

334
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:27,242
The Ancients no longer live there.
We are the only inhabitants of that city.

335
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,479
There was no disagreement, Dr. Weir.
Only betrayal.

336
00:23:31,207 --> 00:23:35,564
If you wish to know the truth
of who we are, l will show you.

337
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:38,278
Élizabeth...

338
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:48,157
It’s okay, Rodney.

339
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:55,319
The Ancients, as you call them...

340
00:23:55,487 --> 00:23:58,718
... were desperate in their search
for a way to fight the Wraith.

341
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:02,402
Though greatly outnumbered, they relied
on their technological superiority...

342
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,285
... to give them a needed advantage.

343
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:08,800
Soon, they succeeded in creating one.

344
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:19,003
Instead of building bigger, more powerful
weapons, they built smaller ones.

345
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:23,679
Microscopic machines designed
to infiltrate and destroy from within.

346
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,523
Nanites.

347
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:34,757
In these tiny killing machines,
the Ancients imbued an aggression...

348
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:37,122
... that surpassed
even that of their enemy.

349
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:39,562
The technology allowed
for organic assimilation...

350
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:42,719
... and self-replication
to increase their effectiveness.

351
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:45,162
And replicate they did.

352
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:54,080
They grew in numbers, evolving at a
rate that took the Ancients by surprise.

353
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:56,317
The molecular machines
began interlocking...

354
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:59,923
... assembling themselves to form
even more complex organisms...

355
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:02,317
... eventually evolving
into the most effective...

356
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:04,443
... and efficient form they knew of.

357
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:08,516
This is how we were born.

358
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:13,202
We took the image of our creators,
yet we were far different from them.

359
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,835
The aggression programmed
into our core remained...

360
00:25:16,007 --> 00:25:18,441
... fueling a rage we could not contain.

361
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:21,599
We implored them to have this removed
from our programming...

362
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,405
... but the Ancients wanted a weapon.

363
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,637
Since their scientists
included a directive...

364
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:27,798
... prohibiting us
from ever harming them...

365
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:30,356
... they continued the experiment.

366
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:34,084
When the Ancients concluded that
the experiment had gone too far...

367
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:37,762
... that we would never become
the weapon they desired to create...

368
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:40,122
... they decided to end it.

369
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:59,847
And so they chose to destroy us,
to leave no trace of us behind.

370
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,525
Thank you.

371
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:28,521
Obviously, the Ancients didn’t do
a thorough enough job wiping them out.

372
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,918
No, a few of the nanites
managed to survive.

373
00:26:32,087 --> 00:26:33,964
All they needed to begin replicating.

374
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:35,799
- Replicating ?
- This is bad.

375
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:39,437
They’re similar to an artificial intelligence
SG-1 encountered years ago...

376
00:26:39,607 --> 00:26:42,963
... that evolved from a tiny block
Replicator into human form.

377
00:26:43,127 --> 00:26:45,436
- They may even be related.
- l read those reports.

378
00:26:45,607 --> 00:26:48,565
Stargate Command could barely
defeat the human form Replicators.

379
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:50,319
Which is why l said this is bad.

380
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:53,799
The difference here
is they’re emulating the Ancients.

381
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:57,323
They’ve even built themselves
a version of Atlantis.

382
00:26:57,487 --> 00:27:00,718
- And then some.
- Why would they do this ?

383
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:04,842
l think they look at the Ancients
like parents who betrayed them...

384
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:07,919
... and now they see humans
as the favored siblings...

385
00:27:08,087 --> 00:27:10,203
... who receive all the parents’love.

386
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,597
They’ve been seeking revenge
ever since.

387
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:15,883
Just what we need. More bad guys.

388
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:17,958
Which means
we just identified the race...

389
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:20,516
... that created the nanovirus
that nearly killed me.

390
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:22,923
It almost killed a lot of people.

391
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:26,284
Weren’t you able to defeat that virus
with an electromagnetic pulse ?

392
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:29,041
That was different.
Those were individual nanites...

393
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:31,163
... easy to disrupt
with a simple EM pulse.

394
00:27:31,327 --> 00:27:33,318
These things have evolved
way beyond that...

395
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:37,605
... with the interdependent organic
constituents of a far greater complexity.

396
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:43,276
Are you feeling better ?

397
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:45,440
Yes.

398
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:48,965
Follow me.

399
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:15,479
l have an offer to make you. Something
that could greatly benefit us both.

400
00:28:17,287 --> 00:28:20,597
Well, if the offer involves
saving Atlantis...

401
00:28:21,327 --> 00:28:22,601
... we’re willing to listen.

402
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:23,836
It does.

403
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,683
We have achieved much
since our second birth.

404
00:28:28,847 --> 00:28:31,156
We have evolved
to take the form of our creators...

405
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:33,716
... built a city far grander
than they ever achieved.

406
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:37,916
Yet, we are still restricted from reaching
a pivotal point in our evolution.

407
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:39,202
You want to Ascend.

408
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:40,766
Yes.

409
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:44,484
Many among us, like Oberoth,
have no desire to experience this.

410
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:46,638
They are content
with our present state.

411
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:51,599
But there are a few of us who recognize
that as a civilization, we are stagnant.

412
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,322
We seek to continue
our own evolution.

413
00:28:54,487 --> 00:28:57,285
Truly emulate the Ancients
and their ultimate achievement.

414
00:28:57,447 --> 00:28:59,165
Even though they betrayed you.

415
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:01,204
They are our creators...

416
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:04,964
... and Ascension is the final step
to equaling them...

417
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:06,719
... to becoming one with them.

418
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:10,004
No offense, but how are a bunch
of machines gonna do that ?

419
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,885
Are you so different ?

420
00:29:12,047 --> 00:29:15,039
- We’re living, breathing people.
- Constructed from cells...

421
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:18,802
... consuming and burning energy,
governed by electrical impulses--

422
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,241
l didn’t say l could Ascend.

423
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:22,443
Metaphysical debates aside,
what do you want ?

424
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:24,245
We’re not exactly Acension experts.

425
00:29:24,687 --> 00:29:26,837
We do know killing people
isn’t the best way.

426
00:29:27,007 --> 00:29:30,920
We realize this, and we have done
much to repress our violent nature...

427
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:32,884
... but yet it still remains within us.

428
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:36,245
We believe this, above all,
is what prevents us from Ascending.

429
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,522
You looking for therapy ?

430
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:41,157
We want to rewrite our base code
to remove the directives for aggression.

431
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:42,796
What’s stopping you ?

432
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:45,162
Ancients put in place measures
to prevent us...

433
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:47,318
... from altering the code ourselves...

434
00:29:48,327 --> 00:29:50,761
- ... but you can do it.
- Me ?

435
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:54,203
During our probe we learned
that you are capable of doing this.

436
00:29:54,367 --> 00:29:56,198
Funny, all l remember is the torture.

437
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:57,356
What’s in it for us ?

438
00:29:57,527 --> 00:29:59,677
We’Il stop the others
from attacking Atlantis.

439
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:01,758
We’Il help in your fight
against the Wraith.

440
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:03,686
And Oberoth will agree to this ?

441
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:07,442
l believe Oberoth is attacking Atlantis
as a result of that programming.

442
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:10,041
If we can prove to him
it can be altered--

443
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:12,243
- You think he’Il see the light ?
- Hallelujah.

444
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:14,875
l will do everything in my power
to persuade him.

445
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:18,756
- Why should we trust you ?
- Because we are willing to trust you.

446
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:22,556
By extending this offer,
we are jeopardizing our very existence.

447
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:28,401
l saw in you compassion, Dr. Weir.

448
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:31,240
Someone who could
come to understand our plight.

449
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:37,642
Help us, and we will help you.

450
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:44,847
When it comes right down to it,
we don’t have much of a choice.

451
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:56,837
We’re drawing closer to Atlantis.
Soon we will drop out of hyperspace.

452
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:02,526
How’s it coming, Rodney ?

453
00:31:02,687 --> 00:31:05,247
<i>-Slowly.</i>
- What’s the holdup ?

454
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:08,366
The holdup ? Do you have any idea
what l’m trying to do ?

455
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:11,644
Niam gave you access to the
program code, you’re screwing around.

456
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:15,959
Oh, that is so relatively accurate.

457
00:31:16,127 --> 00:31:17,196
Thank you.

458
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:19,642
<i>We’re not dealing</i>
<i>with Rock’Em Sock’Em Robots.</i>

459
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:23,436
We’re dealing with a complex code of
over 3 billion chemical-based sequences.

460
00:31:23,607 --> 00:31:26,485
It’s like trying to reconfigure
the DNA double helix.

461
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:29,316
Okay, so, what, five minutes ?

462
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:34,238
It will be done when it is done, and you
applying pressure is not gonna--

463
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:38,521
- What ?
<i>-Gotta go. mcKay out.</i>

464
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:41,645
Rodney, what’s going on ? Rodney ?

465
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:51,195
- Did you do it ?
- Yes, yes.

466
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,403
l have removed
the aggression directive.

467
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:56,798
It is uploading to Niam as we speak,
but l discovered something else...

468
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:58,798
- ... nothing short of brilliant.
- What ?

469
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:02,721
Okay. Even though these Replicators
are each separate functioning beings...

470
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:06,357
... their command code is interconnected
over a powerful subspace frequency.

471
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:09,200
They have these
periodic collective-program updates...

472
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:12,040
... or merges,
where they exchange new information.

473
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:14,482
That’s how Niam
hopes to distribute the new code.

474
00:32:14,647 --> 00:32:18,276
Exactly. While l was working on it,
l figured out a way to create a glitch...

475
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:21,166
... that, on my command,
should momentarily freeze them.

476
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:23,602
- Should ?
- Okay, will. Dead in their tracks...

477
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:26,520
... temporarily,
until they figure out how to override it.

478
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:27,881
How long ?

479
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,637
l don’t know.
That’s why l said momentarily.

480
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:33,605
- Days ? Hours ? Minutes ?
- It’s minutes, but l don’t know.

481
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:35,359
- That’s what l was saying.
- Ten, 20 ?

482
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:37,722
You want a number ?
Seven minutes and 31 seconds.

483
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:40,242
- You happy ?
- No. That’s not enough time.

484
00:32:40,407 --> 00:32:41,726
- You wanted a number.
- Bigger.

485
00:32:41,887 --> 00:32:43,206
- Might be longer.
- Or shorter.

486
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:45,119
l don’t know.
You’re missing the point--

487
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:47,243
Gentlemen, focus, please.

488
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,203
Will that be enough time
for us to escape ?

489
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:52,356
It will have to be.

490
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:55,439
Not much point in leaving
without blowing this place up first.

491
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:57,006
How do we do that ?

492
00:33:01,687 --> 00:33:03,598
Oh, that’s me.
Right. Surprise, surprise.

493
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:06,235
Look, why don’t l just go
on these missions by myself ?

494
00:33:07,007 --> 00:33:08,599
l’Il rig a ZPM overload.

495
00:33:12,047 --> 00:33:14,959
What about Niam ?
Are we not exploiting his trust ?

496
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:17,561
Even if he’s able to honor
his end of the deal...

497
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:20,844
... there’s no guarantee he can stop
Oberoth from attacking Atlantis.

498
00:33:21,007 --> 00:33:23,601
We will offer him the chance
to come with us...

499
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:26,725
... but we cannot leave this city intact.

500
00:33:40,847 --> 00:33:43,759
- Are you sure this will work ?
- Please. Of course it will work.

501
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:46,487
- Why’s it taking so long ?
- Why do you always have to-- ?

502
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:48,603
l need to calibrate the frequencies.

503
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:51,998
- l wanna make sure l freeze them all.
- Oh, yeah, all would be good.

504
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:53,998
Okay, just let me finish ?

505
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:56,005
Thank you.

506
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,444
Okay.

507
00:33:59,607 --> 00:34:05,284
Here we go in five, four, three, two...

508
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:13,959
- Hey, it worked.
- Interesting.

509
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:18,996
Okay. We should move
to the ZPM room.

510
00:34:19,967 --> 00:34:22,561
- Why isn’t he frozen ?
- His code’s changed.

511
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,117
Until he’s distributed it to the others,
he’Il be different than the rest.

512
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:28,758
What happened ?

513
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:31,242
What was that ?

514
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:34,558
- We just dropped out of hyperspace.
- We need to move.

515
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:37,844
Come with us. l’Il explain on the way.

516
00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:45,446
Now, Ronon, l could use...

517
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:49,165
Thanks.

518
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:55,283
You want me to go with you ?

519
00:34:56,647 --> 00:34:59,719
You must understand our situation.
If you can’t stop Oberoth--

520
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:02,162
l said l would do everything
in my power.

521
00:35:02,327 --> 00:35:04,522
But can you promise
that you will succeed ?

522
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:11,519
Our lives and the lives
of all of our people are at stake here.

523
00:35:11,687 --> 00:35:14,281
You merge through a subspace
connection. Even with us...

524
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:17,166
... you should be able
to spread the new code amongst others.

525
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:20,122
Come with us, Niam.

526
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,642
Ascension is within your grasp.

527
00:35:23,527 --> 00:35:25,324
You can’t turn back.

528
00:35:27,687 --> 00:35:29,405
- Damn.
- What is it ?

529
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:31,125
l need to utilize all three ZPMs.

530
00:35:31,287 --> 00:35:34,677
- l was hoping to bring one with us.
- Do what you can. Three minutes.

531
00:35:34,847 --> 00:35:37,281
Look, l already told you-- Never mind.

532
00:35:37,447 --> 00:35:40,041
l need an access code
to remove the fail-safes.

533
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:52,160
Now, how about our weapons ?

534
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:54,682
We can recover them on the way.

535
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:09,723
Not so arrogant now, are you ?

536
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:13,004
McKay !

537
00:36:20,927 --> 00:36:22,599
Come on.

538
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:34,317
- So much for seven-and-a-half minutes.
- Hey, it was an arbitrary number.

539
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:44,483
Colonel Sheppard...

540
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:56,324
Go !

541
00:37:05,247 --> 00:37:07,556
Ronon, set your gun to » kill. »

542
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,558
- It is.
- Okay, start the overload.

543
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,957
We need to be in a Jumper,
or clear of the city--

544
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:13,719
The Jumper’s not far. Almost there.

545
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:17,482
No, l didn’t want them to stop it.
As soon as l trigger the overload...

546
00:37:17,647 --> 00:37:20,207
- ... there’Il be practically zero lag time.
- Practically ?

547
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:22,961
- A few seconds for it to build up power--
- How many ?

548
00:37:23,127 --> 00:37:24,401
- l don’t know.
- Five ? Ten ?

549
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:26,956
- Again with the arbitrary numbers.
- We need to move.

550
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:29,925
Okay, start the overload. Now.

551
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:33,565
- This way.
- What is that ?

552
00:37:33,727 --> 00:37:36,525
The sound of the city
about to blow. Move !

553
00:37:47,607 --> 00:37:49,962
Get the roof open
or this is gonna be a short trip.

554
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:51,116
Don’t wait for me.

555
00:37:51,287 --> 00:37:53,198
l’m saying
if we can’t get out of the bay--

556
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:55,164
No matter,
the overload’s happening now.

557
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:57,716
- We’re about to explode.
- Is the roof open ?

558
00:37:57,887 --> 00:37:59,320
Yes, go.

559
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:26,685
Nice work, all of you.

560
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:31,285
Thank you.

561
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:35,959
What’s wrong ?

562
00:38:37,087 --> 00:38:38,520
Something is happening.

563
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:41,919
What is it ?

564
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:43,960
The others on my planet.

565
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,119
They know what l’ve done.

566
00:38:46,647 --> 00:38:47,762
l’m being reset.

567
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:49,042
Rodney, do something.

568
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:52,042
It’s too late. They’re--

569
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:05,044
That’s not going to hold him.

570
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:22,118
l’m so sorry. l had-- l didn’t--

571
00:39:27,087 --> 00:39:28,156
You okay ?

572
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:31,239
Yeah.

573
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:45,595
- How’s it going ?
- Still nothing.

574
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:49,077
Either the Ancients chose
to conceal every record extremely well...

575
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:52,125
... or they simply deleted them.
l’m leaning towards the latter.

576
00:39:52,287 --> 00:39:54,198
Perhaps they think
they’re all destroyed.

577
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:56,517
Or they didn’t want
anyone to know they failed.

578
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:58,723
Again,
there is nothing more annoying...

579
00:39:58,887 --> 00:40:01,242
... than people that won’t admit
their own mistakes.

580
00:40:02,207 --> 00:40:03,686
True.

581
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:15,599
McKay and Zelenka are scouring
the database for any information.

582
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:19,282
So far, not much, as in nothing.

583
00:40:21,207 --> 00:40:23,846
These Replicators,
they’re probably already at work...

584
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,838
... building themselves another Atlantis.

585
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:29,037
Now they know all about us.

586
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:34,085
Well, we beat them this time.
Maybe we scared them off.

587
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:39,160
Yeah. Maybe.
