<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis :

1
00:00:03,247 --> 00:00:05,317
What’s the nature
of Major Sheppard’s injury ?

2
00:00:05,487 --> 00:00:08,285
Some sort of funky alien bug
attached itself to his neck.

3
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:10,278
Part of Ellia is human...

4
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:12,915
... part of her
comes from the Iratus bug.

5
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:14,918
- She took the retrovirus.
- It wasn’t ready.

6
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:16,964
It’s not. Not by a long shot.

7
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:20,481
You’ve been infected
with the Iratus bug retrovirus.

8
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:22,046
It’s beginning to alter his DNA.

9
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:24,482
He’Il devolve into a creature
similar to Ellia.

10
00:00:24,647 --> 00:00:26,638
l’m not safe to be around anymore.

11
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:33,717
<i>Eyes straight ahead. Focus on me.</i>

12
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:37,882
Never, ever look away
from your enemy.

13
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:41,278
Shows weakness. Are you weak ?

14
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:46,955
- No ?
- Good. Are you ready ?

15
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:52,601
McKay, what did l say ?
Don’t take your eyes off of me.

16
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:55,156
Gotta anticipate the next move.

17
00:00:55,647 --> 00:00:57,126
You all right ?

18
00:00:57,287 --> 00:01:00,040
Yeah, well, l’m trying to ease up
so l don’t hurt you.

19
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:02,319
- You’re getting better.
- Really ?

20
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:04,679
No.

21
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:10,998
- How’re the ninja lessons going, Jet Li ?
- What do you want ?

22
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:14,883
- We lost contact with the Taranans.
- You mean the volcano people ?

23
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:17,083
- Super volcano people.
- What happened to them ?

24
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:21,282
- Well, we don’t know.
- Seeing how we lost contact with them.

25
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:23,915
They check in from time to time
from their settlement.

26
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:26,317
We’ve been sending them food,
medical supplies.

27
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:29,684
It’s the least we can do
since getting the <i>Orion</i> blown up.

28
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:31,485
We haven’t heard from them
in months.

29
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,922
l tried to contact them by radio,
but no response.

30
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:35,600
- So send a M.A.L.P.
- We just did.

31
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:38,281
Looks okay, but the settlement’s
a couple kilometers...

32
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:40,483
... from the gate,
so we don’t know anything.

33
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,800
- l want you to check it out.
- What ?

34
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:51,043
Eyes, yes.

35
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:53,437
May wanna change first.

36
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:10,082
They got a lot done
in the time they’ve been here.

37
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:11,521
They’re hard-working people.

38
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:14,599
l’ve made several trips
to assist them in getting settled.

39
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,997
This is Lieutenant John Sheppard
from Atlantis...

40
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:21,319
... calling anyone in
the Taranan settlement. Please respond.

41
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:28,160
l thought l’d give it a shot.
All right, let’s go.

42
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:42,796
Anybody home ?

43
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:45,435
Well, it looks like
they abandoned the place.

44
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:48,041
Well, maybe they found
somewhere better to live.

45
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:51,199
They left everything behind.
Why would they do that ?

46
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,278
Let’s get
these workstations powered up.

47
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:56,120
Maybe we can figure out
where these people went.

48
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:01,042
- l got something. A single life sign.
- Where is it ?

49
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:03,163
It’s below us.

50
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:08,677
- Quite a way below us.
- They built underground ?

51
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:10,883
No. One of the previous
civilizations here...

52
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:13,242
... was similar to the Genii,
living below surface...

53
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:14,556
... to avoid detection by the Wraith.

54
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,922
They left behind several
underground passages...

55
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:20,204
- ... but the Taranans didn’t utilize them.
- Well, someone is.

56
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:22,801
How do we get there ?

57
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:35,599
Rodney ?

58
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:06,356
Wait.

59
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:13,118
- What is that ?
- It looks like a cocoon of some sort.

60
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:14,322
What’s inside it ?

61
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:20,316
Well, whatever it is,
it’s not inside anymore.

62
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:38,716
Has Sheppard’s team
dialed in with a status report ?

63
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:41,082
Not yet, but they haven’t been
gone that long.

64
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,317
Go ahead and dial them.

65
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:47,926
<i>How’s it going there ?</i>

66
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:50,806
Well, l think l know
why we lost contact with the Taranans.

67
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,844
- <i>Why ?</i>
- They’re gone.

68
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:55,965
- <i>What ? All of them ?</i>
- Looks like it.

69
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:57,719
The entire settlement is deserted.

70
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,481
Rodney’s picked up a life sign
underneath the tunnel...

71
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:03,400
... but we’re tracking it.
We don’t think it’s human, though.

72
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:06,397
- Why not ?
- <i>We discovered a large cocoon...</i>

73
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,046
<i>... in one of the rooms underneath.</i>

74
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:10,880
We think whatever hatched from it
is what we’re detecting.

75
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:12,880
Did you just say cocoon ?

76
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:15,436
- Yeah, it’s like a big slimy--
- It’s a pod.

77
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:18,963
l was gonna say egg,
but who knows what the hell it is.

78
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:21,643
- l’m sending in backup.
- <i>We can handle it.</i>

79
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:24,002
l know you can,
but l’d rather be safe than sorry.

80
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,919
l’Il send a team of Marines to assist.

81
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:30,000
- All right, if you feel the need.
- l feel the need. Weir out.

82
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,602
It’s a hell of a complex down here.

83
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:37,882
It’s like a maze.

84
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:40,277
- We’re closer.
- How far ?

85
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:43,598
Forty meters. It stopped moving,
so we’re gaining ground.

86
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:47,123
All right, good.
Look, if it makes any sudden moves...

87
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:49,562
... l want you to make sure that--

88
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:53,078
Where’s Ronon ?

89
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:57,157
- Ronon.
- In here.

90
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:08,358
Oh, my God.

91
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,836
Taranans.

92
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:23,442
Wounds on their neck. All of them.

93
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:29,199
- Does this look familiar ?
- Looks disturbingly familiar.

94
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,517
You don’t think--

95
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:36,756
Ronon ?

96
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:39,525
Oh, for God’s sakes.

97
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:42,485
- Ronon.
- In here.

98
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:48,676
You can’t wander off like that.
You gotta--

99
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,759
Oh, no.

100
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:53,522
The Iratus bug.

101
00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:55,166
l hate those things.

102
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:57,477
That explains why the wounds
look so familiar.

103
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:00,480
What’s it doing here ? Iratus
aren’t indigenous to this planet.

104
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,682
Somebody brought it.

105
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:03,838
Let’s hope it’s the only bug
they brought.

106
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,597
So some kind of a Wraith experiment ?

107
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:08,678
l doubt the Taranans
did it to themselves.

108
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:11,441
l do not sense
any Wraith in the settlement.

109
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,802
Oh, our little friend is on the move.

110
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,764
- It’s headed right for us.
- How fast ?

111
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:17,406
- Very fast.
- It knows we’re here.

112
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:18,795
Ronon, stun.

113
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:20,639
- Why ?
- Stun.

114
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:38,638
<i>Colonel Sheppard, come in.</i>

115
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,040
Colonel Sheppard,
this is Lieutenant Negley. Do you copy ?

116
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:46,206
Yes, lieutenant.

117
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:48,005
My team has come through the gate...

118
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,725
... and we’re proceeding
to the settlement--

119
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:50,876
<i>Great, terrific.</i>

120
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,685
We’Il meet you there.

121
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:56,522
Right now l need radio silence.
Sheppard out.

122
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:58,802
It stopped.

123
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:02,203
- Why ?
- How am l supposed to know ?

124
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:05,200
- Where is it ?
- Well, l think it’s out in the tunnel.

125
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:27,684
It’s close.

126
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,719
- Are you all right ?
- Yeah, l’m good.

127
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:19,721
- What the hell was that thing ?
- What is that ?

128
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,557
That’s a piece of an arm, it looks like.

129
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:26,797
Let’s hope that slows him down.

130
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:31,279
- Well, maybe it’Il bleed to death.
- Or just grow another arm.

131
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:41,806
Dart.

132
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:48,726
Still moving away from us.

133
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:51,481
Let’s hope losing
a chunk of his arm slows him down.

134
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:54,844
- We need to finish it off to make sure.
- Couldn’t agree with you more.

135
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:56,122
How are we gonna do that ?

136
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:58,403
l noticed that our bullets
had no effect on it.

137
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:00,364
It appears to have a shell on its back.

138
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:03,883
Set that thing to » kill » again.
Lieutenant Negley, this is Sheppard.

139
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:06,277
How far away
from the settlement are you ?

140
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:09,637
Negley, this is Sheppard. Come in.

141
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:14,244
- You did say radio silence.
- Negley, respond.

142
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:17,644
Great.

143
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:21,683
It’s through that doorway.

144
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:57,916
This is not good.

145
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:04,437
Dr. Weir, we just received
a data transmission...

146
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:06,040
... from the Taranan settlement.

147
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:08,801
- Lieutenant Negley checking in.
- And how are they doing ?

148
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:10,958
They’ve contacted
Colonel Sheppard’s team...

149
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:13,516
... who are 10 kilometers
inland from the settlement.

150
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:15,837
Negley’s on his way
to meet up with them.

151
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:18,157
Ten kilometers inland ?
What are they doing there ?

152
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:19,396
They found the Taranans.

153
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:22,559
They’ve abandoned their settlement
for a better location inland.

154
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:25,446
What about the cocoon,
and the life sign they were tracking ?

155
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:28,599
There’s no mention about it.
It was a brief transmission.

156
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:32,362
- They were almost out of range.
- Okay, good. Keep me posted.

157
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:40,721
We searched the whole room.
That thing ain’t in there.

158
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:42,923
- Just a bunch of unhatched eggs.
- Pods.

159
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:45,555
- Whatever.
- Is there another way out ?

160
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:47,445
No, that’s the only door to the room.

161
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:50,997
Well, they must’ve found another
way out, because it is still on the move.

162
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,395
<i>Alien</i>.

163
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,118
The movie <i>Alien</i>.
They use the air shafts...

164
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:59,243
- ... to move around.
- And then killed...

165
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:01,682
... the crew, one by one.
Thanks for bringing it up.

166
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:02,996
It didn’t kill them all.

167
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,806
- What do we do now ?
- Track this thing down and kill it.

168
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:09,039
Agreed, but first things first.

169
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:22,075
- The structure is very peculiar.
- Yeah. l believe the word is » disgusting. »

170
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,922
Go, go, go.
Sheppard, they’re hatching !

171
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,406
We’re good. Let’s go.

172
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:46,239
Shut the door.

173
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:55,316
Fire in the hole.

174
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:04,085
- Everyone okay ?
- Yes.

175
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:07,922
- l’m good.
- l think you singed my eyebrows.

176
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,923
Think you used
enough dynamite there, Butch ?

177
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:26,045
Rodney ?

178
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:30,205
- l think we got them all.
- Well, that’s good.

179
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,801
Except for our armless friend.
He’s still on the move.

180
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:34,685
Let’s go get him.

181
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:46,678
Lieutenant Negley, this is Sheppard.
Do you read ?

182
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,685
Negley, respond.

183
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,967
- Damn it.
- Perhaps they encountered the creature.

184
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,118
- And what, killed all four of them ?
- No way.

185
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:58,403
One creature
isn’t gonna take out four Marines.

186
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,956
- It almost killed all of us.
- But it didn’t.

187
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:03,163
- We need to find them.
- If they were alive...

188
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:05,238
... we’d see them
on the life-sign detector.

189
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:06,522
Not if they didn’t make it
to the settlement.

190
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:09,804
- This thing has a range of 100 meters.
- Where’s the creature now ?

191
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:12,039
Wait a minute.

192
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,642
- It’s back that way.
- Behind us ?

193
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:17,559
- You just said it was that way.
- l did.

194
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:19,718
Well, it was,
but it must’ve doubled back.

195
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,161
Damn air shafts.

196
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:23,716
It knows its way around this place
better than we do.

197
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:25,718
We should consider
returning to the gate.

198
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:28,476
- What, you mean give up ?
- No, not give up.

199
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:31,719
Find out what happened to the Marines,
request additional backup...

200
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,605
... so that we may do a proper search.

201
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,997
l like this plan.
l mean, if we’re taking a vote.

202
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,761
- Sounds like giving up to me.
- Teyla’s right.

203
00:15:38,927 --> 00:15:40,519
Enough of this. We’re better off...

204
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:43,963
- ... doing a full-scale sweep of this area.
- Including the air shafts.

205
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,563
- All right, how do we get out of here ?
- This way.

206
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:54,037
In all the worlds l’ve been to,
l’ve never encountered anything like it.

207
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:55,925
Did anybody get a look at that thing ?

208
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:59,318
Aside from its severed appendage, no.
That thing moved incredibly fast.

209
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,886
It looked almost like a human.

210
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:04,244
If by human you mean clad in a
grotesquely proportioned exoskeleton...

211
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:05,681
... yes, very human.

212
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:07,838
It looked like
it had two arms and two legs.

213
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,885
It looked like a giant bug to me.
l hate those things.

214
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:12,844
If it was indeed a Wraith experiment...

215
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:15,441
... perhaps it was created
by combining the elements...

216
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,359
... of the Iratus bug
with the Taranans.

217
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:19,916
Which is, as we know,
exactly how the Wraith evolved.

218
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,840
The Iratus bug bites human,
human DNA mixes with theirs...

219
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,599
... a thousand years go by, Wraith.

220
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,564
So they’re trying
to create more Wraith ?

221
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:29,161
Doesn’t make sense.
If they wanted to create Wraith...

222
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:32,160
... wouldn’t it be easier
to get a male and female, get a room ?

223
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:34,158
It doesn’t work that way
with the Wraith.

224
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,840
At least, we don’t think it does.

225
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:38,919
We’re not entirely sure
as to the Wraith’s reproductive methods.

226
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:41,123
l don’t wanna be around
to watch that film.

227
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:42,925
Anyway, look.

228
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:46,318
It’s probably less likely they were
trying to create another Wraith...

229
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:49,001
... than they were trying to create
a hybrid creature...

230
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:54,560
- ... probably to use as a weapon.
- Super Wraith ? That’s all we need.

231
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:59,402
That’s the whole distance
from the settlement...

232
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,478
... and l don’t see any sign
of the Marines.

233
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,639
- Maybe they went back to Atlantis.
- No, they would’ve radioed us.

234
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:06,206
They encountered the creature.

235
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:08,801
There’s no explanation
for why they’re not responding.

236
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:13,085
If that thing took them all out,
then that is one nasty bug person.

237
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:15,841
- Dial us out.
- Right.

238
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:21,366
- No.
- What ?

239
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:24,564
No, no, no.

240
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:28,640
- Rodney ?
- The control crystal’s missing.

241
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:30,805
- Missing ?
- We can’t dial out ?

242
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:35,358
- Well, fix it.
- This is not a matter of fixing, okay ?

243
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:36,846
The crystal is just gone.

244
00:17:37,007 --> 00:17:39,840
Someone has removed it
to prevent anyone from dialing out.

245
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:20,436
Stay here ?

246
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:22,802
Élizabeth will wonder
why we haven’t checked in.

247
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:24,878
She’Il dial up,
we can request backup...

248
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:26,560
... also, a Puddle Jumper to come.

249
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:28,843
We don’t know how long it’d be.
Could be hours.

250
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:32,079
We’Il be safe. The detector
will alert us if the creature’s nearby.

251
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:35,637
Right. We can set up a-- What do you
call it ? A perimeter. Wait it out.

252
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:39,003
We’re not leaving
without those Marines.

253
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:42,319
Let’s go back to the settlement.

254
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:02,040
- What ?
- l am sensing something.

255
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,675
- Wraith ?
- l cannot be certain.

256
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,485
Rodney ?

257
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:12,962
No, l’ve still just got the one reading.
He’s still on the move, heading-- No.

258
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:17,284
No, l’m picking up another life sign.
It’s popped up out of nowhere.

259
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,007
- How is that possible ?
- Maybe one of those eggs hatched.

260
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,635
Maybe. That,
or part of the settlement is shielded.

261
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:26,595
- Maybe it’s one of the Marines.
- Well, if it is one of those Marines...

262
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:30,203
... that something Teyla’s sensing
is heading right toward him.

263
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:43,396
We’re close.

264
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:11,918
What was that ?

265
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:15,124
- Teyla.
- Teyla.

266
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:27,559
Ronon.

267
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,319
John.

268
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:13,765
Where’d she go ?

269
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:17,317
l’m reading two life signs
moving away from us...

270
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:20,001
... but one floor up, l think.
That, or more air shafts.

271
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:21,600
Let’s go.

272
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:24,606
Wait.

273
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:27,199
They disappeared.

274
00:21:27,727 --> 00:21:29,365
- What ?
- The life signs just vanished.

275
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:32,166
l was right. Part of this settlement
must be shielded.

276
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:35,000
Wait. No, we won’t be able
to track them.

277
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:50,957
- What-- ?
- This will proceed much more quickly...

278
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:53,004
... if you don’t resist.

279
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,919
Michael ?

280
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:57,958
Hello, Teyla.

281
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:02,357
Aim for the stomach.
Seems more vulnerable.

282
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:03,562
It’s a soft underbelly.

283
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:06,525
- You were able to kill it there before.
- Thanks.

284
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:07,996
Which way ?

285
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:11,239
l don’t know, it’s not
showing me anything. It’s useless.

286
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:13,796
- Yeah.
- This way.

287
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:20,565
- You are the one who’s done all this ?
- All this ?

288
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:24,561
This experiment.

289
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:28,723
You murdered those people.
You allowed those bugs to feed on them.

290
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:31,117
A necessary step in the process.

291
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:35,761
To create these creatures ?
Why are you doing this ?

292
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:38,917
Do you not recall our last encounter ?

293
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:42,679
How you left me to die
on that desolate planet ?

294
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:48,241
The hive that finally rescued me,
they could tell something was different.

295
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:50,523
They sensed the human in me.

296
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:55,283
To them l was unclean.

297
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:02,965
l barely escaped that hive with my life.

298
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:10,317
So now l find myself hunted
by both humans and Wraith...

299
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:16,480
... so you can understand
my need to protect myself...

300
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:20,003
... to survive.

301
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:26,564
It did not have to be like this.
You could have lived with us.

302
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:28,400
As a human ?

303
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:33,844
My consciousness erased
by your retrovirus ? No.

304
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:37,000
l will live the rest of my life
as l choose...

305
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:39,960
... but l can’t do it alone.

306
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:42,842
So having taken my cue...

307
00:23:43,007 --> 00:23:46,204
... from the experiment
your people performed on me...

308
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:50,644
... l figured out
how to reverse the process.

309
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:55,722
To create a being
even more formidable than a Wraith.

310
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:58,079
It began with the feeding.

311
00:24:01,247 --> 00:24:03,636
<i>I allowed the bug to gorge itself...</i>

312
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:07,004
<i>... to absorb as much human DNA</i>
<i>as possible.</i>

313
00:24:07,807 --> 00:24:11,766
<i>This, of course,</i>
<i>led to the death of the subject.</i>

314
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,443
<i>The timing of the feeding</i>
<i>was critical...</i>

315
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:18,405
<i>... ensuring that the bug</i>
<i>laid its next egg quickly...</i>

316
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:22,446
<i>... before the genetic material</i>
<i>could filter out of its body.</i>

317
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:32,119
<i>The embryo then contained enough</i>
<i>human DNA for me to manipulate.</i>

318
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:38,523
<i>I accelerated the development...</i>

319
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:41,884
<i>... augmenting the complexity</i>
<i>of its physiology.</i>

320
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:47,397
<i>There were several adjustments,</i>
<i>several mistakes...</i>

321
00:24:48,007 --> 00:24:50,123
<i>... until I finally found</i>
<i>the perfect balance...</i>

322
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:55,919
<i>... between strength, agility</i>
<i>and resilience.</i>

323
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:02,518
A perfect animal to do my bidding.

324
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,439
Must be some kind
of security lockdown.

325
00:25:22,607 --> 00:25:24,086
Whoever took Teyla triggered it.

326
00:25:24,247 --> 00:25:26,397
- We gotta open this up.
- Stand back.

327
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,206
Jeez, you mind giving us
a little more heads up...

328
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,881
... before you start blasting everything ?

329
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:36,043
You got any more C-4 ?

330
00:25:37,527 --> 00:25:41,725
l saw how you and your team
destroyed the incubation room.

331
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:45,645
But don’t think
that’s the only one in this complex.

332
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:47,684
Don’t think this is the only planet...

333
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,407
... from which l’m conducting
this experiment.

334
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:52,355
That’s right.

335
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:55,485
Soon, hundreds of these creatures
will be at my disposal...

336
00:25:55,647 --> 00:25:58,115
... and their numbers
will continue to grow...

337
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:01,245
... so long as l have
human subjects in supply.

338
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:05,719
And now that you’re here, l do.

339
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:19,845
All right, that’s the last of the C-4.
Let’s hope it’s enough.

340
00:26:20,007 --> 00:26:21,440
Ready ?

341
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:25,439
What happened ?

342
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:34,796
All right, let’s go.

343
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:46,596
- Serious energy spike.
- What does that mean ?

344
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:49,725
We probably just entered
the shielded section of the settlement.

345
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:01,802
Your friends are coming for you.

346
00:27:06,047 --> 00:27:09,244
They’Il meet the same fate as you,
one by one.

347
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:10,920
Others will come for us.

348
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,760
- Weir will send--
- Don’t concern yourself with Dr. Weir.

349
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:18,076
She thinks your team has met up
with the Taranan people and all is well.

350
00:27:19,207 --> 00:27:21,482
One of the Marines
she sent to help you was...

351
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:26,836
... kind enough to assist me in
transmitting a message back to Atlantis.

352
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:32,718
Michael, please don’t do this.

353
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:39,117
After what you did to me, twice,
how could you expect anything less ?

354
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:42,805
- What happened back on the planet--
- No more excuses.

355
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:46,482
Your experiment failed,
you decided to kill us.

356
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,444
We believed we were left
with no choice.

357
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:50,643
And now l’m in the same position.

358
00:27:52,447 --> 00:27:53,960
You drove me to this.

359
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,123
Oh, my God.

360
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:16,919
Where are the others ?

361
00:28:21,727 --> 00:28:23,877
Sheppard, over here.

362
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:38,756
You hear that ?

363
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:43,841
Oh, it sounds like bugs.

364
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:45,599
Come on.

365
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:56,756
Put that thing away.

366
00:28:56,927 --> 00:28:58,645
You said it didn’t work in this area.

367
00:28:58,807 --> 00:29:01,605
l thought l could recalibrate it
to take into effect the--

368
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:24,005
It’s dead.

369
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:36,525
John.

370
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,638
John !

371
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,238
Nice shot. You okay ?

372
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,796
Yes. It’s Michael.
He’s the one doing this.

373
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:48,480
Michael ? Our Michael ?

374
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:50,046
- He’s alive ?
- Yes.

375
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:52,880
He created creatures.
He’s attempting to build an army.

376
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:54,036
- Where is he ?
- l don’t know.

377
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:57,438
- He ran off when he heard the gunfire.
- We need to come up with a plan.

378
00:29:57,607 --> 00:29:59,245
- Best plan is to kill him.
- Hang on.

379
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:01,875
l should check out these stations.
Might be intel.

380
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:03,844
- No time.
- Such as how many creatures...

381
00:30:04,007 --> 00:30:05,360
... he created,
if they have weaknesses...

382
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:07,358
... that we might be able to exploit.

383
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:09,798
All right. Teyla, you stay with Rodney.

384
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:11,639
Ronon and l are going after Michael.

385
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:13,604
- Stay in touch on the radio.
- Can’t.

386
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:15,405
Shielded, remember ?

387
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:17,762
The energy spike,
it fouls the communications.

388
00:30:17,927 --> 00:30:20,760
Well, then unshield it. Let’s go.

389
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:28,599
You go that way, l’Il go the other.

390
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:31,406
- Oh, hey, wait. Set your gun to » stun. »
- What ?

391
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:33,205
We’re gonna need to question him.

392
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:34,595
No talking, no questioning.

393
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,598
l’m gonna do
what we should’ve done the first time.

394
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,837
- Ronon, listen to me--
- No, you listen to me.

395
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:42,124
The retrovirus was a mistake.
l said it then, no one listened to me.

396
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:44,847
- It was a bad idea.
- We had to try.

397
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:47,965
- If it worked, we wouldn’t have--
- But it didn’t work.

398
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:52,325
Admit it, it just made things worse.

399
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:55,524
How long
do you wanna keep paying for it ?

400
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:01,446
It’s amazing how much work...

401
00:31:01,607 --> 00:31:04,167
... he’s been able to get done
in a short amount of time.

402
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:08,115
He’s quite the industrious little fella,
or Wraith, or whatever.

403
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:10,801
What does he look like now ?
Is he full-on Wraith again ?

404
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:12,161
Not quite.

405
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:14,966
There are still human characteristics
present in him.

406
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:18,119
No doubt it’s why l was confused
when l first felt his presence.

407
00:31:18,687 --> 00:31:22,316
You would think that the human side of
him would temper his aggression a bit.

408
00:31:22,487 --> 00:31:24,921
Yes, because we humans
aren’t aggressive at all.

409
00:31:25,087 --> 00:31:30,286
Well, certainly less aggressive than--
Oh, sarcasm. Yeah. Nice.

410
00:31:30,447 --> 00:31:32,722
What Michael is doing right now
must be stopped...

411
00:31:32,887 --> 00:31:35,481
... and he can’t be allowed to escape.
He’s too dangerous.

412
00:31:35,647 --> 00:31:38,923
- Preaching to the choir, my dear.
- But l understand his anger.

413
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:43,675
His life has been destroyed.
He no longer has a home, or family.

414
00:31:43,847 --> 00:31:46,407
- He had a family ?
- l don’t know.

415
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:49,445
l’ve wondered what he left behind
when he was captured by us.

416
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:52,724
We know nothing of his past,
other than he was a Wraith.

417
00:31:52,887 --> 00:31:56,721
- A very smart Wraith.
- Perhaps he was a scientist.

418
00:31:56,887 --> 00:31:59,242
Yeah, sure, probably. Why not ?

419
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:02,319
- One of their very best, l would wager.
- Like you.

420
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,965
Right. Wait a minute.

421
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:09,006
- What is it ?
- l think...

422
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:12,955
... l figured out how to disable the EM
interference that is causing the shielding.

423
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:15,641
- Sheppard, you there ?
- Yeah, l’m here.

424
00:32:15,807 --> 00:32:19,516
- <i>I got the shielding disabled.</i>
- So l see.

425
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:23,837
- Any luck finding Michael ?
- No sign of him yet.

426
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:27,602
- That life-sign detector working yet ?
- Of course.

427
00:32:31,807 --> 00:32:34,605
- Oh, my God.
- What ?

428
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,643
l’m reading
a ton of life signs near you.

429
00:32:37,807 --> 00:32:40,719
Well, define » ton, » and define » near. »

430
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,761
A few dozen ?
l mean, they’re all bunched together.

431
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:47,557
- Prisoners in a holding cell, maybe ?
- Or worse.

432
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,442
Whatever they are,
someone just released them...

433
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:09,122
- ... and they’re headed your way.
- Oh, crap.

434
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:39,244
Keep going. Straight up the tunnel.

435
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:42,838
<i>Ronon should be coming around</i>
<i>the corner towards you now.</i>

436
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:47,799
It’s not Ronon.

437
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:52,244
- It’s one of the bugs ?
- Michael.

438
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:58,966
Colonel Sheppard.

439
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:02,085
No offense, but l was kind of hoping
never to see you again.

440
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:06,479
- l had hoped just the opposite.
- Well, then.

441
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:10,925
You’ve seen me.
Now, say your goodbyes...

442
00:34:11,487 --> 00:34:15,526
... but first, give me
the control crystals to the DHD.

443
00:34:16,127 --> 00:34:19,199
- l don’t think so.
- Or l can just kill you.

444
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:21,642
Unless l stun you first.

445
00:34:25,207 --> 00:34:27,516
As much as l’d like
to sit around chatting--

446
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:30,645
They’re extraordinary, aren’t they ?

447
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:33,043
Your army of bug people ?

448
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:36,358
- l thought you’d be impressed.
- Not so much.

449
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:40,679
After all, l’m merely continuing
the experiment your people began.

450
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:43,998
What then ?
Take over the entire galaxy ?

451
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,203
That’s a little too Dr. Évil,
if you ask me.

452
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:49,757
Sheppard, the creatures are closing in
on you fast. You better get moving.

453
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:52,202
You and Teyla go to the gate.
l’Il meet you there.

454
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:53,800
<i>Right.</i>

455
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:02,200
- Give me the control crystal.
- l can’t do that, colonel.

456
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:08,437
Just so we’re clear,
l have no problem killing you.

457
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:20,165
And l have no problem with dying...

458
00:35:20,607 --> 00:35:23,280
... because even
if you kill me right now...

459
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:29,322
... l’Il die knowing that you and your
team did not get off this planet alive.

460
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,320
Go.

461
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:51,885
Climbing’s the reason l got bronze...

462
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:55,403
- ... instead of silver in the program.
- What ?

463
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,277
Hurry, they’re coming.

464
00:36:14,127 --> 00:36:16,118
This is messed up.

465
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:22,320
- This must be where they got up.
- What ?

466
00:36:22,487 --> 00:36:26,036
Air shafts.
It’s about time we used them.

467
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:51,243
- Michael’s ?
- No doubt.

468
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:52,840
You thinking what l’m thinking ?

469
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:57,603
l fly it, pick you, Rodney and Teyla up.
We use the Dart’s DHD to dial the gate.

470
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:01,521
l was thinking blow it up,
but your idea’s better. Get moving.

471
00:37:28,727 --> 00:37:30,399
Sheppard !

472
00:37:48,407 --> 00:37:49,556
- Wait.
- What is it ?

473
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:52,480
- Life signs up ahead.
- Colonel Sheppard ? Ronon ?

474
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:54,717
Doesn’t sound like it.

475
00:37:57,207 --> 00:38:00,165
Life signs behind us too.
It’s closing in fast.

476
00:38:00,327 --> 00:38:02,238
Oh, God.

477
00:38:03,527 --> 00:38:05,324
We’re surrounded.

478
00:38:33,007 --> 00:38:34,998
Incoming wormhole.

479
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:40,319
- Colonel Sheppard’s IDC.
- Lower the shield.

480
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:52,006
Are you all right ?
Where are the Marines ?

481
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,805
- Didn’t make it.
- What ?

482
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:55,320
We barely made it ourselves.

483
00:38:55,487 --> 00:38:57,443
Had to commandeer
a Wraith Dart to dial out.

484
00:38:57,607 --> 00:38:59,086
We ditched it on another planet.

485
00:38:59,247 --> 00:39:01,283
Didn’t wanna risk
damaging the control room.

486
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:04,803
- <i>Daedalus</i> can pick it up later.
- What happened to the Taranans ?

487
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,480
They’re dead. All of them.

488
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:10,038
Wait, Lieutenant Negley
sent a message...

489
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:12,243
... saying they relocated
to a new settlement.

490
00:39:12,407 --> 00:39:13,442
No, it was Michael.

491
00:39:13,607 --> 00:39:16,644
He sent the transmission.
He’s the one that killed the Taranans.

492
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:18,559
- Michael ?
- We’Il tell you about it...

493
00:39:18,727 --> 00:39:22,197
- ... but first, is the <i>Daedalus</i> here yet ?
- It’s still a few days out. Why ?

494
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:25,200
We’re gonna need it
to make another stop on the way.

495
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:26,766
Okay.

496
00:39:40,687 --> 00:39:43,281
- Élizabeth ?
- l just came from McKay’s lab.

497
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,085
He’s been examining the research...

498
00:39:45,247 --> 00:39:47,761
... he was able to upload
from Michael’s experiment.

499
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:51,158
Has he been able to determine just
how many more of those creatures...

500
00:39:51,327 --> 00:39:52,726
... Michael was able to create ?

501
00:39:52,887 --> 00:39:55,924
Not an exact figure, but Rodney
believes it’s into the hundreds.

502
00:39:56,567 --> 00:40:01,402
Yeah, and it appears Michael has similar
labs on at least three different planets.

503
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:07,477
It’s amazing how quickly he’s been able
to incorporate our science into his.

504
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,041
- What is it ?
- Michael found out about...

505
00:40:12,207 --> 00:40:14,402
... the Taranan settlement
through information...

506
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:16,398
... the Wraith hacked
from our database...

507
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:19,127
... during our brief alliance
with them last year.

508
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:22,675
We led Michael straight to them.

509
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:36,803
Colonel Caldwell just radioed.
They did a full sweep of the planet.

510
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,481
No life signs.
They searched the settlement...

511
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:41,842
... no Michael, no creatures.

512
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:44,043
- He already dialed out.
- Yeah.

513
00:40:44,927 --> 00:40:46,963
Got the control crystal back
in the DHD.

514
00:40:47,127 --> 00:40:49,925
Rodney’s trying to figure out
the last address dialed...

515
00:40:50,087 --> 00:40:51,805
... but you know how long that takes.

516
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:55,118
l’m sure Michael immediately
dialed elsewhere to cover his tracks.

517
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:58,962
- Yeah, you can count on that.
- We need to find him.

518
00:40:59,127 --> 00:41:00,924
He’s already too dangerous.

519
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:04,124
And l’m sure
we’re number one on his hit list.
