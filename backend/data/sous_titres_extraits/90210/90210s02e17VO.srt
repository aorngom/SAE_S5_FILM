<i>Previously on 90210...</i>

2
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:08,013
Adrianna, this is Lila,
our bass player.

3
00:00:09,062 --> 00:00:10,764
I joined the band to get over Navid,

4
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:13,305
now I have to spend every day
with the girl he's dating?

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,063
- I'm kicking you off the Blaze.
- What do you want? Name it.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,824
I'll do anything.
Please. I'll do anything.

7
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:22,206
- Are you offering to sleep with me?
- What? No. I...

8
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:25,525
Because that would be
completely inappropriate.

9
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:26,996
You're off the Blaze.

10
00:00:27,163 --> 00:00:30,328
I know this isn't what you want to hear,
but you were the one out of line.

11
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:33,825
I cannot believe you're
taking his side, Silver.

12
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:38,038
He said if I wanted back on the Blaze,
I had to sleep with him.

13
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,459
What?!

14
00:00:40,203 --> 00:00:42,353
So, you want to go out on a date?

15
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,854
- Do you mind if I crash here tonight?
- Not at all. Tonight, tomorrow,

16
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,056
- as long as you want.
- I'm Laurel.

17
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:01,311
If I can't be with you,

18
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,563
- there's no point in living.
- Jasper, no.

19
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:19,329
I told you,
I don't know where he is.

20
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,844
I just hope he's not getting
into too much trouble

21
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:23,949
before his parents
come back to town.

22
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,427
<i>Leave a message.</i>

23
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:29,964
I need you to tell me
where you are, okay?

24
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:33,331
I'm just getting really worried.
Please call me back.

25
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:36,566
And please don't hurt yourself.

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,020
What are you doing up there?

27
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,386
- It's all pointless, Annie.
- What is?

28
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:17,887
All of it.

29
00:02:18,494 --> 00:02:20,473
Life. It's a joke.

30
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:22,934
It's painful.
It's humiliating.

31
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,145
And I'm over it.

32
00:02:30,938 --> 00:02:33,188
You still have not chosen a loofah.

33
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:36,239
- I think you should come forward.
- Liam, no.

34
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,743
What Mr. Cannon said to you
was sexual harassment.

35
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,799
I don't want to deal
with the aggravation.

36
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:43,163
Now, I'm assuming you're going
to go with blue, but

37
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,278
lavender could be
bold statement for guy.

38
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:47,667
I don't understand.
Why don't you report him?

39
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:51,859
This has been a really crazy year.

40
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,991
The feud with Annie,
the situation with Jen.

41
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,243
Jen has hurt you enough.

42
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:01,306
Don't let her stop you
from doing what's right.

43
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:03,975
What?

44
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:07,063
The truth is...

45
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,072
I'm a lot more like Jen
than you probably think.

46
00:03:14,013 --> 00:03:16,738
You are nothing like Jen.
And if you were,

47
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:19,324
I wouldn't be with you.

48
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,669
I'll take an Arnold Palmer,

49
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,807
mostly iced tea.
Like, a quarter lemonade.

50
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:35,310
And just a regular
water for me. Thanks.

51
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:40,720
So, you notice anything
different about me?

52
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:43,011
You're taller?

53
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:45,934
Shorter? Wait. I know.
You shaved your mustache.

54
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:48,520
No. I got a haircut.

55
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:51,481
Really? Like, a hair cut?
Single hair?

56
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,115
You're just not very
detail-oriented, are you?

57
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:56,736
Just because I didn't notice
your emperor's new haircut...

58
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,448
Now, come here,
you totally transformed woman.

59
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,360
Hey! Dixon.

60
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:05,537
Hey, man.
How's it going?

61
00:04:06,535 --> 00:04:07,935
Who you here with?

62
00:04:09,476 --> 00:04:10,476
No one.

63
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:12,107
By myself.

64
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:18,184
You know what? I should set you up
with my mixed doubles partner.

65
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:19,884
No. Don't worry about it, man.

66
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:22,482
I'm serious.
She is totally hot.

67
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:24,456
Definitely not my type.

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,500
Thanks for looking out
for me, but I'm cool

69
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,117
doing my own thing.

70
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:32,372
See y'all later.

71
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:36,109
Jasper, please listen to me.
It's not pointless.

72
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:38,998
What's the point?

73
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,323
What's the point to life?

74
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,033
You don't love me anymore.

75
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:49,289
Do you?

Season 02 Episode 17
Sweaty Palms and Weak Knees

78
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,073
Hi. We're looking for Jasper Herman.
He's our son.

79
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:28,487
I'll see if he's out of surgery.

80
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:30,706
Mr. And Mrs. Herman?

81
00:05:32,237 --> 00:05:33,708
What's going on?
Do you know?

82
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,981
All we've been told is that he fell
off the top of the Hollywood sign.

83
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:39,422
Were you with him?
What was he even doing up there?

84
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,422
Was he filming something?

85
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:44,156
No, I...

86
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:48,097
Look, he didn't fall.

87
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,517
He jumped.

88
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:57,231
Oh, my God.

89
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,076
Listen, you should go home, Annie.

90
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,786
Get some sleep, and...

91
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,705
we'll call you if we hear any news.

92
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,918
- I can stay.
- No. Jasper's our son.

93
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,879
We'll handle this.
You should take care of yourself.

94
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,254
Okay.

95
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:35,478
I am sick.

96
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:39,076
- Cold or flu?
- Not that kind of sick. I just...

97
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:41,993
Why am I enjoying watching
you iron so much?

98
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,850
- I'm sick, that's all.
- You're a sexist pig.

99
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,698
- What do you think?
- Cute.

100
00:06:48,426 --> 00:06:50,481
You're driving
us to the concert, right?

101
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:51,748
You know it.

102
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:54,277
- You're the best roadie ever.
- Roadie?

103
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:56,415
I was thinking more groupie.

104
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:01,356
That's possible.

105
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:04,365
It's very possible.

106
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,699
But you know what groupies
do for their rock stars?

107
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:08,866
What?

108
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,630
Their ironing.

109
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,265
Okay.

110
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,555
Wilson looks.

111
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:31,866
He shoots.

112
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:36,164
- Come on.
- Was it something I said?

113
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,750
- Do over.
- No way, man. I want my ten bucks.

114
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:42,128
Are you guys betting
on baby basketball? That's just sad.

115
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:44,672
I wish I could put
money on the Lakers.

116
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,341
Telling you they're about
to go on a roll I can feel it.

117
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,741
Sounds like someone's
got the gambling bug.

118
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:52,597
Bug? No. Gift? Yes.

119
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,018
Could you hook me up
with your dad's bookie?

120
00:07:58,202 --> 00:08:00,396
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.

121
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:03,357
I'm telling you,
I really feel good about the Lakers.

122
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:05,234
Put me down for 250 bucks.

123
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,361
You don't want to put it
on the Lakers.

124
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:10,490
My dad's got floor seats
and last night, he overheard his trainer

125
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,406
saying that Kobe's
going to sit out against the Spurs.

126
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,788
- His knee's bothering him.
- Really?

127
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:21,028
Then, I'm feeling really good
about the Spurs.

128
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,950
- Hook me up, all right?
- You got it.

129
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:27,090
Anyone see the Cavs last night?
LeBron was on fire.

130
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:29,592
Man, I missed it.
Naomi and I were...

131
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,180
Never mind.

132
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:36,901
Liam, what's your problem?

133
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:39,102
You can talk about Naomi
in front of me.

134
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:46,986
Dixon looks.

135
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:48,881
He shoots.

136
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,558
- Are you okay?
- Never been better. Why?

137
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:15,513
I don't know. It just looks like
you have something against those books.

138
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:22,740
I don't get why everyone keeps treating
me like I'm some loser or something.

139
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:25,022
- You're preaching to the choir, miss.
- Really?

140
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,990
Ever since Silver and Teddy's
been going out,

141
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:30,611
they've been treating me
like some... charity case.

142
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:32,822
Seriously?

143
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:36,617
Yeah. Teddy tried to hook me
up with some tennis girl.

144
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,699
He was like, "Let me call in a favor
to this ex-girlfriend of mine

145
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:42,719
to see if she'll go out with you. "
Like I need his hand-me-downs.

146
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,464
I hear you. I mean,

147
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:47,437
between you and me, Liam's practically
chewing my food for me

148
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:49,618
then regurgitating it
back into my mouth.

149
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:50,798
What?

150
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:55,145
He's patronizing me, he treats me
like I'm some baby or something.

151
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:56,710
Baby bird, yeah. I get it.

152
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:59,445
And you know what I mean, though?
It's kind of ridiculous. I...

153
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:02,143
As if I care that he's still dating
that giggling imbecile?

154
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,185
Like I'm supposed to care that Silver
changed her Facebook status to

155
00:10:05,352 --> 00:10:06,635
"in a relationship. "

156
00:10:08,014 --> 00:10:09,895
Why do you know
Silver's Facebook status?

157
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:17,116
Anyways, you want to hang out later?
I don't know, grab a burger?

158
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,916
Yes, that'll be cool.

159
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,587
I mean, it seems like
everybody else is coupled off.

160
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,149
And besides, I haven't
had a Beach Burger since...

161
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,958
yesterday.

162
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:29,505
- Peace.
- I'll call you.

163
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:34,107
I'm just saying... you can't let
Mr. Cannon get away with it.

164
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:36,010
That's exactly
what I've been saying.

165
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,790
Have you guys seen Alaina
Grossberg's collagen injections?

166
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,483
- You have to tell somebody.
- Honestly, it's not that big of a deal.

167
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,602
Seriously, her lips
look like an inner tube.

168
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,648
It is, and it's your responsibility.
Your moral obligation.

169
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,839
Think about it. What if Mr. Cannon
harasses some other girl?

170
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:53,806
Enough! Please! Just stop!

171
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,950
This has been really hard?

172
00:11:02,832 --> 00:11:04,282
Yeah, it has.

173
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,876
This whole situation is...
it's too much.

174
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:11,782
Maybe you should talk to somebody.

175
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,479
Maybe Kelly.

176
00:11:14,554 --> 00:11:15,716
It's a good idea.

177
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,468
You're struggling with this.

178
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,388
Fine, I'll talk to someone.
Not Kelly.

179
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:23,849
I don't trust this psyche to anyone
who costs less than $400 an hour.

180
00:11:27,163 --> 00:11:30,063
- I'll see a real therapist, okay?
- Come here.

181
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,956
- Your chair, madam.
- Thank you.

182
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,491
Are those new shoes? I like 'em.

183
00:11:52,018 --> 00:11:53,963
Thank you.
So did I when I bought them

184
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:56,132
in seventh grade. Nice try.

185
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,561
What did we miss?

186
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:02,263
Nothing. Teddy's just trying
to prove how well he knows me.

187
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,808
- He's crashing and burning.
- I am so not crashing and burning.

188
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:08,511
Hello, there. What can I get
you all to drink?

189
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:10,869
Maybe some water for the table.

190
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:13,245
Sure. Sparkling or flat?
What do you prefer?

191
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:15,026
How about... Teddy,

192
00:12:15,683 --> 00:12:17,833
you want to tell him what I like?

193
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:23,373
Sparkling, because she has
such a sparkling personality.

194
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,453
Actually, I like flat,

195
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:28,372
because apparently I have
a flat personality.

196
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,626
I'll get a bottle of each.

197
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,755
I was close. It's not like you know
everything about me.

198
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:38,607
You know what? He's gonna have

199
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:42,636
an Arnold Palmer... three-quarters
iced tea, one-quarter lemonade.

200
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,265
Snap.

201
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,593
I guess so.

202
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,606
Great.

203
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,156
Let's go, right?

204
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,989
- What's up?
- Come here.

205
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,285
- Grab a fork, stab me in the jugular.
- Too late.

206
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,735
You guys wanna join us for dinner?

207
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:11,207
- Why not?
- Yeah, there's

208
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:15,711
plenty of room.
I can just sit in Liam's lap.

209
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:20,007
- Actually, we were...
- We're on a date.

210
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:23,901
All right!

211
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:28,766
You can do better.

212
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,019
Naomi, I can hear you.

213
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,063
Anyway, that's really great.

214
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,695
It's pretty great.

215
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:37,775
Anyway... we should go.

216
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,944
- Shall we?
- We shall.

217
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,278
Bye.

218
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:43,169
- Have fun.
- See ya.

219
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:46,322
What the hell was that?
That was crazy!

220
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:48,994
Yeah, kinda.
But kinda crazy awesome.

221
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:50,371
Really?

222
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,040
Hell, yeah!
Did you see their faces?!

223
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,125
So... guess you're my boyfriend now.

224
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:00,756
Guess so.

225
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:04,846
- After you, my lady.
- None of that gentlemanly crap.

226
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:06,013
Come on.

227
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,880
A lingerie Web site.

228
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,463
Montgomery,
has it really come to this?

229
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:25,743
I'm trying to find
a gift for Silver.

230
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:29,618
Good luck with that. One time
I bought her a leather bracelet

231
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:33,038
and she accused me of being
insensitive to cow feelings.

232
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:35,040
Cow feelings.

233
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:39,877
She's not exactly
the easiest to shop for.

234
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:41,130
Tell me about it.

235
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,048
Do you think maybe she'd like to...

236
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,385
You know what? Never mind.

237
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:50,577
It's cool, man.
All right, I moved on.

238
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:52,344
I really like Ivy now.

239
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:54,018
Hell, yeah.

240
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:59,266
In fact, I recently bought Ivy
a little gift myself.

241
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:02,428
What'd you get her?

242
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,125
I can't have you rip off my idea.
It's way too good.

243
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:11,827
You and Ivy.

244
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:15,657
- I did not see that coming.
- Yeah, I know.

245
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:18,653
Neither did I. See you later, man.

246
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:20,104
Later.

247
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:26,383
Hello?

248
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:28,052
Hi, Annie. Matey Herman.

249
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:32,484
I just wanted to let you know
that Jasper is going to make it.

250
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:33,969
Good.

251
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:36,365
He's okay?

252
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:39,145
He broke both his legs
and sprained his shoulder,

253
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:42,012
but, yes, physically
he's going to be fine.

254
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:45,399
Psychologically, mentally,

255
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:47,929
the kid's obviously going through
a rough patch.

256
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:50,407
Once he checks out over
here, he's going to be checking

257
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:53,410
into a psychiatric facility
for a little while.

258
00:15:54,128 --> 00:15:55,778
A psychiatric hospital?

259
00:15:56,974 --> 00:15:58,324
I mean, that's...

260
00:15:58,741 --> 00:15:59,917
that makes sense.

261
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,956
- That's good.
- Yeah. We feel it's going to help.

262
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:05,839
And help get him talking, you know?

263
00:16:07,512 --> 00:16:10,469
My brother's death
really affected Jasper, and

264
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:15,146
we just want him to talk to someone.
Open up. Stop hiding.

265
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:17,463
One more thing.

266
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,230
Jasper wanted to talk to you
before he goes away. Would you...

267
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,816
would you do that for him?

268
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:39,373
- You really didn't have to drive me.
- I wanted to.

269
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:43,127
- How long is your therapy session?
- I'll be done in about an hour.

270
00:16:43,564 --> 00:16:44,837
I'll pick you up then.

271
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,132
Thank you.

272
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:52,661
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

273
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,458
May I please get a nonfat
blended mocha for here?

274
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:14,282
And can I see a menu, too?

275
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,880
Great! Now, we're going
to be late to our own show.

276
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,510
When did they start
locking the school so early?

277
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:33,350
Maybe after somebody spray painted
"Beth Jennings is a whore"

278
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:35,971
- all over the courtyard.
- Why would anyone do that?

279
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,256
Cause she's whore-like.
Whorish, whore-esque.

280
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:39,823
Not that I did it.

281
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,182
I told you it was a stupid idea
to leave our instruments at school.

282
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:46,357
I told you guys we can't practice
in my parents' garage anymore.

283
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,067
They can't handle the noise.

284
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:51,567
- Your parents have no taste in music!
- What the...?

285
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:54,108
Why don't we just climb
up the fire escape

286
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:57,076
- and jump down into the courtyard?
- Can we do that?

287
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,526
Yeah, totally.

288
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:00,537
All right, let's do it.

289
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:05,459
- You are a genius.
- Just your number one groupie.

290
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:09,555
- Come here.
- Come on, guys!

291
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:12,456
Let's go.

292
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,639
Whatever.

293
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:35,032
Are you still mad?

294
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,606
I'm not mad. I didn't realize
we're still keeping secret.

295
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:40,467
I didn't either. I guess I'm not ready
to let people know yet.

296
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:42,448
- Awesome.
- Gia, I'm sorry.

297
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:44,508
I'm still trying to
figure this thing out.

298
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:47,225
Step one,
stop calling it "this thing. "

299
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,443
you guys?

300
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:55,121
So, how were we supposed to get
over the wall with our instruments?

301
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:01,518
I hadn't really thought
that far ahead.

302
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:16,739
Wait! Before we go in.
I got a little something for you.

303
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,407
What's this for?

304
00:19:19,512 --> 00:19:22,161
Teddy was getting something
for Silver, so I just thought...

305
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,788
Right... of course.
You know...

306
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,880
for a second there,
I thought you might really like me.

307
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:29,047
What?

308
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,005
- Look, I'm sorry...
- Shut up, douche bag.

309
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,916
I'm kidding.
Give me the necklace.

310
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,275
Is this scrimshaw?

311
00:19:36,938 --> 00:19:38,388
This is rad, Dixon.

312
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:42,222
If we were dating,
I would be all over you.

313
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,358
And that's exactly
what I want to hear.

314
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:46,991
Now, look, I'm not telling you
you have to wear it in there

315
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:50,267
and make a big fuss
about what a great boyfriend I am...

316
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,254
Prepare to be fussed over.

317
00:20:04,714 --> 00:20:06,184
What's the word?

318
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:08,954
The word is that I got a great guy.

319
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,461
- Stop it. Come on.
- No, I can't, it's true.

320
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:14,875
Look what my little Poopy got me.

321
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:22,059
- I'm sorry, "Poopy"?
- That's what she calls me.

322
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,061
- Cause she's my little Stinky Pants.
- I don't even want to know.

323
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,434
Anyway...

324
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,339
Where's the band, guys?
Aren't they supposed to go on soon?

325
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:32,441
You know bands... notoriously late.

326
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:35,337
Someone's probably throwing a fit
or eating a bat or something.

327
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,321
- Anyway, should we get drinks?
- You got it... Poopy.

328
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:42,154
Yeah, that's me.

329
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,270
Can we do that in public?

330
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:20,973
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

331
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:26,221
So... I got you a little gift, too.

332
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:28,412
To prove how well I know you.

333
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,624
- You did not have to do that.
- I know I didn't have to. I wanted to.

334
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:35,961
Because I wanted to see your face...

335
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,088
when you opened it up.

336
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:49,474
What do you think?
Do you love them?

337
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:52,674
- Are they my girl's best friend?
- Yes, they...

338
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,271
are gorgeous and big.

339
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:58,308
Thank you.

340
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:01,733
- Let's see how they look.
- Yeah, okay.

341
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,659
Beautiful. Perfect.

342
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,586
Guys, there's, like,
a zillion people out here.

343
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,005
We're gonna rock this bitch!

344
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,255
- You okay?
- Ade, what's wrong?

345
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:31,055
I can't do this.

346
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:32,851
What are you talking about?

347
00:22:33,994 --> 00:22:36,398
I have never sung
in front of a crowd like this.

348
00:22:36,634 --> 00:22:38,704
And I can't even take
a drink to calm down.

349
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:41,108
Don't worry.
You're going to be amazing.

350
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,153
I'm sorry.
I just... I can't do this.

351
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,461
What do you mean you can't?

352
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:47,741
I just can't.

353
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:50,781
All right, girl...

354
00:22:51,076 --> 00:22:53,380
We are going to be right behind you.

355
00:22:53,547 --> 00:22:56,917
You've just got to face your fears.
Don't think about who's watching...

356
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,669
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

357
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,585
Sing in my place.

358
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:04,282
- Please?
- No way.

359
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,925
No.

360
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:08,863
We're a band. All right?

361
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:11,774
It's all for one...
and all that crap.

362
00:23:13,873 --> 00:23:14,973
She's right.

363
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,021
We do it together,
or we don't do it at all.

364
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:20,857
Guys, come on.
Not a chance.

365
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:23,257
There'll be plenty of other gigs.

366
00:23:23,572 --> 00:23:25,821
The important thing
is that we stick together.

367
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:29,755
Put away the puppy dog eyes.

368
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:32,672
We're not gonna rock
this bitch without you.

369
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,346
Hi! We're The Glorious Steinems!

370
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,283
- Can I have a shot of tequila?
- Sure.

371
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:42,582
Mom. What are you doing here?

372
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,459
Guitarist's dad's an old friend.

373
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:49,089
Don't worry.
No one's going to know I'm your mom.

374
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,925
Cause if you call me "Mom"
in public, I'll sock you.

375
00:25:52,408 --> 00:25:54,094
How about "Mommy"?

376
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,222
- Swift kick to the groin.
- Gotcha.

377
00:25:57,606 --> 00:26:00,159
- So, who are you here with?
- Just some friends

378
00:26:00,424 --> 00:26:01,524
from school.

379
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:04,938
- Not that jerk Liam?
- Mom, he's not a jerk.

380
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,440
He just has god-awful
taste in women.

381
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,955
- Don't worry, you'll get over him.
- I know. I...

382
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:14,706
Whatever.

383
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:18,160
Which one is he, anyway?

384
00:26:24,613 --> 00:26:26,168
Looks like a square to me.

385
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:28,742
What's with that helmet hair?

386
00:26:29,612 --> 00:26:31,882
- Thanks, Mom.
- Shh, not so loud.

387
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:57,919
I just wanted to make
sure you're okay.

388
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,493
Don't lie to me.

389
00:27:01,145 --> 00:27:02,995
What are you talking about?

390
00:27:03,662 --> 00:27:05,212
You're here 'cause...

391
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:07,792
you have to make sure I won't
tell anyone your secret.

392
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:11,030
That's not true. Okay?

393
00:27:11,426 --> 00:27:14,507
Despite everything,
I actually care about what

394
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:16,718
- happens to you.
- But you don't love me.

395
00:27:19,552 --> 00:27:20,555
I don't.

396
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:22,891
You should've just
left me there to die.

397
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,479
Stop. Okay, just
stop manipulating me.

398
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,648
- I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

399
00:27:30,077 --> 00:27:33,902
You have been from the start.
Even the way we got together.

400
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:37,906
You were just preying on the fact
that I felt so guilty about your uncle.

401
00:27:38,243 --> 00:27:40,283
- You should feel guilty.
- Don't worry.

402
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,533
I do.

403
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,037
Every day, I do.

404
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:47,457
But I don't owe you
a relationship because of it.

405
00:27:48,643 --> 00:27:50,693
So then what incentive is there

406
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,560
to keep me from telling?

407
00:27:53,994 --> 00:27:54,994
None.

408
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:03,807
Everything I did,
I have done it because I love you.

409
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
You have to know that.

410
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:10,605
I know that you think that.

411
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:12,801
But what we had

412
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,891
was all based on lies.

413
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:17,475
- It wasn't love.
- Yes, it was.

414
00:28:20,276 --> 00:28:21,276
It was.

415
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,860
It was.

416
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:30,492
And that's why I'm not
going to tell anyone.

417
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,627
I'm never going to tell
your secret, ever.

418
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,669
I'm sorry, but...

419
00:28:36,202 --> 00:28:37,799
visiting hours ended a while ago.

420
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:42,892
Thank you.

421
00:28:46,031 --> 00:28:47,892
I really hope you get better.

422
00:28:50,638 --> 00:28:51,646
Good-bye.

423
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,041
I thought we were still trying
to figure this thing out.

424
00:30:35,387 --> 00:30:37,994
I just had to face my fears
and not worry about

425
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:39,379
who's watching.

426
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:42,048
And don't call it "this thing."

427
00:30:49,972 --> 00:30:51,722
That was an awesome show?

428
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:53,899
You okay?

429
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,146
I need to talk to you
about something.

430
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,899
It's something I feel really bad about,
but you need to know.

431
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:04,719
Or maybe you don't need to know,
but I need you to know.

432
00:31:05,735 --> 00:31:06,739
What is it?

433
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:09,951
I hate these earrings.

434
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,230
I'm sorry.

435
00:31:14,257 --> 00:31:17,500
I know that they were a gift
and it's all about the thought and...

436
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,795
It's kind of the thought that
bothers me. These are just

437
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:22,601
so not me.

438
00:31:24,073 --> 00:31:27,302
I know most girls love diamonds,
but I look at them and I think about

439
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,890
about slave mining, orphans in Sierra
Leone and these mistresses in Texas

440
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,310
with their hair- sprayed hair...
Why are you laughing?

441
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:41,733
Here's your real present.

442
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:49,365
I remember at the beginning of the year
when we read this in Matthews' class,

443
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:51,743
you went on and on
about how much you liked it,

444
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,120
and how amazing it
was that Flaubert could write

445
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,290
from a woman's perspective,
and how much that inspired you.

446
00:31:58,462 --> 00:32:00,162
And I thought to myself,

447
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:02,545
"stay away from that girl.
She's way too much. "

448
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,495
That's what you thought?

449
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,663
So, this whole time, you were...
what, you were just screwing with me?

450
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,030
See, I do pay attention to detail,
and I do know you.

451
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:15,475
I definitely knew those
earrings would make you mad.

452
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,575
They're fake... by the way.

453
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,105
But I also know how cute
you look when you're angry.

454
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,690
I hate you.

455
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:24,317
No, you don't.

456
00:32:25,003 --> 00:32:26,899
Trust me. I know you.

457
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:42,085
So, your mom seems cool.

458
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:44,832
- When did you...?
- I think it's absolutely wonderful

459
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:47,292
that you can be so open with her
about your love life.

460
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:48,508
Excuse me?

461
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,344
I heard you, loser.
I know you're still into Liam.

462
00:32:51,796 --> 00:32:53,966
What are you talking about?
I'm with Dixon now.

463
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:56,342
I saw how quickly you let go
of each other's hands

464
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:59,309
- when you thought no one was looking.
- Cause our palms were sweaty.

465
00:32:59,476 --> 00:33:02,706
- You're obviously not really dating.
- Yeah, we are.

466
00:33:02,873 --> 00:33:04,857
- In fact, we're...
- Totally pathetic.

467
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:13,866
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

468
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,296
Sorry. Naomi didn't believe
that we were actually dating.

469
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,933
We can't have that now, can we?

470
00:33:41,828 --> 00:33:43,062
That was great.

471
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,492
She totally bought that.

472
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Water?

473
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:05,752
Thank you.

474
00:34:08,308 --> 00:34:10,590
So, you feel like
your therapy session helped?

475
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:14,052
- Yeah, definitely.
- Good.

476
00:34:15,697 --> 00:34:18,598
And do you feel better about
coming forward with what happened?

477
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,163
When I was at therapy,

478
00:34:26,928 --> 00:34:28,628
I really thought through

479
00:34:29,452 --> 00:34:31,902
what will happen
if I do come forward.

480
00:34:35,144 --> 00:34:37,617
Everyone at school
will talk about me, judge me,

481
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,994
maybe even blame me
for what happened.

482
00:34:41,432 --> 00:34:44,532
I wish I were stronger, Liam,
I really wish I were.

483
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:48,426
The truth is, I'm not.

484
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:52,444
And I'm not ready. And I don't know
when or if I ever will be.

485
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:54,467
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

486
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,984
I should be stronger.
I should be...

487
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,139
It's all right.

488
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,768
I hate that guy for putting
you in this position.

489
00:35:07,368 --> 00:35:08,418
I hate him.

490
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,400
Mr. Cannon, I forgot my paper.
Can I run home and get it?

491
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,576
- I don't know.
- Please?

492
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:23,876
You know you're, like, my
favorite teacher, right?

493
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:27,473
Okay, go get your paper,
but don't be gone too long.

494
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,940
- You son of a bitch.
- Get your hands off me!

495
00:35:39,524 --> 00:35:41,324
You're a piece of garbage.

496
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,168
What's your name?!

497
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:00,683
Okay, this is cool.

498
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,536
Thank you.

499
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:05,703
See ya.

500
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:08,465
Thanks for letting me
borrow your car.

501
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:11,565
Yeah, no worries.
Just return it with a full tank of gas,

502
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:13,432
- and no dents.
- Yeah.

503
00:36:15,312 --> 00:36:16,962
That's Adrianna, right?

504
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:20,845
Sweet.

505
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,723
What are you doing? You can't
exactly just park the car here.

506
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,373
You park it, then.

507
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:33,316
I'm Ivy's mom.

508
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:36,652
I saw your show last night.

509
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:38,821
You were fantastic.

510
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:40,323
Thank you.

511
00:36:43,877 --> 00:36:45,161
You're a music producer?

512
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:47,705
Until the powers
that be tell me otherwise.

513
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:52,495
I work with a lot
of talented musicians your age.

514
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:54,712
And I'm interested in signing you.

515
00:36:58,006 --> 00:36:59,306
No, I mean, yes.

516
00:37:00,213 --> 00:37:01,219
I mean, really?

517
00:37:02,593 --> 00:37:03,643
Oh, my God.

518
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:05,807
I can't wait to tell the band.

519
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,523
I wouldn't rub it in their faces.

520
00:37:11,474 --> 00:37:14,374
Because I'm not interested
in signing the band.

521
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:16,317
I'm only interested in you.

522
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:28,485
Okay, just get it out
of your system now.

523
00:37:28,652 --> 00:37:30,545
Do you prefer the more
colloquial "Poops,"

524
00:37:30,712 --> 00:37:33,543
or perhaps the more
formal "Señor Poopy"?

525
00:37:33,946 --> 00:37:34,996
Very funny.

526
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,839
- Do you want your money or not?
- What money?

527
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,716
You didn't hear about the Lakers?

528
00:37:41,111 --> 00:37:44,934
Kobe sat out, and they still beat
the spread. I owe you $250.

529
00:37:47,538 --> 00:37:50,101
- It pains me to take this.
- It pains me even more.

530
00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:53,396
But it's my own fault.
I should have trusted my instincts.

531
00:37:54,965 --> 00:37:57,608
Anyway there's a
game this weekend, and...

532
00:37:58,139 --> 00:37:59,902
I want to put
the rest of this on L.A.

533
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,530
Man, are you sure?

534
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:05,734
Positive. I got to build back up.

535
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:07,659
See you later, man.

536
00:38:07,826 --> 00:38:08,828
Later.

537
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:17,086
It's an awful day
to be stuck in school.

538
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,614
How about we grab our
wetsuits and head up to Zuma?

539
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:22,091
It's tempting, but I can't.
I have a history test.

540
00:38:22,615 --> 00:38:23,624
Square.

541
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:43,272
Okay, I'm going
to go take a history test,

542
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:46,689
which will be a lot more
pleasant than this encounter.

543
00:38:54,443 --> 00:38:56,143
What's up, Stinky Pants?

544
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,390
What up, Poopy?

545
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:04,436
You know, just in case
Naomi walks by.

546
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:05,603
Gotcha.

547
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:08,705
- I like the way you think.
- Thank you.

548
00:39:14,172 --> 00:39:16,527
Did you hear about Liam?
He's in the principal's office.

549
00:39:16,694 --> 00:39:19,690
- What? Why?
- Apparently, he attacked Mr. Cannon.

550
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,160
Oh, my God!

551
00:39:25,244 --> 00:39:26,944
So, Liam, what happened?

552
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:29,450
Why would you go after Mr. Cannon?

553
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:37,792
I don't even know this kid.

554
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:42,330
If you don't say something, I'm going
to have no choice but to expel you.

555
00:39:52,128 --> 00:39:54,362
Why don't you head back
to your class, Miles?

556
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:55,529
Thanks.

557
00:40:03,876 --> 00:40:06,570
- Is Liam in there?
- You know that kid?

558
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:09,825
- He's my boyfriend.
- Say good-bye to him for me.

559
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:11,792
He's about to be expelled.

560
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:14,912
What happened?

561
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,565
- Please, you can't do this.
- This doesn't concern you.

562
00:40:17,732 --> 00:40:18,882
Yes, it does.

563
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,293
I didn't tell him
what this is about.

564
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,295
You don't have to say anything.

565
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:26,441
Yes, I do.

566
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,760
Principal Wilson,
this is all my fault.

567
00:40:31,158 --> 00:40:33,858
The only reason Liam
did this is because...

568
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:41,858
because Mr. Cannon
sexually harassed me.
