1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,260
Mr.Matthews?

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,910
Class,this is kimberly mcintyre.

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,370
She's transferring to west beverly,starting today.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,780
Please make her feel at home.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,070
Thanks,harry.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,940
Uh,welcome to west bev.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,360
You can have a seat right there.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,100
Y.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,270
He can I just say that I was the new girl up until.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,070
right now,so I totally know how you feel.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,560
Well,I guess you weren't very good at it 'cause now I got the job.

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,230
That's cute.

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,180
Uh,you want to tell us a little something about yourself,kimberly?

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,070
Well,why don't you just take whatever the old new girl

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,080
said about herself and just make it better.

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,360
Well,that's tough,because the old new girl is from kansas,

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,270
and it just doesn't get any better than that.

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,420
There's no place like home.

19
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,730
Right.

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,940
Okay.

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,830
so let me just talk about myself without feeling totally awkward.

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,120
Don't worry,everyone in this class has had their awkward moments.

23
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,500
I'm kim.

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,740
I'm from las vegas.

25
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,110
I wear size eight shoes.

26
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,620
I have three piercings,but I won't say where.

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,270
And I like tacos.

28
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,470
Great,I also like tacos.

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,470
Welcome to the school.

30
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,650
Any piercings?

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,620
Moving on.

32
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,090
This has always been one of my favorite experiments.

33
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,550
You'll be paired off into couples,all with different socioeconomic backgrounds.

34
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,960
By the end of the experiment,you'll have taken care of your real care baby

35
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,600
and also managed the family budget that you are each given.

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,950
Uh,that's women's work-- I mean,whoever I get paired up with better recognize.

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,170
mike,you'll be paired with navid.

38
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,270
What?

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,000
That's right.

40
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,520
You are a same sex couple,and navid is the breadwinner.

41
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,660
Um,I usually go for blondes.

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,580
With boobs.

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,820
Annie and ethan,you are married.

44
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,660
Annie works.

45
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,970
Ethan is a stay-at-home dad.

46
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,900
do I have,like,a hobby?

47
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,430
Your hobby.

48
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,440
is your baby.

49
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,220
Your unique wireless I.D.

50
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,770
Will track your baby care.

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,000
The baby must be fed,burped,rocked and diapered around the clock.

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,390
If you shake the baby,do not support the baby's head or mishandle it in any way.

53
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,440
It will register as abused,and you will fail.

54
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,830
Half-birthday?

55
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,830
Mm-hmm,it's the six month mark between 

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,860
you know how when you're a kid and you're all like,",

57
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,920
I'm four and three quarters," or,"I'm five and a half"?

58
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,630
It's like every single milestone is such a big deal,

59
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,490
and then at some point,

60
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,640
you just stop counting all those little in-between markers.

61
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,620
Yeah,not me.

62
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,770
I will always celebrcelebrate my half-birthday.

63
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,650
You are a very strange girl.

64
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,320
Yeah?Well,I'm a strange girl who's gonna have the most rockingest half-birthday ever.

65
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,640
Come on-- psycho at a cemetery?

66
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,370
How awesomely perfect.

67
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,900
Okay,tell me you you're into hitchcock.

68
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,600
I don't do horror movies.

69
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,100
Why,are you scared?

70
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,150
you scared,you scared?

71
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,310
No.I just think they're stupid.

72
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,340
sometimes that's the beauty of them.

73
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,430
clearly,you just haven't been initiated properly.

74
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,170
Well,uh,maybe you can initiate me the right way.

75
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,740
Okay.

76
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,280
Okay,um,since I am a high-powered attorney,

77
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,590
the teacher says,you can take the baby during business hours.

78
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,670
No,don'T.don't you have day care at your fancy office?

79
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,220
No.

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,090
No,I don'T.

81
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,300
So,uh,hey,how'S.

82
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,480
how's my nephew?

83
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,840
Your nephew is a girl.

84
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,440
that's what I meant.

85
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,090
um,I think you guys have things in reverse.

86
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,270
First,you date,then marriage,and then a baby,

87
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,440
but,you know,whatever works for you.

88
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,080
No,me and ethan,not so much.

89
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,870
He is in rebound city,plus I take my relationships seriously,

90
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,820
and from what I've seen,clearly he does not.

91
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,630
I need a guy who's dependable,who I can count on,you know?

92
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,390
I feel you.

93
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,340
well,hello,stranger.

94
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,050
,hey-hey-hey,what's up?

95
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,800
Not much.

96
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,930
I just haven't really talked to you in a while.

97
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,900
How you been?

98
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,900
Sit.

99
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,060
So?

100
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,590
So,how's mommy dearest?

101
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,710
You know,desperate to be dina lan and 

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,570
making me suffer for every second that she's not.

103
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,710
How you holding up?

104
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,310
I'm fine.

105
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,160
Yeah There's just a lot of.

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,840
talk going around,you know?

107
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,590
I hear this talk,and I worry about you.

108
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,510
Yeah,well,that's all it is,is talk.

109
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,670
Rumors.

110
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,010
Good,good.

111
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,120
The only problem I have is her.

112
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,840
She's the one who got me kicked out of the play.

113
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,700
She's the one running to principal daddy with lies.

114
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,900
Today after school,she's auditioning against me for a movie.

115
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,370
How messed up is that?

116
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,750
Weird.

117
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,570
Whatever.

118
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,170
Okay.

119
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,200
I just.

120
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,470
you know,I hear things,and I know things.

121
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,750
And I see you putting eye drops in your eyes,and I.

122
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,060
all right,it's called allergies,naomi.

123
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,210
Can we not do an intervention in the quad?

124
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,500
Seriously,I'm fine.

125
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,130
Let's do five minutes on you.

126
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,440
Um,ethan and I broke up.

127
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,240
My parents are getting a divorce--

128
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,590
my whole world is just basically a disaster,

129
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,010
and I don't know,I just kind of need my best friend right now.

130
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,590
I'm sorry.

131
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,980
Okay,I've just been really wrapped up in auditions.

132
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,080
I'm here.

133
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,200
always.

134
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,950
How about we hang out after school today?

135
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,380
Pinkberry and shopping?

136
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,460
Ragging on our parents?

137
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,290
Good times.

138
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,830
all right,wish me luck.

139
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,680
I need a lot of it.

140
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,020
Good luck.

141
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,950
Hey,in fact,it's been.

142
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,380
it's been a while,but,um.

143
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,090
switch?

144
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,350
Switch.

145
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,440
It has been a while.

146
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,550
For lu for luck.

147
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,010
Now,you're definitely gonna get it.

148
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,540
Great,so I'll get the invitations printed,

149
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,560
and I'll call you when they're in.

150
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,050
I think it's gonna be the best fund-raiser we've had yet.

151
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,210
I have no doubt.

152
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,080
I want to thank you both for your help.

153
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,690
Thank you.

154
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,690
I'll see you soon.

155
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,110
Talk to you soon.

156
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,100
Harry,can I talk to you for a second?

157
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,320
Sure,yeah.

158
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,930
It's about our son.

159
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,640
I mean,you know,do you think about him?

160
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,220
Do you wonder what he looks like,what his interests are,

161
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,720
Yeah,yeah,but that.

162
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,700
I'm just trying to figure this all out.

163
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,110
I mean,I'd like to know that he's okay,but.

164
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,960
knowing that he's okay isn't good enough for me,

165
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,250
so I've decided to do something about it.

166
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,740
Which is?

167
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,220
I want to hire a private investigator to find him.

168
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,640
Please,please don't kill me.

169
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,400
I am so not ready to die yet.

170
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,770
I haven't even been to prom.

171
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,680
,I.

172
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,090
I haven't been asked,actually,

173
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,670
but I heard that rick bartley's gonna ask me,and I.

174
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,050
he'S...he's rick bartley.

175
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,380
You...you wouldn't want to take that away from a young girl in her prime,now,would you?

176
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,630
Please don't kill me.

177
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,310
I'm not,um.

178
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,330
please don't kill me,I'm not ready to.

179
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,080
I haven't even.

180
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,820
I haven't even gone to.

181
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,330
Okay.

182
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,700
Damn it!

183
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,130
Please don't kill me.

184
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,580
That was great,annie.

185
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,820
Thanks for coming in.

186
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,950
Thank you for having me.

187
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,400
Sure.

188
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,250
You can go now,annie.

189
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,800
Right-- leaving.

190
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,630
Hi,adrianna.

191
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,450
Ready.adrianna?

192
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,350
I'm ready to rock it.

196
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,900
Hello.

197
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,600
We've only just been broken up for a few days,

198
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,170
and you already have a baby with someone else?

199
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,590
That's impressive.

200
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,930
Yeah,we're just doing a project for miss wells' class.

201
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,710
,you two are doing that project?

202
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,470
That's cute.

203
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,260
Yes,we are married for the project.

204
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,280
This is our baby.

205
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,470
How nice for you.

206
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,300
I don't care.

207
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,300
I've moved on.

208
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,530
Ethan and i are over,and he is more than welcome to have

209
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,480
as many babies as he wants with whomever he pleases.

210
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,660
Well,I am off to meet adrianna.

211
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,730
You guys have fun.

212
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,900
Enjoy your little baby.

213
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,570
Bye-bye.

214
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,200
And.

215
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,760
awkward.

216
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,490
You okay?

217
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,030
Yeah,good times.

218
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,640
You know,it's not like you guys are gonna stay broken up,right?

219
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,540
No,actually,we are.

220
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,770
Yeah,well,I've been here six weeks,

221
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,910
and you guys have already broken up and gotten back together three times,so.

222
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,190
that's the point.

223
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,570
I...I can't do it anymore.

224
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,080
We've been through this so many times,

225
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,020
and it didn't even hurt this last time.

226
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,710
I don't want to be in a relationship where I just keep breaking up with the person.

227
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,890
In this room.

228
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,930
I'm painting this wall black.

229
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,320
Just one wall?

230
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,060
Yeah.

231
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,200
I think it makes a statement.

232
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,540
Well,what's the statement,I ran out of paint?

233
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,210
You know black's my favorite color.

234
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,010
I like that,but,uh,what about kelly?

235
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,250
She doesn't strike me as a "wall painted black" kind of girl.

236
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,610
That's the beauty of paint,right?

237
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,950
You can just paint over it later.

238
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:50,260
Man,so you're staying here by yourself for two weeks.

239
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,490
You aren't scared to be here all alone?

240
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,230
I need you to relax and just.

241
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,970
embrace the awesomeness of this situation.

242
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,360
Me,your girlfriend,has a house all to herself.

243
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,360
Point taken.

244
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,410
So,uh,this is definitely gonna become the new party house.

245
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,870
I think I'm gonna charge a cover.

246
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,120
You gonna charge me?

247
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,610
You'll work it off.

248
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,010
I like the way you think.

249
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,490
But right now,you're gonna lay back,

250
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,840
take off your shoes and get ready for something you've never done before.

251
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,440
In my hands,I have the three greatest horror movies ever.

252
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,340
We're gonna have a major movie marathon,my friend.

253
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,550
You have some nerve accusing me of doing.

254
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,970
I have some nerve?

255
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,530
- Tabitha,you have some nerve.
- Hey,what's going on?

256
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,820
Harry,it's my pool,and I'm going to do what I want when I want!

257
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,490
Did I miss a segue here?

258
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,270
Your mother flashed the gardener again.

259
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,220
I never flashed mauricio.

260
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,140
I like to swim naked.

261
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,220
I like know it feels when the water glides off my ass.

262
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,640
Why should I give that up?

263
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,600
Mom,mauricio comes once a week.

264
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,150
Do you have to swim naked at that exact time?

265
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,200
Harry,don't be such a prude.

266
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,970
I'm letting my freak flag fly,and there's nothing you can do about it.

267
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,880
Yeah,and-and speaking of odd women,omen,uh,

268
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,170
tracy was at school today,and she completely blindsided me about.

269
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,860
about?

270
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,070
About wanting to hire a P.I.To find.

271
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,970
our birth son,and she wants my okay.

272
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,580
Did you give it to her?

273
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,640
No.

274
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,480
I mean,I don't know how I can stop her if she wants to.

275
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,630
Just time-out.

276
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,220
I get the feeling the only thing holding you back is how you think I'm gonna react.

277
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,270
No,that is not the only thing.

278
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,620
I mean,that's a big thing,but.

279
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,100
the kids,too.

280
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,700
Do you want to find him,harry?

281
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,250
Yeah.

282
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,000
I do.

283
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,250
I was thinking that I could write a letter,register with the adoption agency,

284
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:25,180
and someday,if he wants to find me,or us,he can.

285
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,730
Okay,well,I think that sounds like a good plan.

286
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,170
You.

287
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,260
are amazing.

288
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,400
Yeah.

289
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,180
Tomorrow?

290
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,910
Um,that's kind of sudden,isn't it?

291
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,440
I thought you guys were going to scope the place out first.

292
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,630
I'm so glad you came by,naomi.

293
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,830
Gosh,every time I see you,

294
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,680
I think it's such a shame you're not trying to be actress like ade.

295
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,850
you've got such a look.

296
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,570
Although,you know,I prefer when you wear your hair straight.

297
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,090
So much prettier.

298
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,650
So,is adrianna here?

299
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,810
She must be celebrating.

300
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,870
She got the movie.

301
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,410
that's incredible.

302
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,120
She must be so thrilled.

303
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,800
We are.

304
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,430
Especially after she botched her last couple auditions.

305
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,840
It's about time she got her act together.

306
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,630
So,you don't have any idea where she's at?

307
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,720
I mean,I was supposed to meet her today after school.

308
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,020
I called a few times,and she hasn't answered the phone.

309
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,170
I'm a little worried,so,I.

310
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,860
,she probably just got so excited about getting the part,she forgot.

311
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah,she's just.

312
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,730
she's off celebr ing.

313
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,550
It's an homage to the texas chainsaw massacre,

314
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:01,090
and the character of captain spalding is a total satire,

315
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,500
but at the same time,he's terrifying.

316
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,710
Can you believe that rob zombie directed this?

317
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,200
Dixon,wake up!

318
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,370
The call's coming from inside the house.

319
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,730
How long have you been sleeping?

320
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,070
I don't know.I was asleep.

321
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,560
What time is it?

322
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,900
11:30.

323
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,400
11:00.

324
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,500
My god,I got to.

325
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,890
I got to go.

326
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,090
Glad you enjoyed the movies.

327
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,880
Look,if-if I don't want to watch one movie,

328
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,560
what makes you think I'm gonna sit through three?

329
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,740
E?

330
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,230
I-I got to go.

331
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,790
I got to go.

332
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,220
Grandma,you don't see me.

333
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,930
You just forgot to take your blue pill.

334
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,660
Did all the blood rush away from the part of your brain that allows you to tell time?

335
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,510
I was just,um.

336
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,400
sneaking in.

337
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,980
Were you with a girl?

338
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,580
I want all the deets.

339
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,320
Don't worry.I won't tell your mom and dad.

340
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,870
Thank-thank you so much,grandma.

341
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,170
I meant,I won't tell them if you were with a girl.

342
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,980
They know you're not home.

343
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,730
Your mother's halfway to calling the police.

344
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,490
Dixon!

345
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,290
I am so furious with you!

346
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,180
Where have you been?

347
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,520
Hey,your mother was freaking out.

348
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,320
Silver made me watch a bunch of whack-ass horror movies,and I fell asleep!

349
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:24,980
I'm-I'm sorry.

350
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,310
I wasn't doing anything fun.

351
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,770
- Trust me.
- Still unacceptable.

352
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,930
Can somebody shut that baby up,please?

353
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,840
I'm trying!

354
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,960
Harry,relax.

355
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,070
He fell asleep.

356
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,560
It's not like he spent the night in tijuana with a couple of laker girls and a goat.

357
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,480
I really hope I get the wording right when I repeat that line to my future therapist.

358
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,680
Annie,the baby.

359
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,470
I can't find her.

360
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,040
Some parent you are.

361
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,160
Hey,this cannot happen again.

362
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,810
It won'T.

363
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,730
Where was your cell phone?

364
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,280
It-it died.

365
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,640
Dixon.

366
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,670
so,uh,where was it?

367
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,240
In the bathroom.

368
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,040
corner.

369
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,610
Under my jeans.

370
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,060
Nobody puts baby in the corner.

371
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,060
no.

372
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,290
Good night.

373
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,730
Hey,how's it going?

374
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,700
Missing my sis?

375
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,870
Feeling a little blue?

376
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,630
Actually,I,uh,already started dating.

377
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,810
Okay.That was fast.

378
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,250
Yeah,well,did you think I'd stay on the market forever?

379
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,300
Kind of,but that's great.

380
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:35,040
You should bring one of the lucky ladies to the hollywood forever cemetery tonight.

381
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,010
They're showing psycho.

382
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,660
Yeah,great.

383
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,260
No,I'll do that.

384
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,140
I'll bring one of the,uh,lucky ladies to the cemetery.

385
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,480
That I will do.

386
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,440
See you.

387
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,940
Cool.

388
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,050
So,did you get in trouble with the rents?

389
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,610
Yeah.

390
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,370
they're pissed.

391
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,330
So pissed that they insisted on going to hollywood

392
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,930
forever tonight just to make sure I make curfew.

393
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,020
All right,well,look,um,

394
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,750
last night I was trying to show you something important to me.

395
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,700
A house of a thousand corpses is important to you?

396
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,430
I was trying to share something that I like with you.

397
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,630
All right,all right.

398
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,710
I'm sorry.

399
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,090
It wasn't intentional,all right?

400
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,380
Yo,be careful.

401
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,360
What?It's not real.

402
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,010
I don't want to fail.

403
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,220
Show me one person who's ever gotten lower than a b in health class,and.

404
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,130
I don't even have to finish that sentence,because it has never happened.

405
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,470
So,you guys are coming tonight,right?

406
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,250
Not only is it the most kick-ass movie ever to show at a cemetery,

407
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,550
but they also have a jnny ramone tribute statue that I am dying to see.

408
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,140
Yeah,me,too.

409
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,220
Shut up.You're making fun of me.

410
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,190
So,you guys want to ride together,or just meet there?

411
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,590
I.

412
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,490
uh,yeah,I suppose we could both go,

413
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,440
you know,as parents,with the baby with us.

414
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,050
Yeah,yeah.It's,uh.

415
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,170
it sounds like a-a plan.

416
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,350
Great.Let's do it.

417
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,270
Hey,wilson,go long.

418
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,980
Hey,no,don't go long!

419
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,150
Hey,it's a baby!

420
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,310
I know it's a baby.

421
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,730
So the concept of the totalitarian authority in orwell's book

422
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,930
really coined the now ever-so-popular term "big brother.

423
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,370
" What does totalitarian mean,mr.Matthews?

424
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,250
You look wiped.

425
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,650
Late night?

426
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,760
Yeah.

427
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,670
Very.

428
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,480
Someone knows how to party.

429
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,880
No,I was actually on baby duty.

430
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,570
Baby duty?

431
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,660
Kimberly!

432
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,890
Once again.

433
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,690
Am I boring you?

434
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,020
I did see the movie.

435
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,370
Not the same thing,and the questions on your test will reflect the book,

436
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,340
not the movie.

437
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,750
So,if you'd stop wasting my time,I could maybe.

438
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,870
excuse me,mr.Matthews,but if I'm here,

439
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,050
and you're here,doesn't that make it.

440
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,940
nice reference,spicoli,but didn't you graduate in 1982?

441
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,450
Thank you.I'm here all week.

442
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,500
And you're going to be here at lunch,too,'cause you just got a detention.

443
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,440
So,debbie and I have lked,and we have decided to go forward with this.

444
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,080
Yes!

445
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,930
Hold on a second,trace.

446
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,620
I'm-I'm not into the whole P.I.Thing.

447
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,410
I mean,we're not chasing somebody down here,so.

448
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,290
you know,we're gonna have to write a letter to the adoption agency.

449
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,930
yeah,whoa,whoa,harry.

450
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,530
I already hired a P.I.

451
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,310
What?

452
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,790
What the hell did you do that for?

453
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,110
Look,I've waited for 22 years.

454
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,510
Besides,you know,I just kind of figured that you'd come around,

455
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,460
so I went ahead and did it.

456
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,230
Come on!

457
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,890
Tracy,that's not what we talked about.

458
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,220
You come on,harry.

459
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,270
I know you.

460
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,090
You want to know how he's been doing.

461
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,150
This has been killing you.

462
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:20,930
Tell me I'm wrong.

463
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,840
Okay,yeah,I feel bad about the whole thing,but you should not have done this.

464
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,540
Now,look,harry,I get it.

465
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,710
This whole thing is a shock to you,

466
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,530
but I've been dealing with this every day since I was 19.

467
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,810
Yeah.

468
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,580
I'm sorry about that.

469
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,330
It's really nice to finally hear you say that.

470
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,200
hey,it's okay.

471
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,270
Yeah.

472
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,080
Y.'S oka whoa!

473
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,870
Tracy.

474
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,050
I'm going to pretend that that never happened.

475
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,690
I'm sorry.

476
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,890
Yeah.

477
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,240
I hear this is where the party's at.

478
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,200
Uh,that's right,so you can sit down

479
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,300
and pour yourself a tall glass of shut up and don't speak for the next hour.

480
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,230
Does that come in diet?

481
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,170
'Cause I'm kind of watching my figure.

482
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,900
And that ends the conversation portion of this detention.

483
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,780
I know you love my company,but this is getting a little old,mr.Matthews.

484
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,910
The fact that I made out with you in the fifth grade makes me want to cut my tongue off.

485
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,750
Do you have a girlfriend?

486
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,940
That's none of your business.

487
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,210
Are you gay?

488
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,700
You seem kind of gay.

489
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,290
Yeah,about as gay as yo dad.

490
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,830
My dad's dead.

491
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,990
Hmm,well,I think your dad's about as dead as I am gay.

492
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,580
Touch?

493
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,660
Yeah,good luck with that.

494
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,730
Starting to see why you got kicked out of your last school.

495
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,290
You two sound like my mom and my old soccer coach.

496
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,570
Before the unpleasantness.

497
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,410
Mr.Matthews,do you have a second?

498
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,930
Yeah,I do.

499
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,150
I'm stepping out for 30 seconds.

500
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,460
George,I'll give you a dollar if you keep your trap shut,

501
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,330
and two if you learn how to read.

502
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,380
I can read,mr.Matthews.

503
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,600
I'm ignoring you.

504
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,230
So.

505
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,250
detention.Bad kids,

506
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,860
any idea where a girl can score some party favors?

507
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,410
I waited for you last night.

508
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,820
I'm happy you got the part,but why you didn't call me?

509
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,500
You heard?

510
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,770
Isn't it awesome?

511
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,360
I was driving over to see you and then I got the call

512
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,020
that I got the part and so I had to call my mom,

513
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,650
d th anen I had to go home and celebrate,and it was just.

514
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,710
that's not true,adrianna.

515
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,470
I was at your house last night and you weren't there.

516
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,610
Why are you lying to me?

517
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,530
Can you just take one minute and be happy for me?

518
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,140
I got the movie!

519
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,300
Looks like our lucky necklace switch worked!

520
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,030
I think you can have it back now.

521
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,790
What-- wh-wh-wh-whoa,what?

522
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,070
Are you kidding me with this?Really?

523
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,160
I know this lipstick container,adrianna.

524
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,980
Are you kidding me?What do you care?

525
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,430
- It was yours.
- It was mine.

526
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,220
Not anymore.

527
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,010
I experimented and I stopped.

528
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,120
Like you supposedly did.

529
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,480
Give me a break,naomi.

530
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,330
No!No,I won't give you a break.

531
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,790
Okay,I'm your friend.

532
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,440
And I may come off as annoying or whatever you think I am,

533
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,810
but I care about you.

534
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,050
And I'm worried about you.

535
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,190
I'm fine.

536
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,260
You're not fine.

537
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,470
And don't,don'T.

538
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,570
don't walk away from me.

539
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,710
I can help you,okay?

540
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,730
I can help you deal with this,but you got to let me.

541
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,420
my god.

542
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,350
my god!

543
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,260
Okay,you're right.

544
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,920
All right,I'm using,but it'S.

545
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,110
it's not like I'm addicted.

546
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,320
I could stop whenever I want.

547
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,950
I'm just like,I'm just under so much pressure from my mom to get a stupid job.

548
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,400
I finally work super hard to get something and I'm gonna get busted.

549
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,070
I'm gonna get kicked out of school.

550
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,540
I'm gonna lose the movie.

551
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,490
I'm gonna lose no,no,no,no.

552
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,310
- Everything!
- No!

553
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,210
- No,you're not.
- Give it to me.

554
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,950
- What?
- No!

555
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,830
Just give it to me.

556
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,550
Stop whatever you're doing!

557
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,710
Where'd you find it?

558
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,870
The coke was in the lipstick.

559
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,270
We'll cop you on the police report.

560
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,360
What the hell,harry?

561
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,590
Isn't there a better way than busting kids?

562
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,950
It's a little extreme,don't you think?

563
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,430
I don't want drugs on this campus.

564
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,160
And neither do I.

565
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,510
But you get one chance to earn these kids' trust.

566
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,780
What,are you defending drug dealers?

567
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,120
Not everyone is a dealer.

568
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,350
Naomi?

569
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,840
Please.

570
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,250
These kids have rights.

571
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,870
They don't have right to bring drugs to school.

572
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,570
This isn't china.

573
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,820
It's beverly hills,all right?

574
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,820
This isn't cool,harry.

575
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,310
Not interested in being cool.

576
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,290
Or in your opinion,mr.Matthews.

577
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,210
That was brutal.

578
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,670
Big time.

579
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,420
Those weren't her drugs,ethan.

580
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,960
I know.

581
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,500
Come on,adrianna.

582
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,630
E alone.

583
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,870
Did you see her get busted?

584
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,550
They took her down to book her.

585
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,650
Yeah,well,her dad will get her out of it.

586
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,220
Yeah,and then what's her dad gonna do to her?

587
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,920
She's probably gonna get suspended no matter what.

588
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,930
Maybe even expelled.

589
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,340
She shouldn't be in this situation,adrianna.

590
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,310
You need to step up and admit the drugs were yours.

591
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:50,960
Says who?

592
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,040
Says me.

593
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,630
I saw her take the drugs from you.

594
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,210
Well,for your information,naomi's the one that initiated me into the c&c club.

595
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,550
C&c club?

596
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,190
Cocaine and champagne.

597
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,180
Yeah,but she grew out of it,'cause she realized how stupid it was.

598
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,680
You can't just let her take the rap for you.

599
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,930
What do you care about naomi?

600
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,820
You're already practically dry-humping her boyfriend.

601
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,770
Ex-boyfriend.

602
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,530
And she does care.

603
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,300
We both care.

604
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,840
Now,if you care about naomi-- you'll prove it.

605
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,000
Mom,what are you doing?

606
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,990
I'm doing what I should have done a long time ago.

607
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,230
I'm acting like your mother instead of your sister or your friend.

608
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:33,840
You kidding me?

609
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,720
Dad,she's tearing my room apart!

610
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,320
If I wasn't bailing you out,I'd be doing it right along with her.

611
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,020
Great.

612
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,450
You guys!

613
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,990
There aren't any drugs here.

614
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,230
I don't do drugs!

615
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,720
Well,you just got caught red-handed.

616
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,650
Come on,mom.

617
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,790
You know I don't do drugs.

618
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:46,570
What is this?

619
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,480
No,I know that you dabbled with adrianna over a year ago.

620
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,930
What I don't know is if your father leaving has made you start again.

621
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,720
That's nice,tracy.

622
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,570
Why don't we just lay off the digs and deal with the issue here?

623
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,210
This is the issue,charles.

624
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,850
You don't think there's consequences for what you did to this family?

625
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,100
Okay,stop!

626
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,230
Daddy,you can fix this.

627
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,130
You can get me out of this.

628
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,040
Can you just make it go away?

629
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,510
I don't think you get how serious this is.

630
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,700
I may not be a to.

631
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,300
Sit down.

632
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,110
What?

633
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,610
Sit down.

634
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,330
You're doing this to get attention?

635
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,870
No.

636
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,110
You're doing this 'cause you think you're gonna get your mom and me back together?

637
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,310
No.

638
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,570
Well,I'm not just gonna be able to write a check-- not for this.

639
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,640
This is gonna go on your permanent record.

640
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,210
You're gonna have to be drug-tested,make court appearances.

641
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,060
Listen,if there's anything that you want to tell us,you should.

642
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,200
Now.

643
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,140
God.

644
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,620
I know.

645
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,710
Look at this.

646
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,860
I'm in a lot of trouble,ade.

647
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,510
I know.

648
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,930
I'm sorry.

649
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,210
I.

650
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,350
I thought your dad would be able to get you out of it.

651
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,200
Yeah.

652
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,670
Me,too.

653
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,080
Apparently he can'T.

654
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,990
Well,maybe he can figure something out.

655
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,420
He's got to figure something out.

656
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,330
Look,I-I want to help,but I.

657
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,960
but what,ade?

658
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,400
I mean,no offense,but this should be you.

659
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,820
I don't think you're grasping how totally screwed I am right now?

660
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,950
I could go to jail.

661
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,080
You won't go to jail.

662
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,590
You don't know that.

663
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,760
Look,I-I need you to tell them that the drugs were yours.

664
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,720
It's gonna suck.

665
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,050
I'm sorry.

666
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,470
I'll lose my movie.

667
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,230
No.

668
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,190
You'll get another one.

669
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,190
Okay?

670
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,640
You'll get another one when you're clean.

671
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,590
Babe,you got to get help.

672
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,160
You really have to stop.

673
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,650
You need to go to rehab.

674
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,160
Hey,maybe it could be a good career move?

675
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,870
What do you know?

676
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,770
Sadly,that's probably true.

677
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,110
Look,I had your back.

678
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,890
You've got to have mine now,okay?

679
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,640
We're going to my dad's office to meet with his attorney.

680
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,300
Come with me.

681
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,640
Maybe he can help you,too.

682
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,670
Okay.

683
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,500
Okay,yeah.

684
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,690
My mom is totally gonna freak out.

685
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,280
Give me an hour or so to explain everything.

686
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,620
Of course.

687
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,810
You'll meet us there?

688
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,170
Yeah.

689
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,260
I'll see you in a bit.

690
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,990
I'm really sorry.

691
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,760
We're gonna sort this out,okay?

692
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,980
Okay.

693
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,040
Mom?

694
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,090
There's my star!

695
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,190
This cake is just symbolic-- so I don't want you eating it or anything.

696
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,320
Calories.

697
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,750
Hey,mom,can we,um.

698
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,050
you did it!You saved us.

699
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,220
Could we talk?

700
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,850
We were about to lose the house.

701
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,820
We were gonna lose the house?

702
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,080
Well,I didn't want to frighten you or put pressure on you or anything,but,yeah.

703
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,140
I mean,I've been literally packing the last few days when you weren't home.

704
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,800
But we're good now!

705
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,190
And it's only up from here.

706
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,220
Bigger and brighter.

707
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,120
'Cause all of our problems are solved.

708
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,490
All because of you,baby.

709
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,030
It's crazy,right?

710
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,920
couldn't sing.

711
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,410
Wasn't handsome.

712
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,440
But still became a rock star sex symbol.

713
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,360
Now,that was a cool guy.

714
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,760
This is jnny ramone?

715
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,290
Thought it was howard stern.

716
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,130
All right,all right,take my picture with it.

717
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,580
Lv All right,come here.Get him in there.

718
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,810
Yeah!

719
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,680
All right.

720
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,350
I mean,I guess they were pretty influential

721
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,050
to a lot of bands that came out after them.

722
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,860
You know?I heard a green day cover of one of their songs.

723
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:21,240
Well,look at you.You're a ramone fan?

724
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,900
Well.

725
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,510
you like them and I like you.

726
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,250
So,you know,I downloaded a couple songs.

727
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,680
Okay,that was really cute.

728
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,140
Can I just say I have had the day from hell,

729
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,870
and you have completely turned that around.

730
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,430
Honestly,I was a little nervous.

731
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,360
I just,I've just heard a lot of horror stories about people meeting online.

732
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,830
,I do it all the time.

733
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,450
Yeah?

734
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,790
You are so cute.

735
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,200
I'm so used to guys not looking like their pictures.

736
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,280
Like at all.

737
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,850
Well,you are quite attractive yourself.

738
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,840
Honestly,prettier than your pictures.

739
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,650
Really?

740
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,280
Yeah.

741
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,020
You're right,though.I totally need new headshots.

742
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,950
You're an actress?

743
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,800
In L.A.?That's rare.

744
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,460
Really?God,I find there are actors everywhere.

745
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,770
Yeah,no,I was,I was.

746
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,330
never mind.

747
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,220
Um,would I have seen you in anything?

748
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,990
Well,I was a corpse in csi,but I look all dead,

749
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,530
so it's not a very good example.

750
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,780
I was in a commercial.

751
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,650
O-m-g!

752
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,270
This is the funniest story.

753
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,820
So it was for this medicine,and I didn't know what it was.

754
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,090
I thought it was like a vitamin or something,

755
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,680
but then they tell me what it is.

756
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,810
And at first I didn't want to do it

757
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,500
because I didn't want everyone to think that I had herpes.

758
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,610
But then I just did it,

759
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:34,090
because it was a national commercial and I was all,"whatever!

760
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,930
Cha-ching!

761
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,960
" Now,did you have to,uh,

762
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,780
do a lot of research to get into character for that or.

763
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,600
What do you mean?

764
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,650
You know,'cause.

765
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,100
'cause.

766
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,270
do you want to grab a seat?

767
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,420
Yeah!

768
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,180
It's good that we got here early,'cause we can scout a good spot.

769
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,120
And there are hitchcock fanatics.

770
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,030
I hear some guys actually dress up like their mothers.

771
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,710
You would never catch me in a dress.

772
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,510
But you have such amazing legs.

773
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,030
Thank you.

774
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,190
What's up,half birthday girl?

775
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,490
I see dead people.

776
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,200
We didn't get you a gift.

777
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,660
We figured that our presence was gift enough.

778
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,090
Yeah.It'll do.

779
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,320
Naomi's off the hook.

780
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,650
Adrianna's gonna admit the drugs were hers.

781
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,990
That's great.

782
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,980
You know,it was,it was really cool of you

783
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,970
to still care enough about naomi to help her.

784
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,620
I'd be there for anybody who was important to me.

785
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,110
Ethan ward-- never fails to surprise.

786
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,480
Hey,uh,I think I'm gonna get some drinks.

787
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,950
Anybody want anything?

788
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,780
I-I'll go with you,man.Let's do it.

789
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,410
Thank you.

790
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,830
Okay,why does this suddenly feel like a double-date?

791
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,940
Chill,it is not a double date.

792
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,800
Okay?

793
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,000
We're going to have fun; it's going to be awesome.

794
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,590
What's up,guys?

795
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,790
Very cute couple.

796
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,620
Funny.

797
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,010
Happy half birthday.

798
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,920
Why,thank you.

799
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,090
Why does this baby only cry whenever I'm holding him?

800
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,370
Dude,have you looked in the mirror?

801
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,880
Your hair,it looks like a medieval weapon.

802
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,390
This relationship is not working.

803
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,140
All right,here,take,take the baby.

804
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,540
********

805
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,390
Dude,you're the caretaker.

806
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,430
Come on.You're my bitch.

807
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,110
Okay,so just one thing.

808
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,040
You cannot make out with dixon while ethan and i are sitting there or I will kill you.

809
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,170
Okay,okay.

810
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,060
Well,then,I'm gonna make out with him over there,so just shut your eyes.

811
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,380
Look away,okay?

812
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,890
She kissed you?

813
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,580
Yeah,but sweetheart,I want you to know that this was all her.

814
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,320
I-I didn'T.

815
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,190
harry,,my god,she's an even bigger nut job than I thought.

816
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,050
Sweetheart,you understand that this woman has issues.

817
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,870
Well,she's about to have some even bigger issues.

818
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,920
See,I knew you'd be pissed.

819
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,970
I just wish she was out of our lives.

820
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,670
Yeah,so do I,but.

821
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,550
She's in our lives.

822
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,780
Yeah.

823
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,600
I miss kansas.

824
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,240
I miss my friends.

825
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,400
I know.

826
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,330
I know.

827
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,950
Hey,well.

828
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,610
at least you're not six feet under.

829
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,140
She kissed you?

830
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,070
Okay,everybody,we'll start the movie as soon as it gets dark.

831
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:30,670
And so,they make you put all these special talents at the bottom of your résum?

832
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,670
like it matters.

833
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,620
I mean,they take one look at your head shot and decide if they're gonna hire you or not.

834
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,970
Seriously,who cares if I do gymnastics,you know?

835
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,120
You do gymnastics?

836
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:39,970
I used to.

837
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,460
I can still do the splits.

838
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,730
Wow,that.

839
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,400
that is good news for everybody.

840
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,250
Wow,that is good news.

841
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,110
Hi,I'm kim.

842
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:52,940
Hi.

843
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,080
I'm jacqueline.

844
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,120
You ryan's girlfriend?

845
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:58,370
No,uh,she's not my girlfriend.

846
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,660
Who's this?

847
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,780
Uh,this is a student,a very annoying student who was just leaving.

848
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,280
So what do you do,jacqueline?

849
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,440
I'm an actress.

850
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,290
In L.A.?

851
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,170
Really?

852
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:08,930
That's rare.

853
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,200
Omg,he said the exact same thing.

854
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,380
Don't you guys know L.A.

855
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,600
Is the capital of hollywood?

856
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:20,230
Omg,I didn't know that.

857
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,950
Good luck with your career.

858
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:24,150
I loved you in the herpes commercial.

859
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,940
Thank you.

860
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,090
Charming student.

861
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,700
Popcorn?

862
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,060
If she confesses,if the drugs are hers,

863
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,690
it should help,but you know there's no guarantees.

864
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:38,790
What I think we can do is.

865
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,730
I understand,mr.Owens,but.

866
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,310
Adrianna is going to be here if we just give her a few more minutes.

867
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,680
Naomi,please let him finish.

868
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,390
Okay,all that said,if your friend doesn't confess and this ends up on your record,

869
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,100
it is,it's gonna be harder for you to go to college,

870
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,630
to get a job,and you may have to go to jail,

871
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,640
which in your case would be a juvenile detention.

872
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,460
Happy half birthday.

873
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,690
Thank you.

874
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,680
What the--?

875
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,030
Told you it was good.

876
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,350
Maybe one day I'll be in a movie.

877
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,000
that's projected on the side of a mausoleum.

878
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,600
One can only hope.

879
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,450
Dude,I'm telling you,that is so her.

880
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,350
Look at her-- blonde hair,the angelina jolie lips.

881
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,780
Can I get you a coffee or.

882
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,390
Yeah,yummy.

883
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,400
So,because it's a first offense,

884
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,840
and because of the small amount,

885
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,810
I may be able to get you probation.

886
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,710
But it's going to be stuck on her record.

887
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,830
How could you be so stupid,naomi?

888
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,370
I know you're upset,dad,but she's coming.

889
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,910
She said she'd be here.

890
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,530
She promised.

891
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,600
I'm a little disappointed in you,matthews.

892
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,940
I mean,that's your type-- self-absorbed and stupid?

893
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,940
No,listen.

894
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,930
That was incredibly inappropriate.

895
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,120
,that's how I roll.

896
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,870
listen,I don't want to assume anything here,

897
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,980
but I've been through this with students before,

898
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,900
so if you're having any kind of feelings.

899
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,120
I'm your teacher,you're my student,and I'm a lot older than you.

900
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,600
I mean,I'm not a lot.

901
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,250
dude,chill.

902
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,060
I just didn't want you to catch her stupidity.

903
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,080
I hear it's contagious.

904
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,250
And I hope you didn't think I had a crush on you because.

905
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,590
gross.

906
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,620
Gross,exactly.

907
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,060
Yeah.

908
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,930
Get over yourself.

909
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,720
I am going to be right back,okay?

910
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,960
,okay.

911
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,510
Hey,I need to talk to you.

912
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,880
Your department made quite the scene today.

913
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,530
We did what we had to do.

914
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,930
I've already made contact with one of the smaller dealers,

915
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,450
but you know we're after the supplier.

916
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,110
The supplier is not going to come anywhere near school after that bust today.

917
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,390
Wrong.

918
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,600
We did this now because then they'll figure the bust already happened,

919
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,970
and now they're safe.

920
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,260
And harry,we've been over this.

921
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,030
Don't make contact in public with me again.

922
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:47,130
Let the precinct do their job and let me do my job.

923
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,780
I wonder,like,how and when our baby was made,you know?

924
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,120
Your dad never had that conversation with you?

925
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,740
I mean,like,overseas or something.

926
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,510
o,then we'd be like brangelina.

927
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,760
You can totally get that.

928
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,160
It's not like this is a date or anything.

929
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,970
Well,I don't know,we're watching a movie,

930
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,890
we have a baby to take care of.

931
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,620
Whoever it was can wait.

932
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,740
Okay.

933
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,050
This is ethan.

934
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,300
Leave a message.

935
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,450
It's complicated.

936
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,990
And you're right,you know,about this not being a date.

937
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,440
Yeahi know,that's why I said it wasn't a date.

938
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,360
Yeah,right,I.

939
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,620
even though,I mean,it kind of,kind of feels like a date.

940
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,300
Yeah,I know,right?

941
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,300
It's not.

942
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,660
No,no,it's not.

943
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,110
'Cause if it was a date.

944
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,040
I'd do this.

945
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,530
my god.

946
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,540
Did you guys see that?

947
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,520
Scared the crap out of me.

948
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,550
Yeah.

949
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,450
You should have seen your brother.

950
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,780
What a wuss.

951
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,480
Hey,but I wasn't the only one who jumped.

952
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,360
*****

953
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,530
I jumped,man,I jumped.

954
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,870
Yes.

955
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:28,940
no pulse.

956
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:29,890
Get th epi.

957
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,290
I don't know what happened.

958
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,170
I cannot believe you did this to me.

959
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,410
You were the one person that I thought I could count on,

960
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,310
that I could trust.

961
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,660
It was you,adrianna,you were it,

962
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,570
and you can't even do so little as pick up your freaking phone!

963
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,890
Amazing,way to go.

964
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,340
This friendship is over.

965
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,120
We're done.

966
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:46,980
I hope you got that.

967
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
