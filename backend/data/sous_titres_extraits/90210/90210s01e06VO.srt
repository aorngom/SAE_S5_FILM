1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Previously on 90210:

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,540
Adrianna,what's wrong with you?

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,220
You can't go out there like this.

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,160
Of course I can.

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,090
Annie,you're up.

6
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,060
Change out of that costume.

7
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:09,890
Put on adrianna'S.

8
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,400
Mom,it's not just a casual fling with her and dad.

9
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,390
He's moving her into the beach house.

10
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,190
What?

11
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,570
Give me a break!

12
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,340
You are never gonna be happy with somebody else

13
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,200
because you're still in love with dylan,and you know it!

14
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,960
So,you think more about the party after?

15
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,250
Your hotel room?

16
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,490
Ty's in the shower.

17
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,220
In the shower?

18
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,380
Rinsing off.

19
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,790
He didn't tell you to meet him here,too,did he?

20
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,820
Here's the thing,adrianna.

21
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,850
If you have a problem and you let us know now,

22
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,430
then there are options.

23
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,860
I don't know what miss walsh told you,

24
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,370
but all I did was take some cough medicine to preserve my voice.

25
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,520
Which is something she's been doing

26
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,480
since she won the miss sunburst beauty pageant at age six.

27
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,850
I don't know what you were on,

28
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,830
but you were on more than just cough syrup,and you know it.

29
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,800
Do you have proof of that?

30
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,320
Okay,this is not just about adrianna's behavior the night of the play.

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,190
Her attendance this year has been terrible;

32
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,430
she shows up late and exhausted; her eyes are red.

33
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,900
okay,you know what?

34
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,990
I go to,like,five auditions a week,

35
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,130
so,yeah,I'm a little tired,but that doesn't mean I'm on drugs.

36
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,640
Well,maybe it's time to think about pulling back on the acting a little bit.

37
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,160
Well,maybe it's time you think about lightening her workload.

38
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,390
That's not gonna happen.

39
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,070
Adrianna,you are a fantastic actress.

40
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,350
And if you choose to,you're gonna have great success,

41
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,680
but there's plenty of time for that.

42
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,810
Maybe you should take a little bit of pressure off of yourself right now.

43
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,970
Do you really think I want to end up like you,

44
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,380
acting in some tragic theater company,

45
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,310
directing high school musicals in my spare time?

46
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,600
No,thanks.

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,430
Adrianna,this is the one and only time we're gonna offer you this solution.

48
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,540
If we find out that you're using unprescribed or illegal drugs,

49
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,060
we'll have no choice but to expel you.

50
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,050
You people are unbelievable.

51
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,210
Isn't it enough you embarrassed her in front of the entire school,

52
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,410
not to mention half a dozen industry executives?

53
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,500
Adrianna does not use drugs.

54
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,920
If you try to imply otherwise,I'll sue.

55
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,250
Come on,baby.

56
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,750
Good job.

57
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,220
You were amazing,annie.

58
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,760
You were so good.

59
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,150
Oh,my god,it's like od,it's likeyou were performing just for me.

60
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,490
Nice job,ty.

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,380
Good job,annie.

62
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,610
Annie,we need to talk.

63
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,980
No,we don'T.

64
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,810
In fact,I think it'd be best if you just never spoke to me again ever.

65
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,100
I don't get you.

66
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,090
You don't get me?

67
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,980
It's a joke.

68
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,830
Annie,please,just.

69
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,880
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,540
Yeah,right.

71
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,230
You're the girl who took adrianna's part.

72
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,030
Principal wilson's daughter.

73
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,430
It's all starting to make sense now,isn't it?

74
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,870
Yep.

75
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,350
God,what is her problem?

76
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,290
She is having a rough time.

77
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,600
Yeah,but so is everybody else.

78
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,950
It's called "high school."

79
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm just saying it might be easier

80
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,100
if you can find a way to be the bigger person where she is concerned.

81
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,700
My mom said she read in some cougar blog that apparently,

82
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,420
young guys like the "trick" the altoids.

83
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,660
I live in a nightmare.

84
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,540
I mean,my parents are acting like 20 years' worth of marriage meant nothing.

85
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,310
Sorry.

86
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,080
Don'T.

87
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:50,840
Don't what?

88
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,670
Don't say you're sorry like there's no hopelike there's no hope.

89
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,990
Your dad's the one who said there's no hope.

90
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,370
Only because gail has him under some kind of spell.

91
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,230
I mean,the minute he got in the same room with my mom they ended up in bed together.

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,400
What does that tell you?

93
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,630
That they're still horny.

94
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,110
No,that they still have feelings for each other.

95
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,780
All I have to do is get them back in the same place at the same time.

96
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,850
How are you gonna do that?

97
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,960
Um,I kinda have to cancel our dinner plans.

98
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:16,980
Is that okay?

99
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,900
Why?

100
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,870
'Cause I have dinner plans with daddy and his mistress.

101
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,630
Hello,kitten.

102
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,550
Daddy?

103
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,110
And what about bill fontaine?

104
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,260
I mean,is he still in milan?

105
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,860
Figures.

106
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,580
Well,see if you can get him anyway.

107
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,980
And send me a list of everybody who's stateside and available.

108
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,810
Thank you.

109
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,580
Antonio.

110
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,780
is everything okay?

111
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,610
No.

112
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,130
The pacific coast fashion show's one of my biggest jobs of the year,

113
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,190
and my #2 photographer just.

114
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,400
pulled out.

115
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,430
Oh,and you can't shoot an entire runway show by yourself?

116
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,010
And everyone I ever worked with is either booked or out of the country.

117
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,020
Antonio.

118
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,590
maybe I could work the show with you.

119
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,310
I mean,you said yourself I did a great job with the los angeles magazine spread.

120
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,060
Debbie,thanks,but this type of shoot,

121
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,130
it's,it's rough work,even for veterans.

122
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,590
Tough angles,difficult light.

123
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,430
I wouldn't offer if I didn't think I was 100% ready.

124
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,330
I know how important this job is to you.

125
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,270
The models come later today for camera tests.

126
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,370
Let's just see how that goes and we'll take it from there.

127
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,560
You won't be sorry.

128
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,470
I promise.

129
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,020
Yes!

130
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,740
I can't believe this.

131
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,150
What?

132
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,110
Dude,you've been in beverly hills,

133
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,740
like,ten minutes and you're already have a girlfriend.

134
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,320
You know what that makes me?

135
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,460
A loser?

136
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,500
No,a third wheel.

137
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,660
See,this is why you don't go befriending the new kid

138
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,300
because they're always gonna be your friend until this.

139
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,580
Needy much?

140
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,280
I mean,is this like a bona fide mid-teen breakdown right now?

141
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,520
All I'm saying is that I refuse to be the third wheel.

142
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,400
Are we clear?

143
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,610
Yeah,yeah.

144
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,970
Yes,listen,I'm gonna let you guys just hug this out

145
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,010
while I go try to blog navid a whole new wheel.

146
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,220
Please,don't do that.

147
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,700
Hey,the only thing worse than a third wheel is a fully exposed squeaky one,okay?

148
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,080
Uh,yeah,it's just kinda what I do.

149
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,760
Later.

150
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,500
Dude,what the hell?

151
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,060
Touch me again.

152
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,110
So what do you think is up next for adrianna?

153
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,760
Honestly,rehab at promises.

154
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,030
Maybe a mug shot on perez hilton.

155
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,140
I don't know.

156
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,800
Really.How do you relate to a child actor who probably peaked at age 14?

157
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,260
It's a shame it had to go this way,brenda,

158
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,000
'cause it really seemed like you were getting through to her during the play.

159
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,350
Maybe if I had just let her go on,none of this would be happening.

160
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,360
No,you did the right thing.

161
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,410
I saw her that night,too,and something is definitely up.

162
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,310
Or maybe she's telling the truth.

163
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,760
I mean,maybe it really is just a classic case of militant stage mom meets one-too-many hits of robitussin.

164
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,030
On a lighter note,what's next for brenda walsh?

165
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,510
Well,tonight is our final performance at the taper,

166
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,910
so I'm thinking,afterwards,a glass of chardonnay and a hot bath sounds about right.

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,880
what about you two?

168
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh,well,I was hoping I'd take this one to dinner.

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,770
Hello?

170
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,400
What do you say,kels?Tonight the night?

171
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,360
What's the matter?

172
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,310
It's dylan.

173
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,600
Where is he?

174
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,140
He says wyoming.

175
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,100
Yeah,well,um,actually,I'm here with kel now.

176
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,780
Okay.

177
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,420
He wants to talk to you.

178
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,700
Hello?

179
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,000
Uh,who's dylan?

180
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,720
Sammy's dad.

181
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,850
Yeah.

185
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,620
Don't forget your "future enterpriser" assignments are due next week.

186
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,840
Five pages detailing your research on any career in any industry that interests you.

187
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,140
No,adrianna,you can't do the paper on yourself.

188
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,060
Annie,what's your plan for the assignment?

189
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,050
Um,my mom's taking pictures at the pacific coast fashion show.

190
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,560
Dixon and I are gonna be her assistants,so I thought I could write about that.

191
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,510
You,uh,think your mom could use a third helper?

192
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,080
thanks,I don't need your charity.

193
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,500
No,what you need is a b or higher on this assignment to keep from failing my class.

194
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,150
Fine.

195
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,870
Yeah,we are leaving right after school for my mom's studio,

196
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,930
and if you're late,we're leaving without you.

197
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,800
Good,then it's settled.

198
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,240
Have you lost your mind?

199
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,970
I want nothing to do with you.

200
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,780
If anybody gets to have a problem here,it's me with you.

201
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,130
Oh,are you serious?

202
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,940
You stole my part in the play.

203
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,760
Adrianna,I was your understudy.

204
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,170
I had to go on.

205
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,020
You,on the other hand,did not need to sleep with ty.

206
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,880
Then why are you helping me?

207
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:31,870
Because unlike you,I'm actually a nice person.

208
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,380
Kind of ran off there.You okay?

209
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,760
Kelly?

210
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,750
Oh,yeah,sorry.

211
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,250
Brenda filled me in on the whole dylan saga.

212
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,650
Thought he was supposed to be off saving the world.

213
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,490
Uh,well,he said he was tired of traveling.

214
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,140
He wants to come back home.

215
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,630
But not to you and sammy.

216
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,870
Not to beverly hills,at least.

217
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,560
He wants me and sammy with him.

218
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,420
Guess a romantic dinner with me is kind of out.

219
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,580
Ryan.

220
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,170
look,you are a really great guy.

221
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,030
I mean it.

222
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,870
Any girl would be lucky to have a chance with someone like you,

223
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,560
but with things the way they are with dylan,

224
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,820
I just don't know if or when I'm gonna be able to go there with somebody else.

225
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,810
And you deserve more than that.

226
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,740
Are you asking me to wait?

227
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,930
'Cause I got nothing but time and the distinct feeling

228
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,250
that women like you don't come around very often.

229
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,660
I don't want you to wait.

230
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,710
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,410
Me,too.

232
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,240
Hey,uh,kelly,do you have your phone with you today?

233
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,860
Yeah.Why?

234
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:03,330
I was just wondering,if dylan wanted to talk to you,why was he calling brenda?

235
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,200
It's not that I don't want to go with you,it's just.

236
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,340
I reject the unrealistic expectations the modeling industry pushes on average women.

237
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,850
And I totally agree.

238
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,510
I totally don't believe you.

239
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,780
Look,it's not like I'm not interested in seeing runway models in their underwear,

240
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,390
because that would be a lie.

241
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,900
I would like that,a lot,actually.

242
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,350
Okay,if you're still trying to convince me to go,you are failing miserably.

243
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,540
Check it,I figured out a solution to our third-wheel problem.

244
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,650
dude,that's your problem,not our problem.

245
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,890
But you guys are still going to the fashion show,aren't you?

246
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,420
How about you let me tag along?

247
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,590
Uh,isn't tagging along the essence of the third-wheel problem?

248
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,530
Not if I'm not alone; if I bring somebody,

249
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,460
then we'll have all four wheels on the same track,fully loaded.

250
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,950
Oh,all right,all right.

251
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,520
So who are you bringing?

252
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,730
Uh,well,that's where you come into play.

253
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,500
You know,after the epic flame-out with ty,I figured I'd take a shot at annie.

254
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,330
What do you think?

255
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,250
- what do I think?
- Yeah.

256
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,650
I think that's going in the "never gonna happen" pile.

257
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,540
- No.
- Why?

258
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,410
She's hot.I'm hot.We're bros.

259
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,750
It makes perfect sense.

260
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,820
Don't make me drop you in the lunch line,bro.

261
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,070
Thanks,man.

262
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,020
Looking for this?

263
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,580
I borrowed it for my lunch date this afternoon.

264
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,570
Lunch date?

265
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,390
With who?

266
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,340
Mr.Wellington.

267
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,990
Dad's investment guy?

268
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,220
Hello?He's gay.

269
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,040
Yeah,well,I know that now.

270
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,020
He spent the entire lunch talking about his partner,william,

271
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,410
and I thought he meant business partner,

272
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,520
until he whips out his pictures from his cruise to barcelona.

273
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,530
Nice,mom.

274
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,480
Yeah.It's just as well.

275
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,440
I really don't know what I was thinking.

276
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,330
Do you want to get some takeout from mr.Chow's?

277
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,430
Oh,no,daddy's taking me to dinner at the marina club.

278
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,490
Well,that sounds nice.

279
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,290
Is she going?

280
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,940
Hey,ethan and I are going to the pacific coast fashion show tomorrow night.

281
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,130
We have an extra ticket,if you want to come.

282
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,010
Me?

283
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,640
Surrounded by hundreds of hot,tan,young runway models?

284
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,730
Naomi,how bad do you want me to feel about myself?

285
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,990
I didn't mean that.

286
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,690
I meant,you're beautiful and smart and.

287
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,280
available.

288
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,650
Thank you.

289
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,360
Count me in.

290
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,980
Okay,here wokay,here we go.

291
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,480
All right.

292
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,230
Great.

293
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,090
Great,erica.

294
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,050
You know what?Just turn your hips towards me.

295
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,780
Oh,that's perfect.

296
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,950
Oh,great!

297
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,970
That is so good!

298
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Okay,you know what?

299
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,160
Can you give me the other camera?

300
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,490
Thank you.

301
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,050
Annie?Adrianna?

302
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,020
Can you switch those fans on for me?

303
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,950
There we go.

304
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,970
Debbie's my new protég?

305
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,260
Very talented woman.

306
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,970
That's hard to come by these days.

307
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,820
Everyone's so easily preoccupied with.

308
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,720
excuse me.

309
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,440
Um,who are you?

310
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,350
Uh,me?

311
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,660
No,clearly,I mean,what modeling agency are you with?

312
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,750
Uh,yeah,I'm-I'm not a model.

313
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,860
You're kidding.

314
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,190
I mean,the structure and the symmetry.

315
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,500
My name's tom moreno.

316
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,760
Silver.

317
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,400
Nice to meet you,silver.

318
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,470
You know,that could be you up there.

319
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,270
Yeah,I'm not interested.

320
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,610
Really?

321
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,410
I mean,most girls would give up their cell phones for a professional modeling contract.

322
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,710
Well,I guess I'm not like most girls.

323
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,410
So it seems.

324
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,020
excuse me.

325
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,120
Thank you for inviting me to dinner,naomi.

326
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,090
It means a lot.

327
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,600
To my beautiful and very mature daughter for bringing us together.

328
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,190
Thank you,sweetheart.

329
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,410
Of course.

330
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,750
We all know you're not exactly the world's greatest communicator,daddy.

331
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,710
I was worried I might not get to know your girlfriend if I didn't take the lead.

332
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,910
Obviously,my dad's legendary secrecy isn't news to you.

333
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,980
Actually,charles and i have always talked openly about everything.

334
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,770
Oh,well,then you know what a workaholic he is.

335
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,540
I mean,expect him to be gone most nights and weekends,and lots of business trips.

336
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,200
It's been like that since way before you guys met.

337
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,730
Or is that how you guys met?

338
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,130
Actually,gail and i met in line at a gelato stand in century city.

339
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,070
That's so cute!

340
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,530
I didn't even know you liked gelato,daddy.

341
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,580
Must be one of his dirty little secrets.

342
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,000
Sweetheart,I know what you're trying to do,and it's not going to work.

343
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,860
Gail knows everything there is to know about me.

344
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,470
Oh,well,that is truly amazing.

345
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,070
How are you handling the current situation with him and my mom?

346
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,650
You must be a saint to allow them to keep their own "lines of communication" flowing.

347
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,010
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

348
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,150
Oh,I'M.

349
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,650
I'm sorry,I just.

350
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,580
figured since you and my dad were so open and honest

351
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,920
that he would have told you that he and my mom are still sleeping together.

352
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,810
Naomi.

353
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,760
Charles?

354
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,930
Tracy and i have a very complicated relationship.

355
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,910
I have always been open with who she is to me,

356
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,980
just as I've always been open with who you are to me.

357
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,120
And who would that be,the woman you're shacking up with at the beach?

358
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,590
Excuse me.

359
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,670
Bye.

360
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,280
Thank you very much,young lady.

361
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,160
No problem.

362
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,950
Your proofs yesterday look fantastic.

363
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,880
Really?

364
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,840
I-I was afraid there was too much bounce in that last setup.

365
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,960
The light's perfect.

366
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,550
So,this is where the magic happens,huh?

367
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,580
Hi,honey.

368
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,160
Um,antonio,this is my husband,harry.

369
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,040
Pleasure.

370
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,690
Good to meet you.

371
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,760
This is tom moreno.

372
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,660
Tom's producing the fashion show.

373
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,500
Mom,we're gonna start packing up the van.

374
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,140
Okay,honey.

375
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,480
I will grab the keys.I'll be right back.

376
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,970
Hey,adrianna.

377
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,240
Principal wilson.

378
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,100
I'm gonna go wait in the van.

379
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,320
Looks like you and adrianna are getting along well.

380
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,810
Mr.Matthews told me you offered to help.

381
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,880
Yeah,well,that's not exactly how it happened,

382
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,930
but you said she's been having a tough time lately,

383
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,210
so I'm trying to cut her some slack.

384
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,120
I'm proud of you.

385
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,470
You know,sweetheart,there's a little more to the story.

386
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,190
And as principal,I shouldn't be telling you this,

387
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,890
but as your father,I feel like I have to.

388
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,970
Uh,adrianna might have a substance problem.

389
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,550
Yeah,I kind of figured.

390
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,950
I was there the night of the play.

391
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,500
Remember?

392
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,010
Yeah.

393
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,060
what's the matter?

394
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,460
Do you still love me?

395
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,070
where's this coming from?

396
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,930
It's not a trick question.

397
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,700
It's just we haven't said it in a long time.

398
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,230
You know?And it's important.

399
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,650
Naomi?

400
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,680
Hi,ethan.

401
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,770
Oh,my god.

402
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,140
Look at yourself!

403
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,020
The guys are going to fall all over themselves when they see you tonight.

404
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,770
Trust me.

405
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,530
Thank you.

406
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,670
at least my daddy will.

407
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,950
You invited your dad?

408
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,460
Not exactly,but I'll figure out a way to get him there.

409
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,360
And neither one of them knows the other's gonna be there?

410
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,110
Oh,no.

411
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,800
This isn't the parent trap,naomi.

412
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,890
You can't fix them this way.

413
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,200
Could you go home and get ready?

414
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,350
We're losing valuable time.

415
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,460
Good-bye.

416
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,270
Good-bye!

417
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,370
Sure,sure,sure,sure,whatever.

418
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,280
Oh,I'm sorry,hon.

419
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,460
Can you back up a bit?

420
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,450
Thanks.

421
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,860
Oh,I'm sorry.

422
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,300
Don't worry about it.

423
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,570
Where do I know you from?

424
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,770
Are you an actress?

425
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,150
Do high school musicals count?

426
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,400
Spring awakening,west beverly hills high?

427
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,360
You saw it?

428
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,050
Yeah,I got dragged to it by this agent I'm dating,

429
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,310
but I was pleasantly surprised.

430
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,580
I'm reeve conlon.

431
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,830
Annie wilson.

432
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,630
Well,it must be fate that I ran into you tonight.

433
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:14,630
I'm producing a slasher film about beverly hills cheerleaders at cheer camp,

434
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,750
and it's a shoestring budget,but the script's a real roller-coaster and.

435
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,510
do you want to come in and read for me?

436
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,130
Yes,that would be amazing.

437
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,950
Thanks.

438
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,300
I'm sorry.

439
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,480
This is adrianna.

440
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,910
Hey,yeah.

441
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,980
Um,we actually met at sundance,like,a few years ago.

442
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,230
Right.You played the little girl in josh marsten's short.

443
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,660
Right.

444
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,880
What happened?You kinda fell off the map after that.

445
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,880
no,I've,um.

446
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,630
I've been here.

447
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,880
I just,uh.

448
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,350
I haven't been working a ton lately.

449
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,510
I,I was adrianna's understudy,the night that you saw the play.

450
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,910
Yeah.If she hadn't gotten sick right before curtain,

451
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,230
she would have gone on instead.

452
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,840
She was really,really great.

453
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,480
Tell you what.

454
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,340
Why don't you both come in and audition for me.

455
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,750
Call me tomorrow.We'll set something up.

456
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,340
Thank you.

457
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,510
That's a great-looking house you're building,sammy.

458
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,460
It's a skyscraper.

459
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,130
It is,is it?

460
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,240
I think you may have a little budding architect on your hands here.

461
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,080
All right,sammy,it's time to get your jammies on.

462
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,750
Come here.

463
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,250
good night,buddy.

464
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,300
I'll be in in just a minute to tuck you in.

465
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,470
I better get going,too.

466
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,330
Ryan wanted to keep an eye on adrianna,so.

467
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,990
I had my agent get us some tickets to that fashion show.

468
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,770
Oh,you and ryan.

469
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,290
I guess old habits die hard with you,don't they?

470
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,780
What is that supposed to mean?

471
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,650
When's the last time you saw dylan?

472
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,790
I don't even remember.

473
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,710
I remember the last time I saw him was.

474
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,140
christmas eve,sammy's first christmas,right here in this living room.

475
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,270
I can even tell you what he was wearing.

476
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,130
Well,you two had a lot more going on that we ever did,so that makes sense.

477
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,470
Then why do you think he called you today,and not me?

478
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,370
You would have to ask him that.

479
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,800
I will.

480
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,800
Look.

481
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,660
brenda,if there is something going on with you and dylan,

482
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,720
now is the time to tell me.

483
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,900
He got my e-mail address from brandon,

484
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,550
and he sent me a message from africa a few months ago.

485
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,220
He wanted to know if you were in a relationship.

486
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,760
I talked to him about that same time.

487
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,150
Why didn't he just ask me?

488
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,260
I don't know,but I told him that he was already messing up,

489
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,810
and that if he was serious about reconnecting with you,

490
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,310
he needed to come back to the states and do it the right way.

491
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,890
I mean,he's hurt you so many times,I was just trying to protect you.

492
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,700
Or maybe you were trying to keep the door open for yourself.

493
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,640
I thought that we had moved past all this already.

494
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,150
Brenda,wait.

495
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,540
I'm sorry.

496
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,400
It's just.

497
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,990
hearing his voice today in that place.

498
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,180
with you there.

499
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,910
just stirred up a lot of old feelings,I guess.

500
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,480
Hey,dylan and i are ancient history,and it's gonna stay that way.

501
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,570
Kelly,you deserve to be happy,and so does sammy.

502
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,230
And if that means ever after on a ranch with dylan,then I am all for it.

503
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,860
You deserve to be happy,too.

504
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,370
i am happy.

505
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,860
I'll talk to you soon.

506
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,890
All right.

507
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,740
****************

508
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,880
All right,do you know how many third world families could live on that?

509
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,570
Maybe you should go for it and feed the world.

510
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,920
I mean,you know,too bad male underwear models don't have it

511
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,560
as gmale underwear modelsdon't have it as good

512
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,260
or I'd definitely try it myself.

513
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,930
Well,if you ever want to model for me,we can just go.

514
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,000
okay,discomfort level rising.

515
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,300
Uh,navid,why don't you go talk to one of these girls?

516
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,720
Navid?

517
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,620
You're persian?

518
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,340
Y-yes.

519
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,790
and cute.

520
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,630
Come on.I'll introduce you to some of my friends.

521
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,010
Okay.

522
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,080
this is not like any high school weeknight I remember.

523
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,280
Well,you didn't go to west beverly.

524
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,800
Trade in rhianna and louboutins for madonna and black leggings,

525
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,250
and it's exactly the same as when I was a teenager.

526
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,310
Nice to have a veteran by my side.

527
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,280
I'm guessing I wouldn't be your first choice.

528
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,250
Yeah.

529
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,820
Well,it's pretty clear kelly's not really in a head space to date,

530
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,420
whatever that means.

531
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,330
You know,I-I probably shouldn't say anything,but.

532
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,710
I love kelly.

533
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,980
As great as she is,you just dodged an epic bullet.

534
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,360
You're pretty sassy,you know that?

535
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,200
Yeah.

536
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,660
I've been told.

537
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,190
are you gonna be staring at your sidekick all night?

538
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,500
You gonna stare at all the fake boobs all night?

539
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,640
I 911'd my dad six times.

540
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,270
He said he'd text me the second he gets here.

541
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,610
**********

542
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,020
Wait till my dad sees how good she looks.

543
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,170
It's going to be perfect.

544
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,670
Oh,my god.He's here.Okay.

545
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,900
Make sure mom doesn't go anywhere.

546
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,520
I'll be right back.

547
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,150
I have to say,your mom-- pretty awesome.

548
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,510
She is,isn't she?

549
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,320
Guess I never really looked at her that way because to me she's just mom.

550
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,940
Sometimes I feel like my mom doesn't even see me as her daughter,

551
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,680
more like her favorite client.

552
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,140
How do you handle that?

553
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,560
By not letting her down.

554
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,900
Hey,that was really cool,what you did for me with that producer.

555
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,180
Thank you.

556
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,010
No,I was just telling her the truth.

557
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,580
Listen,annie,I need to tell you something.

558
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,070
Okay?

559
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,700
ty didn't invite me to his hotel room after the play.

560
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,720
I don't understand.

561
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,570
He wasn't in the shower when you showed up.

562
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,790
He was out looking for you.

563
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,510
I.tricked you and I'm sorry.

564
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,420
You do realize that I told ty to never speak to me again.

565
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,350
Hey,look.

566
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,310
I said I was sorry.

567
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,750
You're unbelievable!

568
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,980
Are you okay?

569
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,870
Fine.

570
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,630
Annie,where's adrianna?

571
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:20,050
Oh,you know,she's just off cooking up her next little psychotic plan to ruin my life.

572
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,770
Is she.?

573
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,520
On drugs?

574
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,230
Who knows?Maybe.Probably.

575
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,910
You little bitch!

576
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,050
What are you,some kinda narc for daddy?

577
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,480
All right.You know,what?Let's take a breath.Okay?Let's calm down.

578
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,980
there.

579
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,490
I am calm and I'm not doing drugs.

580
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,360
It looks like principal wilson's little sting operation failed.

581
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,130
His perfect little daughter's cover is blown.

582
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,830
- Dad. 
- Yeah.

583
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,080
Did you tell me to be nice to adrianna because you wanted proof she was using drugs?

584
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,390
No!Of,of course not.

585
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,680
I would never put you in that position.

586
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,430
Yeah.Well,she thinks i was spying for you.

587
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,550
She's probably texting every number in her sidekick as we speak.

588
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,540
- I'm sorry,sweetheart.
- Yeah.Thanks.

589
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,240
I had to meet you here?

590
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,950
Ethan.

591
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,790
Where'd she go?

592
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,910
Where did who go?

593
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,540
You've gotta be kidding me.

594
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,540
Young lady,what are you up to?

595
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,690
Charles.

596
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,060
What are you doing here?

597
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,280
I received an urgent text message from your daughter saying that there was an emergency here.

598
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,870
Now I see she was lying.

599
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,860
I wasn't lying.

600
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,530
Would you explain this to those of us who have no idea what you're talking about.

601
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,380
Uh,we were set up.

602
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,010
Set up?

603
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,920
Clearly,naomi expected me to come in here,

604
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,660
find you in the arms of your ridiculous companions and whisk you off in a jealous rage.

605
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,310
Is this true,naomi?

606
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,080
Did you really just invite me here as some sort of game?

607
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,570
No,this wasn't some sort of game.

608
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,970
I just wanted you guys to give your marriage a chance.

609
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,140
I figured if you were together.

610
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,170
we are not together,naomi.

611
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,370
Your mother and I will never be together.

612
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,010
Charles.

613
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,330
you don't have to be cruel.

614
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,910
No,I have tried the civil route,and it didn't work.

615
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:05,560
You'll accept that this marriage is over,and we can all move on with our lives.

616
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,400
I hope you and gail are happy together.

617
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,150
Looks like this party's really kicking into high gear.

618
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,040
Yeah,I never should have gotten involved.

619
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,100
Hey,you know,you were just trying to help.

620
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,400
I think I may get out of town for a little bit,you know?

621
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,610
Take a break from acting,recalibrate.

622
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,770
Any idea what you might do?

623
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,390
Might go visit my brother brandon and his family.

624
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,850
I didn't know you had a brother.

625
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,610
There's a lot that you don't know about me,

626
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,060
and it's probably better that it stays that way.

627
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,440
I'm heading in your direction if you want a ride.

628
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,390
How do you know where I'm heading?

629
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,400
I don'T.

630
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,680
Let's go.

631
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,720
Now,I thought the modeling world was not for you.

632
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,660
Morbid fascination.

633
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,820
I was dragged here kicking and screaming.

634
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,940
You know how you can tell when one of these girls are really special?

635
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,080
You catch them in their everyday life.

636
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:21,260
I discovered rebecca romijn in a supermarket in santa cruz.

637
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,570
Seriously?

638
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:27,310
I was also the first to see the potential in heidi as well.

639
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,510
You know,you've got the exact same thing they have.

640
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,180
Oh,really.

641
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,450
What's that?

642
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,120
Me backing you.

643
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,380
All you need now is an agent and a stylist and a portfolio.

644
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,000
But I can help you with that.

645
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,040
But if you're not interested.

646
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,600
how about I get my driver to take us back to my house in the hills,

647
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,260
and we can plot the world domination of silver in my jacuzzi?

648
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,230
You're kidding,right?

649
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,740
Do you know how old I am?

650
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,950
Oh,age,to me,is more of a state of mind.

651
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:05,260
Yeah,well,in the state of california,it's 15 to 20 hard time.

652
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,570
Look,you're obviously a very smart girl,

653
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,410
and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,

654
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,240
so why don't you think about all the good the money could do?

655
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,100
Don'T.

656
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,880
Get your hands off her!

657
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,050
Dixon,what are you doing?

658
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,540
Who the hell is this thug?

659
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,460
Security!

660
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,570
This young man is my son.

661
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,170
Oh,really?And who the baby daddy?

662
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,530
Excuse me.

663
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,680
Dixon!

664
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,290
Get.

665
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,690
Back off!

666
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,660
What the hell is the matter with you?

667
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,810
Debbie?

668
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,660
What's going on here?

669
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,000
What's going on is this protég?

670
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,930
of yours and her little compton kid compton.

671
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,990
just lost you your biggest account.

672
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,850
You're fired.

673
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,080
You okay?

674
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,120
No.

675
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,370
I'm an idiot.

676
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,550
Do you know I.

677
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,280
actually almost started believing that guy.

678
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,370
Hey,hey.

679
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,350
That guy is a pig.

680
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,640
But he was right about one thing.

681
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:31,760
You were definitely the most beautiful girl in the room tonight.

682
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,710
Thank you.

683
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,570
Let me take you home,all right?

684
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,360
that was at palisades high.

685
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,890
It's is like,"we found pigs 1,2,and 4,"but where the hell is 3?

686
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,820
"We've looked everywhere,and we can't find the fourth pig.

687
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,000
" But the joke was there was only three pigs.

688
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,270
We just numbered them 1,2,and 4.

689
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,470
yeah,I don't get it.

690
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,870
There was no fourth pig.

691
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,400
But then what happened to pr three?

692
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,390
What are you doing here?

693
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,030
I got a text from adrianna about an hour ago.

694
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,090
She told me about what happened at the roosevelt.

695
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:30,980
Yeah.

696
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,930
Looks like we were set up.

697
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,660
Yeah,lots of that going on around here.

698
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,900
Look,I'm sorry.

699
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:38,770
About what?

700
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:42,100
Even with adrianna standing there in that towel,

701
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,360
I knew you weren't that kind of guy,I should have trusted my instincts.

702
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,900
Yeah.

703
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,260
You should have.

704
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:54,530
You know,I went to the hotel that night thinking it was going to be the night for us.

705
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:57,370
There's other nights,other hotels.

706
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,300
Yeah,not.

707
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,900
not for me.

708
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,870
Not yet.

709
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,310
I'm just not ready.

710
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,010
God,this town really messes with your head,doesn't it?

711
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,100
Well.

712
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,050
you've always got a friend with me.

713
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,980
If you need one.

714
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,450
I think that might exactly what I need right now.

715
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,270
Friends it is.

716
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,070
antonio,I'm so sorry.

717
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,500
If you want to fire me,I totally understand.

718
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:41,480
Ah,please.

719
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,260
You were defending your son.

720
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,110
And life's too short to work with people like that.

721
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,640
And you're too talented not to keep around.

722
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,990
Thank you.

723
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,690
Thank you.

724
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,580
He did not fire you?

725
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,610
No.

726
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,720
hey,is dixon okay?

727
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,340
Yeah,I gave him grandma's mercedes.

728
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,510
He is taking silver home.

729
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,780
Where's annie and adrianna?

730
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,860
That is a whole other story.

731
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,030
Can we get out of here already?

732
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,270
I will fill you in on the way home.

733
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,100
Every time I try to fix it.

734
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,070
Every time.

735
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,500
I should have just listened to you.

736
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,970
Don't be too hard on yourself.

737
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,090
I just wanted everything to be the same before.

738
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,410
before all this drama.

739
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,540
Now my parents will never get back together.

740
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,080
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

741
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,490
How can you say that?

742
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,290
some people just.

743
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,540
aren't meant to be together.

744
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,420
That's all.

745
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,390
They were together,ethan.

746
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,390
That's the point.

747
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,520
That doesn't mean anything.

748
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,410
Sex always means something.

749
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,880
It says there's still some feelings,connection,emotion.

750
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:58,110
It's that way with us,right?

751
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,480
Right?

752
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,540
Not always.

753
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:10,100
So is that why you couldn't say you loved me earlier?

754
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,170
It's complicated.

755
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,570
It shouldn't be complicated,E.

756
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,970
I'm just so tired.

757
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,820
I'm tired of pretending that my parents are gonna be together forever.

758
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:31,580
I'm tired of pretending that we're ultimately gonna stay together.

759
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,780
I think it's over,E.

760
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,100
For good,this time.

761
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,180
I think you're right.

762
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,110
Hey,kiddo.

763
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,340
How was the party?

764
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,510
Oh,you know.

765
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,310
Dreams built up and shattered.

766
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,920
Typical night in hollywood.

767
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,710
I'm sorry.

768
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,010
Is he awake?I don't want to wake him up.

769
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,750
Oh,no.He's down for the count.

770
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,280
We had a big day.

771
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,900
What's up with the suitcases?

772
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,660
Well,sam and I are going to visit dylan.

773
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,190
Oh,my god.

774
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,090
Are you gonna get back together with him?

775
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,610
No.

776
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,370
And there is every possibility that after this,

777
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,040
dylan may be out of our lives for good,

778
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,620
but I have to find out one way or the other.

779
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,450
I can't keep living in this in-between place,you know?

780
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,850
You actually think he's changed?

781
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,390
There's one way to find out.

782
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:46,760
Well,how long are you gonna be gone?

783
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,720
The school gave me a two-week leave.

784
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,850
And I talked to your dad.

785
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,320
He has a room ready,and he's waiting for you.

786
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,060
You're kidding,right?

787
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,040
I am not gonna go stay with mel and his latest child bride.

788
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,650
I think that girl's actually in my homeroom.

789
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,450
Ugh,I don't know.

790
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,620
Well,you can't stay with mom.

791
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,390
That's for sure.

792
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,600
And you're not going back to that shelter.

793
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,970
Uh,thought.

794
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,420
Why don't I stay here?

795
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,030
I can look after your place,bring in your mail,

796
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,930
pay your everything,you know,water your flowers.

797
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,770
Come on.My stuff's already here anyways,so.

798
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,600
Okay.

799
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,570
Okay?

800
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,990
Okay,yes,I think you can handle it.

801
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,040
Thanks!

802
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,470
And.

803
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,770
that means you have to come back,right?

804
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,900
With or without dylan.

805
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,770
Don't worry about it,okay?

806
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,260
Silver,you and I are family.

807
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,730
You'll never be alone.

808
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,430
Come here.

809
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,180
Thanks.

810
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:48,910
I love you.

811
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,060
I love you.

Got your message.

815

Who are you?

816
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,630
Where's kevin?

817
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,780
Kevin doesn't work for me anymore.

818
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,220
What are you looking for?

819
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,170
I'll take whatever you got.

820
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,150
Welcome to the big leagues,little lady.
