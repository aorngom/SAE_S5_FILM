Dixon, how about a new phrase, like,
uh, "this bites" or "this blows?"

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,430
Because you've been saying, "this

Actually, that's our
crap wagon, tabitha.

60
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,340
Well, then park it around the
corner so the neighbors won't notice.

61
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,750
this is gonna suck.

62
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,630
aren't you a little freaked out
starting over at a new school?

63
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,830
And, like, a week late.

64
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,630
What areouou worried about?

65
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,930
You already got, like,
a boyfriend out here.

That ethan dan dude.

67
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,310
Th y you made out with a couple summers
ago when you was out here with grandma.

68
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,640
Okay, one: We did not
make out; it was a kiss.

69
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,980
And he kissed me.

70
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,690
Yeah, I bet when he kissed
you, you were all, "ethan!"

71
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,990
Shut up! We were not.

72
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,940
Ethan's a really nice guy, but I
haven't talked to him in, like, a year.

73
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,660
And I've got jason now anyway.

74
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,830
But still, it's-it's gonna be
a lot easier out here for you.

throwing themselves at you.

Just don't want toavave to tell my
story over and over and over again.

81
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,530
Then don'T.

82
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,660
All they need to know is
that you're my brother.

Nobody has any clue that
topeka is the capital of kansas.

134
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,730
Hey, thanks for showing up, naomi.

139
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,890
I was at the gynecologist, who told me
to remind you toeeeep your vagina clean.

140
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,310
All right, well, naomi, why don't you put

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,000
This is annie. She's new here.

142
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,140
Figured you might, uh, show her around.

143
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,870
Sort of like a beverly buddy.

144
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,150
will there be anything
else, mr. Matthews?

145
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,430

I cannot believe that that u us.

148
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,390
That-that's quite a look I had going.

149
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,780
Hey, I'm the one who used to inink
that flock of seagulls haircut was cool.

150
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,820
But then, I was ten.

151
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,970
Oh, back up, fashion queen.

152
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,880
I have pictures of you in
polka dot spandex leggings.

153
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,310
See, this is good.

154
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,250
I could never talk to the
old principal likehihis.

155
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,500
He was such a wuss.

156
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,170
He was completely intimidated
by the board, which you won't be,

157
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,510
because you know atat
beverly hills people are like.

158
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,710
Exactly why i moved to kansas.

159
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,800
But now u'u're back.

160
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,710
Oh, yes, I am.

161
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,650
And, miss guidance counselor,

162
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:50,310
I'm hoping that you can enlighten me on how to get my
kids to like me again after I told them we're moving.

163
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,570
Well, you could start by
showing them that picture.

164
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,100
That'll get them laughing.

165
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,830
- you're gonna be a pain in my ass, aret t you?
- Oh, yeah.

166
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,160
she's def cu, , but,
I mean, her clothes.

167
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,940
She's probably poor.
Her dad's a principal.

168
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,370
Naomi.

169
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,880
Hey, uh, you so don't have to worry
about the whole beverly buddy thing.

170
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,080
- I can find my own way around.
- Oh, great.

171
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,120
Yeah, the acacher seemed like
he was punishing you with it.

172
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,510
Yeah! Thank you!

173
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,120
It's just that he does
that to me all the time,

174
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,050
and I have my not-so-swe
1 16 party this friday.

175
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,350
I'm just stressed to the max.

176
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,490
And he's being a big
bitch about the fact that

177
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,290
I haven't turned in my book
report on a tale of two cities.

178
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,020
- Oh, I love that book.
- good one.

179
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,750
I did a paper on it last year.

180
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,170
Doesn't matter. I'm gonna
get it done next week.

181
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,710
I've been telling him that.
He just doesn't listen.

182
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,660
My mom's gonna take
care of it, and... ethan!

183
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,810
Hi, honey. I was looking all
over for you this morning.

184
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,900
completely got busted by
matthews. where were you?

185
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,010
Uh, I, uh, just had some
lacrosse stuff to do.

186
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,150
Well, I'm sorry.

187
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,840
Ethan, this is annie, the
new principal's daughter.

188
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,210
Annie, my boyfriend ethan.

189
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,290
- Yeah, well, actually, yeah,
we-we know each other. - Yeah, we...

190
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,250
we met, like, two summers ago?

191
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,230
Yeah, our, uh, grandmothers are friends.

192
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,700
- Oh, so you've hung out.
- Yeah!

193
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,220
- Well, I mean...

194
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,230
- Adrianna! -
Not-not really.

195
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,450

197
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,300
You're into plays?

198
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,430
Well, adrianna's the lead in spring
awakening, our musical here at the school.

199
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,350
Oh, my god! Really? I'm so jealous.

200
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,900
I love spring awakening.

201
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,120
I really wanted to aitition,
but I moved here too late.

202
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,440
Actually, I had to
leave my play back home.

203
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,430
And what was tt?

204
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,060
* I'merery good at integral
and differential calculus *

205
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,450
* I know the scientific
names of beings animaloulous *

206
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,850
it was this, uh, new,
edgy rent-ish thing.

207
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,080
Anyway... I'dodoing
scenery and stuff now.

208
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,910

the perfect place for you.

209
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,310
Well, it was a pleasure, annie. Ethan?

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,700
Uh, yeah. We'll see you around,

218
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,270
Apparently not as good as yours.

219
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,780
Yeah, listen, I want to explain.

220
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,530
Uh, you don't need to explain a thing.

221
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,800
No, I-I feel like I do.

222
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,080
Ifouou're gonna tell naomi...

223
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,500
uh, I'm not gonna tell her.

224
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,860
I'm not nnnna tell anybody.

225
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,320
Wow, that's really cool.

226
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,080
- Look, I'm not that guy.
- What g?

227
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,590
can't get enough of this guy.

228
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,700
See you around, annie.

229
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,330
I accidentally grabbed your book.

230
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,950
Yeah, I think I grabbed yours, too.

231
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,790
Listen, time's up. You owe
$200. Needs it by tomorrow.

232
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,420
Well, I don't have that.

233
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,480
But I'll get it.

234
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,170
Tomorrow.

235
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,390
I'll get it.

236
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,910
What's this?

237
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,050
- A notebook.
- No, this.

238
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,100
A division day sticker.

239
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,520
That's impossible. They
have like eight fans total.

240
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,410
Where'd you get the sticker, new kid?

241
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,180
Brandoflflowers put one of their
songs on his celebrity playlist.

242
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,620
And can you get your foot off my noteboo

243
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,830
oh, tough girl. Nice.

244
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,260
That's exactly how I found them.

245
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,140
- Thank you.
- What?

246
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,850
- Have some fries.
- Will do.

247
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,270
- I'm silver.
- Silver?

248
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,950
Well, you can call me erin,
but I'm not gonna respond.

249
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,160
So, look, I wasn't planning on
making you feel welcome here,

250
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,980
but then I saw the
sticker, and I thought,

251
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,600
hey, maybe the principal's daughter
isn't such a big loser after all.

252
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,350
thanks.

253
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,340
- You'll learn to dig
me-- trust me. - Yeah.

254
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,620
I need you now, pronto. Come on.

255
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,630
Hey, naomi.

256
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,350
Hey, o I if you need some help later
turning those wheel of fortu letters,

257
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,380
I can totally carve out some time.

258
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,520
Hey, sis.

259
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,490
What's going on?

260
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,320
I'm viving you.

261
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,240
She's out of her mind, and
you should not trust her.

262
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,930
She has this web site, and she
makes messed-up videos of people.

263
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,680
Real? She seemed so nice to me.

264
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,940
Yeah, that's her mo.

265
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,290
So, listen, ethan told me how cool you
are and how you're practically like family,

266
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,820
so I decided I'm gonna invite you to my
birthday par,, my not-so-sweet 16 birthday party.

267
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,120
It's this friday it's going
to be the night of your life.

268
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,870
What do you say?

269
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,290
Oh, my god, I'd love to.

270
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,710
Of course you would, but you're gonna need
new clothes, so we'll gshshopping after school.

271
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,520
I just don't get why this
paper can't wait till next week.

272
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,810
Naomi's got party, and I don't
want her all stressed out for it.

273
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,480
Come on, man. It's a birthday
party for a spoiled little princess.

274
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,820
I got it, mr. Matthews.

275
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,050
Harry, we've spent a
fortune on this party.

276
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,000
Surely, there's something
you can do for us.

277
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,700
she didn't do the assignment.

278
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,780
What am I missing here?

279
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,380
Just have hejust have her write
the paper, charlie. Nonnegotiae.

280
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,620
I'm taking this up to the board
because you're being ridiculous.

281
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,760
Ironic, isn't it, harry?

282
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,910
If things had happened differently,
we'd be talking about our kid.

283
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,720
Yowza.

284
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,720
A lot going on there, huh?

285
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,860
I would get back to your class
if I were you, mr. Matthews.

286
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,990
See you around.

287
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,360
mr c clark and I went out
for a bit back in high school.

288
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,780
I'm never gonna learn
to work this machine.

289
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,890
Whatever happened r
regular coffee? Willie!

290
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,780
And you really do that
when you go online?

291
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,910
Ethan loves it.

292
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,710
I do everything to that boy.

293
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,840
I should do more, actually.

294
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,840
He's been a lilele distant lately.

295
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,610
Uh, hey, uh, listen, thanks
so much for taking me out.

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,120
No problem. hello, I had fun.

297
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,590
I just really wish you would've
l m me buy you that dress.

298
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,020
It looked amazg g on you.

299
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,070
I cannot let you buy me an $800 dress.

300
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,810
- My dad would...
- are you kidding me?

301
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,810
What?

302
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,270
My mom just texted me. I have to write
that paper for matthews by tomorrow.

303
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,670
How much have you writte

304
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,770
I haven't even started yet!

305
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,930
Oh, my god, I-I... I
can't do this right now.

306
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,690
This is so not what I need I mean, I know
if I just sat down and started writing it,

307
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,300
that I could get it done, but thinking
about staring at a blank piece of paper...

308
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,130
what am I gonna do?

309
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,950
Well, I can help.

310
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,430
I told you, I got an "a"
on that paper last year,

311
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,040
so I can give it to you, and
you can take some ideas from it.

312
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,740
Really? that would be so awesome.

313
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,080
Sure... that way, yocacan
see what it should look like.

314
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,750
I'll just email it to
you when I get home.

315
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,040

334
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,960
Why don't you drop down

335
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,460
Come on, guys, you can make out
later. Let's keep playing. Let's go!

336
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,050
Hey, come on, george.

337
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,780
- Come on, man.
- What?

338
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,170
Yo, hey, come on, come on!

339
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,710
Hey, come on.

340
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,710
- Did you kick his ass?
- Mom.

341
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,680
What, that's not the first thing you
thought of when you heard he was in a fight?

342
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,140
Then, ybybe that's why he lost.

343
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,220
I didn't lose.

344
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,150
Never worry about being fair.

345
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,810
Just grab on to those jewels,
and twist them like a garbage bag.

346
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,300
Mom!

347
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,690
Okay, okay. I'll let
you kids hash this out.

348
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,610
He checked me first.

349
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,600
Well, you have got
to control your anger.

350
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,580
People don't know you here.

351
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,700
They're gonna judge you more harshly.

352
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,630
I just reacted.

353
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,500
- I say it was racially motivated.
- Mom.

354
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,110
Look, I'm gonna talk
to your coach tomorrow.

355
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,140
We'll get this all worked out.

356
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,200
And make sure he's not
too rough on our baby.

357
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,070
Yeah, 'cause he is
such a delicate flower.

358
00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:00,730
So listen, you guys are cool with me going to naomi
clark amazing birthday party tomorrow night, rit?

359
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,170
Well, that was fast-- I mean,
harry, do you know this girl?

360
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,320
Yeah, I know her family.

361
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,940
You can go.

362
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,010
Thanks, dad.

363
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,670
Well, I'm gogg to call dan
tana's for some takeout...

364
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,210
not that your tater
tots aren't to die for.

365
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,530
you cannot tell anybody.

366
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,430
You saw that?

367
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,220
Oh, I saw that.

368
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,060
oh, I saw all of that.

369
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,370
The thing is, I totally don't get why
ethan would cheat on someone like naomi.

370
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,260
Believe me...

371
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,800
if a dude is cheating on a chick like that,
he doesn't want to be with her anymore.

372
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,150
But she's so beautiful.

373
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,210
That doesn't mean e'e's
not a pain in the ass.

374
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,730
I love that dress.

375
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,110
Oh, you know me, adrianna.

376
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,600
Early birthday present
to myself from myself.

377
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,510
Aren't I nice?

378
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,580
Here, let me, uh... let
me get this one, ladies.

379
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,380
No, baby, it's on me tonight.

380
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,940
You guys get the tlele; I'll
get the drinks. Thank you.

381
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,770
this is gonna be so much fun.

382
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,050
Do you have the money yet?

383
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,660
Excuse me.

384
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,790
How'd you get up here?

385
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,340
I could ask the same questionbobout you.

386
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,170
You're just a teacher; didn't the
cover charge eat up your month's salary?

387
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,660
You shouldryry applying some of that caustic
wit to your term paper that's due tomorrow.

388
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,990
Actulyly, it's done.

389
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,950
I decided it was better
to do it than to fight it.

390
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,300
Well, I cannot wait to
read that masterpiece.

391
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,380
You know, why are you
always so mean to me?

392
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,940
Who says I'm being mean?

393
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,130
She's underage. Don't serve her.

394
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,240
Oh, I guess that was mean.

395
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,140
welcome wagon.

396
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,070
So, then, harry...

397
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,990
what were we, like 17?

398
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,140
I don't know. Uh, you know,
maybe we should call it...

399
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:08,580
so, then, harry decides that he wants
to climb on the "h" of the llllywood sign

400
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,000
because he thinks it
looks like a ladder.

401
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:14,610
Well, the whole thing comes crashing
down, and he slides on it for like 50 feet.

402
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,060
Oh, my god, did we laugh.

403
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,270
I mean, he's lucky he wasn't killed.

404
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,740
Well, that was a long time
ago. Can I call you a cab?

405
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,590
Oh, I have a better idea.

406
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,370
Why don't you drive me home?

407
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,050
Ooh, or even better, i could drive you home,
and we could swap stories about harry's penis.

408
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,800
I have enough of my own. Thank you.

409
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,770
I'll see myself out. Good night.

410
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,640
okay, don't you ever give me grief
about dating morris kornblum ever again,

411
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,850
because that lady is crazy town.

412
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,780
Well, yeah, in my defense, I was
a teenager. She had a beach house.

413
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,280
But morris... he lived
in a teepee; you were 22.

414
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,820
Yeah, yeah, let's go see
annie's dress for tomorrow night.

415
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,690
You are not gonna win this one.

416
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,510
Whisis this hot babe?

417
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,590
You like it,omom?

418
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,770
It's beautiful.

419
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,240
Look at her ass.

420
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,930
You could crack angggg on it.

421
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:17,710
And I say that because, when I was her age,
ricardo montalban literally cracked e egg on mine.

422
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,390
I won't tell the rest of the
story because I don't remember it.

423
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,850
Sweetie, don't you think that this
is just a little less revealing?

424
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,710
Oh, for god'sasake, who are
you, jedidiah the amish farmer

425
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,160
why don't you go churn us some butter.

426
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,450
beautiful.

427
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,950
- It lookseaeally beautiful.
- I like it.

428
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,020
The thing is, dixon didn't
start it;eoeorge did.

429
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,590
He's just mad the guy's better, but ges alge
il like, "oh, you have to do this for me, man.

430
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,540
"Just say he slashed me first and jumped me
and get him kicked off the team instead of me."

431
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,570
So, you have to lie for
a guy you don't even like?

432
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,180
Wewe're teammates. It's different.

433
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,530
Yes,f f we weren't on the same team, maybe
I wouldn't hang out with him, but we are.

434
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,860
See, that's exactly why I hate lacrosse,
ethan. You're not like those guys.

435
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,090
You're not into anything,
so you don't understand.

436
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,850
I'm not into anything? What
is that supposed to mean?

437
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,530
Well, not like sports
or music. You shop.

438
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,460
you think that's all I'm into?

439
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,940
God, we're talking about me, and
thenalall of a sudden, it's about you.

440
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,860
Just forget it. I'm gonna go home.

441
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,210
Ethan, wait. I'm coming with you.

442
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,010
* Shut up and let me go *

443
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,120
* this hurts I told you so *

444
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,420

you will kiss my lips *

445
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,930
* now shut up and let me go *

446
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,420
*******

447
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,560
where's your cow?

448
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,420
Where's your boyfriend the cow?

449
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,790
What is that all about?

450
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,150
Something yogogot to see.

451
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,210

00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,630

00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,990
Something a little bit
personal. Check it out.

459
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,430
beverly hills sure is nice.

460
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,520
Ain't it sweet, ol' love of mine.

461
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,740
I like being a backstabbing bitch.

462
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,310
I can't believ someone stole my purse.

463
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,100
Hey, they stole mine, too.

464
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,850
Saw the cow video. Funny stuff.

465
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,620
Thanks.

466
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,510
I just don't get what I did to make you
so angry that you had to go and do that.

467
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,170
Gee, I don't know.

468
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,010
Maybe dissing me like I was a piece of
garbage o to gsit with the bratz lllls.

469
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,650
Okay, first of all, I didn't diss you.

470
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,160
Naomi pulled me away.

471
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,280
If I hurt your feeliss by sitting with
someone you don't like, then I'm sorry.

472
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,450
It's not that I don't
like her. I hate her.

473
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,200
Naomi is the antichrist.

474
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:23,320
Well, the antichrist didn't trash me in
front of half a million people. You did.

475
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,760
Soso, how'd that go?

476
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,810
She wasn't so into it.

477
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,310
Can you blame her?

478
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,750
Silver, how many times have we had
a talk about this blog of yours?

479
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,500
All it does is cause problems.

480
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,700
Yeah, well, that's blblog's
supposed to do.Cause problems.

481
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,170
You know, you can't make me stop.

482
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,020
It's not like it's a
school activity or...

483
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,020
okay, I'm not talking to you t
the guidance counselor right now.

484
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,310
I am talking to you as your stster.

485
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,530
Okay, then as my steter you know
what naomi did and why I hate her.

486
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,340
Yes, but this didn h
hurt naomi. It hurt annie.

487
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,200
Co o on. You've got to
let go of that anger.

488
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:03,580
It's not doing you any good. You
don't want to end up like mom.

489
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,170
Come on. Please. Just try, please.

490
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,000
Okay. I'll try.

491
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,750
So... how is mom?

492
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,740
She's fine. You know,
she's mom. I gotta go.

493
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,610
Ethan. Ethan, when you talk to the coach
today you're gonna tell him the truth, right?

494
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,500
You're gonna tell him that
george started it, right?

495
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,540
Let's go, ward. Now.

496
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,560
Dude, I gotta go.

497
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,290
we gotta talk.

498
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,930
And then dixon slashed george and...

499
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,530
george just reacted
like anyone would veve.

500
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,130
- And you saw this?
- Yeah.

501
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,630
You understand the
consequences if you're lying?

502
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:48,950
Yes.

503
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,820
Mr. Wilson, ethan's never lied to me.

504
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,770
You wouldn't do that, right, ethan?

505
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,590
You wouldn't look me in the eye
and lie to my face, would you?

506
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,610
No.

507
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,810
All right, well, because of what you just said, I
have no choice but to keep dixon from joingng the team.

508
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,510
We can't have players who start ghghts.

509
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,900
You can go, ethan.

510
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,620
That kid is lying.

511
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,390
Well, maybe, maybe not.

512
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,770
Were you there? I was
and I didn't see it.

513
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,990
I know my son.

514
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Harry, how mantitimes you
hear that from parents?

515
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,950
And what if dad can't
get me back on the team?

516
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,920
I-I mean, I can't tell him this, but
he's, like, the whole reason why I play.

517
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:38,280
Keke, he played lacrosse so, you
know, I ouought if I played...

518
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,710
what?

519
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:46,570
When I'm on the field, when he talks to me after
a game, it's like something we have together.

520
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,810
That's like our thing.

521
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,480
Like we're really father and son.

522
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,960
You are really father and son.

523
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,230
Don't even say that. It's
been eight years, dixon.

524
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,690
- You're us.
- I...

525
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,720
I just really want to play.

526
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,520
How could you do that to my brother?

527
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,160
How could you lie like that?

528
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,490
It's-it's not that simple.

529
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,000
It is! My god, you... you lie.
You cheat on your girlfriend.

530
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,600
A girl who, byby the way, I like.

531
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,500
Do you remember what I told you I
liked about you the first time we met?

532
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,980
That I was frighteningly honest.

533
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,140
Yeah, I esess I'm just wondering what
the hell happened to that guy that

534
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,870
I liked from a couple summers ago.

535
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,380
Because this new one is an ass.

536
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,320
"but more than a histocacal
snapshot of divisions "between class,

537
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:48,770
a tale of two cities makes us "examine the morality
in our own lives and the true meaning of sacrifice."

538
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,050
thank you, naomi. That was...

539
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,490
that was very well written.

540
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,760
I can't believe you copied e
e whole thing word for word.

541
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,320
What did you think I was going to do?

542
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,320
Not that.

543
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,600
Maybe take some ideas, at
least change it around a little.

544
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,380
What do you care? It
was an old paper, right?

545
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:08,230
You should have asked me first.

546
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,950
I wod d have helped you if you
needed it. That's what friends do.

547
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,820
You did help me,nnnnie. You did.

548
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,120
I don't know why you're
so hung up on this.

549
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,020
Here. It's the dress
you loved from maxfield.

550
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,900
I bought it for you, anyw, ,
because that's what friends do.

551
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,190
One, two, three...

552
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,710
* mama who bore me mama who gave me *

553
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,080
* mama, the angels who made me so sad *

554
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,870
* mama who bore me...*

555
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,680
not bad, right?

556
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,460
* No way to ndndle things
who made me so sad...*

557
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,480
I'm so excited for the party tonight.

558
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,760
Ereryone has rsvp'd already.

559
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,530
Um, cory kennedy is coming.

560
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,970
And tillie and the wall are performing.

561
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,760
I'm so excited. What do you *******

562
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,360
Ethan is cheating on
you.You know it's true!

563
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:09,310
* mama, the weeping
mama, the angels sl *

564
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,560
* no eep in heaven or bethlehem...*

565
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:16,340
okay, okay, uh, let's try this again.

566
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,850
Let's do the reprise to "mama."

567
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,020
You know, it's feeling a little
thin, guys. We need to thicken it up.

568
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,070
The vocals need to be strong, okay?

569
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,060
Hey, miss austin. Why
don't you add annie?

570
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,630
She's been watching the rehearsal.
I'm sure she knows all the words.

571
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,150
Well, I inink it's a little bit late.

572
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,660
I-I really do. I
really do, miss austin.

573
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,700
I've listened to the cd like a billion
times and I've bee watching all the steps,

574
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,280
so, I think I could alally do this.

575
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,810
Um, okay, uh, let's see what you can do.

576
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,860
Grab a mic. Take the
center spot on stage.

577
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,030
Okay, let's take it from the top.

578
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,860
One, two, three...

579
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:54,400
* mama who bore me mama who gave me*

580
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:59,450
* mama, the angels who made me so sad *

581
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,010
* some pray that one day one day *

582
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,890
* christ will come a-comin' *

583
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,270
* they light a candle
and hope that it glows *

584
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,800
* andomome just lie there crying
for him to come and find them *

585
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,800
* but when he comes, they
don't know how to go *

586
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,630
* oh...mama.*

587
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,200
that was excellent, annie.

588
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,080
How would you like to put down
the paintbrush d d join the chorus?

589
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,370
I would so love to.

590
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,850
- Thank you! Thank you so much.
- It was great.

591
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,070
you're welcome. See you tomorrow.

592
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:39,530
Dad, I just got to perform. Did
you see that? It was... so much fun!

593
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,820
We need to talk.

594
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,610
Why did naomi clark turn in your paper?

595
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,010
Naomi, I'll deal with
you after I make a call.

596
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,830
Annie, you wait for me here
till the end of the day.

597
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,770
I can't believe you told your daddy
everything. Are you kidding me?

598
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,090
He recognized the paper. And
mr. Matthews could tell, too.

599
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,340
What was I supposed to do?

600
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,510
Cry. Threaten him. Be creative.

601
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,250
You sound like a spoiled brat.

602
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,050
Well, you sound like a little bitch.

603
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,510
And just so we're clear, you're
completely disinvited to my birthday party.

604
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,990
- 'Cause I care.
- Oh, you should.

605
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,630
Did you see if wilson was crying?

606
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,560
Dude, shut up.

607
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,060
Dude, don't be such a puss.
Who cares about that puss?

608
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,320
She wants to keep the
cheating off her record,

609
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,910
she writes me a new paper on a
new book by the end of the day.

610
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,110
Well, that's impossible. She can'T.

611
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,910
Well, then that kills any chance she
has of joining her sister at yale.

612
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,030
She's not going to yale.

613
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,140
What does th m mean?

614
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,470
Just that you have other interests.

615
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,870
I'm just as smart as jen, mom.

616
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,790
Honey, all I meant is that you
have your big party tonight.

617
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,410
You have to have your final fitting.

618
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,840
Sweetie, you've been emotional.

619
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,130
You've had your purse stolen...

620
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,440
can you stop making excuses for her?

621
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,100
Naomi, do you hear this?

622
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,240
Mr. Mattwsws doesn't think you can do it;
your mother doesn't think you can I it.

623
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,960
Oh, don't talk to my daughter like that.

624
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,570
I am trying to get her to take
responsibility for her life.

625
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,590
Oh, you're one to talk.

626
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,130
This is about naomi.

627
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,020
And you're being lazy.

628
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,560
I think you're smart.
I think you can do it.

629
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,440
Come on, naomi. Prove 'em wrong.

630
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,760
Unless, of course, I'm way off base,

631
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,840
and you cheated because you aren't smart
enough and you do need another week.

632
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,350
Honey, take another ekek.

633
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,180
I don't need another week!

634
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,180
I didn't cheat because I
couldn't write the paper.

635
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,080
I'll write the stupid paper
right now, mom. I'll show you...

636
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,100
- naomi, you...
- mom, could you just...

637
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,110
could you just leave?

638
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:07,390
So, look, I'm not great at apologies,
but I shouldn't have posted that cow vid,

639
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,910
and I was hoping that by
helping you t t in the play,

640
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,450
I n'n't know, maybe that makes us cool.

641
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,960
Maybe friends.

642
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,400
Yeah, that'd be great.

643
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,320
etethan, what happened to you?

644
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,130
Tell your brothehe team.

645
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,480
dixon, dixon. You're back on the team.

646
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,310
What?

647
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,480
Yeah, I know, I wanted to
see your face when I told you.

648
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,290
I spoke to ethan and I guess
he told the coach the truth.

649
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,370
Oh, man.

650
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,870
Ethan is going to kill me wh h he finds
out what I did to get even with him.

651
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,840
What did you do?

652
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:50,600
I, uh, sent the text to naomi saying
that ethan was cheating on her.

653
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,940
What? Hyhy? Why would you do that?

654
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,730
Look, I'm sorry, all right but
I just reacted. I was angry.

655
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,530
I'm the only one who saw him with that
girl. He's going to think that I...

656
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,090
what am i gogoing to do?
What am i going to do?

657
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,360
Do you think it's fair that we let dixon go to the
party after he gets into a fight but we ground annie?

658
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,300
Wha-what, we should just let
heher not have any punishment?

659
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,810
No, but it could have started tomorrow.

660
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,430
Back home, yeah, but here,

661
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,520
I just feel like there's so much more
temptation and ways to get into trouble.

662
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,120
I feel like we need to be tougher.

663
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,350
I guess I feel like sometimes
we bend over backwards for din,n,

664
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,020
but we don't do the same for annie.

665
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,030
annie. Sweetheart?

666
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,610
Your mom and i have talked and we've
decided you can go to the party.

667
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:45,190
Nie? That's weird.

668
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,660
Mom, have you seen annie?

669
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:53,800
Yes, just before she left,
and she looked smoking.

Cory

677
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,730
maybe ethan's not even going to beerere.

678
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,990
Maybe they broke up alrdydy.

679
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,900
Either way, I have to apologize to him.

680
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,680
And plus, if she confronted him already, then,
you know, I'm gonna have to take the rap for it.

681
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,040
Either way, we're going
to have to tell him.

682
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,450
It's just the right thing to do.

683
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,850
Do you guys go to church or someining?

684
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,190
- keep in touch, D.
- All right.

685
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,260
There's some good shots right here.

686
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:50,180
Who is tha not a chance in
hell is what you call her.

687
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,570
Just remember, I got you in.
You're not a guest. You're my bitch.

688
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,150
- Now go get some footage for our story.
- Bitch?

689
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,570
We need to talk about
your people skills.

690
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,850
I can't believe we're
crashing naomi's party.

691
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,490
what'd i tell you?

692
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,440
Lame.

693
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,650
Okay, let's go find ethan.

694
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,450
Debbie, there's like a
thousand kids in there.

695
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,870
I will never find her.

696
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,460
- See you at home.
- Harry?

697
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,580
What are you doing here?

698
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,440
long story.

699
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,130
We need to talk.

700
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,290
Okay.

701
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,370

702
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,250
Dixon.

703
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,150
- Urur sister is not going to believe this.
- What?

704
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,630
Oh, no, I'm telling her.

705
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,220
her purse was stolen?

706
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,610
Last night at the pit.

707
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,760
Hers and adrianna'S.

708
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,600
Wallet, keys, sidekick.

709
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,850
So she never g t the text.

710
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,170
- She never got it?
- Never goitit.

711
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,170
She never got it!

712
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,270
Thank you, god.

713
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,250
You really do go to church, don't you?

00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,770
Hey, sorry I'm late.

715
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,810
Look what I got back.

716
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,080
Oh, my god. Oh, my god,
where did you get it?

717
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,460
The guy from the pit called
me. They found our purses.

718
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,000
Where?

719
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,290
I don't know. They just found them.

720
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,330
I'm still really angry, harry.

721
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,640
I had no idea how to handle it, okay?

722
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,430
We were broken up. What
do you want me to say?

723
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,180
- Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
- Yes.

724
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:45,710
Okay, I am sorry that I freaked
out, but that was over 20 years ago,

725
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,430
and besides, I did-- I
called to find out ouout you,

726
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,560
and your mother said u'u'd
gone off to europe for the year.

727
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:55,090
I didn't go off to europe for the
year and I didn't go to the clinic.

728
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,980
I I went away to have our baby.

729
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:04,470
So that he could be adopted.

730
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,190
We have a son together.

731
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,180

732
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,880

00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:42,900

than for naomi and ethan to share a dance,

738
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,320

the most beautiful 16 you ever saw,

Ethan, I am so sorry about everything.

770
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,840
I saw what happened.

771
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,750
Well, you were right.

772
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:23,060
I have become a complete ass.

773
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,510
Not complete. You did help
dixon. What made you do that?

774
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,080
I don't know. I esess I was...

775
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:32,570

you liked a couple summers ago.

776
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,730
but thank you. Annie.

777
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,160

779
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,930
Uh, I can't talk. He just came in.

780
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,590
I can't sleep, mommy.

785
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,090
- definitely.
- Welcome to california.

786
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,440
Come on.

787
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,830
good morning.

788
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:40,160
Well, my damn computer froze up again.

789
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,020
What'd you spill on it this time, mom?

790
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,680
- Scotch. I mean, iced tea.
- Yeah.

791
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,860
The good iced tea, too.

792
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,480
I'll take it to the repair shop for you.

793
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,180
Oh, no, I'll do it myself.

794
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,790
I need to pick up some
more iced tea anyway.

795
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,740
Mom, you can't drive.

796
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:58,280
That's why there's that big sticker on your heart
medication that saynonot to operate heavy machinery.

797
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:02,460
Oh, pish. It's a mercedes,
not a corn tesesher.

798
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,620
I need to finish my memoirs
before my friend virginia does.

799
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:08,130
We've slept with all of the same people.

800
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,800
If I would have walked in five seconds
later, I wouldn't have had to hear that.

801
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,730
Mom, let debbie get it. You just...

802
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,540
honey, you okay?

803
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,790
Jason ani I broke up.

804
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,720
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, what a smeme.

805
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:26,690
It just comes down to we are
both geographically undesirable.

806
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,790
Well, I could have told
you that wagogonna happen.

807
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,690
It doesn't make it any easier. Move!

808
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:37,710
I say good-bye to huckleberry
finn and hello to california boys.

809
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,060
Dixon, I'm gonna grab my keys
and then I'll take youto practice.

810
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,590
Could we talk for a second, honey?

811
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,440
Tracy caeded again this morning.

812
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,830
What are you gonna do?

813
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:55,300
I have no idea. I think
I'm still in shock.

814
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:58,540
Listen, I want to handle this
the right way for you and me.

815
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,440
I know it's been a tough weekend, but
you gotta tell me how I can help you.

816
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,840
I don't know, harry. I didn't
expect to wake up saturday morning

817
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:09,320
and hear that my husband has
a child with another woman.

818
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,660
This could be such a major
adjustment for our family.

819
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:18,280
I'm sorry this dropped in your lap, but p promise
you that we will handle this together. I will...

820
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:19,770

821
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,060
First day on the job and he's

822
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,140

823
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,050
You know what? We should...

824
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,440

825
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,140

Yeah, antonio.

827
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,140
- Yeah.
- That's a great idea.

828
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,100
What? The whole front hallway?

829
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,920
Unbelievable.

830
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,770
Pali hi lacrosse team did this?

831
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,620

00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,340
I know you guys are pissed. I get it.

833
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:57,130
I would want revenge if I were in your
shoes, too, but we're not gonna retaliate.

834
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,680
Are you kidding me? Look at the ground!

835
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,730
I'm not kidding! No, we'll let
the school board handle this.

836
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,120
We'll get back at them on
the field, not off the field.

837
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,150
That's a terrible idea.

838
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,000
Didn't ask your opinion.

839
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:10,930
Look, come on, gentlemen, this gives us a
chance to show what kind of character we have.

840
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,170
- What kind of men we are.
- What, wussmemen?

841
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,600
There's to be no retaliation
or pranks on palisades hall.

842
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,630
End of discussion.

843
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,590
Am I cle?

844
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,370
Am I clear?

845
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,500
Guys, come on. You heard the principal.

846
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:29,950
Yes, mr. Wilson.

847
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,580
Yes, dad.

848
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,180
Here, I, uh, got this.

849
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:56,050
It didn't travel well, but
it made me think of you, so...

850
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,620
because it's crushed?

851
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:02,240
Are we gonna be okay?

852
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:07,160
I hope so.

853
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,640
I'll meet you after class.

854
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,750
Why don't you tctch
where you're going, ward?

855
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,050
You need a hug, dede?

856
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,890
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

857
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,210
Everything's gonna be okay.

858
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,800
Hey, annie.

859
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:36,440
Hey, uh, listen, I just want to say I'm sorry
for all e e stuff I put you through last week.

860
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,470
It's okay.

861
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:42,020
Well, no, 's's not, but
anyway, um, how are you?

862
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,720
Um, jason broke up with me.

863
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,130
My boyfriend from back home?

864
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,280
- Wow, that sucks.
- Yeah.

865
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:51,220
Um, do you want me
to, like, kick his ass?

866
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:52,840
'Cause I could totally do that for you.

867
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:56,150
He'd kill you, but, uh,
thanks for the thought.

868
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:02,800
Wait. He'd kikill me?

869
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,170
oh, I am, I am, so sorry.

870
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:20,870
Was I that bad?

871
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:24,820
Oh, my god, no-no-no.
Uh, not... it was great.

872
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:29,200
You just... you have
a really nice voice.

873
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,440
Uh, I-I'm annie.

874
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,690
I'm in the musical, too.

875
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:33,910
But I'm just in the chorus.

876
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,530
You probably never noticed me
'cause why would you look behind you?

877
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:40,500
I've noticed you, annie.

878
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,560
Oh, you dropped this.

879
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,950
Thank you.

880
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:48,670
I'm just, I'm in rehearsal.

881
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,290
Please go y your thing.

882
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,420
Thanks. We'ljujust start
from the top, I guess.

883
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,010
All right, let's start
with last night's reading.

884
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,870
Uh, who wants to tell
me what a haiku is?

885
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:06,010
And if you say a haiku is the new sushi
roll at koi, well, that would be incorrect.

886
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

887
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,130
adriana, what's up
with you? Are you okay?

888
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,380
Yeah. I'm just distracted.

889
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:33,270
I have this really big audition for this movie
this week and I just haven't been able to sleep.

890
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,060
And if you get it, what then?

891
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:39,900
Well, then I'd be in a
movie, make lots of money.

892
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,770
So, what, you can buy a new cell
phone or maybe a fancy pair of shoes?

893
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,890
Maybe an expensive car
you really don't need?

894
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,210
No, so I can pay the
mortgage 'cause my mom can'T.

895
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,540
Well,did you enjoy my party?

896
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,230
I know we shouldn't have crashed,but...

897
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,880
Cool tattoo.

898
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:04,870
Yeah.

899
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,400
No,I don't blame you.

900
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,470
I mean,it was a fabulous party.

901
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:12,540
I just didn't expect to see you there,you know,with all your morals and everything.

902
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,870
Thanyoyou.

903
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,320
ms. Taylor?

904
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,880
Mr. Matthews.

905
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,990
You know,if you sit with me,I'll let you have half my sandwich.

906
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,820
How about I sit with you and you keep your sandwich?

907
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:27,190
Well,you're too easy.

908
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,330
Anyone ever tell you that?

909
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,390
Not lately.

910
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,400
so,guys,uh...

911
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,870
are we gonna get 'em back or what?

912
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:42,960
Uh,no,man.

913
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,540
I mean,you heard what mr. Wilson said.

914
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,560
I mean,uh,youradad.

915
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,810
No retaliation,right?

916
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,830
Come on,guys.

917
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:51,480
I want in on this.

918
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,430
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

919
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,180
Dude,you're the principal's kid.

920
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:59,130
I mean,what are we,stupid?

921
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,030
I think this may be my best blogisode yet.

922
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,220
Now,why does that scare me?

923
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:06,300
You shouldn't be scared.

924
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,620
Others should becacared.

925
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,710
Okay,seriously,silver,it's kinda mean,

926
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:12,050
and it makes me feel li I I can't tell you stuff.

927
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:15,630
In fact,p probably already told you too much.

928
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,110
Okay,what was that?

929
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:19,870
What?

930
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,040
"What?"

931
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:23,580
Mm,ty collins just practically put his tongue in your mouth.

932
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,030
- That's what.
- Shut up!

933
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,420
Okay,you are obviously too messed up to see what's right in front of you,

934
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,690
so let me be your eyes.

935
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,510
Ty collins is into you?

936
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,880
You should be into ty colls.S.

937
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:35,620
Or so to speak.

938
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:39,560
Okay,can you just give me e e second because my old relationship ended six hours ago?

939
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,710
Okay,the cure for a breakup isis a hookup.

940
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,870
Now,he does tend to leave brokenhearted girls sobbing at his locker,

941
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:48,030
but for a temporary distraction,he's your man.

942
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,220
That is a terrible recommendation.

943
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:53,840
And I really don't think he's that into me.

944
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,040
Yeah...

945
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,420
'cause you're such aorork.

946
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:58,890
Thanks.

947
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,470
Hey,annie.

948
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:07,750
Hey,ty.

949
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,960
Want to grab dinner tonight after rehearsal?

950
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,730
uh,yeah.

951
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,360
Great.

952
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,790
I'm so sorry that happened to you.

953
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,910
I don't know why peoplchcheat.

954
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:26,070
Who are you and why are you speaking to me?

955
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,490
Welcome to mfifirst installment of puppet revenge theater.

956
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,840
This episode is entitled "we're fighting...

957
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:36,300
again" how could you cheaonon me?

958
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,380
I think I'm so beautiful.

959
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:39,830
- I love lacrosse.
- No.

960
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,680
No,no,you're supposed to love !

961
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,620
'Cause you're the only one stupid enough to actually think that I'm interesting.

962
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,160
I love lacrosse.

963
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:48,120
Hi,ethan.

964
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,660
Can we go to you car and check out your lacrosse stick together?

965
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,910
everybody's seen it,ethan!Everyone knows!

966
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:06,980
I know,I'm sorry.

967
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,260
That slap's going to be legendary.

968
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,880
Too bad that's not on silver's site.

969
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,750
Maybe you can reenact it.

970
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,490
The harder the slap,the faster they run back.

971
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,360
You shou Mm-hmm.*********

972
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,020
Wait till you see the second part of my plan.

973
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:41,400
Why do y w want to do anything with those jock asses anyway?

974
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,460
They're just gonna end up selling tires or car insurance.

975
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,210
Killed ya!

976
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,000
Buh-bye.

977
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,590
Look,the fun part about being on a team is being part of theeaeam,

978
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,580
and you wouldn't know that because you were never on one.

979
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:54,940
How do you keep doing that?

980
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:58,350
Because you are my bitch I was on a team in the sixth grade.

981
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,980
I played soccer with all those guys.

982
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:03,580
But I kept scoring for the other team,so we respectfully parted ways.

983
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,810
I hit you first!

984
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,410
Then why are you dead?

985
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:10,260
Look,I just got to come up with the dopest prank ever,kid.

986
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,280
Like,just crazy.

987
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:14,860
So they won't even think of me as the principal's kid anymore.

988
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,160
Suck on that!

989
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:16,970
Suck on that!

990
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:19,000
Sweet,dude,you ate my head.

991
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:21,210
so what are you going to do?

992
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,080
I don't know.

993
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,660
You got anything?

994
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,990
Honey,I'm swamped at work.

995
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:31,990
Is this important?

996
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,250
I'm just going to go grab a bite with a friend from the play.

997
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:35,170
Is that okay?

998
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,160
What bite,what friend?

999
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,960
Just this guy,who...

1000
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,020
is this a date?

1001
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:40,850
That was fast.

1002
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:42,680
It's not a date,mom.

1003
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,170
- It's just a hang.
- A ngng?

1004
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,400
On a school night?

1005
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,170
I know it's a school night,but it's just a guy from the play.

1006
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,650
His name is ty and we just want to,you know,talk about the play...

1007
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,390

1008
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,290
okay,slow down.

1009
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:59,530
It'd be nice to have something to take my mind off jason,yoknknow.

1010
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,740
And I promise I won't be outatate.

1011
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:03,090
I didn't s y yes yet.

1012
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,060
Come on,mom,please.

1013
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,420
Okay,I'll make you a deal.

1014
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:11,310
I'm going to be working later than I thought,so can you and ty stop by,

1015
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,940

1016
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:14,990
Will do.

1017
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,040
Be home by 10:00.

1018
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,240
I love you.

1019
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:20,740
I will see you at 9:59.

1020
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,370
All right,here we go.

1021
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:26,720
Bullitt central high school in shepherdsville,kentucky,

1022
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:30,020
put nair in the other team's jockstraps.

1023
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:32,770
Do you really want to touch the other team's jockstraps?

1024
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:34,470
Good point.

1025
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,910
Hello,gentlemen.

1026
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:37,150
Hey grandma,what's up?

1027
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:40,110
Oh,just waiting for annie to bring my computer back.

1028
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,020
I heard about the trash atat school.

1029
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,490
Yeyeah.

1030
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,450
You know,your dad loved a goodrarank.

1031
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:52,320
His senior year,he and the team got 50 pigs,god only knows from where--

1032
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,790
and released them on palisade's fldld.

1033
00:55:54,910 --> 00:56:00,240
Took them six hours to catch them all and then they had to play the game in pig poop.

1034
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:05,150
I'll let you get back to your studies.

1035
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,150
I think I have an idea.

1036
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:18,930
So where are we?

1037
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,490
This looks like an airport.

1038
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:21,820
It is.

1039
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:23,240
The planes seem small.

1040
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:26,250
Private planes,private aiorort.

1041
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:27,250
So,uh...

1042
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,030
where's e e restaurant.

1043
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,730
Oh,it's in san francisco.

1044
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,180
Heaset,silver.

1045
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,130
A jet.

1046
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:42,770
Okay,it's the coolest thing ever.

1047
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,350
It's like pretty woman,but I'm not a whore.

1048
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:47,030
Yeah,well,he is the richest guy in school.

1049
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:51,200
I have a solid say-yes-to-jet policy,so what's the problem?

1050
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:55,730
The problem ist my mom would kill me,

1051
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:59,620
because she almost didn't let me go she thought we were eating at astro burger.

1052
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,270
Well,okay,it's,like,an hour flight,right?

1053
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,970
It'se being stuck on sunset in traffic.

1054
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,150
Okay,so you think I should...

1055
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,490
Stop being such a farm girl and go.

1056
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,490
I'll talk to you later.

1057
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:18,740
Hey,naomi,I'm so sorry to hear about ethan rejecting you.

1058
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,960
You are such a good person.

1059
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,610
You really deserve to be happy.

1060
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,530
Idn't reject her,bitch lips.

1061
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,520
She slappeM.

1062
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:27,890
Yeah,his cheating was really an act of love.

1063
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:29,310
See you around,cheetah girls.

1064
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,940
Nobody break a nail.

1065
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,540
Just so you know,I'm going to try and play it cool,

1066
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:40,560
but I am totally eaking out right now.

1067
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,530
I'm king out,too.

1068
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,940
I just talked to the pilot and he's slurring his word 

1069
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,560
- are you serious?
- No,I'm not.

1070
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:51,030
You call your mom,freak out about a plane...

1071
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:52,410
it'S...

1072
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,540
it's cute.

1073
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,370
That doesn't sound like a good thing.

1074
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,530
It's a great thing.

1075
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:09,060
Yes,I hated the business side of the fashion world and I had my degree psychology,

1076
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:10,590
so I thought,why not?

1077
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:14,020
Went back and got my masters and here I am.

1078
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:14,830
How about you?

1079
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,300
How did you get started in teaching?

1080
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,100
For the chicks.

1081
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:23,790
Listen,I wantedto ask you something outside of school.

1082
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,760
Will you go to dinner with me sometime?

1083
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:27,850
I don't know.

1084
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:28,610
Yikes.

1085
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,640
Is that like a,I'm-just-not-that-into-you,"I don't know,"

1086
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:34,480
or is it more of a I'm-going-to-play-coy- and-make-him-sweat "I don't know"?

1087
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,320
I would have to get a babysitter.

1088
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,300
You have a kid?

1089
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,980
And this is where you can retract the offer with no hard feelings.

1090
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:42,090
No,it doesn't bother me.

1091
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,610
You know,everybody comes with some age.

1092
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:49,480
I don't really consider my son baggage,but okay.

1093
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,790
I don't know why it came out like that.

1094
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:53,490
I didn't mean that,okay?

1095
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:56,310
What I meant was...

1096
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,170
- wa how old is h 
- four a half.

1097
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:01,000
Four and a half-- that...

1098
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,760
that is a wonderful age.

1099
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,040
I don't know if that's true.

1100
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:08,080
I just...I hear people say it,and I just thought maybe it was...

1101
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,400
it was the right thing to say.

1102
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:11,990
- See you later.
- Yeah.See ya.

1103
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,060
Never.Real bad.

1104
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,930
Okay,ybody,rehearsal in five minutes.

1105
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,740
So your dad's like a movie producer or something,right?

1106
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,690
Yeah.

1107
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,160
There they are.

1108
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:26,920
this is crazy.

1109
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,370
Hey,what time do you guys wrap?

1110
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,580
Uh,another couple of hours.

1111
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:30,550
All right,w be back soon.

1112
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,380
Hey,buddy,this way.

1113
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:36,900
Hey,lila,good to see you.

1114
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,180
What kind of movies does your dad produce?

1115
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,630
Porn.

1116
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:46,010
He's the biggest producer of x-rated moviesin the world.

1117
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,440
So can we stay and watch?

1118
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,040
- Dude,no.
- Why not?

1119
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:50,460
Dude,my dad only has two rules...

1120
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:55,620
no watching porn until I'm 21,and we as eat dinner together.

1121
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:09,480
I wish I knew what you were thinking.

1122
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,420
I am thinking...

1123
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:19,330
that I just had the best meal that I've ever had at the fanciest restaurant I've ever been to.

1124
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,140
Ere did you learn to speak italian?

1125
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:24,360
Oh,well,that's the upside of spending all my summers in italy.

1126
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:27,240
And what would be the downside?

1127
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:29,080
There is none.

1128
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:34,100
This night is nothing like I thought it would be.

1129
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,070
Is that a good thing?

1130
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:39,520
It's a great thing.

1131
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,730
by yourself,kel?

1132
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,470
No,I'm meeting someone.

1133
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,960
Nat,give me a shake and french fries,extra cris 

1134
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,490
Brenda!

1135
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:55,510
Wow,look at you.

1136
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:57,780
It's so good to see both of you in this place again.

1137
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,850
How's your brother?

1138
01:00:58,860 --> 01:00:59,830
Brandon is good.

1139
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:04,380
He told me to tell you that every single time he thinks of you,he craves a mega burger.

1140
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,580
I made an impression.

1141
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:11,530
and he told me to tell you,that you aeautiful.

1142
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:15,230
Yes,he said that on the phone at 3:00 A.M.

1143
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:16,960
When he called from belize.

1144
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,010
What is with you walsh kids?

1145
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,530
You can't stay in one place.

1146
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,770
Well,I'm here for at least a month doing the play.

1147
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:22,960
So that should count for something.

1148
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,400
Yes,it does.

1149
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:27,450
Listen,I was thinking...

1150
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,030
we should spend some more time together.

1151
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,900
I mean,it's been too long.

1152
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:33,170
The last time you saw sammy was when he was a baby.

1153
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:35,270
I know.

1154
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,160
And,you know,

1155
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:41,600
I was thinking that we've wasted a lot of time over the last couple years,you know.

1156
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:43,190
Yeah,I know.

1157
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:46,050
So what do you say we stop wasting it and get back to where we were?

1158
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:46,740
It sndeaT.

1159
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,680
My only question is,what are we doing here just having milkshakes?

1160
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:50,810
That's a good question.

1161
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:52,250
Nat?

1162
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:05,490
Dude,I can still see the slap mark on your face.

1163
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:08,280
Whatever.At least I've got somebody who cares enough about me to slap me.

1164
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:09,750
Better thau and your hand.

1165
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,360
All right,this prank,better be good.

1166
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,120
And what is he doing here?

1167
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:14,450
I mean,he's not even on the team.

1168
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,530
Yeah,I'm participating as a fan.

1169
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:19,680
I think I have a shr to you in my room,mikey.

1170
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,500
Oh,funny.

1171
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:24,000
Look,guys,if y'all don't like the idea,we can do this alone.

1172
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,190
Yeah,let's see what you got.

1173
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:33,490
Whoa,where'd you get these?

1174
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:34,560
They're my dad'S.

1175
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,910
Why are dudes so freaky?

1176
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:39,450
You guys,guys,hold 'em back,hold 'em back.

1177
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:40,850
We've got to get these jerseys on 'em.

1178
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,560
Look,there's just three pigs.

1179
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:46,250
But when they see the number four,they're going to be looking for the other number all day.

1180
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:48,360
Dude,this is sick.

1181
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:49,820
I mean,disgusting...

1182
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,710
but also sick.

1183
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:13,130
I seriously think we'd be really great together.

1184
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:19,020
with my beauty and your brains,there's nothing we couldn't do.

1185
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:20,010
Is that right?

1186
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:21,600
You want toknow something?

1187
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,960
Not really.

1188
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,310
When we were in eighth gr 

1189
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:28,990
I loved sitting behind you in history because your hair smelled like grapefruits.

1190
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,340
why are you so weird?

1191
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,100
I'm just saying what I'm thinking.

1192
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:37,250
Oh,well,you know what,that's scary.

1193
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:41,830
Very,vecary,actually.

1194
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:51,770
Come on,tell me.

1195
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:52,700
What?

1196
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:55,540
How many girls have you n to san francisco on your first date?

1197
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:57,820
Uh,you're buzzing.

1198
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,470

1199
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:04,960
Oh,sorry,uh,we don't get cell service when we're in flight.

1200
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,090
Oh,no.

1201
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:07,960
What's wrong?

1202
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:10,780
M-my grandma was in an accident.

1203
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:13,140
A car accident.

1204
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:20,270
I am so sorry.

1205
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:21,260
You should be.

1206
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:24,920
Tabitha picked up her computer becae e obviously you couldn't be bothered.

1207
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:26,620
Oh,myodod,i totally forgot.

1208
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:27,610

Shshe is okay now.

1210
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,490
She's upstairs talking with onef f her friends.

1211
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:37,430
I ha n no excuse was having funhanging out with a new friend and I just forgot.

1212
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,560
Punish me,do whatever you need.

1213
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,650
I am so sorry.

1214
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:43,390
Well,appreciate your honesty,annie.

1215
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,150
No more dates on a school night.

1216
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:47,010
Hey,where is this ty guy?

1217
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:49,060

1218
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,170
Yeah.

1219
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:56,500
So,then pacino says,I don't care who cooked it,m m not eating it.

1223
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:09,100

1225
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,670
Oh,sweee,e,I'm fine.

1226
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:12,490
Did you hear?

1227
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,630
I nailed an suv.

1228
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,650
The big bastard was taking up three spots.

1229
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,240
Hi,mrs. Brewer.

1230
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,730
Hi,annie.

1231
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,170
It's so good to see you.

1232
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:23,080
I believe you know my grandson.

1233
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,600
so...

1234
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:38,980
you like him?

1235
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,290
Yeah.

1236
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:41,930
Yeah,I like him.

1237
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:43,620
We had fun.

1238
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:47,030
A-at the very least,we'll be friends.

1239
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:48,930
Just friends,or...

1240
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:52,180
Well,that's the most important thin if we can't be that,

1241
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,930
then we can't be ytything else.Right?

1242
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:56,380
Right.

1243
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:00,830
are we friends?

1244
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:08,530
Hey,remember that four o of july at the pier?

1245
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,280
That was fun.

1246
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:10,230
Oh yeah!

1247
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:12,590
I'm still mad at you about that,by the way--

1248
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,360
you were supposed to send me those pictures of the octopus...

1249
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,390
oh,the penta-pus-- it only had five tentacles.

1250
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,820
Yes,yes,the penta-pus.

1251
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:19,790
Yes.

1252
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,980
That i won.

1253
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:25,300
E-excuse me-- who was the one who threw the ball that knocked over the last milk bottle?

1254
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:26,970
Aw,it was wobbling already.

1255
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:28,300
It was already falling down.

1256
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:31,000
You just grabbed the ball and threw it as it was going down-- that doesn'T...

1257
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:36,160
and knocked it over-- which is why i won the penta-pus,thank you very much.

1258
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,420
God,that was the ugliest thing I've ever seen.

1259
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:40,050
it was.

1260
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:42,040
I-I bet you it was stuffed with asbestos or something.

1261
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,610
I got a rash for a week after holding that thing.

1262
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:45,990
It was not good.

1263
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:46,640
Not good.

1264
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:48,340
Whatever happened to that thing?

1265
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:49,920
I don't know.

1266
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:50,960
Probably just...

1267
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,860
dissolved.

1268
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,220
so...

1269
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,410
how are things with you and naomi?

1270
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,090
Not good.

1271
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,310
I'm sorry.

1272
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,770
Ye,,I am,too.

1273
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:09,370
About a lot ofhihings.

1274
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,640
Ethan,time to go.

1275
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,200
Well,that's my exit.

1276
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,550
Your grandmother has trouble driving,too,huh?

1277
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,690
God,it must suck getting old.

1278
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,600
Yeah,actually,uh...

1279
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:26,120
she drives just fine.

1280
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:30,430
See you around,annie.

1281
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:48,630
*************that destreded palisades hall's cafeteria last night?

1282
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:51,430
Really.

1283
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,780
Interesting.

1284
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,190
Besides extensive property damage,they had to call animal control,

1285
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,860
who's been looking for the pigs,trying to round them up for the last ten hours,

1286
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,340
and just can't seem to fd d them all.

1287
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:05,010
you know,a lot of schools hate palisades.********

1288
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:08,620
These pigs rere wearing west beverly lacrosse jerseys.

1289
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:10,330
Yeah,it's probably us.

1290
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,660
Was I not clear when I said no retaliation?

1291
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:17,590
Let me be clear about this-- if one of you doesn't step forward by 1:00 today

1292
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:21,150
and take responsibility for this,your lacrosse season...

1293
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,610
is over.

1294
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:24,830
What?

1295
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:29,790
It's funny guys,but someone's got to come clean.

1296
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:35,440
Still running lis?

1297
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:37,340
Yeah,I'm almost off script.

1298
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,500
You ready for your audition?

1299
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:40,250
My mom thinks I am.

1300
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,660
What about you?

1301
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:42,540
Yeah.

1302
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:43,480
That's what I meant.

1303
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:44,180
I'm ready.

1304
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:45,670
I'm on it.

1305
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:50,140
You know,it's all over school,about you and george.

1306
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,700
I know.

1307
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,940
Has ethan called?

1308
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,100
Meeting tonight.

1309
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,460
Told you it would work.

1310
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,340
Good lk.

1311
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:58,410
You,too.

1312
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,860
I need you to tell me y you know anything.

1313
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:04,970
How can you ask me that?

1314
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:06,820
It'll be much better if somebody steps forward.

1315
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:09,550
So you're asking me to rat on my team?

1316
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:11,590
They barely trust me as it is.

1317
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:15,100
You don't think that they know I'm in here right now,thinking I'm giving them up?

1318
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,910
Is there something to give up?

1319
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:20,510
Are you asking mththis as my dad or as my principal?

1320
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:21,880
Because my dad would be on my side.

1321
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:25,480
Your father and your principal are trying tteteach you something about character.

1322
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,430
By ratting on my team.

1323
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:29,330
No.By taking responsibility for your actions.

1324
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:34,190
Whoever is iololved with this has to come forward,or the entire team gets punished.

1325
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:35,100
Fine!

1326
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:36,730
It was me.

1327
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:37,720
What was?

1328
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,260
I did it.

1329
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:40,350
Did what?

1330
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:40,920
I-I-I...

1331
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:45,260
let the pigs loose,I-I planned everything,I did everything by myself.

1332
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:47,790
come on,dixon.

1333
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:48,530
What?

1334
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:50,250
You don't believe me?

1335
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:50,880
No.No,I don't believe U.U.

1336
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:52,980
Where do you think I got the idea from?

1337
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:56,420
Grandma told me about your pig prank when you were on the team.

1338
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,890
okay.

1339
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:11,150
Are you absolute certain that...

1340
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:14,340
you want to take full responsibility for this?

1341
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,850
All on your head?

1342
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:20,800
All of it,by yourself?

1343
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:24,220
Easiest decision I've made since gogot here.

1344
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:25,790
Okay.

1345
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,850
Skyler

1346
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:43,800
adrian?

1347
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:45,230
I think she left.

1348
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,910
Okay.

1349
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:49,680
So,come on,spill it.

1350
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:51,200
Did you join the mile-high club?

1351
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:53,100
We didn't even kiss.

1352
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:57,390
Of course,I was so nervous asat I wlk taing incessantly and didn't give him the chance to.

1353
01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:58,310
Ye.

1354
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,720
Well,you did get to fly on a private jet.

1355
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,470
That makes you a winner; I am a loser.

1356
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:04,540
I stayed at the pit and drank coffee all night.

1357
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:05,580
Loser!

1358
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,340
hey,uh,cool tattoo.

1359
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,830
What does it mean?

1360
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:17,590
it's the chiymbose s lfor friendship,'cause,you know,friends are cool.

1361
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:20,330
Naomi has the same one.

1362
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:23,680
Yeah.

1363
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:26,900
All right...

1364
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:30,600
in eighth grade,my dad had an affair with my mom's best frid.

1365
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:32,390
I was...

1366
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:36,240
god,I was so angry.*******

1367
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:41,600
butKn that she'd find out,you know,and she'd get a divorce or...

1368
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,640
start drinking again.

1369
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:44,630
So I...

1370
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,030
I didn't tell anybody,I kept it a secret,

1371
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:50,090
but then it started eating away at me,and I just...

1372
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:51,410
I had to tell someone.

1373
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:52,950
So...

1374
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,880
I told my best friend,naomi.

1375
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:00,420
She promised me that she wouldn't tell anyone.

1376
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:01,850
So she told everyone.

1377
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,550
Why-why would she do that?

1378
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:07,350
Because she needs to know more than anyone else.

1379
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:10,840
Because it gives her power to tear people down.

1380
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,090
So...

1381
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:13,420
my mom found out.

1382
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:21,570
She confronted my dad,and everything that I prayed wouldn't happen happened.

1383
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,310
So...

1384
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:29,070
now it is my greatest pleasure to make her pay for it.

1385
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:33,900
I'm sorry.

1386
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,390
Adrianna...

1387
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,260
Listen,um,how was the audition?

1388
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:49,450
Oh,it was great!

1389
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,150
Really great.

1390
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:54,920
Actually,um,it's between me and one other girl,so keep you fingers crossed.

1391
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:56,660
Wow,I will.

1392
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:59,100
Hey,cgrgratulations.

1393
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:01,490
Thank you.

1394
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:07,100
Yoyou didn't have to do that,man.

1395
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:08,500
Don't worry about it,man.

1396
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:09,610
It was my idea anyway.

1397
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:11,460
Yeah,but now he cut you from the team.

1398
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,440
Yeah,but there were other guys on the team who had ththing to do with it.

1399
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,870
And they would have been screwed for the whole season.

1400
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:18,710
I had to do it,man.

1401
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:21,110
See you later.

1402
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:27,660
You think his dad'll put him back on the team?

1403
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,720
I don't know.

1404
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:35,660
Hey,mr. Wilson.

1405
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,280
What can I do for you,mr. Ward?

1406
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,840
Dixon didn't do it alone.

1407
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:42,640
I helped.

1408
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:47,700
So,I mean,if you suspend him,you have to suspend me.

1409
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:49,260
Me,too.

1410
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,100
Navid,you,too?

1411
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:54,900
They're my pigs,sir,and I can prove it.

1412
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,720
They respond to their names when called.

1413
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:59,920
Really?

1414
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,290
Look what I found in my daughter's pocket.

1415
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:10,340
San francisco,annie?

1416
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:21,040
I was just so bummed about jason,e,and *********

1417
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:22,270
I knew you would say no.

1418
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:22,910
Wait a minute.

1419
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,630
I said yes to a date on a school night,which I thought was pretty cool of me.

1420
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:30,510
I'm sorry if I have to draw the line at my 15-year-old daughter jetting off

1421
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:32,930
to san francisco with a guy she barely knows.

1422
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:34,180
That's what kids here do.

1423
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,500
They have planes they have planes and they go places

1424
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:39,340
and they don't tell their parents 'cause it's no big deal.

1425
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:41,900
It takes an hour to get to san franccoco by jet,

1426
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:45,050
and that's likbebeing in traffic on sunset.

1427
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,700
We have rules,annie!

1428
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,740
What if you're somewhere and we don't know where,and you get hurt?

1429
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:52,300
I will work with you,t t i have to be able to trust you,

1430
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,500
and right now I don't know when I'm gonna be able to do that again.

1431
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:56,930
Are you gonna tell dad?

1432
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,910
Of course,I'm gonna tell dad.

1433
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,930
george?

1434
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:10,310
Of all the guys,why him...

1435
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,530
in front oeveveryone?

1436
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,440
Well,I guess I just did to you what you did to me.

1437
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:15,610
What I did to you was terrible.

1438
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:17,000
I feel horrible.

1439
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:19,630
But,I mean,I hurt you,you hurt me.

1440
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:22,070
Is that how it works with us?

1441
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:25,360
I wouldn't do that to a friend,and we're supposed to be more than friends.

1442
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,300
But we are more than that.

1443
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:29,870
We're more than friends,ethan.

1444
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:30,960
And we've fought before.

1445
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:34,390
We always work it out.

1446
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:40,190
U u know,you asked me why I did it.

1447
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:42,970
I said I didn't know.

1448
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,300
I think I do now.

1449
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,220
Know what?I wanted out.

1450
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:59,500
Are you breaking up with me?

1451
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:03,540
I'm breaking up with us.

1452
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,150
Thanks to your buddies,you're back on the team.

1453
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,970
You and ethan are gonna have to sit out the pasasades game,

1454
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,760
and navid's gonna have to pick up trash.

1455
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,930
Really?

1456
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:19,820
Yeah.

1457
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,420
And I want to apologi t to you.

1458
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:25,480
Wasn't fair of me to ask you to give up your buddies.

1459
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:27,350
I was on a team once.

1460
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,520
I know how it works.

1461
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,850
You know,I'm sorry I disobeyed you,you know?

1462
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,690
I'I'm still trying to find my way around here,you know?

1463
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:40,130
I'm trying to figure out when to be your principal and when to be your dad.

1464
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,560
you know,I think I like my dad more than my principal.

1465
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,440
You might not when you hear hihis punishment.

1466
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:08,930
Uh,is...

1467
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,410
Uh,sorry,I was looking for kelly.

1468
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:11,770
Yeah,you're in the right place.

1469
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:13,840
She's just putti s sammy to bed.

1470
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:15,270
I-I'm her friend brenda.

1471
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:16,140
I just got into town.

1472
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,270
We've been catching up.

1473
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,200
I bet that you're ryan.

1474
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,240
Why,I am.

1475
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:22,960
ryan.

1476
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:26,230
I know; weird that'm'm here.

1477
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,750
I,I,uh,I'm not a stalker.

1478
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:31,250
I just,I felt bad about my comment.

1479
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:32,820
The comment.

1480
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:37,390
So,um,I wanted to bring you these.

1481
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,390
Thank you.

1482
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:39,060
Yeah.

1483
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:42,250
Oh,and I also work part-time for the blackhawks recruiting fans,

1484
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:45,760
so I brought you that,too,fofor your son.

1485
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:47,340
Yeah,I figured.

1486
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:50,980
yeah,okay.

1487
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:52,730
So,you have company and you're busy.

1488
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,650
I'm just gonna...

1489
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:57,520
actually,if you guys want to grab some food or a drink,I can stay here and watch sammy.

1490
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:59,940
I mean,if he's already asleep,he won't even know that you're gone.

1491
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:02,860
I would love that,but,but it's up to you.

1492
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:04,640
You justotot here.

1493
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,970
Don't worry.I'll be here for a while.

1494
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,600
Okay,yeah.

1495
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,540
Um,are you sure?

1496
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:28,540
well?

1497
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:34,730
He nailed me: No texting,coming straight home teter school from practice.

1498
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:40,170
And play rehearsal and no dates for two weeks or parties or coffee money.

1499
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,570
But you got to go san francisco.

1500
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:44,480
I know.

1501
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:48,170
this ain't kansas no mo'.

1502
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,380
you sorry we moved here?

1503
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,720
Yet to be determined.

1504
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:57,790
A lot of temptation here.

1505
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:59,860
I'm just concerned about how 's's gonna affect the kids.

1506
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:02,740
You say the word,I will move us back to kansas.

1507
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:03,960
Would you really do that?

1508
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,510
Yes,I would.

1509
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:10,910
Look,it was tough moving here,but if you're unhappy,if the kids are miserable,

1510
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:15,550
I will pack us up,mom in tow,and head back to kansas.

1511
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:19,160
I think we can give it some time,but it's nice to know we have another option.

1512
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,030
We do.

1513
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:25,680
And this thing with tracy,I wish I knew what to do,but I don'T.

1514
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:27,770
And am I curious to know the kid's okay?

1515
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:34,570
Absolutely,but being an adoptive father,would I want dixon's birth parents around us?

1516
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,070
No way.

1517
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,570
Well,look,dixon is a teenager.

1518
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,890
This is a man.

1519
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:42,330
Before you do anything about that,

1520
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,550
I think you really need to figure out how you want to handle things with try.

1521
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:49,890
I don't,I don't kno and I am the first to admit that I was not the greatest guy back then.

1522
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,780
Honestly,I'm more concerned about the guy that you are now.

1523
01:19:53,810 --> 01:20:00,270
So just take your time and figure out how you want to handle this.

1524
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:05,030
