1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,440
previously on 90210...

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,230
my dad says I have to live at home.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,480
Stay at my house.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,390
As long as you want.

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,820
liam,I'm not going to be your booty call.

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,850
Girl:Hello,silver.

7
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,810
Hey. I saw your movie on youtube.

8
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,170
I can't go back to school.

9
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,890
I'm enrolling at st. Claire'S.

10
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,160
I just need a fresh start.

11
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,540
You don't have to give your baby up if you don't want to.

12
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,040
What are you saying?We should get married?

13
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,010
Yes. Yes!

14
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,050
Uh,married. Sure.

15
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,140
Yeah,okay.

16
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,960
We're getting married.

17
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,240
Freshly pureed carrots coming on up.

18
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,570
Who's hungry?

19
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,940
I think I know who's hungry.

20
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,470
Organic vegetables coming in for a landing.

21
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,550
open up,hannah.

22
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,380
Hannah?

23
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,210
That's an odd name for a boy.

24
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,930
Well,she's not going to be a boy.

25
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,030
Oh,please.The way you're carrying?She's a boy.

26
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,480
He's a boy.

27
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,760
I will call him habib.

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,490
Habib?

29
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,260
Really?

30
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,040
Do you want him to be teased mercilessly?

31
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,410
Come on.Kids in beverly hills are used to all kinds of names.

32
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,310
Not by kids.

33
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,440
By me.

34
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,090
Habib's a good name.

35
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,060
Very masculine,yet sensitive.

36
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,580
Navid: Which is the kind of kid he's going to be.

37
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,930
Rugged but soulful; athletic,but not jocky.

38
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,330
Intelligent,but not nerdy.

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,360
Oh,and you know what I bet he's really going to be into?

40
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,270
Chess.

41
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,090
Adrianna: Babies do not play chess.

42
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,790
Navid: Oh,if any baby could,ours could.

43
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,510
I'm telling you,our little guy is going to have the best of everything.

44
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,890
I made this bassinet,you know.

45
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,280
I know and I love it.

46
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,500
But babies do not play chess.

47
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,900
Navid: Well,not at first,I guess.

48
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,900
When he's older.

49
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,450
I'm telling you,he's going to be a prodigy.

50
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,190
Well,I don't need a prodigy.

51
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,100
I just want a healthy baby.

52
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,220
come to mama.

53
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,420
We better get to school.

54
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,630
Who's going to take care of hannah?

55
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,510
My parents.

56
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,860
Hello!

57
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,670
Yeah,if they're on board.

58
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,930
Of course I'm on board to raise our grandbaby.

59
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,360
Navid?

60
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,060
What?

61
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,370
They don't even know I'm pregnant.

62
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,050
Yeah,because you keep avoiding them,which you can't keep doing.

63
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,550
Because unless you have the gestation period of an elephant,

64
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,440
the cat is going to come out of the bag soon enough.

65
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,580
Not to mix my animal metaphors.

66
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,940
I know that they need to know.

67
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,980
I just...

68
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,060
I thought maybe you'd want to tell them by yourself,

69
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,390
while I go hide under a bed.

70
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,840
No,it's not going to be that bad,I promise.

71
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,590
in fact,I can tell you exactly how the whole thing is going to go down.

72
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,250
At first,yeah,they'll explode with anger.

73
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,500
My mom's going to start to cry.

74
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,000
oh,she cries when she burns dinner.

75
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,400
While ' momcrs ying,my dad will rant about how we never should have moved to america.

76
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,630
He'll say random things about,you know,the dangers of video games or processed sugar.

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,200
He really hates processed sugar.

78
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,600
-And then...
-the's more?

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,880
Well,then they'll start to calm down.

80
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,990
My dad will begin to shake his head.

81
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,200
My mom will start to sigh repeatedly.

82
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,250
But the worst will be over.

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,060
And that's when I'll bring in the clincher.

84
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,270
I'll suggest,if they don't want to help take care of the baby,

85
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,850
maybe we'll get a nanny and my mom will be like,"shirazis don't use nannies!

86
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,200
"Are you crazy?

87
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,300
Family takes care of family.

88
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,710
" And then it will be all hugs and kisses and halva from there on out.

89
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,900
I'm sorry.

90
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,020
Don't you think they're going to totally freak when they find out you're not...

91
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,870
-the biological father?
-No.

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,530
My mom was raised by her stepdad.

93
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,650
It's her favorite person in the whole world.

94
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,940
It's not going to matter to them who the sperm donor is.

95
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,190
I'm going to be habib's father.

96
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,150
I'm going to be the one to build his bassinet.

97
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,040
well,habib is a very lucky kid,despite his unfortunate name.

98
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,990
What about this?

99
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,040
Are you and liam grabbing a drink or applying for a second mortgage?

100
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,040
You're right.It's ridiculous.

101
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,320
it's just,tomorrow's our first official date,

102
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,770
and I want him to take me seriously,you know?

103
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,040
I really like this guy.

104
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,920
I mean...

105
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,210
he's smart,interesting,deep.

106
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,730
I want him to know that I have substance,too.

107
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,830
I don't want him to think I'm just someone he has sex with 

108
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,150
in the woods,or in cars,or in your bed.

109
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,890
-What?
-Laundry.

110
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,060
Oh,it's a figure of speech.

111
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,890
Maybe I can find something to wear in here.

112
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,010
So,listen,naomi,I know you're going through a difficult time...

113
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,480
'cause my dad's a pervert and the newspapers are comparing him to clarence thomas?

114
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,680
Whoever that is.

115
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,100
It's been tough.

116
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,560
Yeah,I bet it has.

117
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,320
But are you even talking to your father,

118
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,960
trying to come up with a solution to this whole living situation?

119
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,250
His solution is that I move back in with him and play the role of,

120
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,190
"the good daughter," and make nice with his skanky girlfriend.

121
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,490
My solution is that he take his solution and shove it uhis ass.

122
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,690
The only compromise we came to is that I stay here 

123
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,640
until the sexual harassment case blows over and seriously,

124
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,160
thank god you guys are letting me crash here.

125
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,100
I am so grateful.You have no idea.

126
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,850
Yeah!

127
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,400
Thank you so much,mom.

128
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,570
You're welcome.

129
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,890
Wait,could you iron this,por favor?

130
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,680
you are the best.

131
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,750
Really.

132
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,430
Oh,my god,I'm so mad right now!

133
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,580
Take it easy!

134
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,660
I can't!

135
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,350
He makes me crazy!

136
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,240
Who-who?

137
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,550
Liam!

138
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,080
He cancelled our date again.

139
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,910
-I swear,I'm going to rage out right now!
-No raging out!

140
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,060
But why did he do it?

141
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,910
Why?!

142
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,030
Did he meet someone else?

143
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,850
Or is he sick?

144
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,830
Why don't you just ask him for an explanation?

145
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,770
Yes!

146
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,590
Yes!

147
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,360
Oh,my god!

148
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,880
I love living with you.

149
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,240
Okay.

150
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,700
What do you think?

151
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,150
I think you look like you're going to catholic school 

152
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,880
come on,dixon,doesn't seeing me in this uniform make you feel a little bit better?

153
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,880
Not really.

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,840
Don't tell me you have a yeshiva fetish.

155
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,550
Okay,I will try to grow out the little curls and wear a fur hat in the summer.

156
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,980
I just think it's a little extreme.

157
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,700
Wearing fur hats in the summer?Yeah,I agree.

158
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,990
No,I'm not talking about fur hats.

159
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,740
I'm talking about catholic school.

160
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,410
I mean,you're not even catholic.

161
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:58,410
It's pretty much like any other school,with the occasional mass.

162
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,260
It's the only place that would take me mid-semester.

163
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,490
You have to understand.

164
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,610
I can't go back to west beverly.

165
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,070
I'll always be "crazy bipolar girl who made a sex tape.

166
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,470
" Silver,that's not true.

167
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,330
Everyone there kno what I did.

168
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,800
I walk in that building,people are going to stare and whisper and...

169
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,880
I just can't take that.

170
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,240
I can'T.

171
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,140
I need a fresh start.

172
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,190
And I need you to be supportive.

173
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,120
Kelly got on board.

174
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,020
Why can't you?

175
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,030
Because kelly's still going to see you every day.

176
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,450
I mean,you won't come hang out with me at the peach pit anymore.

177
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,280
And you're not going to be in school.That's all...

178
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,320
you're still going to see me all the time,I promise.

179
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,170
Can't you try to accept this?

180
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,740
For me?

181
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,520
Does the outfit come with the knee socks?

182
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,610
I'd like you all to welcome a new student who will be joining our homeroom.

183
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,820
Please introduce yourself.

184
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,790
Hi,I'm-I'm erin.

185
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,930
Erin silver.

186
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,300
And what brings you to st.Claire's,erin?

187
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,990
well...

188
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,820
uh,the academics mostly.

189
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,110
I-I hear they're really good here.

190
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:20,450
And I like what you have to offer in terms of,you know,god.

191
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,000
And morals.I'm really excited to be around people with good morals.

192
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,410
And that's pretty much it.

193
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,750
Well,we're pleased to have you.

194
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,890
Tell me,are you familiar with the catechism?

195
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,260
um,I'M...

196
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,160
no,not really.

197
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,040
Not a problem.

198
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,750
Why don't you have a seat,erin?

199
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,510
Would anyone like to help erin brush up on the...

200
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,710
Okay,angela.

201
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,490
But remember,not everyone is as pious as you are.

202
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,170
So go easy on her,okay?

203
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,220
I will,sister mary elizabeth.

204
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:52,850
All right.

205
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,590
Let's begin with our morning offering.

206
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,350
Oh,jesus,through the immaculate heart of mary,

207
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:04,860
I offer you my prayers,works,joys,and sufferings of this day.

208
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,250
Adrianna: What the hell?

209
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,520
You okay?

210
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,630
Dahlias are out of season.

211
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,830
No!

212
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,500
I'm having dinner with navid's parents tonight and dahlias are his mom's favorite flower.

213
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,470
But the only florist that has them right now is up in santa barbara.

214
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,890
Do you think I should ditch school and drive up there?

215
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,080
Um,I'm going to go with no.

216
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,420
What are you nervous about?

217
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,580
His parents are in love with you.

218
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,530
Yeah,but...

219
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,910
but what?

220
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,130
Okay.

221
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,400
I was going to wait until tomorrow to tell you this.

222
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,650
But,well,

223
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,960
navid and I are getting married.

224
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,750
What the hell?

225
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,650
Okay.Not exactly the reaction I was hoping for.

226
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,590
I'm sorry.

227
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,970
I'm just.

228
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,190
why?

229
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,900
Well,we're going to keep the baby.

230
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,210
You're going to ke bab they?

231
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,420
Yeah,I am.

232
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,050
Navid's going to raise it with me,which is why we're getting married.

233
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,490
I don't understand why you have to get married to keep the baby.

234
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,670
Or why you want to keep the baby,for that matter.

235
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,080
I'm keeping the baby because it's my baby.

236
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,560
I want to raise it and I didn't think it was possible before,

237
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,580
but now,because of navid,it is.

238
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,160
I want to be with him for the rest of my life.

239
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,720
And he wants to do this with me.

240
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,010
He's so amazing.

241
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,570
Yeah,he'd have to be pretty amazing to be okay with raising ty's baby.

242
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,530
Oh,he still thinks the dad's some guy from rehab?Ade!

243
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,240
You know,it didn't seem that important when I was set on adoption.

244
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,770
If you can't be honest with navid,do you really think you should be marrying him?

245
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,960
It's complicated.

246
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,690
It's not.

247
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,850
You're afraid if you tell him the truth,your perfect little marriage fantasy will end.

248
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,780
Look,don't judge me.

249
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,670
If you love him,you need to tell him.

253
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,390
what's that I smell?

254
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,740
Are we,perchance,having salmon for dinner?

255
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,500
We are.

256
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,740
Three times this week.

257
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,750
You guys take that omega-3 propaganda seriously,huh?

258
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,250
No,mom makes salmon because she knows how much I like it.

259
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,310
Maybe you should think about what the other family members might want.

260
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,450
: Kobe beef.

261
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,640
: Just kidding.

262
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,870
Filet's fine.

263
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,930
So,how was your first day without sier?

264
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,770
Well,it...

265
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,730
oh,poor dixie.

266
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,070
He's bumming hardcore.

267
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,000
Long distance relationships blow.

268
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,580
Stop calling me dixie.

269
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,740
And,uh,yeah,they do blow.

270
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,880
You're not in a long-distance relationship,dixie...

271
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,680
dixon.

272
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,310
Silver's just going to another school.

273
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,120
You'll have to put in a little extra effort.

274
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,220
Yeah,I guess you're right.

275
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,820
Got a feeling it's not gonna work.

276
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,500
Hey,there,easy on the pepper,mama.

277
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,360
So what do you kids have planned for the rest of the day?

278
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,610
You're not gonna stand around watching me cook,are you?

279
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,770
I'm going to the gyno.

280
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,860
Aw,geez,naomi!

281
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,890
What?

282
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,190
It's time for my pap.

283
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,480
Oh,hey,annie,you know about hpv,right?

284
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,960
'Cause it doesn't matter if you have your little v card,

285
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,560
all it takes is some genital contact...

286
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,520
-naomi!
-Please?

287
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,400
What?

288
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,200
-Ask me how I know that.
-It's okay,really.

289
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,880
Super hot gyno.He talks,I listen.

290
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,620
Anyways,I'm off.

291
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,490
Have fun.

292
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,810
Oh,believe me,I will.

293
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,200
So,salmon,huh?Yum.

294
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,660
Dixon,where are you going?

295
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,020
Um,not really hungry anymore.

296
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,920
Okay,the catechism is arranged into four principle parts.

297
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,680
I'm assuming you know the lord's prayer?

298
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,230
Not a problem.We'll go over it.

299
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,400
Cool.Thanks.

300
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,050
Of course.My pleasure.

301
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,930
So,you went to west beverly,right?

302
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,490
Well,I know what you meant by wanting to be around people with better morals.

303
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,450
I don't know how you survived west beverly.

304
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,860
It's like sodom and gomorrah over there with...

305
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:59,510
with all the sex and drugs,so much money and excess,and no moral compass.

306
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,440
Sometimes I'll see those west beverly kids at the movies,

307
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,120
and they'll buy a medium soda and then just keep going back for refills.

308
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,370
And it's not like they got the jumbo which comes with free refills,you know?

309
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,700
And they could totally afford the jumbo.

310
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,450
Yeah,um,that's why I left.

311
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,620
Things like the soda stuff.

312
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,970
Should we get back to the catechism,though?

313
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,930
'Cause I just have so much to learn.

314
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,910
Of course.

315
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,070
Now,I know this can be overwhelming.

316
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,510
Try not to think of it as work,okay?

317
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,090
Think of religion as like...

318
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,150
the best extracurricular activity ever.

319
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,330
Okay.

320
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,990
Decided to do a little shopping after the gyno.

321
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,740
What do you think?

322
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,230
So cute!

323
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,560
Good,it's for you.

324
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,600
Try it on.

325
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,840
What?Why?

326
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,660
So I can see if it fits.Go.Shoo.

327
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,320
Yeah,I know,but why did you buy me a gift?

328
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,570
To thank you.

329
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,750
That advice you gave me about confronting liam,ask him why he canceled?

330
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,950
Genius.

331
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,300
He told me the reason.

332
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,180
We came up with a solution,and voila,we're back on for tonight.

333
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,110
And so why did he cancel?

334
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,090
Oh,his cousin came up from san diego.He had to hang with him.

335
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,430
-Does it fit?
-Perfectly.

336
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,870
I just need help with the zipper.

337
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,070
Wow,it oks amazing on you.

338
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,980
Try these on with it.

339
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,060
You got me shoes,too?What,naomi?

340
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,720
Put them on.

341
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,380
so are you gonna hang out with this cousin,too?

342
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,550
Yeah,we're gonna do the double date thing.

343
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,450
With who?

344
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,760
Well,seeing as you're already dressed...

345
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,890
naomi,I hate blind dates.

346
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,640
Please?!

347
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,090
You know how important tonight is to me.

348
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,950
Okay,I'll go.

349
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,510
uh,hey,so thanks again for everything today,and I'll see you tomorrow.

350
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,460
All right,have a good night.

351
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,400
You,too.

352
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,270
Hey,what are you doing here?

353
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,050
I called kels and I told her I was gonna pick you up.So,

354
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:03,440
okay,well,um,let's,let's go,all right?

355
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,350
Everything all right?

356
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,640
You shouldn't have come.

357
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,170
I'm trying to keep a low profile.

358
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,280
I wasn't exactly making a scene.

359
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,870
I know,I just,I don't need people here knowing things about me.

360
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,880
I told you,I'm trying to make a fresh start.

361
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,920
So that means you can't have a boyfriend?

362
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,270
No...

363
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,200
I just...

364
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,530
I want to keep my personal life separate from school,okay?

365
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,240
So what does that mean for us?

366
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:36,000
I mean,you don't want to go anywhere we might run into anyone from west bev; 

367
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,810
you don't want me near st.Clare's; 

368
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,380
so where does that leave us to hang out?

369
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,530
I don't know my house,your house.

370
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,720
Are you serious?

371
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,900
Look,this is just what I need right now,okay?

372
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,410
Hello,navid.

373
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,740
Thanks,jackie.

374
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,490
It's gonna be okay.

375
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,410
hi,guys.

376
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,200
Hey,you two!

377
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,150
Adrianna,we are so glad you're having dinner with us tonight.

378
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:19,360
We keep telling navid to bring you by,but you know how he is,so private.

379
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,010
well,thank you so much for having me.

380
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,570
These are for you.

381
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,520
Oh,I love peonies.

382
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,270
That's so thoughtful.Thank you.

383
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,960
: It's gonna be okay.

384
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,640
So,how have you been?

385
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,810
Well,

386
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,040
this is an outrage.This is just outrageous.

387
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,650
Look, I know, I know this is a shock,

388
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,890
but we're in love, and,we're getting married.

389
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,000
Married?!

390
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,050
16 and you're having a baby?!

391
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,700
This is an outrage!

392
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,390
-I knew it!
-I try to be a good mother!

393
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,020
I knew we should have never moved to america!

394
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,900
-I knew it was a mistake!
-What did I do wrong?!

395
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,030
Mom,dad,we came to you because we have a plan and we want you to be a part of it.

396
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,850
You have a plan?

397
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,480
What kind of plan could you possibly have?!

398
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,540
We thought we could live in the guest house.

399
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,510
We still want to finish high school and go to college.

400
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,420
Of course,we'll,we'll maybe have to hire some help.

401
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,620
Maybe we'll get a nanny?

402
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,260
Our family doesn't use nannies!

403
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,090
are you nuts in the head?!

404
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,340
your cousin ravi will watch the baby two days a week.

405
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,090
I'll take care of the others.

406
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,580
Family takes care of family.

407
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,700
Thanks,mom.

408
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,610
What did you expect?

409
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,470
This baby's blood.

410
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,780
Uh,just so you know not at this matters but,um,

411
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,200
the baby isn't,you know,technically your blood.

412
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,000
What-what do you mean?

413
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,380
Whats "technical" here?

414
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,370
Just that it's not my baby biologically,but you know,I don't even care,so.

415
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,980
you mean you didn't get her pregnant?

416
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,230
Well,no,not technically.

417
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,540
Um,but that's not the point.

418
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,340
The father's out of the picture and I'm here,

419
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,570
so I want to raise the baby as if...

420
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,970
what are you talking about?!Mom was raised by her stepdad!

421
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,910
end of story.

422
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,240
-But dad,you don't 
-end of story!

423
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,450
Hey,you two.

424
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,600
I'm naomi.

425
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,610
You probably heard a lot about me.

426
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,660
This is annie.

427
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,460
Annie,this is liam.

428
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,340
I'm bru-dog.What up?

429
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,380
Sorry?

430
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,460
Bru-dog.

431
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,100
Old surf name that stuck.

432
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,190
And you are a hottie,annie-dog.

433
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,910
so,this is where you woo the ladies.

434
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,510
Don't do too much wooing...

435
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,540
unless the ladies insist on being wooed.

436
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,290
well,it's a cute place.

437
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,300
Two-dollar beers.

438
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,640
What's better than that?

439
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,940
One-dollar beers.

440
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,270
so how was your day?

441
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,530
Not bad.

442
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,220
You know,I was actually thinking about bung a new car.

443
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,700
Maybe you could advise me.

444
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,280
Didn't you just get a new car?

445
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,840
So,what kind of car were you thinking?

446
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,540
I want a hybrid.

447
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,870
I'm pretty pro-environment.

448
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,280
Maybe you could get a bike then.

449
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,370
Are you kidding?

450
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,070
I can't tell if you're kidding.

451
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,330
I'm kidding.

452
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,440
right,yeah,funny.Me on a bike.

453
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Ah,nancy sutley would be into it.

454
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,400
Totally,yeah,I know.

455
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,960
You know what?I am going to run to the little girls' room.

456
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,920
Remind me to give you my nancy sutley story when I get back.

457
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,990
Another one coming up.

458
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,770
You got someplace to be?

459
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,380
oh,no.

460
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,370
This is fun.

461
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,440
You don't like me,do you?

462
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,820
Oh,no,I like you just fine.

463
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,530
Don't lie.

464
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,790
Honestly,people who grunt one-word answers aren't really my cup of tea.

465
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,670
But whatever floats your boat.

466
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,560
Okay,look,I have a confession.

467
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:42,320
I'm pretty shy around strangers because,when I was a kid,we moved around a lot.

468
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:49,970
I was always meeting new people,and they would mock me and...

469
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,870
make me feel insecure.

470
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,410
I understand.

471
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,080
I am probably bringing my own baggage to this.

472
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,350
See,I once dated this guy named carl-dog,

473
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,930
d anhe had this cousin who was a real ass,you know?

474
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,100
He would try to screw with people and make them feel uncomfortable.

475
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,180
I guess it was just to make himself feel better.

476
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:12,470
Really quite pitiful andvery traumatic for me.

477
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,220
naomi: Well,I'm back.

478
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,340
What were we talking about?

479
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,010
Oh,yeah,nancy sutley.

480
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,140
Good choice for obama.

481
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,600
She's such an expert on california's water and air problems. 

482
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,270
Good point.

483
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,830
Hey,look,sorry I was being short earlier.

484
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,010
I was just getting my bearings.

485
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,290
So how was your day?

486
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,340
Good.

487
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,640
Not bad.I mean,I was completely consumed with this novel.

488
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,710
I was almost late coming here.

489
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,480
I just threw on whatever and dashed out the door.

490
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,830
Well,"whatever" looks good on you.

491
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,620
Brewskis from the bru-dog.

492
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,870
navid: They're gonna come around.

493
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,360
I don't know.

494
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,480
They will.

495
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,070
They have to.

496
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,840
I...

497
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:09,950
soad.

498
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,180
much fun with you today.

499
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,550
Bru-dog: And next,I'm gonna hit oaxaca.

500
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,540
They're running rad double overheads with barrels big enough to drive a truck through.

501
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,290
That'S...

502
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,700
that's just rad.

503
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,190
Naomi,time to go home.

504
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,040
Right.

505
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,690
Heel,boy.

506
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,870
Later.

507
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,430
Bye,guys.

508
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,390
Hey,so,

509
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,720
you were right.

510
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,750
I was being a jerk earlier.

511
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,490
not gonna argue.

512
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,020
Come on.

513
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,500
Can't you give me another shot?

514
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,040
Fine.

515
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,880
I will give you another shot.

516
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,010
Over dinner next week?

517
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,200
Just the two of us.

518
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,310
you cannot marry adrianna and raise the child.

519
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,810
Not in our guest house,not with our support.

520
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,940
That is so hypocritical.

521
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,410
Our family is full of step-kids.

522
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,890
Honey, you're 16.

523
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,280
I know the timing's not perfect...

524
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,080
d, inavit's not up for discussion.

525
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,420
Our decision is final.

526
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,130
This doesn't mean that your relationship will end.

527
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,140
You can still date adrianna.

528
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,540
Just because you're not getting married,

529
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,890
doesn't mean that you'll break up.

530
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,680
I know this is hard.

531
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,710
Your heart's in the right place, navid.

532
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,450
Adrianna will understand.

533
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,850
I'm just saying that if you end up with bru-dog and I end up with liam,

534
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,240
we'll be cousins-in-law.

535
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,950
I am not ending up with bru-dog.

536
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,820
You never know,annie-dog.

537
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:49,870
you know,I'm beginning to think

538
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,090
that liam is really taking me seriously.

539
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,390
Going on an actual date is a really big step forward in our relationship.

540
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,840
Um,look,uh,I have to tell you something,

541
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,830
and I know that it's really going to upset you,

542
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:07,540
but we said that we would be honest with each other,so...

543
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,980
liam asked me out.

544
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,340
What?

545
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,910
Yeah,um,when we were saying good-bye.

546
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,240
It came completely out of the blue.

547
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,810
Well,you musthave misunderstood.

548
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,210
Yeah,but I didn'T.

549
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,430
What did you say?

550
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,210
Nothing.

551
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,730
I-I just left.

552
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,750
I would never do that to you.

553
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,610
Not never.

554
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,130
Never again.

555
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,470
The guy's a jerk,naomi.

556
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,670
Well,thank you for telling me.

557
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,890
I appreciate it.

558
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,570
I'm sorry.

559
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,960
I know how much you like him.

560
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,660
It happens.

561
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,950
Can I just get a little privacy tonight?

562
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,130
Yeah,sure,of course.

563
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,580
I'll find somewhere else to sleep.

564
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,450
Like my grandma's bed or something.

565
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,100
Thanks.

566
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,080
Hey,stop that.

567
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,880
I'm doing the dishes,and you're just making them dirty again.

568
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,910
How am iupposed to eat?

569
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,080
Debbie: You're not.We already ate.

570
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,510
Guys,can we keep it down a little bit?

571
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,880
I'm doing my homework over here.

572
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,340
Why don't you go upstairs and work in your room?

573
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,670
Naomi's upstairs.

574
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,870
She'll try to teach me how to french braid her hair...

575
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,720
no,no,sorry.

576
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,990
Annie: Hey,mom,do we have any extra blankets?

577
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,410
Grandma's room is drafty and I'm sleeping there tonight.

578
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,300
-Why?
-It's no big deal.

579
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,710
Na omi just had a really tough night and she needs some privacy.

580
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,450
Annie...

581
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,150
what?I said it was no big deal.

582
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,270
Look,sweetheart,we know you want to help her out.

583
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,400
Yeah,I do.

584
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,490
She's going through a really hard ti.

585
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,440
Harry: And we're sympathetic.But her living here...

586
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,850
just not a long-term solution.

587
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,600
Amen!

588
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,670
What?What?

589
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,460
You remember those jeans of mine that she didn't like?

590
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,760
She cut them up.

591
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,350
Into a million pieces.

592
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,700
That's not normal behavior.

593
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,140
Yeah,well,she probably thought that she was doing you a favor.

594
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,350
She threw away my frozen salmon and filled the fridg with kobe beef.

595
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,160
So let's try the kobe,see what all the fuss is about.

596
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,620
What about the whole "principal boxer-shorts" nickname?

597
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,240
You should have worn a robe!

598
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,380
In my own bedroom?

599
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,920
She was looking for toothpaste.

600
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,350
Come on,you guys,where is your compassion?

601
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,410
She has nowhere else to go.

602
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,390
Debbie: I know that,honey.

603
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,500
And we're not saying we're going to kick her out right away.

604
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,190
We're not?

605
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:32,460
Debbie: No,but we have to figure out a solution for her sake as well as ours.

606
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,120
Okay.

607
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,870
So when is she leaving?

608
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,730
Shut it,dixie.

609
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,850
Liam,did you do it?

610
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,330
Did you ask annie out?

611
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,810
Yeah,I did.

612
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,810
What were you thinking?

613
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,600
She's my friend.She'd never go out with you.

614
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,620
Lo ok,that's who I am,naomi.

615
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,660
A huge douche bag?

616
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,870
Basically.

617
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,340
I don't do the whole boyfriend thing.

618
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,840
Which is why you should get out now.

619
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,900
what?

620
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:13,910
Nothing.

621
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,050
why don't you let me take care of myself.

622
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,610
Who knows maybe I have a little thing for jerks.

623
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,200
Hey,erin.

624
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,850
It's funny you looked familiar to me yesterday,but I couldn'tquite place you.

625
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,220
And then,when I saw you with your boyfriend,it all came together.

626
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,160
You're the whore from the video.

627
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,070
Oh,no,please,don't take any offense to that.

628
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,280
I didn't mean it in a derogatory way at all.

629
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,420
You know,some people think that mary magdalene was a whore,

630
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,600
and she was one of jesus's best friends.

631
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,790
People can repent,erin; they can.

632
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,750
Okay.

633
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,300
Well...thanks.

634
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:02,750
You know,I was so shocked when someone forwarded me the videoast month.

635
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,740
You'd think catholic school people would be above that sort of thing,

636
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,600
but they're always forwarding me things just trying to get my goat.

637
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:15,240
Of course,I turned it off when you and your boyfriend began to fornicate.

638
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,740
Erin...

639
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,150
why did you really come to catholic school?

640
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,950
Well...

641
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,640
I made that video during a difficult period.

642
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,840
And afterwards,I just wanted a fresh start.

643
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,550
That's totally understandable.

644
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,090
Thank you.

645
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,210
And now I know why god brought us together.

646
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,720
I am going to help you save your soul.

647
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:46,130
First step: You have to tell everyone about your checkered past.

648
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,710
Okay,yeah,actually,that'S...

649
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,910
I really would rather not.

650
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,710
No,I know you don't want to,but I guarantee you'll feel better if you come clean.

651
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,280
Pretending to be someone that you're not it's basically lying.

652
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,740
And god knows,because god is everywhere.

653
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,550
Okay,well,I'll think about it.

654
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,970
Lies separate us from our relationship with god.

655
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,510
And,erin,I care about you.

656
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,340
You know what?

657
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,130
I'm going to fast.

658
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,410
What?

659
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,340
I won't eat.

660
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,500
And I will pray every minute of every day until you come out of hiding 

661
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,870
and admit who you are and what you've done.

662
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,770
Okay,that is a little bit extreme.

663
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,210
I know it is,and the nuns,they may say I'm overzealous,

664
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:34,910
but I feel anything I can do to help you get to heaven...

665
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,400
oh,I have to do it.

666
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,580
Silver: It's your fault.

667
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,560
She knows,and it's your fault.

668
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,480
Well,hold on,wait.

669
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,290
Slow down.

670
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,840
Who knows?What are you talking about?

671
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,900
Angela.

672
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,070
She knows about the movie.

673
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,230
She saw it online last month,but she didn't put it together.

674
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,540
Except then,she saw you yesterday,and now she knows that it was me...

675
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,730
all right,silver,relax,calm down,all right?

676
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,450
Are you having another manic episode?

677
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,240
No!

678
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,120
I'm allowed to have a bad day,okay?!

679
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,150
I'm allowed to be upset that a video of me having sex went viral!

680
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:04,830
I'm sorry.

681
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,610
I know.

682
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,070
I just wanted a fresh start,

683
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,730
and now that's ruined because angela knows about the movie and she's fasting.

684
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,130
Wait,hold on.What?

685
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,160
She says that she's not going to eat again until I come out of hiding,

686
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,180
and I tell everyone about my "checkered past.

687
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,380
" Because that's going to bring me inner peace.

688
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,100
Really?

689
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,740
Yes.It's ridiculous.

690
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,470
Not that ridiculous.

691
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,880
What?

692
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:33,050
Well,the fasting stuff is,obviously,but 

693
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,730
the stuff about how you have to stop hiding it's what you've been doing,silver.

694
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,140
You're working so hard to keep this whole thing a secret.

695
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,420
Oh,I'm sorry.

696
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,510
What do you want me to do,send out some mass e-mail telling everyone,

697
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,420
"hey,I made a sex video because I'm bipolar"?

698
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,710
I'm not telling you to send out an e-mail.

699
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,900
But you're going to have to do something to stop this girl from fasting.

700
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:53,760
Right?

701
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,940
No.

702
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,940
You're just going to let her keep going?

703
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,570
I'm not in charge of her.

704
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,630
there's no end to what you'll do to avoid dealing with this.

705
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,280
But you know what,I'm not even surprised.

706
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,860
You already transferred schools.

707
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,500
You're afraid to leave the house.

708
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,650
You don't know what it's like.

709
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,710
I don't?

710
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,120
I have newfor you.

711
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,760
I was in that movie,too.

712
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,640
Only,instead of hiding,I dealt with all the whispering and all the looks.

713
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,140
Which wasn't easy,by the way,but I did it.

714
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,940
And you're going to have to figure out how to do that,too,

715
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,110
if you're ever going to move on.

716
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,230
I'm not surprised, navid.

717
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,820
I mean, weere asking a lot from your parents.

718
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,960
I'll just... I'll figure something else out.

719
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,090
what are you doing?

720
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,580
-I chose you.
-What?!

721
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,920
Navid,they're your family.

722
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,580
They're not going to opyou're all that I want,and...

723
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,230
wait,wait,this is not how it's supposed to go.

724
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,870
How what's supposed to go?

725
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,350
Well,our proposal was such a non-proposal,you know?

726
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:17,120
So I was going to get my great-grandmother's ring after we told my parents.

727
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,920
But plans changed,so this is from a pawnshop.

728
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,980
I've loved you since the first time I saw you in e second grade.

729
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,390
You had this ponytail,and all I ever wanted to do was pull it.

730
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,220
and when you got the fifth grade,and you got your braces...

731
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,440
oh,wow,let me just say,my heart stopped.

732
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,920
But that's nothing compared to our first kiss.

733
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:45,380
Which is bigger than the ponytail and the braces combined.

734
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,840
I believe in us,ade.

735
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,940
I can't imagine loving anyone else as much as I love you.

736
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,980
Or feeling as close as...

737
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,430
as I feel with you.

738
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:58,280
I want to spend the rest of my life with you,ade.

739
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,780
And the rest of habib's life.

740
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,350
so,adrianna tate-duncan...

741
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,000
will you please marry me?

742
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,120
I want to.

743
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,120
I love you so much.

744
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,460
But,

745
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,440
could you...?

746
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,760
I have to tell you something first.

747
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:37,270
And I know that this might change everything.

748
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,470
And you might not want to marry me.

749
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:44,830
But I have to tell you,because you're giving up so much and...

750
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,740
and you deserve the truth.

751
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,370
Ade...

752
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,660
what are you talking about?

753
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,590
The father of the baby...

754
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,560
isn't a guy from rehab.

755
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,390
It's ty.

756
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,790
no,I-I-I I can't believe it.

757
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,000
I-I was so scared.

758
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,140
I thought that if I told you,you would just leave.

759
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,710
No,y-you lied to me the whole time!

760
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,640
I just,I...

761
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,350
I've been walking around west beverly,talking to that guy.

762
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,860
You know,every time I pick you up from play practice,I'm like,"hey,ty,what's up?

763
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,070
" Like a fool!

764
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,900
Who else knows?

765
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,500
Just-just ms. Taylor and naomi.

766
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,500
Naomi knew?

767
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,550
I've given up everything for you,ade.Everything!My family...

768
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,150
-I know!-No,it's the fact that you could lie to me to my...

769
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,300
I know!I am so sorry,okay?!

770
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,250
I don't know what to say except that I messed up.

771
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,290
Which I used to do a lot of.

772
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,280
And now I do a lot less because you make me a better person.

773
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,940
Okay,but I-I still mess up sometimes.

774
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,730
And yes,this was a big one,okay?

775
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,380
And there really is no "and" except I am so sorry!

776
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,410
I'm sorry!

777
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,270
I told you I want to spend the rest of my life with you,ade...

778
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:40,370
so don't ever lie to me again.

779
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,740
And put this on your finger...

780
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,540
and don't you ever take it off again.

781
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,730
Okay?

782
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,110
Okay.

783
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,630
Okay.

784
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,880
Okay.

785
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,490
-I love you so much.
-I love you so much.

786
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,780
Naomi: And I don't know why mrs. Jackson was so upset.

787
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,060
I was very discrete when I gave her the number for my waxer.

788
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,640
It's not like I said,"you got a moustache,get it fixed.

789
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,920
" Yeah,I guess some people are just ultra sensitive about that kind of thing.

790
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,440
Sometimes school is just too much.

791
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,160
Oh,liam doesn't like you,by the way.

792
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,340
What?

793
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:20,320
Oh,he's gun-shy about relationships; he's freaking out 'cause he's so into me.

794
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,960
Classic self-sabotage stuff.

795
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,910
He admitted that?

796
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,730
Oh,he didn't have to; it was obvious.

797
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,360
Psychology 101.

798
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,260
all right,well,honestly,naomi,I think he might just be a creep.

799
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,870
I know that's what he wants me to think,but I'm onto him.

800
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,480
Okay.

801
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,610
Just be careful.

802
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,450
He's the one who should be careful.

803
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:42,270
He doesn't think he's boyfriend material,but he's gonna be my boyfriend sooner or later.

804
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,090
Jen!

805
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,960
Darling!

806
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,260
annie: Who's this?

807
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,140
This is my sister!

808
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,010
This is jen!

809
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,250
well,don't just stand there.Grab some glasses.

810
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,940
-okay.
- Come on.

811
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,660
Let's have a toast.

812
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,750
: I'm baaack.

813
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,940
Jen: The whole thing was so last minute.

814
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,650
Naomi left me this frantic message about our father,so...

815
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,650
I immediately hopped in a friend's private jet and voil?

816
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,550
here I am to rescue her from bourgeois hell.

817
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,720
Naomi: I know we all wish I could stay here forever,but it's just not practical.

818
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,700
We totally understand.

819
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,480
Totally.

820
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,330
Actually,we don't smoke in here.

821
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,070
Me neither.

822
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,080
Cigarettes are for losers.

823
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,380
I quit.

824
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:43,470
Thank you for helping naomi cope with this dionysian debacle that is our father.

825
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,470
I'll take it from here.

826
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,400
Come.

827
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,890
I have a town car outside and a hillside bungalow at the chateau marmont that'll do 

828
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,050
until we can find more permanent accommodations.

829
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,320
Ciao.

830
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,260
Can you help with my...

831
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,100
-getting your stuff.
-coming right up,

832
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,740
well,I'm gonna miss you around here,you know.

833
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:02,940
Yeah,I do.

834
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,460
oh,hey,one thing.

835
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:08,740
If you guys ever do a remodel around here,you might think about fixing the air ducts.

836
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,160
Sound really travels.

837
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,500
Trust me,someday dixon will be grateful that I cut up those awful jeans of his.

838
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,760
God,you heard?

839
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,210
Is that why you called your sister?

840
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:25,300
Well,I can't live with you guys forever,plus I needed help with my debacle of a dad.

841
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,210
and I was starting to get mercury poisoning from your mom's salmon fetish.

842
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,940
Santa monica high school has a teen parenting program.

843
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,440
I could apply to go to school there.

844
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,790
They have a day care on site.

845
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,060
That sounds perfect.

846
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,440
Oh,and I was thinking about getting a job at the peach pit.

847
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,430
perfect.

848
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,990
Okay.Anything you don't want,throw out.

849
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,890
We're gonna have to clean out that guest room to make room for the kid.

850
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,130
And you better be getting a job.

851
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,030
You are not living here rent-free,that's for sure.

852
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,720
I wouldn't dream of it,ma'am.

853
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:58,260
Adrianna: Who knew she'd be the parent that came through for us,huh?

854
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,630
Oh,I'M...

855
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,490
I'm sorry.I didn't mean it like that.

856
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,280
No,it's okay.

857
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,290
I mean,it's true,right?

858
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,920
Damn,who knew bassinets were so complicated?

859
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,820
Navid,are you sure that you're okay?

860
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,390
I'm positive.

861
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,270
All I need is you.

862
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,820
And maybe a handyman to help me build this thing.

863
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:37,510
angela,would you like to solve for x?

864
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,120
No pulse.

865
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,540
Angela is dead.

866
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,720
She died for your sins,erin.

867
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,800
All : She died for your sins.

868
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,710
She died for your sins.

869
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,010
She died for your sins.

870
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,490
"bipolar.

871
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,180
" Which means...

872
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,080
Apparently that you're a sex maniac.

873
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,480
Why'd she send this e-mail?

874
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,940
Still crazy,I guess.

875
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,450
Speak of the devil.

876
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,900
There's the slut.

877
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,250
Angela: Erin!

878
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,730
Oh,I'm so proud of you.

879
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,430
You did it.You came clean.

880
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,670
And quickly,too.

881
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,760
I mean,it took me five days of fasting 

882
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,780
before deb murphy admitted to cheating in earth science.

883
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,380
My stomach was growling like a grizzly bear.

884
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,850
Anyway,I'm just thrilled to the gills.

885
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,790
You must feel like a huge weight has been lifted.

886
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:09,220
Actually,what I feel is humiliated and ashamed and sad.

887
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,400
You wanted me to get into heaven?

888
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:14,960
Well,thanks to your extortion,I feel like I'm in hell.

889
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,940
So,does west bev look different?

890
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,380
Sadly,no.

891
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,510
not at all.

892
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,910
Mr. Matthews,wait.

893
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,380
This is my sister jen.

894
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:33,580
This is the awesome english teacher I always rave about.

895
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,030
Nice try,but,uh,you're not getting an extension on that paper.

896
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,220
Hey,jen.

897
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:43,130
So you're the reason my little sister ends so many sentences with dangling prepositions.

898
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,350
About what are you talking?

899
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,950
grammar jokes.

900
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,300
Hilarious.

901
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,360
Right.Well,I got to get to class.

902
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,350
You coming,naomi?

903
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,940
If you insist.

904
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,360
See you around.

905
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,570
It was nice to meet you.

906
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,620
So I'll pick you up at 3:00.

907
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,640
My friend's docking his yacht in the marina,so we'll grab an after-school drink.

908
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,930
Sounds perfect.

909
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,690
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

910
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,130
Ethan!

911
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,730
Jen.

912
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,070
You're back.

913
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,670
I sure am.

914
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,940
How long are you staying?

915
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,880
We'll see.

916
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,240
don't worry.

917
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:32,590
I'll never tell naomi that I was your first.
