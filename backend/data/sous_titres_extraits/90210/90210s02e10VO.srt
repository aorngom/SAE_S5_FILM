1
00:00:00,854 --> 00:00:02,866
I will be going
to California University.

2
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:06,256
- CU isn't going to happen.
- You're going to focus on the SAT's?

3
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:08,169
No, I'm gonna date the dean's son.

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:09,568
Are you Richard?

5
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:11,381
I'm Jamie, by the way.

6
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:13,403
- There you are.
- Jamie, this is...

7
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:14,759
My roommate Richard.

8
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:17,110
I wish you weren't dating
Richard because...

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,015
- I really want to kiss you.
- You can go home, Marilyn.

10
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:21,558
My date's arrived.

11
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,853
I want the same stuff
I got last time.

12
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:29,941
Navid Shirazi told me
that you were a drug dealer.

13
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:32,277
What?
I am not a drug dealer,

14
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:35,947
but if I was, I wouldn't be the kind
of guy you want to mess with, would I?

15
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,648
I love you.
And I want my first time to be with you.

16
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:42,537
Time to wake up.

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,467
I need an ambulance.

18
00:00:52,213 --> 00:00:54,046
- What do we have?
- 60-year-old female

19
00:00:54,216 --> 00:00:55,690
found unconscious in her home.

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,595
Status:post cardiac arrest.
BP's 110/70.

21
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:00,880
- Medications?
- One milligram of epinephrine.

22
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,891
- She's on Bactrim and Gabapentin.
- Where are you taking her?!

23
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,561
Wait in the lobby.
We'll find you when there's news.

24
00:01:15,788 --> 00:01:18,139
- I was texting you.
- Good. Me first.

25
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:21,104
I am here to rescue your little
news broadcast thingy.

26
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:22,369
I'm going to join.

27
00:01:23,463 --> 00:01:26,331
Come on, I just want to pad
my resume with some extracurriculars.

28
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:29,604
You're just going to flake
whenever there's any actual work to do.

29
00:01:29,774 --> 00:01:32,073
Please, Navid,
I really have to get into CU.

30
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:34,623
Please, please.
Pretty please.

31
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:37,342
- I'm gonna keep on until you say yes...
- All right, fine.

32
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:39,309
My segment's going to be called:

33
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,055
- You're not getting one.
- Clark After Dark.

34
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:44,349
I'll give people sex advice.

35
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:49,813
I'm getting new high-def video mixers,
and you can help me unpack those.

36
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:52,725
Ex-squee me?

37
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:56,001
I you're serious about the Blaze,
you can meet tomorrow by 6:00.

38
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:57,242
Can I talk now?

39
00:01:59,384 --> 00:02:02,403
I have something very
important to tell you.

40
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,374
This better not be
some hazing ritual.

41
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:06,128
It's about Adrianna.

42
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:08,561
I think she's back on drugs.

43
00:02:11,177 --> 00:02:12,209
What?

44
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:14,376
Of course I'm not on drugs.

45
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:17,285
I've been clean for
so long, you know that.

46
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,136
Why would Navid say it?

47
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:22,488
I don't know.

48
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:25,265
Things have been
pretty bad with us lately.

49
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:28,435
Maybe he's mad because
I've moved on since the breakup.

50
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:31,602
You have to believe me, I'm clean.

51
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,964
I want to believe you, I really do,

52
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:39,112
but you've lied to me
about this before.

53
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:41,948
I'm not lying now.

54
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,786
Do you remember what
I was like when I was on coke?

55
00:02:48,756 --> 00:02:51,147
Am I acting anything
like that right now?

56
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:56,884
- You're not.
- Exactly.

57
00:02:57,512 --> 00:03:00,592
I'm going to talk to Navid and
I'm going to get to the bottom of it.

58
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:15,815
- How is she? Is she okay?
- I don't know.

59
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:19,784
When I woke up this morning,
she wasn't breathing,

60
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:21,377
so I called 911.

61
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:23,037
She was in cardiac arrest.

62
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:26,007
But they gave her CPR and
her heart started beating again,

63
00:03:26,177 --> 00:03:28,036
but she's been in there
for over an hour.

64
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,163
Everything's going to be okay.

65
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:31,509
It's not!

66
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,500
You don't know how sick she's been.

67
00:03:35,578 --> 00:03:37,633
I know that she has cancer, but...

68
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:41,076
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

69
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:43,718
Thank you for being so patient.

70
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:45,637
Are you a relative?

71
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:48,420
We're her daughters.

72
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,484
Your mother suffered
a cardiac arrest.

73
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:53,443
And I'm afraid with
the chemotherapy treatments,

74
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:56,981
She's too weak to fight much longer.

75
00:03:59,577 --> 00:04:01,820
She's conscious. It would be
a good time to see her.

76
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:14,374
Aren't you coming?

77
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:18,002
I can't.

78
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,747
Just go.
I'm sure she'll be happy to see you.

79
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:23,591
Is anybody coming?

80
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,199
I am.

81
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:39,936
- Morning, Dixon.
- I'm getting a ride from Liam.

82
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:41,763
Do you want any breakfast?

83
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:45,502
He'll get over it sooner or later.

84
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:47,785
- Morning.
- Morning.

85
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,536
- You're in a good mood.
- Things are good.

86
00:04:51,796 --> 00:04:54,289
- Can we get some details?
- Dirty deets, as the kids say?

87
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:58,026
- Seriously, Dad?
- Regular details would be just fine.

88
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:00,461
I've kind of been seeing someone.

89
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:02,213
Who's the lucky guy?

90
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:03,790
His name is Jasper.

91
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,967
- Does he go to West Bev?
- Yes.

92
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:08,469
- What's he like?
- He's amazing.

93
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:11,804
He's a filmmaker,
but more like a genius.

94
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:15,143
I will check his transcripts
just to be sure.

95
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:17,228
Can we meet him sometime?

96
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:21,733
Actually, I was hoping that
maybe he could come over for dinner?

97
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:25,028
Sure. That's a great idea.
How about tomorrow night?

98
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:27,500
- Perfect.
- Shouldn't you be getting to school?

99
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,115
First period.
Study hall.

100
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,903
It's Friday, remember?

101
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:34,219
- Dirty deets?
- That's what they say.

102
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:36,187
I can't believe
she's seeing someone.

103
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:38,750
I can't believe she's
actually telling us about it.

104
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:44,172
How did it go?

105
00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:47,217
You're coming over tomorrow night.

106
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,603
Do you think Jasper would like Chicken
Tarragon or Mahi Mahi for dinner?

107
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,410
- Mahi Mahi.
- You got it.

108
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,092
I can't wait.

109
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:06,365
Mahi Mahi?

110
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,615
Should I come in
through the window for dinner,

111
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:12,575
or should I use the front door?

112
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:22,543

Season 02 episode 10
<i>To Thine Own Self Be True</i>

114
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:37,678
Ivy's mom has
a recording studio, right?

115
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:40,674
You finally gonna make
an album as DJ Mr. Big Dix?

116
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,424
It's D-I-X.

117
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:46,695
Anyway, what I was trying to say

118
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,431
was maybe we could use it

119
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:51,280
to bring down Naomi's sister.

120
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:57,158
All we have to do is
get Ivy to say exactly

121
00:06:57,328 --> 00:07:00,157
what Jen said in that recording
that you deleted.

122
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:03,584
Mix it down so it sounds like Jen...

123
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:06,921
Let Naomi hear it.

124
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:10,183
I know you're just trying
to help and everything, but...

125
00:07:10,353 --> 00:07:12,792
Mix it down a little bit
so it sounds like... Jen.

126
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:14,739
- What's up?
- You figure anything out yet?

127
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:18,041
We figured out
DJ Mr. Big Dix is a big moron.

128
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:20,831
You're the one who deleted
the recording.

129
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:23,420
That would make you both
morons then.

130
00:07:23,928 --> 00:07:25,782
DJ Mr. Big Dix? Really?

131
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:30,340
How about you guys come by the media lab
and help me unpack some video mixers?

132
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,679
Dinner on me.
Anytime, anywhere.

133
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:35,952
Including and limited to
In-N-Out Burger. What do you say?

134
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,483
- Fine.
- Sure.

135
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:39,603
You in?

136
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:44,584
I don't know. She's been spending
a lot of time with that freak.

137
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,388
I'd keep an eye on him.

138
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:48,504
I saw that dude dealing drugs.

139
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:53,150
Let's go.

140
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:57,887
Hello, and
welcome to Clark After Dark.

141
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:01,155
Today we're here to talk
about all the best ways

142
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:03,339
to make a woman reach ecstasy.

143
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:06,598
We have our first caller.

144
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:08,153
Hello. You're on with Naomi.

145
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:11,069
Hi. I need some advice.
You see, I'm dating

146
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:12,695
this wonderful girl,

147
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,913
I want to do filthy,
terrible things to her.

148
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:20,261
What exactly did you have in mind?

149
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:31,918
My new boss at the Blaze.

150
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:34,086
- Ignore.
- Why is he calling on the weekend?

151
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:37,261
Because I have to go there
tomorrow at 6:00 and unpack some crap.

152
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:39,806
I think Katie Couric got her
start unpacking crap.

153
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:48,259
- Thought you were at your parent's.
- I just forgot my laptop.

154
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:51,726
Hey, Dean Carter.

155
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:53,903
This is Richard's mom.

156
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:55,658
This is Naomi Clark.

157
00:08:56,137 --> 00:08:59,826
The girl who was supposed to
be Richard's date for my cocktail party.

158
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:02,495
- Kind of.
- And now you're with Jamie.

159
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:04,247
Classy.

160
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:06,077
Can we go now?

161
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:18,548
After the Bonhams
and Butterfields auction

162
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:21,675
- we have a table at Entitlement.
- Is that another night club?

163
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,048
The name's ironic, obviously.

164
00:09:24,392 --> 00:09:26,747
We'll be sitting with a
South American coffee magnate,

165
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:29,227
Manuel Fonseca Veloso de...

166
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:31,816
You don't speak Portuguese, do you?

167
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:34,198
"Nao."

168
00:09:34,545 --> 00:09:36,832
And tomorrow night is
the benefit concert...

169
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,707
- Who does that benefit?
- I forget.

170
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:42,630
Either a village in Africa
or a degenerative spine disease.

171
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:46,331
Is something wrong?

172
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:48,423
Everything is fine.

173
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:50,463
I'm looking forward to...

174
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:51,669
All of it.

175
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,050
But?

176
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:55,005
It's just that,

177
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:58,591
we've been spending a lot of
time in your world and it's been fun

178
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:02,346
but I just someday would like
to show you my world.

179
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:05,481
I'm a West Beverly alumni.
I know everything about your world.

180
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:08,874
I was thinking more along
the lines of planning a weekend.

181
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:10,313
Maybe even this one.

182
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,941
What exactly do you have in mind?

183
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:15,693
What about camping?

184
00:10:15,953 --> 00:10:18,354
We could go up to Los
Padres and do a little hiking

185
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:21,367
and we could sleep out under the stars.
Enjoy the peace

186
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,034
and the quiet and each other.

187
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:26,078
It does sound romantic.

188
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,293
I'd love to.

189
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:33,753
- Really?
- Really.

190
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:36,810
It sounds,

191
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:38,651
great.

192
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:50,311
What's the matter, babe?

193
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:53,556
Forget it. Just go back
to your carbo loading.

194
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:55,858
What's wrong?

195
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:58,385
You said Richard wouldn't be here.

196
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:00,115
Are you still caught up on that?

197
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,511
He knows that we're dating.
We can't avoid him forever.

198
00:11:03,681 --> 00:11:05,577
It's not Richard I care about.

199
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,370
Then who? His mom?

200
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:09,972
I can't believe you didn't
tell me they were coming.

201
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,460
I didn't know.

202
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:14,686
- Why do you care what she thinks?
- I don't.

203
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,296
What do you think she thinks?

204
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:20,007
I don't know.
She probably hates you.

205
00:11:20,267 --> 00:11:22,134
Great.
That's awesome.

206
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,182
Why is this such a big deal?

207
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:28,474
- You didn't even like Richard.
- She's the freaking dean of admissions.

208
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:36,405
Is that why you were dating Richard?

209
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,416
- To get to his mom?
- Of course not.

210
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,735
Then why?

211
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:46,951
You were just using him?

212
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,858
- How could you treat him like that?
- Like you're so noble.

213
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:54,667
- You stole me away from him.
- At least that was something honest.

214
00:11:55,143 --> 00:11:56,210
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,009
I wanted to give myself the
best possible shot of getting here.

216
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:05,011
Because my dream was
to always meet someone like you.

217
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:07,430
And now I have.

218
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:10,099
I realize I made a mistake.

219
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:13,786
Can we just move on?

220
00:12:15,312 --> 00:12:16,397
Please?

221
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:18,983
I don't think you even get it.

222
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:21,542
Richard has been beating himself up,

223
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,260
wondering what he did
to screw things up.

224
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:26,870
You're a user.

225
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:32,288
And I don't want to see you anymore.

226
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:39,184
This week on the Blaze,
we'll have an exclusive interview

227
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:43,234
with Mr. Lichtenstein about
his lifelong battle with hypoglycemia.

228
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:47,094
Even I'm bored by that promo.

229
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,056
Maybe I should let
Naomi do the sex show.

230
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,878
- What?
- No, I mean...

231
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:53,606
Why did you tell Naomi I was using?

232
00:12:55,398 --> 00:12:57,146
I'm gonna go away from here.

233
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:00,121
I saw you, Ade.

234
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:03,721
- I saw you buying drugs from Jasper.
- I wasn't buying drugs.

235
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:06,499
What was he doing walking out of
your car with a wad of cash?

236
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:08,824
Why are you doing this?
Because I care about you.

237
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:12,162
- I'm not using.
- You clearly are.

238
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:16,207
When we broke up, you were totally
devastated. Sleeping in all day, crying,

239
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:19,052
singing me love songs.
And then I see you walking around school

240
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:20,711
and you're perfectly fine?

241
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:22,891
Yeah, I am.
You know why?

242
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:27,006
Because you really weren't
that hard to get over.

243
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,178
I'm sorry, but it's true.

244
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,680
The more I thought about things,

245
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:35,572
the more I realized that we were
only together because I needed you.

246
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:38,396
And that's not love.

247
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:41,941
So, yeah, I do feel
completely different.

248
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,228
It has nothing to do with drugs.

249
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,908
I guess I was never
really in love with you.

250
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:02,002
What is all this?

251
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:05,381
I stopped at the Beverly Center
for some wilderness accoutrements.

252
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,168
Be warned though, I bought a knife

253
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:10,469
so powerful that I could
butterfly you in 15 minutes.

254
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:11,771
Interesting.

255
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:13,597
That is an air mattress.

256
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,899
King size when inflated.

257
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:17,643
But don't worry, I bought a pump.

258
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:21,579
- What else do you have?
- Just a few small necessities:

259
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:22,815
a portable GPS,

260
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:24,980
a Burberry raincoat...

261
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:26,657
We can't bring all this stuff.

262
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:29,797
The beauty of camping
is that we don't need much.

263
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,326
Don't you worry, 'cause
you're gonna be comfortable. Trust me.

264
00:14:34,586 --> 00:14:36,203
What about the fondue set?

265
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,164
We can manage without it.

266
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:41,346
Do you want to help me
bring this stuff inside?

267
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:52,990
Morning.

268
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:57,683
Just the way you like it.

269
00:14:57,943 --> 00:14:59,268
No cream, no sugar.

270
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:00,895
Thank you.

271
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,399
Thank you for everything.

272
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:09,498
For staying late at the hospital
and driving me home.

273
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,585
I'm glad you decided to stay here.

274
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,201
Are you hungry?
You want me to make you some eggs?

275
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,829
You always take such
good care of me.

276
00:15:19,512 --> 00:15:20,770
Sometimes I...

277
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,548
I worry that no one's
looking after you.

278
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:28,172
I can take care of myself.

279
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:31,104
One cream, two sugars.
Just the way I like it.

280
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,137
I really think that
you should go see Mom.

281
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,980
You're gonna regret it if
you don't say good-bye.

282
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,984
Mom and I really don't have
a relationship anymore.

283
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,528
- And I'm okay with that.
- That's what I used to think.

284
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:48,660
I can't tell you how much better
I felt since we reconnected.

285
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,315
And I'm glad you did.

286
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,031
But it's different with her and me.

287
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,287
How?

288
00:15:56,471 --> 00:16:00,162
Because I have 20 more
years of bad memories than you.

289
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:04,057
And I'm not talking about
just your run-of-the-mill,

290
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:07,586
falling down drunk memories.
But lifetime of never being good enough.

291
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:10,297
She's different now.
She's sober.

292
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:13,286
Her sober wasn't much better for me.

293
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,140
When she was sober,
she'd remember to give me my diet pills

294
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,823
and make my nose job appointment

295
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:21,892
and remind me of what a colossal
disappointment I was.

296
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,396
I got the message, loud and clear.

297
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,905
You have to forgive her.

298
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:31,386
For your own sake.

299
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:34,952
I don't.

300
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:39,099
Look, I'm happy to pick you
up at the hospital, drop you off,

301
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,839
whatever you need.
But that's it.

302
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:05,737
Jamie's at football practice.

303
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,484
I came to see you.

304
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:10,471
Can I come in?

305
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:24,991
I need to apologize to you.

306
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:28,464
- For a lot.
- It's fine.

307
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,823
You liked Jamie more; it happens.

308
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,362
I was just surprised you know? I thought
you and I were really connecting.

309
00:17:35,877 --> 00:17:38,008
I was dishonest
with you from the start.

310
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,480
I'm not really into
the whole environment thing.

311
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,096
Watching that movie
on industrial meat production

312
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:47,406
just gave me
a craving for Kobe sliders.

313
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:51,181
Why didn't you say something?

314
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:52,731
Because...

315
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:55,157
I wanted to date you.

316
00:17:58,127 --> 00:17:59,127
But...

317
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:02,551
the whole reason
I wanted to date you,

318
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,798
the reason I hired you
as my tutor even,

319
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:10,097
was so I could meet your mom.

320
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:14,096
I'm sorry, what?

321
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:18,092
I've always wanted to go to CU.
And I guess I thought

322
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:21,180
if I dated the Dean's son, then
that would guarantee that I'd get in.

323
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:23,727
I'm really sorry.
I realize how awful that is.

324
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,194
What were you...

325
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,152
planning to do?

326
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,693
Just lead me on until
you got your acceptance letter?

327
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,570
- I would take it all back if I could.
- Stop.

328
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:36,193
Just... stop.

329
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:43,789
Okay.

330
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,233
So, Dad,

331
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,273
you are not gonna tell
any stupid jokes during dinner.

332
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,295
When you say "stupid," you
mean "hilarious"?

333
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,489
I mean, no telling Jasper you're gonna
check his transcript or whatever.

334
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:55,351
Don't worry.
I already checked it.

335
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:58,015
Okay, crudités and my famous dip.

336
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:01,670
So, you guys know that Jasper's
the one wanting to set all this up.

337
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:03,809
He's been wanting
to meet you guys real bad.

338
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,792
You may have
mentioned that once or twice.

339
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,965
And you're gonna love him.
He's so sweet

340
00:19:08,132 --> 00:19:11,247
and sensitive, not like all
those typical high school boys.

341
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,001
We look forward to meeting him.

342
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:16,071
Is that what
you're wearing to dinner?

343
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,241
This is what I'm wearing to help
Navid move some stuff into the Blaze.

344
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,327
Can that wait until later?
I was hoping you could join us.

345
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:24,913
This dinner's important
to your sister.

346
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:26,749
What's your problem?

347
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,960
Nothing. I just don't want to have
dinner with your weirdo boyfriend.

348
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,171
At least he's not
some 40-year-old psycho.

349
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,539
At least Sasha wasn't a drug dealer.

350
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:36,717
Jasper is not a drug dealer!

351
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,726
That's what Navid told me.

352
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:41,847
Navid doesn't know
what he's talking about, okay?

353
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:52,696
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Hey, Dixon.

354
00:19:58,093 --> 00:20:00,991
Mom, Dad, this is Jasper.

355
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:14,325
Isn't it nice to get out of
Beverly Hills for a change?

356
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:19,399
I'm just glad your idea of roughing it
includes a bottle of Pinot Grigio.

357
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:21,943
What'd you expect,
a jar of moonshine?

358
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,159
We're campers, not savages.

359
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:27,291
What are you doing
with my New York Times?

360
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:28,602
Starting a fire.

361
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,286
Don't worry, I didn't
touch the Style section.

362
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,240
- Did you check the weather?
- Not exactly.

363
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:45,077
- It never rains in L.A.
- Yeah, apparently it does.

364
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,101
I'm so happy I wore my suede boots.

365
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:55,295
- What do you want me to do?
- Obviously there's nothing you can do!

366
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:01,996
Just, pull the...
Give it a... Yeah, that's...

367
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
Okay.

368
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,322
This is going well.

369
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,690
What about this?
All you have to do

370
00:21:20,857 --> 00:21:22,798
is get Naomi's sister
alone in her bedroom.

371
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,868
Seduce her. Get her to admit that she
slept with you on prom night.

372
00:21:26,273 --> 00:21:30,080
Meanwhile... No, you hide Naomi behind
a curtain until she hears everything,

373
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,124
just like Polonius in Hamlet,
my friend.

374
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,479
Doesn't Polonius get stabbed?

375
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:36,795
Spoiler. I haven't even started
my English homework.

376
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,725
Guys, I'm not seducing Jen.

377
00:21:38,892 --> 00:21:41,049
That is the worst idea
we've had yet.

378
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:44,263
It's a brilliant idea. Maybe we should
just forget about the whole thing.

379
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,680
- You're not giving up, are you?
- I don't know, maybe.

380
00:21:46,978 --> 00:21:50,114
- Hamlet. We'll figure something out.
- We'll figure something out.

381
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:52,865
We'll figure something out.

382
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:57,024
The dip, it was excellent,
Mrs. Wilson.

383
00:21:58,184 --> 00:21:59,184
Thanks.

384
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:03,611
So...

385
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:08,139
I haven't
told you guys, I don't think,

386
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:12,096
but Jasper and I are
working on a film together.

387
00:22:12,627 --> 00:22:13,777
That's great.

388
00:22:15,316 --> 00:22:17,002
Sweetie, could you hand me a napkin?

389
00:22:17,318 --> 00:22:18,825
Yeah, there you go.

390
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,051
Yeah, I've seen some of the footage,
and it's gorgeous.

391
00:22:25,216 --> 00:22:26,416
He's a genius.

392
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,181
Annie's my inspiration.

393
00:22:31,824 --> 00:22:34,102
Jasper, what else do you
do besides filmmaking?

394
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:37,700
Not a whole lot.

395
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,108
And who are your friends
at West Bev?

396
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:42,778
Well, it's... pretty
much just Annie.

397
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,845
Yeah, 'cause the kids
at West Bev suck.

398
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:49,701
All right, they're all
lemmings and-and spoiled brats.

399
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,215
All right? We don't want to
be friends with them.

400
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,589
Come on, they're not all bad.
Just because you had a falling-out

401
00:22:55,756 --> 00:22:57,445
- with your friends doesn't...
- Okay.

402
00:22:57,612 --> 00:22:59,696
Those people were never my friends.

403
00:22:59,863 --> 00:23:01,263
Annie, look at me.

404
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,629
We talked about this, right, and
we just got to forget about it, babe.

405
00:23:04,796 --> 00:23:06,046
I know. I know.

406
00:23:06,445 --> 00:23:07,595
You're right.

407
00:23:08,483 --> 00:23:09,483
Sorry.

408
00:23:12,632 --> 00:23:15,310
I bet dinner is almost ready...
I'm gonna check on that.

409
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,421
Oh, no, no, please. You sit,
we've got this, thank you.

410
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:26,059
I feel like I'm totally blowing it.
Did I do something wrong?

411
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:28,907
No. No, you are...
You're perfect.

412
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,270
It's them.

413
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:35,157
Look right before you got here,
Dixon told them that stupid rumor

414
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:37,958
about you being
a drug dealer or whatever.

415
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:40,845
Dinner's ready.

416
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,524
It doesn't really matter

417
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:48,470
I hope you like mahi mahi.

418
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:51,725
Look, I know that you think
I'm a drug dealer.

419
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,325
- It's not true.
- Well, obviously.

420
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:57,892
It's been hard for me
to fit in at West Bev.

421
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,730
People, they're always

422
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,862
talking about me behind my back, and

423
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:04,017
I never...

424
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:07,084
used to care
what anyone even thought about me.

425
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,945
But now... that I'm with Annie,

426
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,117
Everything has changed.

427
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,454
Cause when I'm with her,
I feel like I have a place in the world.

428
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,706
I care about her so
much, and I just know

429
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,618
that if you...

430
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:22,442
Just give me a chance,

431
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,297
you'll see that all I want is
what's best for your daughter.

432
00:24:27,886 --> 00:24:31,303
I'm glad to hear you say that,
because that's all that we want, too.

433
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:35,140
- Great. Thank you.
- Why don't you try some of that. Here.

434
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,449
Sounds good.

435
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:38,685
Yes, please! Dig in.

436
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,442
Navid, I'm here to unpack your crap.

437
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:48,213
Could you give me a hand?

438
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,564
Please, I'm gonna drop it.

439
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:51,998
Okay.

440
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:56,578
All right let's just set it
over there. All right.

441
00:24:57,766 --> 00:24:58,766
Oh, God!

442
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,175
Thanks.

443
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:13,969
I tried to find the crushed ice.

444
00:25:14,136 --> 00:25:15,786
All they had was cubed.

445
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:18,339
Are you okay?

446
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:20,771
Yeah, I'm fine.

447
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,481
What?

448
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,858
If I could take back what
happened last year, I would.

449
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:32,859
I think about it every single day.

450
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:37,745
Well, well, well,
she finally showed up.

451
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,705
I'm sorry, I...

452
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:42,276
Let's get back to work?

453
00:25:42,443 --> 00:25:44,376
Yeah let's get back to work.

454
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,508
It's your ride calling.

455
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,231
I was waiting outside for you;
you never came out. So

456
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:56,508
now I'm here in the hall
outside Mom's room.

457
00:25:56,983 --> 00:26:00,008
Only I don't see you anywhere, so...

458
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,848
Hope everything's okay.
Call me when you get this...

459
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:04,915
or just come find me.
Okay.

460
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:13,113
What happened? Where is she?

461
00:26:13,693 --> 00:26:15,508
I just clean the room.

462
00:27:08,472 --> 00:27:10,638
Great. So, can we go home now?

463
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:12,171
It'll let up soon.

464
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:14,404
Oh, come on,
the car's all packed up.

465
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:16,384
Let's... cut our losses here.

466
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:23,171
This was clearly a huge mistake.

467
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,362
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know,

468
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:28,279
I just thought maybe once we could
do something that I wanted to do

469
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,210
instead of always doing what you
want to do, but I guess I'm the one

470
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:33,337
who makes sacrifices
in the relationship.

471
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,854
Sacrifices? What,

472
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,531
- you don't enjoy...
- The extravagant auctions,

473
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,116
the lavish night clubs,

474
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,606
the charities where people
don't even know what charity

475
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:43,675
they're supporting? No, actually,

476
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:46,081
I don't. But I go, anyways.

477
00:27:47,192 --> 00:27:49,709
You know, and I let you tell
me who I have to impress,

478
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:52,471
and squeeze my elbow whenever
I do something wrong,

479
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:56,550
which is all the time. I walk around
on egg shells, and it's not fun.

480
00:27:59,252 --> 00:28:00,902
But I put up with it...

481
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:04,087
Because it's what you want to do.

482
00:28:08,557 --> 00:28:10,166
I had no idea.

483
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:15,819
I thought you were
enjoying yourself.

484
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,578
Yeah, I know you did.

485
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,829
Look, we can't drive down
the mountain in this weather, all right?

486
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,688
As soon as it lets up,
I'll take you home.

487
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:43,371
You okay?

488
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:47,195
You were right. You said I should say
good-bye, and I didn't.

489
00:28:47,502 --> 00:28:48,768
Now it's too late.

490
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:51,187
It's not too late.

491
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:52,915
What?

492
00:28:55,218 --> 00:28:57,360
No, they moved her
to a private room.

493
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:00,822
You still have time to say good-bye.

494
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:04,943
Okay.

495
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,529
So I know that the first half of
that was kind of totally unbearable,

496
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:16,638
and maybe we did need one of dad's
corny jokes to break the ice,

497
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:19,404
but I think it really turned
around when we started the fish.

498
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:21,461
Which was delicious, by the way.

499
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:23,779
And I want to thank you both so much

500
00:29:23,946 --> 00:29:27,074
for just, you know, listening to Jasper
and giving him a second chance.

501
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
What?

502
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,896
Annie, we don't think
you should see Jasper anymore.

503
00:29:33,722 --> 00:29:35,982
You don't think I should?

504
00:29:36,562 --> 00:29:38,985
I know you're upset,
but we're doing what's best for you.

505
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,571
Is this because
of that stupid rumor?

506
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,495
Obviously, that concerns us.
We know Navid; we trust him.

507
00:29:44,662 --> 00:29:47,124
- But it's a lie!
- No, it's more than the rumor.

508
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:48,745
Jasper is... odd.

509
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,748
How can you say that?
You don't even know him.

510
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,500
He doesn't have any friends.

511
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,668
Yeah, because the kids
at are school suck!

512
00:29:57,153 --> 00:29:59,243
Annie, you are not yourself
around him.

513
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,197
You're not a... a loner
or an outcast.

514
00:30:02,364 --> 00:30:05,178
You have no idea who I am anymore!

515
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:23,293
Hi, Kel.

516
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:25,281
Hi, Mom.

517
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,471
I'm so glad you came.

518
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:32,189
Sorry it took me so long.

519
00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:35,597
You shouldn't apologize.
I'm the one who's sorry.

520
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:39,853
I've been... a terrible mother.

521
00:30:41,234 --> 00:30:42,550
It's just...

522
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:46,261
You didn't turn out at all
like I expected.

523
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,230
- Mom...
- And...

524
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:51,891
Thank God for that.

525
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:55,171
Because you are so much better.

526
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:58,554
The way you have raised Silver.

527
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,278
I don't know how you learned
how to be such a good mother.

528
00:31:04,415 --> 00:31:05,515
But you are.

529
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:10,451
You're such an amazing
person, Kelly.

530
00:31:11,738 --> 00:31:13,288
You are so beautiful...

531
00:31:13,923 --> 00:31:14,986
Strong...

532
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:17,002
And caring.

533
00:31:19,358 --> 00:31:21,632
I'm so proud of you.

534
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:24,966
And I am so sorry...

535
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:28,636
... for everything that happened.

536
00:31:32,283 --> 00:31:33,475
I forgive you.

537
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:38,342
Thank you...

538
00:31:40,136 --> 00:31:41,274
... for coming.

539
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:45,904
I've been so tired,

540
00:31:46,226 --> 00:31:50,215
but I knew that I just had
to hang on till you got here.

541
00:31:55,857 --> 00:31:57,257
I love you, Kelly.

542
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,666
Did you get all that crap unpacked?

543
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:25,276
I wasn't much help.

544
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,628
What are you doing here?

545
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:28,795
Well, I...

546
00:32:31,928 --> 00:32:34,428
I heard that you
apologized to Richard.

547
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,207
And I have to say, I'm

548
00:32:37,186 --> 00:32:38,186
impressed.

549
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,960
You were right.
I needed to be honest with him.

550
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,878
Oh, come on, you made a mistake.

551
00:32:44,138 --> 00:32:45,910
So what? So did I, you know?

552
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:50,009
I totally overreacted, and I shouldn't
have gotten so upset.

553
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:52,229
But you did the right thing.

554
00:32:52,396 --> 00:32:53,888
And once I heard that,

555
00:32:55,823 --> 00:32:58,268
It was hard for me to stay mad
at the girl I'm falling for.

556
00:33:00,137 --> 00:33:01,521
And I am,

557
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,356
I'm falling for you.

558
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,604
I need to be honest with you, too.

559
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,775
It was my dream
to meet someone like you.

560
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:20,103
But the truth is...

561
00:33:20,468 --> 00:33:22,700
I'm still hung up on someone else.

562
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,544
Someone I thought I was over.

563
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:32,135
I hope he's worth it.

564
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,575
You know, that mahi mahi wasn't
half bad, Annie.

565
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,704
When can I come back
and try the chicken tarragon?

566
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,415
Look, they said that
I can't see you anymore.

567
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:10,632
- I'm here.
- I mean, they still believe Navid.

568
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,056
Otherwise, I know that
they would have loved you,

569
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:14,658
I know that, but...

570
00:34:14,825 --> 00:34:16,137
Just calm down, Annie.

571
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:20,642
There's no point
in getting mad at anyone.

572
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:23,686
It's not gonna help anything.

573
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:27,530
What's done is done, right?

574
00:34:28,624 --> 00:34:30,944
Yeah, but what are we gonna do?

575
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:34,074
We'll figure something out,
okay? I promise.

576
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:35,567
Okay.

577
00:34:36,948 --> 00:34:39,098
Yeah, we'll figure something out.

578
00:34:56,256 --> 00:34:58,737
I know I should've called
first, but your mom let me in.

579
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,975
I had the perfect guy, Ade.

580
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:05,581
He went to my dream school,
he plays football,

581
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,981
he's SAE.
What is wrong with me?

582
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:09,857
Would you mind shutting the door?

583
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:11,604
Oh, yeah, sure.

584
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,153
What are you doing?

585
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:18,324
Nothing.
So, what happened with Jamie?

586
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:20,034
What's in your purse?

587
00:35:20,714 --> 00:35:23,246
- Stop it! Stop!
- Give it to me.

588
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:25,413
It's private.

589
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:27,464
Are you kidding me?

590
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,502
You lied to me again?

591
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:34,161
I'm sorry.

592
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:36,676
Are you ever gonna stop this?

593
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:40,673
You know what?

594
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,218
Do what you want.
I'm over it.

595
00:36:30,628 --> 00:36:32,728
How long have you been out here?

596
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,695
Since the rain stopped.

597
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,239
And how did you start a fire?

598
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:42,992
The Style section.

599
00:36:44,825 --> 00:36:48,748
Look, I'm sorry that I forced you
to go all those... parties.

600
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:52,376
No, I mean, you know, how would you
know I hated them? I wasn't honest.

601
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:53,927
We're in a relationship.

602
00:36:54,094 --> 00:36:56,506
I wouldn't expect you to be honest.

603
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,551
- You don't really mean that.
- Come on, Ryan. I know the cliché.

604
00:37:01,215 --> 00:37:05,077
Tell each other everything,
no secrets, blah-blah-blah.

605
00:37:05,686 --> 00:37:07,628
But in the real world...

606
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:08,893
It doesn't work.

607
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,827
- Jen, come on. That's...
- Honest.

608
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:12,105
No, it's sad.

609
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,399
- If you really believe that...
- Of course I do.

610
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:20,361
You say that you want
to know everything,

611
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,161
- but you really don't.
- I do.

612
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,494
I really like you.

613
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,305
- It's my point.
- And there's nothing you could tell me

614
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,533
short of a Charles Manson streak...
that would make me like you less.

615
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:40,967
I'm broke and living off Naomi.

616
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:42,557
So?

617
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:45,012
What do you mean, "so"?

618
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:47,135
It's not like
I'm dating you for your money.

619
00:37:47,302 --> 00:37:50,294
I mean, if anything,
I'm dating you despite your money.

620
00:37:51,134 --> 00:37:52,812
How'd you lose it?

621
00:37:55,832 --> 00:37:58,651
I blew it trying to land my husband.

622
00:38:02,394 --> 00:38:03,619
Your husband?

623
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,771
Well, I'm getting a divorce,

624
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:08,536
but yes, he is technically
still my husband.

625
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:11,681
Okay, that's...

626
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:15,328
Why didn't you tell me that?

627
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:19,065
Because then you would ask me why

628
00:38:20,857 --> 00:38:22,884
the relationship ended.

629
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:25,789
And...?

630
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:31,851
He cheated on me.

631
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:34,854
Sorry.

632
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,244
There you go.

633
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,145
Whatever.

634
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:42,486
It happens.

635
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:46,449
No, it doesn't happen.
I mean,

636
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:49,121
it shouldn't happen.

637
00:38:57,428 --> 00:38:59,885
Look, I, for one,

638
00:39:00,886 --> 00:39:02,757
would never cheat on you.

639
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:06,361
Honestly?

640
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:09,013
Honestly.

641
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,894
I got it.
I know what to do.

642
00:40:57,061 --> 00:40:59,928
I know how exactly what we're gonna do
to take down Naomi's sister.

643
00:41:00,607 --> 00:41:01,807
Somebody help!
