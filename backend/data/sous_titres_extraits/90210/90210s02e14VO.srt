1
00:00:00,263 --> 00:00:02,177
<i>Previously, on 90210...</i>

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,554
<i>I'm done dating.</i>
I mean it, Silver.

3
00:00:05,343 --> 00:00:07,627
I like you more than
I've ever liked anyone.

4
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:11,381
This is my sister Savannah, back
from boarding school. This is Dixon.

5
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:13,717
- Nice to meet you.
- The guy's a huge player.

6
00:00:15,593 --> 00:00:18,984
Me and Silver aren't over yet. We're
talking about getting back together.

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,392
I got a text from Ivy saying that
you had something you wanted to tell me.

8
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:25,729
I think it's time for me
to see my birth mom.

9
00:00:26,515 --> 00:00:28,058
I know this guy's a drug dealer.

10
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:30,609
I've been buying from Jasper
for the last month.

11
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:33,737
- You're a drug dealer.
- You accidentally ran over my uncle.

12
00:00:33,997 --> 00:00:37,198
Apparently, they're doing random locker
searches, something to do with drugs.

13
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:39,784
Come on.

14
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:40,910
Let's go.

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,732
This has been
a productive afternoon.

16
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:49,656
I'm so sorry.

17
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:51,818
Keep your eyes
on the road there, partner.

18
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:53,833
Any word from Navid?

19
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:57,010
No, and if I leave him any more
messages, I'm gonna seem stalker-ish.

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,321
There's no way
that that coke was his.

21
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:01,020
We're talking about Navid here.

22
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:04,801
I can't believe got suspended
when he's so clearly innocent.

23
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:07,925
- It's a travesty of justice.
- At least he wasn't expelled.

24
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:09,126
Or expunged.

25
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:10,940
What's that, death by sponge?

26
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,436
Exactly.

27
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,211
I bet his parents confiscated
his phone and his computer,

28
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:18,209
and he has no idea
that I'm trying to reach out to him.

29
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,909
- I feel so helpless.
- He's gonna be okay.

30
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:27,565
Hey, guys. Looks like you've
been doing some serious shopping.

31
00:01:28,217 --> 00:01:29,345
One of us has.

32
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:32,791
You should come with us. We have about
20 minutes left before the shops close,

33
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,923
and I am still looking
for the perfect LGD.

34
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:37,300
Little Gold Dress.

35
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:39,389
Of course.

36
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,542
- I would love to...
- Come on.

37
00:01:44,984 --> 00:01:47,581
Sorry, I can't.
So I'll see you later.

38
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:54,239
See you later, Annie.

39
00:02:01,584 --> 00:02:03,410
- You hungry?
- Not really.

40
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:07,622
Come on, Annie, you said
that you would give me a chance.

41
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:10,294
What do you mean?

42
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:13,782
I'm giving you a chance.
We're here, aren't we?

43
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:15,683
We're hanging out, what do you want?

44
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:18,550
What I want is to have
things how they used to be.

45
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:24,203
I want you to come over to my house,

46
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:25,861
tomorrow night.

47
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:27,100
What do you say?

48
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,061
I say I have homework.

49
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,647
Come on, we used to always
hang out at my house.

50
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,670
Damn it!

51
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:38,501
I'm getting really sick and
tired of this attitude of yours.

52
00:02:39,374 --> 00:02:40,736
We had a deal.

53
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,617
And you know what's at stake.

54
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,459
I'll go to your house.

55
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,844
I've been looking all over for you.

56
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:04,633
We should talk.

57
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,667
Yeah, we should.

58
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,136
What are you thinking?

59
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:13,691
I want to get back together.

60
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:37,890
Good morning.

61
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,560
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- Somebody's in a good mood.

62
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,008
Are you wearing cologne?

63
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:46,132
- Maybe a splash.
- I have to go clear my nose out.

64
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:48,652
What happened,
did you win the lottery last night?

65
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:49,755
Not exactly.

66
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:52,943
But I did wake up
with a good feeling.

67
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,003
Something that I've been worried
about is finally gonna work out.

68
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,014
Is this about your birth mother?
Did she e-mail you back?

69
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:01,486
- No, she didn't.
- I'm sorry.

70
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:04,085
It's cool, it's fine.

71
00:04:04,897 --> 00:04:07,170
She doesn't
want to see me; big deal.

72
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,160
She has her own life, right?

73
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:10,787
And you're okay?

74
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:11,864
Me?

75
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:14,165
Yeah, I'm fine.
Things are good.

76
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,294
And they're gonna get better.
You know what?

77
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:19,671
Got to get ready for school.
Don't want to be late.

78
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:21,589
Have a good day.

79
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:23,526
- See you, bub.
- Peace.

80
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:43,407
I've been looking for you.

81
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:44,737
We should talk.

82
00:04:47,897 --> 00:04:49,117
What are you thinking?

83
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,790
I really, really care
about your friendship.

84
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:59,669
I really,
really want us to be friends.

85
00:05:00,157 --> 00:05:01,462
Still into Teddy?

86
00:05:02,498 --> 00:05:04,325
It's not like
it's an either/or thing,

87
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,557
Teddy or Dixon.
It has nothing to do with Teddy.

88
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:12,598
I don't feel that way about you

89
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:13,933
anymore.

90
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:16,269
Or right now.
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,732
- But I really...
- Really want to be friends?

92
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:24,687
I'm serious about that.

93
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:27,280
I like having you back
in my life, and...

94
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:29,407
I want it to stay that way.

95
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,165
It will.

96
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:50,345
How's the burger?

97
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,045
It's not bad.

98
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:54,390
- You want a bite?
- No, I'm fine.

99
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:57,435
Want a bite of my
extremely dry chicken?

100
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,424
But I'm sorry it's dry. You want
me to run up and get you something else?

101
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,069
I was just making a little joke.

102
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:08,488
Apparently, a bad one.

103
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:10,698
It wasn't bad, it was...

104
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:11,991
it was funny.

105
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:18,983
I was actually doing some
reading about boats yesterday.

106
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,169
Apparently, the earliest boats
were built over 40,000 years ago.

107
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:26,172
- They weren't cruise ships...
- More like canoes?

108
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:28,151
Exactly. Canoes.

109
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,501
Hey, potato head.

110
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:31,135
What the hell!

111
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,579
Be prepared to go down!

112
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,723
Not gonna happen, sucker!

113
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:41,529
I give up, okay?
Mercy.

114
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:44,482
That's what I'm talking about!

115
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:46,985
Later, loser. Bye, Naomi.

116
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:51,830
Sorry about that.

117
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,257
What were we talking about?

118
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:55,724
Canoes.

119
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:56,708
Exactly.

120
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,333
- What's up?
- You're totally over Liam, right?

121
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:09,424
Me?

122
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:14,395
I'm the one that got
you guys together, remember?

123
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:15,568
I know.

124
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:18,587
I wanted to double-check, cause I
could really use your help.

125
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:21,936
And in exchange, I will give
you some fabulous fashion tips.

126
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,152
First of all, you should
burn that T-shirt.

127
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:26,448
Listen, Naomi, I really got to go.

128
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:27,938
No, please.

129
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:32,124
It's me and Liam. We obviously
have incredible sexual chemistry.

130
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:34,189
Good to know.

131
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:37,715
I don't understand
why he's so stiff around me.

132
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:40,507
Outside the bedroom.
Inside, like I said, he's plenty stiff.

133
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:41,928
Right, like you said.

134
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:44,092
I'm just trying really, really hard,

135
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:46,757
and it seems like he's completely
uncomfortable around me.

136
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:50,298
But then I see him with you, and he
is so relaxed, throwing French fries...

137
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,759
What do you think the problem is?

138
00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:55,335
I'm not really sure.

139
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:57,972
It's not like I spend a
lot of time with the two of you...

140
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,767
You're right.
We should all do something together.

141
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:06,453
- Excuse me?
- He's clearly more relaxed around you,

142
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,399
and maybe it'll rub off on me.

143
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,804
Please? I really want this
relationship to work out.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,575
Let's all do something together.

145
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:19,577
You know what?
I know just the thing.

146
00:08:20,372 --> 00:08:21,715
Thank you!

147
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:37,804
Come in.

148
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,698
My parents are away.

149
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:49,756
We have the whole
house to ourselves.

150
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:54,904
I know
what's been the problem between us.

151
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:57,949
We haven't been connecting lately,

152
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:00,159
and I think it's because...

153
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:02,036
we haven't been intimate.

154
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:04,122
Intimate?

155
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:05,707
If we have sex,

156
00:09:06,098 --> 00:09:09,043
then you'll remember how magical
things used to be between us.

157
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:11,230
You'll remember our
special connection.

158
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,301
Come here.

159
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,341
Jasper, no.

160
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:19,637
What do you mean, no?

161
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,044
I mean...

162
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:23,391
I can't sleep with you.

163
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:25,226
You have to!

164
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:28,998
You have to...

165
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:31,482
You have to give us a chance.

166
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:33,616
Are you...

167
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:38,739
Are you saying that if I don't have sex
with you, you're gonna go to the police?

168
00:09:39,186 --> 00:09:40,800
Don't be vulgar, Annie.

169
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,137
What I want is what's good
for both of us.

170
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:47,073
I just want...

171
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,085
us to have a real chance.

00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:29,032
and I can't be in a relationship
with you. I just... I can't.

178
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:31,436
And if that means
you have to go to the police,

179
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:33,502
then you have to go to the police.

180
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:35,046
You don't mean that.

181
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:37,386
- Yeah, I do.
- You don't mean that, Annie.

182
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,489
And if you love me, like you claim to,
and you want even the slimmest chance

183
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:46,020
of us getting back together,
you won't go to the police.

184
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,430
'Cause if you go to the police,
that's it.

185
00:10:50,252 --> 00:10:52,360
That chance that we
might get back together,

186
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,732
that one-in- a-million chance,

187
00:10:55,236 --> 00:10:56,359
it'll be gone.

188
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:15,253
Naomi, stick around a second.
I want to talk to you.

189
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:18,401
Any similarities between my paper

190
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:20,584
and Wikipedia is
purely coincidental...

191
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:21,926
It's not that.

192
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,489
I was just kidding.

193
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:26,597
So what's up?

194
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:31,269
I'm just checking in. I want to see
how you're holding up since Jen.

195
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:34,563
I am okay.

196
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:36,435
Good. I'm glad.

197
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:38,608
I actually have some of her stuff.

198
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:40,343
It's mostly clothes,

199
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:42,929
- it's probably expensive.
- Just throw it out.

200
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:46,409
Or better yet, put it up on eBay
and buy yourself a new pair of shoes.

201
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:49,575
I just want you to know,
if there's anything that you need...

202
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:51,695
I'm fine, Mr. Matthews.

203
00:11:57,438 --> 00:12:00,009
Are you all right?
She was pretty awful to you, too,

204
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,300
using you to bait
rich men or whatever.

205
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:03,884
What's that?

206
00:12:04,144 --> 00:12:06,328
She told me
it looked good to be dating a teacher.

207
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:10,295
That way, rich men wouldn't think
that she was after their money.

208
00:12:14,218 --> 00:12:17,523
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
it'd bother you. She's a sociopath.

209
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:19,189
Yeah, I know.

210
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:21,610
Don't worry, I'm fine.

211
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,114
You're going to be late
for your next class.

212
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:39,925
You busy?

213
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:42,590
No, I'm just slacking off,
'cause Navid's not here.

214
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:44,550
Great.

215
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,095
Sorry. I shouldn't have brought him up.
Have you been able to get ahold of him?

216
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,724
But in a way, it's actually easier.

217
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:54,524
Not being able to see him
or talk to him.

218
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:56,979
It makes my heart hurt less.

219
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,067
- Does that make me a horrible person?
- No. Trust me, I get it.

220
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:04,594
In history, we're learning about
medieval torture techniques.

221
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:07,090
And I got to say sitting
next to Alexa for 40 minutes

222
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,244
pretty much trumps impalement.

223
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:12,880
When I pass Navid in the hallway,
it's like I can't breathe.

224
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,226
I saw Alexa getting
out of her car on La Brea,

225
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:18,417
and I walked into a lamppost.

226
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:19,710
Shut up.

227
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,380
I'm serious. True story.
I had a lump and everything.

228
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:24,757
Still didn't hurt
as much as my heart.

229
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,510
You win.
You are most miserable.

230
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:30,096
Sorry.

231
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:31,931
Been awhile since I won anything.

232
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:36,133
Cheers.
Here's to being miserable.

233
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,351
Being miserable.

234
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:46,735
You are going to die when you
see the view from the top of this hike.

235
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:48,854
I'm talking full 360.

236
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:49,909
Right on.

237
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,014
Being outdoors reminds me
L.A.'s got more to offer than Botox.

238
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:55,999
I know I love the outdoors.
All the rocks,

239
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,001
dirt.

240
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:58,749
Chance to wear khaki.

241
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:01,377
It's funny,
I never thought you'd like hiking.

242
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,921
I am full of surprises.

243
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:08,384
- Come on, guys, let's get going.
- Let's do it.

244
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:13,149
Sorry this isn't really your thing.

245
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,429
I thought getting outside,
a little physical activity,

246
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:19,247
help you guys,
get out of your heads, whatever.

247
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:21,808
I totally agree.
It's already working.

248
00:14:21,978 --> 00:14:23,381
He fist-bumped me.

249
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:30,281
What exactly is a seitan burger?

250
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,904
It's like a burger,

251
00:14:32,377 --> 00:14:34,966
except instead of the burger part,

252
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,821
- it has seitan.
- I don't know.

253
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:39,729
It sounds to me like
you're eating a Satan burger.

254
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:43,836
It is the best thing you can get
for six dollars and sixty-six cents.

255
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:48,632
See, this is nice, right?

256
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:50,968
Nice hanging out, being friends.

257
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,968
Yeah, it is.

258
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:58,517
So, have you heard back
from your birth mother?

259
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:03,210
No, actually.

260
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,650
But it's cool, though.
I'm kind of used to being rejected.

261
00:15:08,804 --> 00:15:10,404
Come on, I'm just joking.

262
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:18,562
Looks like Teddy's still hanging
out with that girl from the dance.

263
00:15:18,907 --> 00:15:21,457
Can't believe they're actually
still seeing each other.

264
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:24,317
This is a long-term
relationship for him.

265
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:27,540
You met her at the dance, right?

266
00:15:28,086 --> 00:15:29,131
What's she like?

267
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:32,468
I don't know.

268
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,720
Wasn't really paying attention.

269
00:15:35,094 --> 00:15:36,848
She looks really friendly.

270
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:40,103
Are you almost done with your burger?
I can get the check.

271
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,227
Check, please?

272
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:47,803
I know I'm way out of line here,
but I have to tell you,

273
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:50,986
you're making a huge mistake
rejecting a great guy like my brother.

274
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:52,956
Savannah.

275
00:15:54,796 --> 00:15:56,773
I'm sorry.
We're just leaving.

276
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,938
I'm sorry, I just had
to say my piece.

277
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:01,835
He's never been like this over
a girl before. I just can't stand...

278
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:03,174
Leaving now.

279
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:05,751
I'm really sorry.

280
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:08,921
Good to see you again, Dixon.

281
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:12,120
Wait,

282
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:13,514
you knew?

283
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:16,520
You knew this whole time that
that girl was Teddy's sister?!

284
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:18,639
Kind of, yeah.

285
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:22,139
Teddy's a player,
and he's always going to be one.

286
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:25,634
He didn't hurt you just now,
but eventually he would have.

287
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:29,089
I care about you.
I just wanted to protect you.

288
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,069
No. You have no right to
make that decision for me.

289
00:16:34,218 --> 00:16:37,658
I don't even want to hear it.
What kind of friend are you?

290
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:47,900
I'm just saying it's not
always easy listening to Coach

291
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,934
cause I'm a way better
surfer than he is.

292
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:53,934
- I'm hoping you didn't tell him that.
- I did, except I used the words

293
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:56,260
suck my tail***...
which is not such a good idea.

294
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,235
You okay, Naomi?

295
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,147
Yeah!
Just taking my time.

296
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,171
Enjoying the great outdoors.

297
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,396
- Watch out for that poison oak.
- What! Where!

298
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:09,315
Sorry, to the left.
No, my left.

299
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:11,547
- By the garter snake.
- What?!

300
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:19,241
Come on.

301
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:30,552
Sorry I couldn't make it to the top.

302
00:17:30,722 --> 00:17:31,988
Stop. Don't be silly.

303
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:34,233
The view isn't
even really that great.

304
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:36,761
You might as well just
buy the postcard.

305
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:40,356
Would you mind filling
up my canteen?

306
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,862
I'm really thirsty.

307
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,402
You got it.

308
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,770
Just so you know, I'm on to you.

309
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:49,229
What?

310
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:53,072
You've been trying to make me look bad
because you still like Liam.

311
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:56,116
Okay, Naomi, that's ridiculous.

312
00:17:57,424 --> 00:18:00,412
What's worse... You're too much
of a coward to admit it.

313
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:06,043
- I am not a coward.
- Really?

314
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,045
Then come clean.

315
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:12,506
Fine.

316
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:15,135
I like him.
I like him a lot.

317
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,452
And you know what,
you guys suck as a couple.

318
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:18,806
That's not true.

319
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,641
So why'd you ask for my help?

320
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,654
Just stay away from him.

321
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:26,355
That's going to be hard.
We are on the surf team together.

322
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,905
Then it's going to be hard
for me to not take you down.

323
00:18:30,804 --> 00:18:32,361
I'd really like to see you try.

324
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:37,725
You have no idea
what you're up against.

325
00:18:55,248 --> 00:18:58,137
- Mind if I sit with you?
- Sure.

326
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,060
I have something I got to tell you.

327
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:06,969
Shoot.

328
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:09,821
Silver was really into you

329
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:12,568
at the Winter Wonderland Dance,
and she was going to tell you.

330
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,991
But when she saw u with Savannah,

331
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:17,406
she thought that you were
flirting with another girl.

332
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:18,831
She was?

333
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:20,482
She did?

334
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,230
And I... I let her think that.

335
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:28,492
I really like her

336
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,755
And when she was feeling really
vulnerable, that's when I kissed her.

337
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,425
So, you should know that the
kiss didn't mean anything to her.

338
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,411
I lied when I said

339
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:41,167
we might be getting back together,

340
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:44,743
and I lied when I told you she
wanted you to leave her alone.

341
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:49,104
What the hell, bro?

342
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:52,787
You should punch me.

343
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,521
I can give you a bunch of excuses

344
00:19:56,688 --> 00:19:58,903
to why I did what I did, all right?

345
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:02,278
I was rejected by Silver.
I've been rejected by my birth mom.

346
00:20:02,524 --> 00:20:05,621
I failed a math test that I studied
for for three frickin' hours.

347
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,167
But the truth is,
none of that matters.

348
00:20:10,662 --> 00:20:13,112
None of those excuses
are good enough.

349
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:16,139
So...

350
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:21,002
You should punch me.

351
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:29,897
Okay...

352
00:20:30,435 --> 00:20:32,523
- I deserved that.
- Yeah, you did.

353
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:35,108
You screwed up.
At least you came clean.

354
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:39,029
Well, I feel better.

355
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:41,210
Yeah, me, too.

356
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:45,135
Not better.

357
00:20:45,302 --> 00:20:47,037
So... what now?

358
00:20:47,718 --> 00:20:49,318
Silver likes you, man.

359
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:52,501
Go for it.

360
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,957
Pity party checklist.
First thing we need, sad movies.

361
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:03,720
<i>The Way We Were,
An Affair to Remember,</i>

362
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,973
<i>P.S. I Love You, The Notebook.</i>

363
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,159
Not <i>The Notebook.</i>
I watched that with Alexa.

364
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:10,269
- <i>Love Story?</i>
- Does anyone die?

365
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:13,063
- Yes, and she's so young, too.
- Perfect.

366
00:21:18,386 --> 00:21:19,973
Alexa, this is Adrianna.

367
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,863
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

368
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:26,477
So listen, I was wondering
if maybe we could talk at some point?

369
00:21:26,644 --> 00:21:27,452
Sure.

370
00:21:27,702 --> 00:21:29,532
Cool. Well, I'll call you later?

371
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,794
Maybe she wants to
get back together.

372
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:40,632
- Why else would she want to talk?
- Who knows?

373
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,552
Maybe she's still mad at me
for saying that Rachel McAdams was hot.

374
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,731
Did I tell you we got in a fight
when we watched <i>The Notebook?</i>

375
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:48,301
I hope it works out.

376
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:52,311
Besides, a true pity party
is a solo affair, right?

377
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:21,632
It was actually harder to
track down than I expected.

378
00:22:22,285 --> 00:22:24,809
I had to call nearly a
dozen auto body shops,

379
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,706
pretending to be a guy
from your insurance company

380
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:29,640
before I struck gold. But I did.

381
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,090
I struck gold.

382
00:22:31,436 --> 00:22:34,102
They were very cordial, meticulous.
They kept excellent records.

383
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:36,813
That photo, however,

384
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:38,357
was a real bonus.

385
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:41,401
- Is this a threat?
- It's a present.

386
00:22:45,246 --> 00:22:46,446
You know what?

387
00:22:47,248 --> 00:22:49,701
- You win.
- You want to get back together?

388
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:51,195
No.

389
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:55,583
If you want people to
know what I did, then...

390
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,930
I'll tell them.

391
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,469
I'm going to confess.

392
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,438
Well, aren't you cute?

393
00:23:41,605 --> 00:23:43,743
You look like a little wet seal.

394
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:45,549
I hope no one clubs you.

395
00:23:46,229 --> 00:23:47,779
I think I'll be fine.

396
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:51,763
I'm actually just going to head
back into the water with Liam.

397
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,605
You have fun, now.

398
00:23:53,772 --> 00:23:56,201
I'll just be waiting for
him when he gets back.

399
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,668
All oiled up!

400
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:20,042
Dixon told me the truth.

401
00:24:20,674 --> 00:24:23,775
About the dance and
Savannah and everything.

402
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:27,465
Thought Savannah was a girl.
Obviously, she's a girl,

403
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:31,210
but I thought that she's a girl-girl,
not like a sister-girl.

404
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,175
Well, she's a sister-girl.

405
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,718
I'm sorry for assuming the worst

406
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,612
and for overreacting.

407
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,690
You know, and kissing Dixon.

408
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,819
He did tell you about that, right?

409
00:24:47,406 --> 00:24:48,786
I knew about that.

410
00:24:49,044 --> 00:24:50,974
And it's okay.
I don't really care.

411
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:54,007
What I care about is what you were
going to tell me at the dance...

412
00:24:54,174 --> 00:24:56,736
when you were coming up to talk to me
before the whole

413
00:24:56,903 --> 00:24:59,164
mix-up with my sister-girl.

414
00:25:01,187 --> 00:25:05,045
- You wanted to get together?
- Yeah. I wanted to get together.

415
00:25:05,498 --> 00:25:08,799
So, can we just pick-up
where we left off?

416
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,051
No.

417
00:25:11,656 --> 00:25:12,469
No?

418
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:15,514
I freaked out because
I thought you were a player,

419
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,933
and, I mean, come on, you are.

420
00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:21,212
You've already been with two girls
since we'veen back to school, and...

421
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:23,897
That was cause I thought
you didn't like me. Now that I know,

422
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,358
- things are different...
- Teddy, stop.

423
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:30,487
How much could you like me
you were able to move on so quickly?

424
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:02,316
I'll take another.

425
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,840
Drinking on a school night?

426
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,190
Hair of the dog.

427
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,693
Last night was a school night, too.

428
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:13,816
You gonna tell on me or something?

429
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,920
Those who live in glass houses...

430
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:23,373
Let's just say it's been
a rough couple of weeks.

431
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:25,589
I hear that.

432
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:28,962
I'm Laurel.

433
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,589
I'm Ryan.

434
00:26:32,162 --> 00:26:33,513
Would you excuse me, Ryan,

435
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,636
while I go put some real
music on that jukebox?

436
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,354
Hey, you.

437
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:49,538
- You look good out there.
- Aren't you cold?

438
00:26:49,705 --> 00:26:52,319
I'm one of those people
who usually runs really hot.

439
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,403
So, I brought you some food.
Figured you'd

440
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,549
worked a great,
big appetite out there.

441
00:26:58,716 --> 00:27:00,660
Sure did.
What you got in there?

442
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:02,585
Just some sandwiches.

443
00:27:03,194 --> 00:27:05,540
Looks like you got a bunch.
Mind if I grab one?

444
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:09,794
- This is really nice of you. Thanks.
- My pleasure.

445
00:27:10,044 --> 00:27:12,329
Nai brought some sandwich,
you want one?

446
00:27:12,496 --> 00:27:14,633
No, I'm cool.
Can I talk to you for a second?

447
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,933
Yeah, sure.

448
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:17,995
I'll be right back.

449
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:21,348
Turkey and sprouts? Good choice.

450
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,767
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

451
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,974
- What the...
- I'm so sorry. That was

452
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:29,356
totally an accident.

453
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,706
Whatever. I'm out of here.

454
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:36,762
- What the hell?!
- Sorry. An accident.

455
00:27:48,273 --> 00:27:49,447
I'm gonna kill you!

456
00:27:49,614 --> 00:27:52,434
Get the hell off me!
You crazy... Bitch

457
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,765
What is wrong with you?

458
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,142
You crazy bitch!

459
00:28:16,507 --> 00:28:18,571
Relax, relax. Stop.

460
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:20,390
What the hell is going on?

461
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:22,296
What is going on is that Ivy

462
00:28:22,463 --> 00:28:24,536
has been trying to break us
up this whole time!

463
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,228
That is obviously not what
I was trying to do. She's crazy.

464
00:28:27,395 --> 00:28:28,331
Stop it!

465
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:32,231
Ever since I asked u for help,
you've been working against me.

466
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:36,232
But the truth is, I shouldn't have asked
you in the first place.

467
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,570
Cause you know what?

468
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:39,407
She's not the problem.

469
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,395
We are the problem.

470
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,399
I wouldn't have had to ask
that she-devil for help

471
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:46,891
if it hadn't been so
awkward between us.

472
00:28:47,588 --> 00:28:50,149
And I have been trying so hard,

473
00:28:50,316 --> 00:28:52,760
so unbelievably hard
to be polite and

474
00:28:52,927 --> 00:28:55,275
perfect and to prove that we
have something in common.

475
00:28:55,605 --> 00:28:57,485
But you know what?
I am done trying.

476
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:59,975
I'm done. This is me, Liam.

477
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:04,034
I don't give a crap about
how to build a boat.

478
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:06,682
And I don't do french fry fights.

479
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,143
And I hate nature. I hate it!

480
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,725
If you think I am ever,
ever going on another hike again,

481
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:14,092
you are out of your freaking mind.

482
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:16,777
And if you don't like me...

483
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:18,988
for who I am,

484
00:29:19,483 --> 00:29:21,483
then that's just too damn bad!

485
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:45,026
- I refuse to answer that.
- Come on. Come on!

486
00:29:45,193 --> 00:29:47,335
- They're different.
- But if you had to choose.

487
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:48,615
Had to?

488
00:29:48,782 --> 00:29:50,830
- Who's going to make me?
- Maybe I am.

489
00:29:52,402 --> 00:29:54,340
Now, come on.
Spill. Who was better in bed?

490
00:29:54,507 --> 00:29:56,544
Keith Richards or Mick Jagger?

491
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:01,299
Sorry, I don't kiss and tell.

492
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,651
Here you go.

493
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:08,139
Although... Steven Tyler had it
over both of them.

494
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,433
Steven Tyler?

495
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,769
Your turn.

496
00:30:13,226 --> 00:30:15,500
Why are you really
drinking on a school night?

497
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:18,525
I'm guessing either you got dumped,

498
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,229
or your indie rock
band just broke up.

499
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,660
I don't have a rock band.

500
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:32,542
You know the best way to
get over someone, right?

501
00:30:32,907 --> 00:30:34,007
What's that?

502
00:30:36,576 --> 00:30:37,794
Hair of the dog.

503
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:45,009
So, what did you want to talk about?

504
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:50,181
I made a huge mistake,
and I want to get back together.

505
00:30:53,322 --> 00:30:56,187
Why? Are you jealous cause I've been
hanging out with Ade?

506
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,073
- Cause we're just friends.
- No. It has nothing to do with her.

507
00:30:59,314 --> 00:31:02,553
It has to do with us and
how much I miss you.

508
00:31:04,134 --> 00:31:05,134
So...

509
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:08,116
Will you give me another shot?

510
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,201
Screw Paris.

511
00:31:43,224 --> 00:31:46,923
Screw Paris and music and all that stuff
you thought you stole from me.

512
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,325
I don't care.
Don't you believe that?

513
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,812
Room for one more
at this pity party?

514
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:55,441
Of course. Sit.

515
00:31:57,256 --> 00:31:58,666
What did Alexa say?

516
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,083
I was so sure she'd want
to get back together.

517
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,380
She just wanted to
give me back some of my stuff.

518
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,841
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

519
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:09,914
You are fantastic and wonderful.

520
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,680
And Alexa is an idiot for
ever letting you get away.

521
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:15,475
Whatever. I'd rather
hang out with you anyway.

522
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:20,351
All right. We are going
to be starting this over.

523
00:32:20,984 --> 00:32:22,732
Be prepared to cry.

524
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,416
That's why I came.

525
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:26,486
I brought reinforcement.

526
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,950
- For you.
- For you.

527
00:33:27,664 --> 00:33:29,364
What are you doing here?

528
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:31,561
I couldn't stop...

529
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,345
thinking about what you said.

530
00:33:35,303 --> 00:33:37,056
I want that one-in-a-million chance.

531
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:40,602
- Wait. So you're not gonna...?
- Go to the police? No.

532
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,895
I love you too much.

533
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,206
If you love something, set it free.

534
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:50,445
And if it comes back,
then it's yours.

535
00:33:53,694 --> 00:33:55,325
Just come back to me, Annie, okay?

536
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:21,035
Feeling any better?

537
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:22,585
Much.

538
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:27,020
Thank you, but I will definitely
need you to come back tomorrow.

539
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,794
Getting into a girl
fight uses muscles

540
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:32,176
I don't usually work out at the gym.

541
00:34:32,343 --> 00:34:33,343
Same time?

542
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,760
Yes, thank you.

543
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,881
- See you then.
- See you.

544
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,872
You have a visitor.

545
00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:48,503
It's all right. He can come in.

546
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,762
You didn't really have to
come all the way over here.

547
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:01,182
I actually prefer to be broken up with
over the phone. It's much less...

548
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:11,599
So, girl fights turn you on?

549
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:18,153
I've been feeling distant from you
ever since we got back together.

550
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,243
And I couldn't figure
out what was wrong,

551
00:35:21,013 --> 00:35:22,813
why we weren't connecting.

552
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:25,873
You've been so polite

553
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,668
and so unlike the
girl that I fell for.

554
00:35:29,074 --> 00:35:30,837
I just want everything
to be perfect.

555
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:35,383
I guess somehow that translated
into me not being myself.

556
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,391
I'm glad you're done with that,

557
00:35:38,142 --> 00:35:40,242
because the girl that I fell for

558
00:35:40,648 --> 00:35:41,661
is ballsy

559
00:35:42,021 --> 00:35:43,384
and opinionated

560
00:35:44,023 --> 00:35:45,523
and sure of herself.

561
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,500
And today...

562
00:35:50,953 --> 00:35:52,400
I finally saw her again.

563
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:59,949
You will be
seeing a lot more of her.

564
00:36:16,817 --> 00:36:20,821
And even after showing what a colossal
bitch she is, Liam still chose Naomi.

565
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:22,595
Whatever.

566
00:36:22,762 --> 00:36:24,771
He said he had to make
things right with her.

567
00:36:25,156 --> 00:36:26,544
Clearly, he's an idiot.

568
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:29,561
Yeah, but you have to say that,
you're my mom.

569
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:33,173
Come on. You know me.

570
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,718
I don't say things
just 'cause I have to.

571
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:37,377
That's true.

572
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:40,156
Can I interest you in a toke?

573
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,533
It might relax you a little bit.

574
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,485
No, I'll pass.

575
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:46,845
Mom, you should really
give that stuff up.

576
00:36:47,012 --> 00:36:49,207
I don't respond
well to "should" either.

577
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:56,543
So did you at least take
the princess down #s mano a mano?

578
00:36:56,992 --> 00:37:00,134
It was actually kind of a draw.
She's pretty scrappy.

579
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,950
You hungry?

580
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,223
You want to, you know,
grab some food or...?

581
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:10,249
I'm cool.

582
00:37:13,154 --> 00:37:14,941
Yeah, you are cool.

583
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,211
And Liam's an idiot,

584
00:37:18,378 --> 00:37:20,971
which is why he and Naomi
deserve each other.

585
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,954
You know, Mick Jagger
was an idiot, too.

586
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:32,511
Why he chose Jerry Hall,
I'll never know.

587
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,196
No, I'm kidding.

588
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:47,265
- I'm really glad you called.
- Me, too.

589
00:37:47,617 --> 00:37:49,684
My schedule unexpectedly cleared up.

590
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,866
- These chips are insane.
- Yeah. They're, like, mental.

591
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:54,397
We have to focus.

592
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,026
We have work to do here.

593
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:58,442
I am officially on the
quest for the perfect LSD.

594
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:00,058
What?

595
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:03,656
I'm, I'm sorry, LSD?

596
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,566
Every girl must have the
perfect little sequin dress.

597
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:09,829
The LSD is the most important
element to a girl's wardrobe

598
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,039
because boys like shiny things.

599
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,876
- They're kind of babies in that regard.
- Or like trout.

600
00:38:15,802 --> 00:38:18,087
True, true.
Liam is totally a trout.

601
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:21,648
- So, things are good with you guys?
- Yeah, they're good.

602
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:23,718
I am glad.

603
00:38:24,284 --> 00:38:25,284
Me, too.

604
00:38:25,451 --> 00:38:26,923
I'm glad I didn't chicken out.

605
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,723
And I might have a bruise or two

606
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,315
and what I think is a dislocated
shoulder blade,

607
00:38:31,987 --> 00:38:34,854
but I took a risk and
I caught me a trout.

608
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,174
Okay, but what if your trout
turns out to be a huge player?

609
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:42,361
And yes, I may be conflating
your fish with my fish.

610
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,280
You'll never know unless you try.

611
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:47,717
Where's the waitress?
We need some more of these chips.

612
00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:50,912
To trout and chips.

613
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:16,198
I don't want to be with you.

614
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:19,023
You made that pretty clear.

615
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,448
I want to be with you,

616
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:26,530
I just don't want to want
to be with you.

617
00:39:29,821 --> 00:39:32,703
- What are you saying?
- I'm scared.

618
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,922
I like you a lot, and

619
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:40,169
I want to trust you, but I don't.

620
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:42,505
So I'm scared.

621
00:39:43,868 --> 00:39:46,884
So, what do we do now?

622
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,358
You'd better not hurt me.

623
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,151
Protestant and Catholic disagreement

624
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:17,126
about the 1555 Peace of Augsburg

625
00:40:17,424 --> 00:40:19,937
- was a cause...
- Hundred Years War.

626
00:40:20,104 --> 00:40:21,154
Good guess.

627
00:40:21,321 --> 00:40:24,005
- Evelyn?
- The 30 Years War.

628
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,765
What is the Hundred Years War?

629
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,551
- Terry?
- What is the 30 Years War?

630
00:40:29,353 --> 00:40:31,126
I'll take
"Confrontational" for $800.

631
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:33,394
After shutting
off trade with the UK,

632
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:35,510
President Madisson advised congress

633
00:40:35,677 --> 00:40:38,386
to get ready for what would be knonw
as this war

634
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:41,772
- 1812.
- What is the War of 1812?

635
00:40:43,052 --> 00:40:44,483
You're on a roll.

636
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:47,635
No disrespect or anything,
but you're a lot smarter than I thought.

637
00:40:47,971 --> 00:40:50,823
Rule number one:
Never underestimate the dad.

638
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:54,958
I get it.

639
00:40:58,961 --> 00:41:01,850
Wait a minute!
You TiVoed this!

640
00:41:02,017 --> 00:41:04,128
It is? What?! I had no idea!

641
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,606
Never underestimate
how low the dad will sink.

642
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:18,079
You're here.

643
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,809
I'm here.

644
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,940
I hope it's okay.

645
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,708
Dixon, who's there?

646
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:27,151
Hi, I'm Dina.
I'm Dixon's birth mom.
