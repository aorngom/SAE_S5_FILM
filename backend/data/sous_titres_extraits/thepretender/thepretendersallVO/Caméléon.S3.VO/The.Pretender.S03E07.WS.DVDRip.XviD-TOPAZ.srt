nearly 100 of them so far-

00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:32,204
and I'm still without them.

172
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:37,569
They could be anywhere
in the world by now.

173
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:39,580
Leave that to me.

174
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:44,083
Desmond is a monster.

175
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:47,155
When the judge granted me
full custody...

176
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:49,623
Desmond was furious.

177
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:54,425
I saw hatred in his eyes
like I have never seen.

178
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:58,490
You're talking about going
after his number one possession.

179
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:03,027
And that is exactly how
he sees our children, as a possession.

180
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:06,939
- He sounds like a real family man.
- He wasn't always like that.

181
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:15,950
Now... he would kill...

182
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,986
to keep me away
from our children.

183
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:22,752

184
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,095

185
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,131
I'm someone...

186
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:31,826

shouldn't be stolen...

187
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:33,892

- [Sighs] Thank goodness.

I didn't know what to think.

210
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:24,245
I didn't expect to hear from you
for at least a week.

211
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:26,247
I had to push
the timetable up.

212
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:28,613
Desmond has only
given me 72 hours.

213
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:32,916
- Is that enough time?
- [Sighs] It'll have to be.

Just tell me that you are sure
that Ryan and Rebecca are okay.

- You will.

- along with his armed guard.
- Well, how are we gonna save 'em?

220

This is a layout

221
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,362
Ryan and Rebecca's rooms
are in the main house.

222
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,433
I'm working on circumventing the
security cameras and the alarm system...

223
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,104
so that I have free access
inside the house.

224
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,614
Once I've accomplished that...

225
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,707

It's just, uh...

232
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,308
hard for me to even imagine
being with them again.

233
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:04,411
Trust your feelings.

234
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,812

[Sighs]
There's something you have to know.

236
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:22,354
Desmond told your children...

237
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:25,491
that you died in a car crash.

238
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:40,281
I just-

239
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,613
I don't know if I'm gonna
make it through this.

240
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:47,179
Wendy, you can't
fall apart on me now.

241
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,622
It may be a shock for them
at first...

242
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:52,024
but your children need you.

243
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,324
They need a mother.

244
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:58,132
Trust me.

245
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,727

- Oh.

00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:08,509
Oh, just thank you.

00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:15,176
You can thank me

Gee, Broots, come on in.

252
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,355
It found the money
thatJarod stole.

253
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:33,697
He routed it
through 506 bogus accounts...

254
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:36,863

506
00:36:54,262 --> 00:36:57,993
Hey, it's the least I can do
for a paying customer.

507
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,134
What the hell.

508
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,340
An iron gate's not gonna
save you this time, Jarod.

509
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:15,905
<i>[Blake]</i>
<i>What's the problem? Let's go.</i>

510
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,146
Emma, aren't those two
parked over there the ones...

511
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,745
that were questioning you about
the children when you were in town?

512
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:26,389
- Uh, yeah, yeah. That's them.
- What questions?

513
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,394
I should have mentioned it
to you earlier...

514
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:31,431
but I, uh-
I didn't want to bother you.

515
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,933
They just seemed
really interested...

516
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,935
<i>in Ryan and Rebecca,</i>
<i>that's all.</i>

517
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,937
<i>I told them nothing,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

518
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,939
We've got a couple
of trespassers at the gate.

519
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,771
Make sure they don't
give us any trouble or follow us.

520
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,073
Then you can let them go.

521
00:37:49,984 --> 00:37:53,715
- He's gotta come out sometime.
- I got a bad feeling.

522
00:37:56,324 --> 00:37:58,292
Move it! Go! Go!

523
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:28,751
[Blake]
Okay, kids, let's <i>go.</i> Come on, let's shake.

524
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,651
[Beeps]

525
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,924
<i>Unlock the door.</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

526
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:39,125
What the hell are you doing?

527
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,192
Just making sure
I have a captive audience.

528
00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:44,635
Oh, Desmond,
I hope you don't mind...

529
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:47,173
but I sent
one of those ahead.

530
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:53,035
- I thought I would do a little target practice.
- [Electronic Whine]

531
00:38:53,114 --> 00:38:55,139
Wait till Logan and Dobbs
get here. You're a dead man.

532
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:58,310
<i>The key word being "when."</i>
<i>[Chuckles]</i>

533
00:39:02,957 --> 00:39:05,289
[Groans]
Oh, man.

534
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,953
You have wonderful taste
in weapons, Desmond.

535
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:11,328
Who the hell are you?
Why are you doing this, Jarod?

536
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:14,391
So you would know
what it feels like...

537
00:39:14,468 --> 00:39:16,902
to have everything
that you care about in the world...

538
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:19,235
ripped away from you-

539
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:21,399
Like you did to your ex-wife.

540
00:39:21,475 --> 00:39:23,500
Like you did
to Ryan and Rebecca.

541
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:26,171
My kids? What do my kids
have to do with this?

542
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,647
Oh, they have everything
to do with this.

543
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:31,082
- I know what's best for them.
- Oh, really?

544
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:34,679
Like telling them that the one person
that they love in the world is dead?

545
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:36,814
That woman doesn't deserve them.
They're mine!

546
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:39,587
You make it sound like
having children is like owning-

547
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,027
well, a missile.

548
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:45,691
- [Panting]
- [Whirring]

549
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:48,564
No! No! No!

550
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,604
No! No!

551
00:39:53,074 --> 00:39:55,065
You know, on second thought...

552
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,474
blowing you up is too easy.

553
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:02,108
I've got something...

554
00:40:02,183 --> 00:40:04,708
that will get you
where you live.

555
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:08,548
<i>Emma, bring the children.</i>

556
00:40:08,622 --> 00:40:10,852
<i>[Blake] What the hell's</i>
<i>going on, Jarod? What are you doing?</i>

557
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:18,461
- <i>Ryan. Rebecca.</i>
- I have someone here
who has missed you very much-

558
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:22,263
who loves you more
than everything in the whole world.

559
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,271
Don't be afraid.
Just trust your heart.

560
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:29,409
Oh, Wendy.

561
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:32,412
No! No!

562
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,471
<i>No!</i>

563
00:40:34,548 --> 00:40:36,880
<i>No, don't listen! No!</i>

564
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:39,784
- <i>Come on!</i>
- <i>[Ryan] Mommy!</i>

565
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,414
- <i>I can't believe it.</i>
- <i>[Rebecca] We missed you.</i>

566
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,981
- <i>You're actually here.</i>
- <i>[Blake] Wendy! Wendy, don't!</i>

567
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:47,254
Mom, oh! Oh, my God.

568
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:51,423
<i>[Wendy]</i>
<i>Oh, look at you.</i>

569
00:40:57,404 --> 00:40:59,497
Emma! Thank you so much.

570
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:01,632
Get on the plane.

571
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,143
<i>[Blake]</i>
<i>Rebecca!</i>

572
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,338
Ryan!

573
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:09,075
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Oh, Desmond.</i>

574
00:41:10,184 --> 00:41:12,118
You know...

575
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:14,450
the Venezuelan authorities
were very interested...

576
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:19,118
when I told them that arms dealing
was going on right under their very noses.

577
00:41:19,193 --> 00:41:21,525
- You son of a bitch.
- <i>They'll be here within the hour.</i>

578
00:41:21,595 --> 00:41:23,620
F.Y. <i>I. -

579
00:41:23,697 --> 00:41:27,292
All this time I haven't
been arming your missiles.

580
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:29,802
I've been disarming them.

581
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:33,670
<i>Now</i> they couldn't
take out a Tonka truck.

582
00:41:35,142 --> 00:41:37,076
Rebecca!

583
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,012
Ryan!

584
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,878
Rebecca! You're my kids!

585
00:41:56,063 --> 00:41:58,861
<i>Come on. Let's go.

586
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:02,631
Jarod! You-

587
00:42:02,703 --> 00:42:04,694
[Laughing]

588
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,138
You've given me
my life back.

589
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:09,176
Take good care of them.

590
00:42:09,243 --> 00:42:11,803
- Let them take care of you.
- I will.

591
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:15,337
Oh. Here's a little something
to get your new life started-

592
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:17,350
from Desmond.

593
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,477
From Desmond?

594
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:21,851
Well, I helped out
a little bit.

595
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:26,592
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

596
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,255
- Good luck.
- Jarod.

597
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:33,164
I hope your parents
find you one day...

598
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:37,330
so that you can feel
what I'm feeling right now.

599
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,374
Thanks.

600
00:42:41,442 --> 00:42:43,376
Thank you.

601
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:49,914
- [Whispering] Bye.
- Bye.

602
00:42:54,221 --> 00:42:56,348
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>Dear Mom. I miss you more than ever.</i>

603
00:42:56,423 --> 00:42:58,516
[Thinking]
Every day I think of you.

604
00:42:58,592 --> 00:43:01,493
I make myself remember
your face...

605
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:03,496
and Dad's face.

606
00:43:03,564 --> 00:43:05,930
I remember everything I can...

607
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,093
so I'll know you
when we see each other again.
