Except for the fact thatJarod's still out there,
he was, strangely enough, elated.

Raines suspects that Osborne
was chummy with Major Charles...

214
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:19,348
and may have even helped him
get away from the research station.

215
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:22,045
- We got an address?
- Osborne's only next of kin was his daughter...

and she owns a small flight school
down in Barney Fife territory.

217
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:28,820

So the assumption would be that-

218
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:31,088
Major Charles might be there.

219
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:33,494

He got into the data bank
and made off with several disks.

328
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:19,257
- The embryo disks.
- [Groans]

329
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,061
<i>[Mr. Parker] Then it won't be long</i>
<i>till they find out about Donoterase.</i>

330
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:26,228
- I'm gonna have to tell Big Mutumbo something.
- <i>[Raines] If I were you...</i>

331
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:29,034
I'd come clean about
the Centre mistakes...

332
00:23:29,106 --> 00:23:32,132
and hope for benevolence
from Mutumbo.

333
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:37,280
Tell him everything's
moving along swimmingly...

334
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:40,249
and we look forward
to his visit.

335
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,081
When in doubt, lie.

336
00:23:43,654 --> 00:23:46,555
Sweetheart.

337
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:48,649
You go find Jarod
and his father, hmm?

338
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,220
Raines, call Donoterase.

339
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:55,129
<i>We transfer Gemini</i>
<i>in 24 hours.</i>

340
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,701
<i>[Major Charles]</i>
<i>Doesn't look like much, but we should be safe here.</i>

341
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:06,231
Looks like all the places
that I've hid out in over the years.

342
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,244
Like father like son.

343
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:13,940
For years I would
lie awake at night...

344
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:16,920
wondering what
you would be like...

345
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:19,856
what you would look like.

346
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:24,952
<i>But all those sleepless nights wouldn't</i>
<i>prepare me for how nervous I feel right now.</i>

347
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:27,520
I've missed you so much.

348
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:30,431
<i>The first few weeks</i>
<i>after you were kidnapped...</i>

349
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:33,766
we got by on hope
and prayers alone.

350
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:35,999
<i>Then it wasn't long</i>
<i>before I realized...</i>

351
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:39,509
that if we were gonna find you,
we'd have to find you ourselves.

352
00:24:41,445 --> 00:24:43,640
And all that time
running for your lives.

353
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:46,808
Yeah. It seemed that...

354
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:50,320
everywhere we turned was just
another place to run from Sweepers.

355
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,379
<i>I know the feeling.</i>

356
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,820
But bein' here with you now
makes all that pain go away.

357
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:03,730
- <i>[Chuckles]</i>
- I really want to see Mom and Emily.

358
00:25:04,902 --> 00:25:06,893
So do I.

359
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:09,166
<i>I've been searching</i>
<i>for your mother and sister...</i>

360
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,505
almost as long as
I've been lookin' for you.

361
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:14,737
In an attempt to rescue you, l-

362
00:25:14,812 --> 00:25:16,803
I was separated from them.

363
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:20,383
What happened?

364
00:25:21,552 --> 00:25:23,713
A woman named Catherine Parker
tried to help...

365
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,722
<i>but things went wrong.</i>

366
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,385
<i>The Centre came after me.</i>
<i>And when it was safe, I went back.</i>

367
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:34,194
But your mother and Emily
were gone.

368
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:37,757
I don't even know
if they're still alive.

369
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:40,895
But they are.

370
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:44,566
I saw them...
two years ago.

371
00:25:44,642 --> 00:25:48,078
Thank God.
We'll find them together.

372
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:53,273
There's something else.

373
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,844
Kyle.

374
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:59,014
- He's, uh-
- Yeah. I know, Son. I heard.

375
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,754
I came upon that little town about two days
after your brother was gunned down.

376
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:07,226
But I'm proud of you, Son.

377
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:09,323
It's amazing after all
you've been through...

378
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,062
that you still have
the compassion to help others.

379
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:15,594
I wish I could take
some credit...

380
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:17,607
for your upbringing-

381
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:20,701
that I could have
been there with you.

382
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:22,769
There's some-

383
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,077
something I have to ask you.

384
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:28,243
Something I was told
and I don't want to believe.

385
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,581
What is it?

386
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,985
Did you kill
<i>Catherine Parker?

387
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:42,098
What do you think?

388
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,898
<i>[Broots] Donoterase.</i>
<i>Does that name mean anything to you?</i>

389
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:53,910
Sounds like
an Italian mime troupe.

390
00:26:53,978 --> 00:26:56,276
I was down in
the communications room last night...

391
00:26:56,347 --> 00:27:00,215
and I intercepted a call from Raines
to a place called Donoterase.

392
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:04,482
Now he said your dad ordered that Gemini
be transferred from there in 24 hours.

393
00:27:04,555 --> 00:27:06,955
- Any clue where Donoterase is?
- Well, I'm working on it.

394
00:27:07,024 --> 00:27:10,187
Now this is their surveillance footage
from Jarod and his Dad.

395
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:14,027
<i>Besides finding Jarod,</i>
<i>Major Charles also stole some data disks.</i>

396
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:16,498
And he didn't seem to mind
who saw him do it either.

397
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:20,765
Any man who'd walk into the Centre and shoot
my mother has the brass ones to do that.

398
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:23,204
Any way to find out what was
on those disks he lifted?

399
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:25,868
Well, I'm running an anonymous
sequencing search right now.

400
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:27,877
- This is a Centre facility?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

401
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:31,745
<i>And the footage comes from a well-buried</i>
<i>Centre location in Baltimore.</i>

402
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,875
Uh- [Clears Throat]
Bearded...

403
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:37,648
- <i>by the name of Pakor Frozen Foods.</i>
- Pakor.

404
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:40,849
<i>My mother referred to that name in the memo</i>
<i>that she wrote about Project Gemini.</i>

405
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,486
<i>Exactly. But why would Jarod's father</i>
<i>be interested in Gemini?</i>

406
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,622
- And what does this have to do with your mother?
- I wish I knew.

407
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:49,632
- <i>[Computer Beeps]</i>
- What?

408
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,225
Data from the disks he stole.

409
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,533
Broots.

410
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:01,237
Succotash isn't the only thing
frozen in there.

411
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,111

00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,650

<i>I've never been much of</i>
<i>a sound sleeper.</i>

417
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,428
Well, what I found
probably won't help.

418
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,094
I broke the code on
one of the disks I stole.

419
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,937
The Centre's
outdoing themselves.

420
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:33,408
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Pakor Frozen Foods is a biological storage facility.</i>

<i>You name it.</i>
<i>It's Old MacDonald's farm from hell.</i>

424
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,183
<i>And Old MacDonald.</i>
<i>There's human embryos.</i>

425
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:48,886
- Oh, God.
- What is it?

426
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:51,291
Ayear ago...

427
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,796
I went searching for my past,
and it led me to...

428
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:56,890
the fertility clinic that
you and Mom went to to get pregnant.

429
00:28:56,967 --> 00:29:00,027
<i>I found out that it was</i>
<i>owned by the Centre.</i>

430
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:02,197
My God.

431
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,673
The doctors took
your mother's eggs.

432
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:08,405
My guess is the Centre has them on ice
somewhere at Pakor Frozen Foods.

433
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:10,413
Gemini.

434
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:15,714
I don't know what it all means,
but it's all happening at a place called Donoterase.

435
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:17,720
<i>[Miss Parker's Voice]</i>
<i>You found Donoterase?</i>

436
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:20,951
Yeah. And one thing's for sure.
The Centre didn't want anybody to know about it.

437
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,483
It's only about 15 miles from here. That's where
they're gonna transfer the Gemini from.

438
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,224
And if we figured it out,
so haveJarod and his old man.

439
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:30,131
<i>[Major Charles]</i>
<i>The Centre database was specific on this location...</i>

- I don't get it.

443
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,278
- <i>What is it?</i>
- Tire tracks.

- Dual rear wheels.
- <i>Transportation vehicles.</i>

445
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:52,686

what are they transporting...

446
00:29:52,756 --> 00:29:54,747

00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:07,698
but to create a child-

492
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,568
How were they even
able to do it?

493
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:20,716
Years ago, they asked me to perform
a cloning simulation.

494
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:24,184
A cell containing the D.N.A. Blueprint
of the desired organism...

495
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:27,051
is fused into a host ovum.

496
00:35:27,122 --> 00:35:30,751
The newly fertilized egg
develops into an embryo...

497
00:35:30,826 --> 00:35:33,317
and then it's implanted
inside a surrogate mother.

498
00:35:33,395 --> 00:35:36,421
That's why they had
your mother's frozen egg cells.

499
00:35:36,498 --> 00:35:40,628
They implanted my D.N.A. Into her egg,
knowing that it wouldn't reject it.

500
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:43,228
- It should never have happened.
- But it did.

501
00:35:43,305 --> 00:35:45,398
Regardless of how that boy
came into this world...

502
00:35:45,474 --> 00:35:47,465
he is here,
and he is our family.

503
00:35:49,311 --> 00:35:51,802
We can't let the Centre possess him
like they possessed me.

504
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,814
We need help from the inside.

505
00:35:55,184 --> 00:35:57,448
Do you know anyone
in the Centre you can trust?

506
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:01,185
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>

Please tell me that you had
nothing to do with this.

509
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:07,695
- With what?
- They took my genetic material...

510
00:36:07,763 --> 00:36:10,129
and like I was some kind of farm animal,
they cloned me.

511
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:12,360
There were rumors,
of course, but...

512
00:36:12,434 --> 00:36:14,959
- <i>I didn't want to believe them.</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Well, believe it.</i>

513
00:36:15,037 --> 00:36:17,437
I saw him.
I saw me.

514
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:21,169
It was like looking into a mirror,
only the reflection was 20 years younger.

515
00:36:21,243 --> 00:36:24,178
My God.
This is beyond words.

516
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:27,613
Sydney, you're the only person
at the Centre we can trust.

517
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:29,344

<i>He's never been</i>

522
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:48,363
<i>No wonder secrecy has always</i>
<i>been the key to Gemini.</i>

523
00:36:48,437 --> 00:36:51,133
And no wonder Mother
was against it.

524
00:36:51,206 --> 00:36:54,300
- Angel.
- Don't angel me.

525
00:36:54,376 --> 00:36:57,709
- They all knew about this, and I didn't.
- It was a Triumvirate directive.

526
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,681
Eyes only. Hell, I've only known about it
a little while myself.

527
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:03,013
He is an amazing specimen
though, isn't he?

528
00:37:04,953 --> 00:37:08,389
Is there no depth
to which we won't sink?

529
00:37:09,758 --> 00:37:13,250
- What's bothering you?
- You let Raines play God.

535
00:37:30,746 --> 00:37:34,773

541
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:01,632
He is young Jarod.

00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,441
<i>Sydney, don't tell me</i>
<i>you knew about this too.</i>

543
00:38:05,514 --> 00:38:07,607
Only four of us
knew about this.

00:38:07,683 --> 00:38:09,480
And Mutumbo's people
at the Triumvirate.

545
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:13,447

549
00:38:20,229 --> 00:38:23,392
<i>I'm making Sydney project</i>

There's no way he's going to
test <i>my</i> Pretender.

552
00:38:30,906 --> 00:38:33,739
The boy doesn't belong to you, Raines.
He belongs to the Triumvirate.

553
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:36,471
<i>And before we deliver him,</i>
<i>I want a performance comparison...</i>

554
00:38:36,545 --> 00:38:39,514

<i>You, me and your mom were</i>

562
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,475
A big storm came up
and washed out the road.

563
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:21,155
We had to take shelter here
till it blew over.

564
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:23,214
That's funny.

565
00:39:24,893 --> 00:39:27,987
- I don't remember.
- I didn't see it before, but it's still here.

- What?
- The scar.

567
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:31,624
You were entertaining
your mom.

568
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,501
You climbed up on that ladder, tryin' to
take her mind off the storm, and fell.

569
00:39:36,572 --> 00:39:39,200
You cut your back.

570
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:42,437
It was just the three of us
for two days.

571
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:44,945
It was like we were

<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>I can't do it, Sydney! I can't figure it out!</i>

580
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:15,703
- You have to.
- How much oxygen is left?

581
00:40:15,777 --> 00:40:18,575
- Less than 48 hours.
- What caused the explosion?

582
00:40:18,647 --> 00:40:20,615
We don't know.

583
00:40:20,682 --> 00:40:22,616
- Fuel?
- You've shut down your gauges.

584
00:40:22,684 --> 00:40:24,845
Data is sketchy,
but little.

585
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,411
- Oxygen?
- You've asked that already.

586
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:29,423
- Now focus!
- There's nothing that can save us.

587

- Of course you can!

589

- <i>[Raines] Eighty-five seconds quicker...</i>

594

than Jarod's record
doing the same sim.

<i>[Sydney] But factoring in the technological</i>
<i>awareness available to the boy...</i>

Yes. But what you are

01:06:44,966 --> 01:06:46,627
But my parents.

992
01:06:48,336 --> 01:06:50,327
They don't exist.

993
01:06:50,404 --> 01:06:53,100
<i>They never did.</i>

994
01:06:53,174 --> 01:06:57,076
<i>At least not in the way</i>
<i>you were taught.</i>

995
01:06:57,144 --> 01:07:00,045
No. You're lying.

996
01:07:00,114 --> 01:07:03,174
<i>Mr. Raines said you were clever.</i>
<i>You're lying.</i>

997
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,218
I wish to God I was.

998
01:07:07,788 --> 01:07:09,779
<i>But I'm not lying.</i>

999
01:07:12,994 --> 01:07:14,985
I'm sorry.

1000
01:07:20,334 --> 01:07:22,859
I want to
show you something.

1001
01:07:22,937 --> 01:07:25,906
<i>That's me</i>

1002

[Young Jarod]
No. I can't do it!

1003
01:07:29,276 --> 01:07:32,245
- [Young Sydney] You shut down now, you all die!
- I'm you?

1004
01:07:32,313 --> 01:07:36,010
- I come from nowhere?
- <i>You come from here.</i>

1005
01:07:38,285 --> 01:07:41,550
And I come from two people
who love me very much.

1006
01:07:47,928 --> 01:07:49,919
<i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>

1007
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,891
It's okay to cry.

1008
01:07:56,437 --> 01:07:58,371
I can't.

1009
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:03,704
Mr. Raines won't let me.

1012
01:08:20,027 --> 01:08:23,121

I'd rather die
than give up my son.

1019
01:09:08,843 --> 01:09:11,368
You're going to die,
but it's not about your son.

1020
01:09:11,445 --> 01:09:13,606
It's about my mother.

1021
01:09:21,889 --> 01:09:24,357
You look just like her.

1022
01:09:24,425 --> 01:09:26,985
You should know.

1023
01:09:27,061 --> 01:09:29,052
You killed her.

1024
01:09:47,081 --> 01:09:49,106
That's my gun.

1025
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:52,776
The one you used
to shoot her.

1026
01:09:52,853 --> 01:09:54,787
No.

1027
01:09:54,855 --> 01:09:58,916
It's the one a man named Raines stole
from me the day your mother was killed.

1028
01:09:58,993 --> 01:10:00,984
She knew trouble was coming.

1029
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:05,098
[Chuckles]

1030
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:07,100
Why should I believe that?

1031
01:10:07,168 --> 01:10:10,035
Because it's true.

1032
01:10:10,104 --> 01:10:14,063
It was the day I was supposed to help her
rescueJarod and two other children.

1033
01:10:15,142 --> 01:10:18,805
Raines shot me,
left me for dead...

1034
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:21,439
took my gun.

1035
01:10:21,515 --> 01:10:23,779
I still carry the bullet
in my back.

1036
01:10:36,797 --> 01:10:39,231
You bought yourself another second.
Talk fast.

1037
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,291
Your mother located me.

1038
01:10:41,368 --> 01:10:45,236
She knew I was
searching forJarod.

1039
01:10:45,306 --> 01:10:47,501
She was afraid of something
called the Triumvirate.

1040
01:10:47,575 --> 01:10:50,442
She said we'd have to
move fast-

1041
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:53,571
that this Triumvirate
threatened her husband...

1042
01:10:53,647 --> 01:10:56,138
because of her action
to rescue the children...

1043
01:10:56,217 --> 01:10:58,811
and her opposition to
something she called Gemini.

1044
01:10:58,886 --> 01:11:02,481
- They threatened Daddy?
- They threatened his wife and his daughter.

1045
01:11:06,594 --> 01:11:09,495
You were the other child
we were trying to rescue.

1046
01:11:11,865 --> 01:11:14,629
Your mother was gonna take you
to Europe the next day.

1047
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,161
Don't you remember?

1048
01:11:22,977 --> 01:11:27,812
My father knew about these rescues?
<i>My</i> rescue?

1049
01:11:27,881 --> 01:11:30,372
That was how I saw it.

1050
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:32,385
But I can't be certain.

1051
01:11:33,621 --> 01:11:35,555
<i>But I do know for sure...</i>

1052
01:11:35,623 --> 01:11:39,389
your mother was scared
for your safety and his.

1053
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:43,521
<i>Afraid ofhow</i>
<i>the Triumvirate controlled him.</i>

1054
01:11:44,832 --> 01:11:47,767
Raines was the Triumvirate
watchdog then.

1055
01:11:49,737 --> 01:11:51,728
He's still howling.

1056
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:59,111
<i>I didn't understand why he took my gun</i>
<i>all those years ago, but I do now.</i>

1057
01:12:02,583 --> 01:12:06,144
All your mother and father
ever wanted was what I wanted:

1058
01:12:08,088 --> 01:12:12,354
To love
and be with our children.

1059
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,834
- <i>[Birds Chirping]</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Good morning.</i>

1060
01:12:20,834 --> 01:12:22,199
- <i>[Birds Chirping]</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Good morning.</i>

1061
01:12:22,269 --> 01:12:24,260
Breakfast.

1062
01:12:24,338 --> 01:12:26,772
That isn't wheat grass
and tomato juice.

1063
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,774
No. That's what they feed you.

1064
01:12:28,842 --> 01:12:32,334
It's called ice cream.
You'll never forget the first bite.

1065
01:12:32,413 --> 01:12:34,404
Go ahead. Try it.

1066
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:45,253
Go ahead.

1067
01:12:53,801 --> 01:12:56,065
- [Chuckles]
- Mmm.

1068
01:12:56,136 --> 01:12:58,229
It's very good.

1069
01:12:58,305 --> 01:13:00,796
There are so many incredible
things in the world to try.

1070
01:13:00,874 --> 01:13:03,434
Hope they're all
as good as ice cream.

1071
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:05,444
So, what are we
gonna do now?

1072
01:13:05,512 --> 01:13:08,242
Right now I have to
figure out a way to get my-

1073
01:13:08,315 --> 01:13:12,115
<i>our</i> father out of the Centre.

1074
01:13:12,186 --> 01:13:14,586
Maybe we should trade them
for something just as important.

1075
01:13:26,467 --> 01:13:29,868
I can't believe I doubted him.
All these years.

1076
01:13:29,937 --> 01:13:33,737
All these years I've- I've wondered
why Daddy hid things from me...

1077
01:13:33,807 --> 01:13:36,139
lied to me, dissuaded me
from digging into her past...

1078
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,144
but it was all for my own good.

1079
01:13:38,212 --> 01:13:42,876
We all want to believe that our parents
have our best interests in mind. But-

1080
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:45,976
I finally find some peace of mind,
and you want to lobotomize it?

1081
01:13:47,488 --> 01:13:50,924
Isn't there an apparent conflict
between your newfound joy...

1082
01:13:50,991 --> 01:13:52,982
and your loading
of this weapon?

1083
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,789
It's very simple.
Raines dead...

1084
01:13:57,131 --> 01:13:59,122
me happy.

1085
01:14:00,768 --> 01:14:03,328
Not an easy man to kill.

1086
01:14:03,404 --> 01:14:05,338
<i>Can't help it
if you're a lousy aim.

1087
01:14:05,406 --> 01:14:07,601
I don't plan to miss.

1088
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:09,642
Miss Parker.
Y-You both.

1089
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:11,735
- You gotta come quick- to the lobby.
- Later, Broots.

1090
01:14:11,812 --> 01:14:15,509
Oh, no, no, no. Trust me.
You're not gonna believe this.

1091
01:14:15,582 --> 01:14:18,278
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
- He's right here.

1092
01:14:18,352 --> 01:14:20,377
Move.

1093
01:14:29,963 --> 01:14:32,397
Remember me?

1094
01:14:46,113 --> 01:14:48,047
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Where'd you find him?</i>

1095
01:14:48,115 --> 01:14:50,743
[Sam]
We didn't.

1096
01:14:50,818 --> 01:14:52,342
He came in on his own.

1097
01:14:56,990 --> 01:15:01,261
Three years on the run, and it's finally
homesickness that brings you back.

1098
01:15:01,394 --> 01:15:04,261
Well, actually,
I came to cut a deal.

1099
01:15:05,331 --> 01:15:07,356
<i>Broots, go get my father.</i>

1100
01:15:07,433 --> 01:15:10,425
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Oh, he's not in his office.</i>

1101
01:15:19,045 --> 01:15:21,036
What kind of game is this?

1102
01:15:21,114 --> 01:15:24,743
It's a simple one. You'll get
your father back...

1103
01:15:24,817 --> 01:15:26,785
when I get mine.

1104
01:15:31,157 --> 01:15:33,125
So you're proposing
an equal trade.

1105
01:15:33,192 --> 01:15:35,160
Your father for my husband.

1106
01:15:35,228 --> 01:15:39,221
I wouldn't say that it was
equal, but it will do. Yes.

1107
01:15:39,299 --> 01:15:42,029
And how do we know
you're not bluffing?

1108
01:15:45,405 --> 01:15:47,396
<i>[Gun Cocks]</i>

1109
01:15:50,343 --> 01:15:52,743
Seeing is believing.

1110
01:15:52,812 --> 01:15:55,440
<i>I'll call you in two hours</i>
<i>to arrange the exchange.</i>

1111
01:15:55,515 --> 01:15:58,143
<i>One of you will bring me</i>
<i>my father.</i>

1112
01:15:58,217 --> 01:16:00,617
- Only one.
- That'd be me.

1113
01:16:00,687 --> 01:16:02,450
That'd be Sydney.

01:16:02,522 --> 01:16:06,788
<i>Sydney? This is my father</i>
<i>we're talking about.</i>

1115

<i>Our</i> father.

1116
01:16:09,562 --> 01:16:11,723
All the more reason
to keep cool heads.

1117
01:16:11,798 --> 01:16:14,824
Sydney's the only person I can trust
to play by the rules.

1118
01:16:14,901 --> 01:16:19,770
- Where will the exchange take place, Jarod?
- Like I said, I'll call you.

1119
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:23,172
I wouldn't want anybody showing up early
and complicating things.

1120
01:16:23,242 --> 01:16:25,301
I really have to go now.

1121
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:32,641
Do you want to see
your father again?

1122
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,653
Alive?

- <i>[Wheels Squeaking]</i>
- <i>And you letJarod walk right out?</i>

1124
01:17:01,714 --> 01:17:03,375
He has my father!

1125
01:17:03,449 --> 01:17:05,883
And we had him!

1126
01:17:05,952 --> 01:17:09,217
I made the only move there was,
you son of a bitch!

1127
01:17:09,288 --> 01:17:12,416
It was your last one,
Miss Parker.

1128
01:17:12,492 --> 01:17:15,689
The Centre's
chain of command is clear.

1129
01:17:15,762 --> 01:17:18,094
As long as
Mr. Parker is absent...

1130
01:17:18,164 --> 01:17:21,565
Mr. Raines is in charge.

1131
01:17:23,002 --> 01:17:25,493
<i>And your plan is,</i>
<i>Mr. Raines?</i>

1132
01:17:25,571 --> 01:17:28,267
We organize two Sweeper teams.

1133
01:17:28,341 --> 01:17:32,539
<i>Once we know the location,</i>
<i>one will scout and secure-</i>

1134

And the other will execute.

1135
01:17:35,915 --> 01:17:39,180
No. No. No.

1136
01:17:39,252 --> 01:17:42,119
You're gambling
with my father's life.

1137
01:17:42,188 --> 01:17:44,418
We do this just as Jarod said.

1138
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:47,584
<i>Well, Raines's experience</i>
<i>with Jarod is just administrative.</i>

1139
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,594
Look...

1140
01:17:49,662 --> 01:17:54,292
- I know how this guy's mind works.
- This is not a democracy.

1141
01:17:55,368 --> 01:17:57,359
My decision stands.

1144
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:15,442
Iversonville,

<i>Not 2.59. Not 3.01.</i>

3:00.

1147
01:18:20,026 --> 01:18:23,757
- That barely gives enough time for Sydney to-
- Then he'd better get moving.

1148
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:26,162
Jarod, I want to
talk to my father.

Like I said, two teams.

And I'll need our best sharpshooter.

01:18:45,017 --> 01:18:48,043
I'm your man.
Jarod will not walk away from this.

1157
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,180
No. I wantJarod alive.

1158
01:18:51,257 --> 01:18:54,055
And the boy too.

1159
01:18:54,126 --> 01:18:57,254
It's Mr. Parker who's outlived
his usefulness.

1160
01:19:04,637 --> 01:19:07,504
That waste of skin Raines
is gonna get my father killed.

1161
01:19:07,573 --> 01:19:11,509
Well, I don't thinkJarod would hurt your father.
I don't think.

1162
01:19:11,577 --> 01:19:13,772
Jarod's been searching for his father
his entire life...

1163
01:19:13,846 --> 01:19:16,076
and he's gonna do
whatever it takes to get him back.

1164
01:19:16,148 --> 01:19:18,082
I could see it
in his eyes.

1165
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:21,142
- Well, then what do you think we should do?
- Same thing. Whatever it takes.

1166
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:23,711
Miss Parker.

1167
01:19:23,789 --> 01:19:26,656
Jarod isn't
the only enemy this time.

1168
01:19:26,726 --> 01:19:29,160
Don't worry, Bridget.
I wouldn't forget about you.

1169
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:31,856
I know what you think of me...

1170
01:19:31,931 --> 01:19:35,526
but believe me, we both want
the same thing this time.

1171
01:19:35,601 --> 01:19:39,867
Mr. Raines is planning
to kill your father.

1172
01:19:39,939 --> 01:19:42,840
Why should I believe you?

1173
01:19:42,909 --> 01:19:47,573
Because if you don't, somebody we both love
very much is going to die.

1174
01:19:47,647 --> 01:19:49,638
With or without you,
I'm going.

1175
01:19:49,715 --> 01:19:51,910
Let's do this together.

1176
01:19:51,984 --> 01:19:53,975
Please.

1177
01:19:56,589 --> 01:19:58,557
[Major Charles]
I'd like to thank you, Sydney.

1178
01:19:58,624 --> 01:20:01,718
- What for?
- For raising my son.

1179
01:20:03,796 --> 01:20:07,323
What he's become
is a reflection of you.

1180
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,391
What was he like as a child?

1181
01:20:09,468 --> 01:20:13,928
Someone a father would feel
very proud to call his son.

1182
01:20:14,006 --> 01:20:17,669
<i>I'm sorry you never</i>
<i>had that chance, Major.</i>

1183
01:20:17,743 --> 01:20:21,702
In fact, I can't imagine
anything worse...

1184
01:20:21,781 --> 01:20:23,908
than what
you've had to endure.

1185
01:20:24,951 --> 01:20:26,885
I can.

1186
01:20:26,953 --> 01:20:30,047
- Not ever finding him at all.
- <i>[Jarod On Walkie-talkie] Sydney, are you there?</i>

1187
01:20:32,124 --> 01:20:34,115
Yes, Jarod.

1188
01:20:34,193 --> 01:20:37,788
You'll see a road a quarter of a mile up.
Turn right.

1189
01:20:37,863 --> 01:20:39,922
My father will know
where to go from there.

1190
01:20:39,999 --> 01:20:44,561
<i>[Sydney On Walkie-talkie]</i>
<i>All right, Jarod. I'll follow his instructions.</i>

1191
01:20:44,637 --> 01:20:47,663
Well, he- he didn't say where.
Only that his father knew.

1192
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:51,403
Great. We're in the middle
of nowhere with no Sydney...

1193
01:20:51,477 --> 01:20:53,741
and no idea
where he's going.

1194
01:20:53,813 --> 01:20:56,611
- I know exactly where he's going.
- Yeah?

1195
01:20:56,682 --> 01:20:58,877
Well, where might that be?

1196
01:20:58,951 --> 01:21:01,920
To the beginning
of this little odyssey.

1197
01:21:24,744 --> 01:21:26,735
[Sighs]

1198
01:21:26,812 --> 01:21:29,212
Well, I gotta
hand it to you.

1199
01:21:29,281 --> 01:21:32,648
<i>Capturing the king
is inspired.

1200
01:21:32,718 --> 01:21:35,881
Walking into the Centre
to cut your deal.

1201
01:21:35,955 --> 01:21:38,446
- Real bold.
- Not bold.

1202
01:21:38,524 --> 01:21:41,357
Prudent. Necessity.

1203
01:21:41,427 --> 01:21:43,418
Exhibition of resolve.

1204
01:21:43,496 --> 01:21:47,125
You people only understand
one thing: Power.

1205
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,463
Whatever it was,
it was brilliant.

1206
01:21:49,535 --> 01:21:52,333
No wonder my people have
such a hard time catching up to you.

1207
01:21:52,405 --> 01:21:55,932
Of course, that's why we want you back.
'Cause you're brilliant.

1208
01:21:56,008 --> 01:21:57,999
I'm not going back.

1209
01:21:58,077 --> 01:22:00,011
Neither is he.

1210
01:22:02,114 --> 01:22:04,480
I do have one question.

1211
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:06,916
It's your nickel.

1212
01:22:06,986 --> 01:22:09,887
Why? Why do you do it?

1213
01:22:09,955 --> 01:22:11,547
Why the Centre?

1214
01:22:11,624 --> 01:22:13,615
Give and take.

1215
01:22:13,693 --> 01:22:15,718
For a cause bigger than
both of us.

1216
01:22:15,795 --> 01:22:19,492
<i>Oh, hell. I don't expect</i>
<i>you to understand it...</i>

1217
01:22:19,565 --> 01:22:22,329
but in the end,
it does all add up.

1218
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:24,460
You steal children.

1219
01:22:24,537 --> 01:22:28,166
You create them.
How does that add up?

1220
01:22:32,078 --> 01:22:35,070
Rape, incest, murder.
Survival.

1221
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:42,619
Given enough incentive,
man is capable of almost anything.

1222
01:22:43,622 --> 01:22:44,884
<i>[Car Approaching]</i>

1223
01:22:46,792 --> 01:22:49,386
It's time to go.

1224
01:22:55,101 --> 01:22:57,262
Dad.

1225
01:22:59,271 --> 01:23:02,069
<i>Now take care of your father.</i>
<i>And of yourself.</i>

1226
01:23:02,141 --> 01:23:05,736
Thank you, Sydney.
<i>Come on, Dad.

1227
01:23:05,811 --> 01:23:06,903
Jarod.

1228
01:23:06,979 --> 01:23:09,345
<i>I'm glad you found</i>
<i>your family.</i>

1229
01:23:12,752 --> 01:23:14,743
<i>[Car Rapidly Approaching]</i>

1230
01:23:21,694 --> 01:23:26,097
- I told you. Sydney comes alone!
- Jarod, I had no choice.
They're planning to kill my father.

1231
01:23:26,165 --> 01:23:28,190
- Who?
- <i>[Helicopter Approaching]</i>

1232
01:23:34,707 --> 01:23:37,471
Daddy, get back!

1233
01:23:40,012 --> 01:23:41,377
- I've got him.
- Shoot him!

1234
01:23:41,447 --> 01:23:42,778

- God, no!
- <i>[Jarod] She's losing a lot ofblood.</i>

1237
01:24:03,702 --> 01:24:05,636
Keep this compressed
against the wound.

1238
01:24:05,704 --> 01:24:07,934
[Raines]
Forget Parker. Stop the plane!

1239
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:12,506
Jarod, let's go!

1240
01:24:14,313 --> 01:24:17,009
- You go ahead without me!
- Jarod.

1241
01:24:17,082 --> 01:24:21,644
That boy needs a father.
Now go! We'll catch up later!

1242
01:24:23,255 --> 01:24:25,246
I love you, Son!

1243
01:24:26,659 --> 01:24:28,490
I love you too, Dad.

1244
01:24:55,688 --> 01:24:56,950
Go! Go! Go!

<i>[Jarod's Voice]</i>
<i>I've got to get her to the hospital.</i>

1246
01:25:16,308 --> 01:25:19,869
You're not going anywhere.
Looks like you're out of luck.

1247
01:25:19,945 --> 01:25:23,210
Now, you want to do this the easy way,
or do you want to end up like her?

1248

Stop him!

1249
01:26:32,251 --> 01:26:34,651
Welcome back
to the Centre, Jarod.

1250
01:26:42,161 --> 01:26:45,494
Angel, don't leave me.
Don't leave me, angel.
