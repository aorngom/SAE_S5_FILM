00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:56,617
Twenty years in solitary,
this is like a vacation.

164
00:12:56,725 --> 00:13:00,593
- I didn't do it for you.
- Then why?

165
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,529
We'll get to that.

166
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:05,566
Nice accommodations.

167
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:08,068
<i>Of course, I'm used to</i>
<i>a little bit more privacy.</i>

168
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,400
Smart-ass.

169
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:14,442
- Who are you?
- I'm Jarod Ressler.

170
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:19,845
- I'm with theJustice Department.
- Justice?

171
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:21,849
I never realized I was so important.

172
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:23,919
You're not.

173
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:35,362
Just what is it you want?

174
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:38,126
I'm a criminal behaviorist.

175
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,759
You're a case study.

176
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,168
Interviewing you would
broaden my knowledge.

177
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,699
Why do I get the feeling you're lying?

178
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:52,109
And why do I find it shocking
that you have feelings?

179
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:56,181
Touché.

180
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:59,516
The way I was abruptly jerked
from my peaceful abode and rushed here...

181
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:01,988
makes me think that
my presence was urgently needed.

182
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,424
It's almost as if it was
a matter of life and death.

183
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:07,928
Now the feds are involved.

184
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,828
That narrows down the list
of possible crimes, doesn't it?

185
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,494
I doubt if I was pulled in
for a terrorist bombing.

186
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,503
It's not really my specialty.

187
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,574
No, I'm gonna take a wild guess and say-
[Inhales]

188
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:22,542
Abduction.

189
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:28,374
Still, there must be a reason why
you chose me, why I was selected...

190
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:30,816
and that's the easiest one of all.

191
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,717
I'm on pins and needles.

192
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:38,693
Tomorrow night is a blue moon...

193
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,319
and that leaves us
with one conclusion.

194
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,764
There's somebody else out there.
Someone like me.

195
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:47,836
I'm impressed.

196
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:53,173
And you want my help?

197
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:55,106
Yes, I do.

198
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:08,613
Well, as they say,
hell will freeze first.

199
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:12,353
Well, I am very sorry
to have disturbed you.

200
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:15,897
I'll make sure they
take you back to your...

201
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,228

Patience.

207
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:49,329
I worked like hell
to get that guy here!

208
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:55,535
Ressler! It's not as if
I have somewhere else to be.

<i>the Sunshine State, sniffing trails going nowhere.</i>

210
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,513
A standard cleanup crew
could have checked that out.

211
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:10,710
The question is, why were we sent?

212
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:12,980
And what's Sydney got to do with it?

213
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:15,181
Sydney wouldn't just
send us to waste our time.

214
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,690
- Unless he wanted us gone.
- What?

215
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:20,125
I saw him staring
at a photo in his office.

216
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,797
I bet answers are there.

217
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:22,525
I bet answers are there.

218
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:26,692
Yesterday, a young woman was taken.
This young woman.

219
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:30,397
Every detail of the crime
was identical to yours.

220
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:35,409
Well, let me guess.

221
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:40,642
You're looking for a white male,
22-35, unmarried, a loner.

222
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,685
His neighbors are amazed and say,
"He was a quiet man."

223
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:48,348
I know the standard profile.
I need more, and there's little time.

224
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:51,426
If I give you what you need,
will you give me what I need?

225
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:53,757
I already got you out of your hole,
which means you owe me.

226
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:57,889
<i>Now, the copycat is</i>
<i>re-creating your last abduction...</i>

227
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,629
which means he's going to take his victim
to the last place that you took yours.

228
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:06,367
Oh, Annie.
They never found her, you know.

229
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:11,276
<i>It'll be the same with the new one</i>
<i>if the copycat is as smart as I am.</i>

230
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,315
<i>And how does it feel to be</i>
<i>the smartest man on the planet?</i>

231
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,611
Lonely.

232
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:21,816
<i>Clearly, law enforcement has not raised</i>
<i>its standards in the last 20 years.</i>

233
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:26,452
They're still the same stupid people that
bungled their way through my capture.

234
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:29,156
- But they did catch you.
- Not in time.

235
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:31,824
<i>Besides, "they"didn't catch me.</i>

236
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:34,494
As I sat in my hole,
I studied those...

237
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:38,903
who were supposedly responsible
for bringing me to justice.

238
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,134
I knew them better
than they knew their wives.

239
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,268
And?

240
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:46,245
They couldn't catch a cold.

241
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:48,839
They got a lucky break
from a very gifted informant.

242
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:53,615
How do you know he was gifted?
Maybe he was just lucky.

243
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:00,827
'Cause I'm smarter than that.

244
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:03,796
He had to be really gifted.
A genius.

245
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:08,666
He was the worthiest adversary
I've ever had.

246
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:13,003
I was denied the opportunity to meet him.
It was so disappointing.

247
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:17,704
You see, I got inside
my victims' heads.

248
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:23,046
I knew where they lived,
how they thought, how they act.

249
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:28,283
To know someone,
you've got to get inside them.

250
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:33,157
See, that's what I wanted to ask the anonymous
informant. For 20 years, I wondered-

251
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:36,322
How did he get inside me?

252
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:42,035
Do you know this man, Agent?

253
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:48,208
No.

254
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:51,904
Well, I only ask
because I was wondering...

255
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:54,949
if he was as lonely
on this planet as I am.

256
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,445
Well, like you said...

257
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,888
being smart gets lonely sometimes.

258
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:05,516
Now, where is this copycat
going to take her?

259
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:07,527
You said it already.
Same place I took Annie.

260
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:09,688
- Where?
- <i>We've got till tomorrow midnight.</i>

261
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:12,824
- Tell me!
- Oh, I can't do that. You'd send me back.

262
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:16,393
Answer me! Where is he going to take her?
Where did you take Annie?

263
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:18,496
Relax, Ressler.
<i>Come on.

<i>We'rejust looking at it.</i>

00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:38,096
Oh, you know more about me
than is in my file.

329
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,327
You know who I really am.

330
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:49,372

who you really are.

- It seems you and I have a secret.

You were a child then.
A prodigy.

- I can see.

I can feel your loneliness.

336
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:28,877
A small child helps the police
capture a genius. Now, I am impressed.

337
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:31,077
I helped them capture a monster.

338
00:24:31,186 --> 00:24:33,677
But it wasn't in time
to save Annie, was it?

339
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:41,060
It must be a terrible experience
for someone as human as you.

- No, I can't!
- <i>It's the only way we're gonna find Annie.</i>

Why did I cut the eyes
out of the dolls?

- To make yourself invisible.
- Why open the curtains?

<i>He left them for you this time.</i>

Take me to the crime scene.
Take me to Sarah's bedroom.

- Because I can feel it.

00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:39,711
What does he do next, Jarod?

492
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,499
He wants to scream...

493
00:35:55,603 --> 00:36:01,166
because it feels so good...

494
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:04,344
so right.

495
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:09,078
He takes her down
the hallway, doesn't he?

496
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:15,278
Past her parents' bedroom.

497
00:36:16,657 --> 00:36:18,955
He pauses.

498
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:24,331
They're asleep.

499
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,833
They look so...

500
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,903
innocent...

501
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:32,632
so unaware.

502
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,833
Where does he take her next, Jarod?

503
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,274
- I don't know.
- Feel it.

504
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:39,744
The moon is full.
It's almost midnight.

505
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:43,374
Look, I took you
where you wanted to go.

506
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:45,418
Now just tell me where she is.

507
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,216
It must be frustrating to be so close,
and yet so far away.

508
00:36:49,323 --> 00:36:51,450
Tell me!
Tell me where she is!

509
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,789
- Tell me!
- Follow the clues.

510
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:57,729
- Do what you have to do!
- I don't know! Now tell me where she is!

511
00:36:57,832 --> 00:36:59,925
It's so obvious.

512
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:04,130
Why can't I figure it out?
Why doesn't it make any sense?

513
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:07,401
Because it's all a lie.

514
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:15,972
There is no rhyme or reason
to any of this, Jarod.

515
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:19,143
There is no midnights,
no blue moons rising.

516
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:21,619
It's all meaningless.
The truth is...

517
00:37:21,722 --> 00:37:23,883
I killed them
because I wanted to.

518
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,952
I like it.

519
00:37:29,063 --> 00:37:31,964
Now it's time
for me to see Sarah.

520
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:41,231
I expected a much more
worthy adversary, prodigy.

521
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,376
Good-bye, Jarod.

522
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:53,010
It's time for the monster
to leave now.

523
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:01,890
- What'd you get on the girl?
- Ah, there wasn't a lot.

524
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:05,022
Not even a last name. I mean, there's
absolutely no reference to her last name.

525
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:09,865
- <i>It's-It's weird.</i>
- Broots, don't waste my time
telling me what you didn't find.

526
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:15,667
Okay.
All I could find is that...

527
00:38:15,776 --> 00:38:18,336
she was kidnapped and murdered
23 years ago...

528
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:21,381
<i>and there's not even</i>
<i>a body been found.</i>

529
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:23,382
Where did this happen?

530
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:27,545
Uh, about 40 miles from here,
a place called Snow Hill, Maryland.

531
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:30,317
<i>Snow Hill?</i>

532
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:43,933
"Snow Hill."

533
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:06,326
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>And who might you be, little boy?</i>

534
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:17,530
Well, if it isn't
the young prodigy.

535
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:20,664
How does it feel...

536
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,266
to be the smartest man
on the planet?

537
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,012
Lonely.

538
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,877
It's time to go back to your hole.

539
00:39:28,983 --> 00:39:32,316
You found me, Jarod.

540
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,820
But once again...

541
00:39:34,922 --> 00:39:37,220
not in time to save the little girl.

542
00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:40,384
Not this time.

543
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:52,132
<i>You see, a request to visit</i>
<i>the girl's bedroom was a ploy.</i>

544
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,265
So was my taking you there.

545
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:59,244
I followed you here.
Actually, I was one step ahead of you.

546
00:39:59,346 --> 00:40:00,904
<i>We all were.</i>

547
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:04,246
<i>Carl Schuman never got near this place.</i>

548
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:12,549
Prodigy, you got inside my head.

549
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,094
No.

550
00:40:15,196 --> 00:40:19,792
You don't have to become a monster...
to face one.

551
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,113
[Whimpering]
Help.

552
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,494
She's over here.

553
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:54,767
It's okay.
We're here to help <i>you.</i> Come on.

554
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:01,664
It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

555
00:41:01,775 --> 00:41:04,767
Nobody's gonna hurt you anymore.

556
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,313
- Get her out of here.
- It's okay, Sarah.

557
00:41:07,414 --> 00:41:09,644
<i>Come on.
You'll be okay.

558
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,048
<i>Agent Ressler?</i>

559
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,957
<i>[Siren Wailing]</i>

560
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:38,878
It's time for you
to go home too, Annie.

561
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:06,597
I'm looking for this man.

562
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:09,005
- Special Agent Ressler?
- "Special Agent." Right.

563
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:12,772
- Where is he?
- He's right over- right over there.

564
00:42:20,221 --> 00:42:22,655
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>You saved her, Jarod.</i>

565
00:42:22,756 --> 00:42:25,247
I wish I could have done
the same for Annie...

566
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,259
for her parents.

567
00:42:27,361 --> 00:42:29,261
I know you tried.

568
00:42:29,363 --> 00:42:32,423
I hope that finally
being able to bury her...

569
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:34,467
will bring them some kind of peace.

570
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:36,536
I'm sure it will.

571
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:40,373
I gave her father the locket.

572
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,204
I know he'd like me to thank you.

573
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,545
<i>[Beeps]</i>

574
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:58,149
I'm sorry.
I'm so very sorry.

575
00:43:08,235 --> 00:43:10,203
[Sobbing]

576
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:21,580
You let me run all over the country
instead of telling me the truth.

577
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,775
He wanted it that way.

578
00:43:23,884 --> 00:43:25,852
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>I don't get it.</i>

579
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:32,155
<i>Sometimes, even the devil</i>
<i>deserves a little privacy.</i>
