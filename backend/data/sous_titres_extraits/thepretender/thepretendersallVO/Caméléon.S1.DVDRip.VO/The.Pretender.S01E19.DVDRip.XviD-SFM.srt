- Why does Tug Beaulieu want you dead?
- That's the $64,000 question.

00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:07,316
You break into my house.
You put a gun to my neck.

254

You tell me somebody's gonna kill me.

255
00:24:09,855 --> 00:24:14,019
Then you fake my murder, you bury me,
and you give me a straw to breathe through.

256
00:24:14,093 --> 00:24:17,187
- Your point?
- The point is I don't even know
who the hell you are!

My name is Jarod.
Why does Tug Beaulieu want you dead?

258
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:25,262
Business conflicts.

00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:27,669
Conflicts?

260
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,903
I own some jazz clubs.
Beaulieu wanted to buy me out.

261
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:34,173
- I wasn't interested.
- He's willing to kill for those clubs?

262
00:24:34,246 --> 00:24:37,477
The Quarter's a small place,
but the land's invaluable.

263
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:41,545
Wait a second.
Where are you going?

264
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,250
Look, you're not the only person
that Beaulieu has a murder contract on.

265
00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:51,024
- Oh, my God.
- What?

266

269
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:04,269
She runs one of the clubs.
I run the other one.

270
00:25:04,343 --> 00:25:08,780
Don't answer the phone,

272

going to kill you.

<i>I'd have cleared out</i>

and sell the land.

282
00:26:03,102 --> 00:26:05,662
I'm sure glad you didn't.
Do you mind if I take a look?

283
00:26:05,738 --> 00:26:07,672
Mm-mmm.

284
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,470
So you say you're one of those kids
Sonny was lookin' for?

285
00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:12,669
I don't know.

286
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:15,441
I was hoping there was something
that Mr. Herbert had here...

287
00:26:15,514 --> 00:26:18,642
that would help me find my parents.

288

289
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:23,380
Just fore Mr. Herbert disappeared.

290
00:26:23,455 --> 00:26:25,855
They claimed he owed them money.

291
00:26:25,925 --> 00:26:29,417
Tell the truth, they looked like
vending machines with heads.

292
00:26:29,495 --> 00:26:32,760
[Chuckles]
So I didn't ask too many questions.

293
00:26:32,831 --> 00:26:35,664
Oh, there was a weird-looking one
with an oxygen tank.

294

- Oxygen tank?
- Yeah.

295

Did they take anything?

297
00:26:47,012 --> 00:26:49,003
They was in a pretty big hurry.

298
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:53,142
I never got a chance to tell 'em
about the stuff down in the basement.

299
00:26:53,218 --> 00:26:55,152
The basement?

00:29:40,018 --> 00:29:43,283
Police say it was an accident.
Fell asleep smoking.

341
00:29:43,355 --> 00:29:45,585
You don't sound convinced.

342
00:29:45,657 --> 00:29:48,125
Sonny was an insomniac.

343
00:29:48,193 --> 00:29:51,754
He'd never have fallen asleep so deep
that he'd set himself afire.

344
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,321
I tried to tell the police...

345
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,459
but there's no record of his problem...

346
00:29:57,536 --> 00:30:00,130
so they let it go.

347
00:30:00,205 --> 00:30:02,503
There's something else.

348
00:30:02,574 --> 00:30:05,168
Sonny thought he was being followed.

349
00:30:05,244 --> 00:30:08,439
After he got hurt, I got scared.

350
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:11,841
Where is he now?

351
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:14,173
V.A. Hospital, Slidell.

352
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,716
- After we spoke earlier...
- We both had the same...

353
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:24,118
- Thought about your...
- Accident.

354
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,724
Yes?

355
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,022
You said the accident was on...

356
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,619
- August 2...
- 1967?

357
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:36,195
- <i>The last time we saw</i>...
- Dr. Jacob...

358
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,667
Was on the Monday before.

359
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:42,001
<i>And you can both remember</i>
<i>a specific Monday...</i>

360
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,473
<i>30 years ago?</i>

361
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,705
- It was the day before our 10th...
- Birthday.

362
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:51,839
- And the first time we'd ever seen...
- [Both] A gun.

363
00:30:53,884 --> 00:30:56,546
- <i>Dr. Jacob was shouting.</i>
- <i>[Sydney] At you?</i>

364
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,647
- Oh, no, but it was a very...
- Loud argument.

365
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:04,717
- <i>The other man said</i>...
- <i>"If you're not part of the solution'"</i>...

366
00:31:04,795 --> 00:31:07,025
<i>"Then you're part of the problem. '"</i>

367
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,999
- <i>Then Dr. Jacob began</i>...
- <i>To argue back.</i>

368
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:12,058
And that's when...

369
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,004
He pressed the gun...

370
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:17,506
<i>into Dr. Jacob's neck.</i>

371
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,447
- <i>Dr. Billy.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

372
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,278
- <i>Dr. Billy.</i>
- <i>[Sydney] Billy?</i>

373
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:30,283
You mean Dr. William Raines.

374
00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:34,552
<i>[Simultaneously]</i>
<i>Dr. Billy scared us to death.</i>

375
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:27,300
<i>[Knocking]</i>

376
00:32:47,698 --> 00:32:49,632
[Grunts]

377
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,691
Son of a bitch!

378
00:32:57,841 --> 00:32:59,832
[Grunts]

379
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:16,082
Now I'm going to forget
you just did that...

380
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:22,121
and it would be disrespectful
to kill you in front of family.

381
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:26,826
Where's Ben Worth's body?

382
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,031
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Is that why you're here?</i>

383
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:34,044
<i>I moved him.</i>

384
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:36,978
Just in case hotshot here
started mouthin' off...

385
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:39,311
and somebody went looking...

386
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:41,374
you'd be protected.

387
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:44,512
- Not that you'd do something like that.
- What about the woman?

388
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:48,991
- I saw you go to her house,
and you never came out.
- You've been a busy boy.

389
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:53,060
We all have quirks.

390
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,156
<i>Mine happens to be taking photos,</i>
<i>as you know.</i>

391
00:33:56,233 --> 00:34:00,670
But even that gets boring,
so I decided to take some live ones.

392
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:06,067
Now what did I tell you
about pointing guns at me?

393
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:08,441
Put it up.

394
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,558
- She still alive?
- <i>For the time being.</i>

395
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:29,360
I'm going to do her in front of you.

396
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:33,802
<i>I know this little spot in the woods</i>
<i>not too far from here.</i>

397
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:37,466
Perfect place for a woman
who's been abandoned by her husband...

398
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,977
<i>to park her car, roll up the window...</i>

399
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,876
and gas herself.

400
00:34:42,946 --> 00:34:46,609
Yeah. I knew you were
the right man for the job.

401
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:52,716
- Wait a minute.
- What?

402
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,954
Story on the limp is you took one
running from the cops in Chicago.

403
00:34:57,027 --> 00:35:00,463
Doctors had to take
an inch of bone out. True?

404
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,898
- Yeah, it's true.
- Show me.

405
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:07,460
- What?
- <i>[Gun Cocks]</i>

406
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,472
Show me your knee.

407
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,823
<i>Is there anything else you'd like to see?</i>

408
00:35:30,894 --> 00:35:33,089
Nah.

409
00:35:33,163 --> 00:35:35,097
Let's go.

410
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:39,161
I gotta use the can.

411
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:44,671
<i>[Beaulieu]</i>
<i>Donny.!</i>

412
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:49,778
No.

413
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,372
We've bothered Mr. Doe
enough for one day.

414
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:55,441
I'm not gonna let you foul up
his hotel room on top of it.

415
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,778
<i>Now let's go.</i>

416
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:16,832
[Deep Sigh]

417
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,441
So, Jarod, is everything set?

418
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:31,446
Cops will think she killed herself...

419
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:34,279
depressed about
the disappearance of her husband...

420
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:36,342
and the failed business.

421
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,514
[Chuckles]
That's just fine.

422
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,581
Now about my money.

423
00:37:41,658 --> 00:37:45,094
- Well, uh, got a little problem there.
- What kind of problem?

424
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:49,121
- This kind.
- Now you know why nothin'
ever lands on my doorstep.

425
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,566
- Do him.
- A pleasure.

426
00:37:52,636 --> 00:37:54,501
Big mistake.

427
00:37:57,641 --> 00:38:00,633
You never learn, do you?

428
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,702
Doris.

429
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:07,242
<i>[Ben]</i>
<i>Come here, baby. Come here.</i>

430
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,952
- Get in.
- How much you want?

431
00:38:14,024 --> 00:38:17,755
How much does he want? You were gonna
kill my wife. Think you can buy your way out?

432
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,353
All right, Ben. That's enough.
He gets the point.

433
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,364
Yeah, right.

434
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:24,923
Get in, or die.

435
00:38:28,872 --> 00:38:31,363
You too, squirrelly. Get in.

436
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:42,275
Well, I think it's time
for my last photo shoot.

437
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,724
Now, I'm gonna ask you two
some questions.

438
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:54,423
You answer correctly,
this'll be over soon.

439
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,602
Did you hire an assassin...

440
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,663
to kill Ben and Doris Worth?

441
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,232
<i>I saw your leg.!</i>
<i>I seen that scar on there.!</i>

442
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:16,285
It's neat, huh?

443
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:20,585
A little mortician's wax,
a little pancake makeup, and voilà.

444
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:24,058
Now, did you contract
for the killing of Ben and Doris Worth?

445
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:29,725
I'm afraid that's not
gonna do you any good.

446
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,496
And I wouldn't try
smashing the window.

447
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:38,904
Shatterproof glass.

448
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:43,640
<i>Well, looks to me like you boys aren't</i>
<i>interested in doing too much talking, so</i>...

<i>to kill all of'em.!</i>

453
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,274
- Donny!
- I could tell you where he buried the bodies!

454
00:40:17,347 --> 00:40:21,215
- I can't hear you.
- All right, Jarod. I did it.

455
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:24,583
All right, Jarod,
I'll give you $100,000 to open this door!

456
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,253
My, that's an awful lot of money.

457
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:31,453
A man would be crazy
not to think that offer over.

<i>[Coughing Continues]</i>

459
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:50,438
I thought it over.

460
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,505
No deal.

461
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,080
Jarod!

00:40:57,554 --> 00:41:01,615
- <i>[Coughing]</i>
- You're just gonna let 'em die?

463
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,456
I only put enough gas in the tank
to scare them.

00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:07,622
<i>The engine should shut off</i>
<i>in about 30 seconds.</i>

00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:10,826
I wish I could stick around to see how
they try to explain that tape to the police.

466
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,495
They should be here any minute.

467
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,800
Hey, who could I say? Thanks, pal.

468
00:41:15,872 --> 00:41:17,806
Thank you.

469
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:29,211
You two, you work well together.
You should consider a merger.

470
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:32,483
- See?
- Oh, please, don't start.

471
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,151

<i>And I've missed you too, Sydney.</i>

00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,636
Why has it taken you so long
to talk to me?

474
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:54,768
I was afraid.

475
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,178
I thought that, um...

476
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:01,081
if I tried and failed...

477
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,142

479
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,284
I've already told you, Sydney.

480
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,351
It wasn't your fault.

481

But you see, I wasn't listening...

482
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:21,568
to what you were really trying
to say to me.

483
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:25,267
You were in trouble.
You needed my help.

00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,692
Do you remember her name?

510
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,668
Nice... woman.

511
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:38,473
Wanted to find... her little boy.

512
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:41,567
Yes. That's right.

513
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,671
Do you remember her name?

514
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:48,912
Mr. Herbert. Mr. Herbert,
do you remember her name?

515
00:44:53,189 --> 00:44:55,180
[Sighs]

516
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:04,760
[Sighs]
Remember her name.

517
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,782
[Rings]

518
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,250
- Hello.
- [Jarod] Hello, Sydney.

519
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,257
Jarod.

520
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,226
I wanted to thank you
for sending me the photograph.

521
00:45:31,294 --> 00:45:33,194
What photograph, Jarod?

522
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:35,254
Sonny Herbert.

523
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:40,625
Jarod, I did not send you any photos.

524
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:44,105
In fact, I was just about to thank you...

525
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:48,133
for the message letting me know
about the Twins Convention.

526
00:45:49,412 --> 00:45:51,846
Sydney...

527
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,406
I didn't send you any message.

528
00:45:58,254 --> 00:46:00,188
Then who did?

529
00:46:44,934 --> 00:46:46,094
[Mews]
