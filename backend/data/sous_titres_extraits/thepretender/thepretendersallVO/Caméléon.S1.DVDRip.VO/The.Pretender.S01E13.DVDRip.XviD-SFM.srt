- <i>Hard to say.</i>

333
00:24:55,336 --> 00:24:57,896
At first, I thought the song
from Jarod's phone call...

334
00:24:57,972 --> 00:24:59,963
was "I Shot the Sheriff,"
but then I refiltered it...

335
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,703
- and realized it was "Bungle in theJungle."
- Mm-hmm.

336
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:07,280
How much longer, Broots?

337
00:25:07,348 --> 00:25:11,944
Well, between BMI's and ASCAP's

338
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,250
it could be some time.

339

- I found traces of narcotics in the back.

- And I found this.
- Deliver your drugs, pick up your money.

356
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:54,019
You don't file a flight plan with a run
like this, so if your plane crashes...

00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:58,491
- No one looks for you.
- Somebody was up here.

358
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:13,671
There's two sets of footprints, but they
both come from different directions.

359
00:27:15,442 --> 00:27:19,902

367
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:52,338
- Conrad.
- Conrad is leading the search.

So, uh, is Simpkins okay?

498
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:45,109
You mean is he alive,
so he can testify against you?

499
00:40:45,184 --> 00:40:48,449
- You betcha.
- So, why didn't you just call the police?

He was tall, handsome,
