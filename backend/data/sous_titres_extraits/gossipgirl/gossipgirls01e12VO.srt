Gossip Girl
Here--

00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,200
Your One And Only Source Into The Scandalous Lives
Of Manhattan's Elite.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,000
At What Point Do We Admit

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,200
That No Matter How Much
We Want It Or How Hard We Try...

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,800
It's Just Not Working.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,900
You're Going Back To Hudson,
Aren't You?

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,700
Yeah.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,100
Rufus, Why Are You Calling?

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,200
I Miss You.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,100
Mom,
You Cannot Date Bart Bass.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,900
You Said A Moment Ago
You Didn't Care Who It Was.

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,000
He Raised Chuck.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,200
Would You Do Me The Honor
Of Being My Wife?

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,100
I Think You Like Dan ???

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,600
Just Thought I Should
Let You Know Someone's Watching.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,600
Chuck, You Are
Not Answering My Calls.

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,800
Please, For The Love Of God,
Do Not Tell Anybody About Us.

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,400
Don't Worry. B.Who Would I Tell?(From Chuck)

That's A Secret
I'll Never Tell.

22
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,700
You Know You Love Me.

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,200
On The Upper East Side,

26
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,700
It's Easy To Think  That The World
Is Exactly As It Appears--

27
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,100
Refined, Elegant, Imposing.

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,200
But Sometimes,
All It Takes Is A Little Key

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,800
To Open The Door
To The Wild Side.

30
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,100
Nate.
Why Have You
Been Avoiding Me?

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,500
Avoiding You? What?

32
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,800
Ever Since
I Got Back From Monaco,

33
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,500
You've Been--You're Not
Returning My Calls Or My Texts.

34
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,400
I've Barely Seen You.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Really? I Don't Recall.

36
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,100
Oh? Well, Do You Recall That
Night After The Debutante Ball

37
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes, I Do.

38
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,500
Blair?

39
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,400
What Are You Doing?
This.

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,400
Good Catching Up.

41
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,400
Enough With The Blackmail.

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,700
Aren't You Bored Already?

43
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,200
I Can't Avoid Nate Forever.

44
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,300
Excuse Me.

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,900
I Didn't Say Forever.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
Just Until The Sight
Of The Two Of You Together

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,500
Doesn't Turn My Stomach.

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,600
And When Will That Be?

49
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,000
Only Time Will Tell,
I'm Afraid.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
So Unless You Want
Dear Nathaniel To Know How

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,300
You Lost Your Virginity To Me
In The Back Of A Moving Vehicle,

52
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,000
I Encourage Patience
And Restraint.

53
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,200
Isn't There Someone Else
You Can Torture?

54
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,400
Probably,

55
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,000
But I Choose You.

56
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,400
Why Don't I Turn That, Uh,
One-Piece Into A No-Piece?

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,500
Find A Floatie
To Talk To, Chuck.

58
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,800
You Know,
If My Dad And Your Mom

59
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,300
Come Back From South Africa
Tomorrow Engaged,

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,300
We'll Be Brother And Sister.
And You Know What They Say--

61
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,800
The Family That Plays Together
Stays Together.

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,100
Ah, Incest--
The Universal Taboo.

63
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,300
One Of The, Um, Only Ones
You Haven't Violated.

64
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,800
Well, I'm Game If You Are.

65
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,800
Dan Humphrey, Age 17,

66
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,700
Enjoying An Exotic Meal
Of Cheerios

67
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,000
On An Exciting
Saturday Night In.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Come On. Be Interesting.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,800
You Don't Want Me
To Move Back To Vermont, Do You?

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,200
No,
But If Your Whole Future

71
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,000
Depends Getting This Grant
For Your Documentary,

72
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,300
I-I Really, Really Think
You Should Find A New Subject.

73
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,400
Absolutely Not.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,800
The Outsider Goes Inside--

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,400
A Likable Everyman's Pursuit
Of His Dream Girl

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,000
Begins His Descent
Into The Bowels Of Hell.

77
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,100
This Is Mythic Stuff.

78
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,300
Okay,
Not Big On The Soundtrack.

79
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,300
Whatever Movie He's Scoring
Sounds Depressing.

80
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,700
Yeah, I Think It's A Biopic.

81
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,100
Try Listening To That
For Three Weeks Straight.

82
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,300
But Before Christmas, My Dad
Hadn't Finished A Song In Years,

83
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,100
So I Really Don't Have The Heart
To Ask Him To Stop.

84
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,500
Well, I Do.

85
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Hey, Serena.

86
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,200
Yes! Finally Some Action.

87
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,000
Hey. What Are You Up To...
Besides Missing Me?

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,500
Oh, Uh, Just Wondering
If You're Missing Me.

89
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,200
Aw!

90
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,400
Well, Of Course I Am,

91
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,100
At This Party That Would Be
A Lot More Fun If You Were Here.

92
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,000
Party? I Thought It Was
A Quiet Night With Blair,

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,900
Your Last Night At Her Place
Before Your Mom Comes Home?

94
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,700
Yeah, We Were, And Then Kati And Is Showed Up,

95
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,100
And We All Went Out,

96
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,800
And We Ran Into Some People
And Then Ended Up Here.

97
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,900
Where--Where's Here?

98
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,900
719 E. 82nd Stre.

99
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,100
Wait A Second. That's, Um...

100
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,000
That's School, Is It Not?

101
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,700
Bring Your Bathing Suit!

102
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,000
You're Swimming?

103
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,900
No, You Hung Up.

104
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,100
So What Will It Be, Dan--
Cheerios And Chaucer

105
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,600
Or An Illegal Party
At Your Prep School Pool With

106
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,000
Your High Society Girlfriend
And Her Nasty Cohorts?

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,900
Dad?

108
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,000
Vanessa And I
Are--Are Going Out.
All Right.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,100
Well, Uh,
If You Wanted To Get The Perfect Shot Of Me
Feeling Like An Outsider,

110
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,100
Then I'm Ready
For My Close-Up.

111
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,700
Dan! Oh!

112
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,600
Hey.

113
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,900
Hey!

114
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,500
Hehe Vanessa.
Hey.

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,100
Come On, Guys.

116
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,300
Help!

117
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,500
Call The Ambulance!
Call An Ambulance.

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
Someone Call 9-1-1.

119
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Hi. Hi. We--We Need--
We Need An Ambulance.

120
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,800
Yeah, A-A Kid--
He--He Hit His Head,

121
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
And--And He Fell In The Pool.

122
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,500
It--It's 719, Uh,
East 82nd Street.

123
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,900
Thanks To The Cell Phone
That Somebody Left Behind,

124
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,400
We've Got Plenty Of Evidence
Of Who Was At The Party.

125
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,400
Lucky For You, Andrew Collins
Is Going To Be Fine.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,200
Unlucky For You, We Need
To Hold Someone Responsible.

127
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,800
Ms. Queller?

128
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,200
Hello.

129
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
I'm Ms. Queller,

130
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
The New Headmistress
At Constance.

131
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,900
It's Unfortunate That We Meet
Under These Circumstances.

132
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,500
But I Look Forward
To Getting To Know Each And Every One Of You.

133
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,900
I've Already
Talked To Your Parents...

134
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,700
At Least, Those I Could Reach,

135
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,800
And Look Forward To Reading
Your Personal Essays--

136
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,300
10,000 Words

137
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,100
Describing How You Came To Be
On School Property After Hours,

138
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,900
Using Alcohol And Drugs,

139
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,700
Where A Fellow Student
Almost Died.

140
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,400
In Other Words,
What The Hell Is Wrong With You?

141
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,500
I'll Also Be Conducting
One-On-One Interviews

142
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Until I Discover Ho Broke Into The Pool
And Initiated The Party.

143
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
That Person Will Be Expelled.

144
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,500
If That Person
Is Not Identified,

145
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,400
Then You'll All Face Expulsion.

146
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,200
So We All Know
How This Works.

147
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,900
Look, No One Talks,
No One Gets Into Trouble.

148
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,500
Who Did Break In, Anyway?

149
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,900
I Guess We Don't He To Worry About Nate
Cracking Under Pressure.

150
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,300
So Are We All Agreed?

151
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,600
Agreed.

152
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,200
Look, Blair, I-I Know You Have
Your Sights Set On Yale,

153
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,300
But This--This Skull And Bones
Stuff Is A Bit Much,

154
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,100
Don't You Think?

155
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,400
Maybe, But It Works...

156
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,300
Every Time.

157
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,100
You Know, When Someone
Says "Every Time,"

158
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,400
It Sounds Like--Like--Like
More Than A Few Times.

159
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,600
Erything's Gonna Be Fine.

160
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,200
Were You Just
In The Same Assembly As Me?

161
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,400
Do You Really Think
She's Gonna Expel Two-Thirds
Of The Junior Class?

162
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,900
Look, I Got You Into This.

163
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,200
I'm Gonna Get You Out Of It,
Okay?

164
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,900
Trust Me.

165
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
There's A Weak Link
In Every Chain,

166
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,400
And It's Just A Matter Of Time
Before This One Snaps.

167
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,900
I'm Innocent.

168
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,900
Well... Except For
A Crime Of Passion.

169
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,700
I Did Something Stupid
With Someone.

170
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,500
And Even Worse
Than Doing That Stupid Thing,

171
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
I Did The Same Stupid Thing
With Someone Else

172
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,000
And Pretended I Had Never Done
That Stupid Thing Before.

173
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,600
You Look Confused.

174
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,900
Should I Walk You Through It?

175
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,200
Let's Stay On Point.

176
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,600
I Reviewed Your Record.

177
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,100
It's Pristine.

178
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,500
If Constance Has A Shining Star,
It's Blair Waldorf.

179
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,000
I Would Never
Have Expected This From You.

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,300
I Know. I'm The Perfect One.

181
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Ms. Waldorf,
Who Broke Into The Pool?

182
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,300
Like You Said, My Unfortunate
Participation In Said Party

183
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,700
Was Entirely
Out Of Character.

184
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,000
I Don't Know Anything
About It.

185
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
You're Taking That Paper
Seriously.

186
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,300
This Isn't A Paper. It's...

187
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,500
It's A Heartfelt Letter
To Blair.

188
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,900
A Heartfelt Letter?

189
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,000
Who Spayed You, Man?

190
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Blair Doesn't Even Want You.

191
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,100
She's Been Crystal About That
Since We Got Back.

192
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,300
Didn't Seem That Way
En She Kissed Me At The Pool.

193
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,300
She Kissed You?

194
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,900
Well, I Kissed Her, But...

195
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,400
Yep.

196
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
What Was She Like? Into It? Or Was She More Like--

197
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,800
Of Course She Was Into It, Man.
What Do You Think?

198
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah, I Know, But, Uh...
You Know Blair...

199
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,900
Yes, I Do.

200
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,000
I Think She Wants Me
To Suffer A Little More.

201
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,600
You Know,
Even The Playing Field?

202
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,800
It's Worth It,
Believe Me.

203
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,100
Hey, Dad. Listen, Uh,
I-I Got Your 1,001 Messages.

204
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,500
I Just Haven't Had A Chance
To Get Back To Ya.
Yeah, That's Not Gonna Work.

205
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,300
I Guess You Heard From
The New Headmistress.
Look, I Know How Upset

206
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,600
And Apparently, Some Of The Kids
Who Were At The Party

207
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,000
Didn't Even Tell
Their Parents.
Look, You Don't Have To Say

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,800
I-I Regret Even
Leaving The House Saturday.
Yeah, But If You Know

209
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,800
Keep You Out Of Trouble,
Then You Need To Cooperate.
I Don't.

210
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Dan, Don't Think For A Second

211
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,700
These Other Kids Aren't Gonna
Be Looking Out For Themselves.

212
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,700
You Need To Do The Same.
All Right?

213
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,900
I Hope I'm Not
Interrupting Anything.

214
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,600
I Just Got A Message
That Our Kids Are In

215
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,700
Some Kind Of Trouble At School.
And You Came All The Way
To Brooklyn To Talk About It?

216
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,500
No, No, Not About That.

217
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Um, Bart And I
Just Landed At The Airport

218
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Back From Our Trip,
And He Proposed,

219
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,200
And I'm Going To Say Yes.

220
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,200
I Wanted You
To Hear It From Me First,

221
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,600
Not From My Daughter
Or Your Son.

222
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Right, The People
Who Actually Talk To Me.
Oh, If You're Referring

223
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,700
You Left Me
On Christmas Day,

224
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,800
I Didn't Get It Until
We Were Already On The Plane.

225
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,100
It Was Very Endearing,
Though.

226
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,100
But Not Enough
To Turn The G5 Around?

227
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,400
You Miss Me. That's Great.
I Miss You, Too.

228
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,900
What? You Kissed Me
At Eleanor's Party,

229
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,600
And Then You Say

230
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,100
You Can't See Me Anymore
Because Your Wife Came Home,

231
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,300
And Then You Call And Say
You Should've Never Let Me Go,

232
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,100
And Then You're
Back With Alison Again.

233
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,000
I Didn't Plan Any Of That.
That Is Just It With You, Rufus.
You Don't Even Plan Anything.

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,400
Well, I'm Sure
That Your Current Plan

235
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Will Be Full Of Private Jets
And 5-Star Hotels.

236
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,100
Take Care, Rufus.

237
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,600
Do You Really Have
To Show This To Me Now?

238
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,200
Trust Me When I Say
You're Gonna Wanna See This

239
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,800
Before You Enter
Blair Waldorf's Evil Lair.
It's A Homework Group, Vanessa.

240
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,500
We're Just Gonna Be
Writing Papers, You Know?

241
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,000
Here.

242
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,300
I Wasn't Sure What It Was

243
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,200
Till I Got It Home And Saw It
On The Computer, But--
Okay, That's Chuck. Wh--Wh...

244
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,900
What Are You Holding Here?
It's A Key.

245
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,500
Spotted--Lonely Boy Learning

246
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,600
That When The Punishment
Fits The Crime,

247
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,000
There's No Reason You Can't
Serve Your Sentence In Style.

248
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,200
Yay! You're Here.
I Thought We Were Gonna
Work On Our Papers.

249
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,500
We Are.
One Night At Bilboquet,

250
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,000
Kati And Is Made Out With A Guy
In Cornell's Ethics Program.

251
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,300
They're Getting Tips Now.

252
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,100
I Thought I Told You
You Couldn't Film Me.

253
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,200
Come Here.

254
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,500
You Are So Naive.
Michael Moore Over There

255
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,600
Is Obviously Just Using
This Film To Get Close To Dan.
No, She Needs That Grant Money.

256
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,500
So Did You Bring
Your Legal Pad?

257
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,600
You Wait Here. I'll Find Us
A Quiet Place To Work.

258
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,900
Okay.

259
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,400
I Can't Believe
You Brought That Here.

260
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,100
It's Evidence.
Give It To Me.

261
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,400
Chuck.

262
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,100
You Need To Tell The Truth.

263
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,600
Whatever Happened To
"Don't Speak Until Spoken To"?

264
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,400
I Just Saw You With That Key.
I Know You Had It At The Party.

265
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,800
Poor Little Humphrey Dumpty.

266
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,900
Look, Let Me Clarify Something
For You.

267
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,700
Regardless Of Who You're
Currently Sleeping With,

268
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,500
You And I Come
From Different Worlds.

269
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,700
In My World,
If I'm Suspended Or Expelled,

270
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,700
A Wing Is Donated
In The Bass Name.

271
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,800
That Sounds Like
Quite A World.

272
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,300
Well, It's Not Perfect,
I'll Admit.

273
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,600
But One Thing It Does Offer
In Spades Is Security.

274
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
My Family Can Take Care
Of Me.

275
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,900
What Do The Humphreys Have
To Offer?

276
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,200
Used Metrocards?

277
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,800
Your Dad's Cassingle?

278
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,100
And In Case
You Were Wondering, You Narc,

279
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,200
I Only Took The Key
From The Party To Hide It

280
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,700
So We Didn't All Get Blamed...
Including You.

281
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
Blair.
Nate.
What Are You Doing Here?

282
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,100
I, Uh, Wanted To Talk To You.
I Brought You This.

283
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,900
It's A Love Letter.

284
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,700
A Hostess Can't Hide
In Her Room. It's Unladylike.

285
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Hey. Hey,
Where Are You Going?

286
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,900
I Made Us A Study Area
In The Other Room.
You Know What? I'm Just Gonna

287
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,600
I-I Think--I Think
Chuck Is Right.
Wait. Chuck?

288
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600
No, The Guy Has A Point,
Actually.

289
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,100
Maybe The Reason None Of
You Guys Take This Seriously

290
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,200
Is Because For You
It's Not.
No, It Is.

291
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,900
Vanessa, Please, Some Space.
I'm Sorry.
Sorry.

292
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,000
Look, I'm All For Loyalty

293
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,900
And I'm All
For Sticking Together,

294
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,700
But We Are Not
In The Same Boat Here.

295
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,400
I'm On A Partial Scholarship.
My Parents Have No Way

296
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Of Buying My Way Back
Into This School, Or Any Other.

297
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,300
And I Know This Isn't Going
To Be A Popular Opinion

298
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,600
With--With Your
Band Of Brothers,

299
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,000
But If The Person Who Brought
That Key Refuses To Step Up,

300
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,200
Then Anybody Who Knows Anything
Has The Right To Say Something.

301
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,800
Do--Do You Know Who It Is?

302
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,100
You Do, Don't You, And You're
Not Gonna Say Anything?

303
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,100
Dan, Please.
You Don't Understand.

304
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,600
You're Right.
I-I Mean, I Don't Understand.

305
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,800
Hey, Let Go Of Me, Bass.
Drop Your Archibald Habit
First.

306
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
You Know I Already Have.
Really? A Kiss Does Sort Of
Send The Wrong Signal.

307
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,200
Let's Not Waste Time Denying.

308
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,800
You Know What? I'm Tired
Of This. Go Ahead And Tell Him.
Really?

309
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,500
You Want Me To Tell Him
How You Slept With Me

310
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,100
And Then Faked Your Virginity
For Him?
I'll Just Tell Him

311
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,600
And Who Do You Think
He'll Believe?

312
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,500
You, Who Bangs Anything
In His Field Of Vision,

313
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Or Me, His Pure And Honest
Girlfriend Of Many Years?
Well, Now He'll Believe Me.

314
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Why?

315
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,700
I Have Proof.

316
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
Good Eye, Docu-Girl.
I'll Take The Tape Now.

317
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,300
You Knew She Was Watching?

318
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,500
This Is My House.
That Tape Belongs To Me.

319
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,700
Actually, This Is My Footage,
And Thanks To Both Of You,

320
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,300
I Think I Got A New Angle
On My Subject.
Hey, Vanessa,

321
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,300
If You Think I'm Gonna...
Let Go Of Me.

322
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,900
Let You Walk Out Of Here
With That Tape, You're Crazy.
Hey!

323
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,200
Last Time I Checked,
I Still Owe You A Black Eye.

324
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,000
So Unless This Is You Coming
To Claim It, Stay Away From Her.

325
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,100
Now That Sex And Lies
Have Been Caught On Videotape,

326
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,900
V.'S Documentary Just Became

327
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,700
The Most Anticipated
New Release Of The Year.

328
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,900
Rufus.
What Are You Doing Here?
I'm Not Leaving A Message

329
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,600
From The Courtyard This Time.
Well, I Can See That.

330
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,900
But Five Minutes Ago,
My Kids Would've--
Why Did You Really Come

331
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,900
I Told You.
Out Of Respect For--
Respect Or Regret?

332
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,400
You Wanted Me
To Give You A Reason

333
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,100
Not To Spend The Rest
Of Your Life With Bart Bass.
Rufus...

334
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,500
I'm Still In Love With You.

335
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,900
So What Exactly
Are You Offering, Rufus?

336
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,400
Some Retrospective

337
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,300
Of The Way We Were
Over A Decade Ago?

338
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,100
Look, We're Not 20
And On The Road.

339
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,200
Thank God We're Not,
Because Your Mother

340
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,000
Made This Decision For You
Back Then, Remember?
Yes. Mm.

341
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,700
Look...

342
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,400
I Don't Know Exactly

343
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,800
What It Would Even Mean
For Us To Be Together.

344
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,300
But Can You Look At Me

345
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,600
And Tell Me You're Not
The Least Bit Curious?

346
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,600
You're At The Same Crossroads
You Were Years Ago.

347
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,300
Claim Your Life This Time.

348
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,200
Live It The Way
You Want To Live It.

349
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,000
I Did It.
I Broke Into The School.

350
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,200
After All Your Family
Has Been Through This Year,

351
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
I'm Surprised To Learn

352
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,900
That You're Behind
Something Like This.

353
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,700
I Know, I Know.
And I Apologize.

354
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,600
From What I Can See,
You Always Seem To Be

355
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,200
Toeing The Line Of Mediocrity,
Nathaniel.

356
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,000
Your Grades Are Average At Best,
Almost As Though

357
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,600
You're Not Committed To School
Or Your Future.

358
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,800
Can We Just Move On

359
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,000
To The Punishment Part
Of This Meeting, Please?

360
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,800
Certainly.

361
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,500
But I'm Curious.

362
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,800
Can You Please Describe
How You Broke Into The School?

363
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,400
I Can Do Betr.
I Can Show You.

364
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,500
And How Did You Get Access
To This Key?

365
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,500
You're Not On The Swim Team.
Not A Janitor, Right?
No.

366
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,900
Where's The Key Chain?
The Key Chain?

367
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,400
Do You Remember Its Color?
Size?

368
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,400
What It's Made Of?

369
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,800
Anything At All?

370
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,900
Who Are You Trying
To Protect?

371
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,400
May I Have A Word?

372
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,300
Off Camera.

373
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,300
Uh, Sure. But I Think I Know
What You're Gonna Say.

374
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,400
And I Can Save You
The Indignity Of Groveling

375
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,500
By Telling You Right Now--No Way
Are You Gonna Get That Tape.

376
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,600
I Wasn't Going To Grovel,

377
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,500
And The Fact That You Even
Went There Makes It Clear

378
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,900
You Have No Idea
Who You're Dealing With.
What Are You Gonna Do To Me,

379
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,400
Blackball Me From Eating Yogurt
On The Met Steps?

380
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,500
You Have Nothing I Need.
You Put That Footage
In Your Film,

381
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,900
You Won't Be Able To Show It.
I Won't Sign A Release.

382
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,600
I'm Not Looking For
A Distribution Deal,

383
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,800
Just A Local Arts Grant
So I Can Pay My Rent.

384
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,900
Now If You'll Excuse Me...

385
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,700
You're In My Shot.

386
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,400
What's That,
Your Stripper Money?

387
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,700
$10,000 For The Tape.

388
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,000
You Think I'd Take
Your Money?

389
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,400
Yes, I Do.
I Know Girlsilike You.

390
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,100
You Act Like
Money's Not Important.

391
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,300
The Truth Is,
Money's Important To Everyone.

392
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,500
And I Thought Blair
Was Manipulative.

393
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,900
Blair's An Amateur.
She Thinks You're Just Like Her.

394
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,200
To Blair,

395
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
This Money Is A Couple Pairs
Of Manolos And A Chanel Bag.

396
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,600
But I Know
That This Much Cash

397
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,700
Can Make A Real Difference
In Your Life.

398
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
You're Sick.

399
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,200
You're Welcome.

400
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Who Knew B. And C.
Were Such Patrons Of The Arts?

401
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,600
Call It Philanthropy
Or Bribery.

402
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,900
It Looks Like
Everyone Has Their Price.

403
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,300
Something On Your Mind,
Lily?

404
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,900
Uh...

405
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,900
Yeah?

406
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,400
What Are You Saying?

407
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,100
I'm Sorry. It's Sheldon.

408
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,900
He Has Those Numbers
I Was Asking For.

409
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,000
Do You Mind?

410
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,500
No.
Yeah.

411
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,300
Just Make Sure He Gets It
At The Current Rate.

412
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,400
The Dollar's
Been All Over The Place.

413
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,800
Hello?

414
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,000
I Was Thinking
About What You Said.

415
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,400
Let's Do It.

416
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,300
Let's See What We Are.
Let's See What We Could Be.

417
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,100
Who Is This?
Rufus...

418
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,800
Lily, This Is Great.
Do You Know How Great This Is?

419
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,700
Well, Yes. I Mean, I-I Do.
I Mean, I Think So.
Let's Go Away Tonight.

420
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,700
Let's Get Away
From Everyone, Everything,

421
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,900
Just Figure It Out.
Wh-Where Would We Go?

422
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,900
Who Cares?

423
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,900
Okay, Sounds Like A Plan.

424
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,700
Um... 90th And 5th. 6:00?

425
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,800
Okay.

426
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,100
I'm Scared, Rufus...

427
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,500
In A Good Way.

428
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,400
Me, Too.

429
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,500
Settle Down, Please.

430
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,700
Yesterday, I Talked About
The Serious Consequences...
Proof. Worth Every Penny.

431
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,000
For Your Dishonorable Actions,

432
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
And Obviously,
You Didn't Believe Me.

433
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,400
But Someone Came Forward Today
And Claimed Responsibility...

434
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Do You Know Who?

435
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,900
For A Crime He Did Not Commit.

436
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,900
And Although I Appreciate
His Self-Sacrifice,

437
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,500
I Don't Abide Dishonesty.

438
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,300
And I Think It's Time
You All Know How Serious I Am.

439
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,000
Nathaniel Archibald
Is Suspended From St. Jude's.

440
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,300
And, Yes, This Will Go On
His Transcript.

441
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,600
Effective Immediately.

442
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,300
Mr. Archibald,

443
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,000
You Know Where
To Find The Exit.

444
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,800
This Just In--Nate Archibald,
Dead Man Walking.

445
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,300
We Hear St. Jude's
Has A New Policy--

446
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,000
An Eye For A Lie.

447
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,100
Watch Him Go, Students.

448
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,900
Who Wants To Be Next?

449
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,700
Until One Of You Comes Forward,
We'll Keep Going

450
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,700
Until Every Last One Of You
Has Walked Out That Door.

451
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,100
I Don't Believe This.

452
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,600
Dan, It's Okay.
Serena, I-I Can't--
I Can't Get Expelled.

453
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,300
I Cannot Get Suspended.

454
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,200
My Whole Future
Is Riding On This.

455
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,700
If You Know Who Broke In,
Then Why Won't You Give Them Up?

456
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,800
Because It Was Me.

457
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,500
So Why--Why Didn't You
Tell Me Right Away?

458
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,500
'Cause I Didn't Want You
To Judge Me.
Aren't We Already Beyond That?

459
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,900
And I Didn't Want You To Know
Because I Didn't Want You

460
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,600
To Have To Be In
The Position You're In Now

461
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,100
Of Having To Choose Between

462
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,900
Protecting Me
And Helping Yourself.
So How'd You Even Get In?

463
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,400
I Have A Key.
You Had A Key To The Pool?

464
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
All Right, What Happened
To Being Beyond This?

465
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
Sorry.

466
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,700
The End Of Freshman Year,

467
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,600
I Kind Of Dated
The Swim Team Captain,

468
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,500
And He Gave Me A Key
So That We Could...

469
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,200
You Know, Meet Up, And...
That's--Enough Said.

470
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,000
And Saturday Night--
What Happened Then?

471
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,700
Well, Blair And I
Ran Out Of Places To Go,

472
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,300
And She Knew
I Still Had A Key,

473
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,000
And... Before I Knew It,
It's Like We Were All There.

474
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,700
And I Thought It Was
Just Gonna Be Us Girls.

475
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,000
And Then Everybody
Got On Their Phone,

476
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And More People Started
Showing Up, And...

477
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,700
I Just Never Thought
Anybody Was Gonna Get Hurt.

478
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,400
Yeah. Well, You Can Still
Tell Queller The Truth.

479
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,200
I Think She'll Respect
Your Honesty.
Yeah, Like She Respected Nate's?

480
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
No, Nate Lied.

481
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,600
And Besides,
You're Serena Van Der Woodsen.

482
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,900
You Didn't Know Me
Before I Went Away.

483
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,300
Barely Got Back
Into Constance.

484
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,500
If I Got Expelled,

485
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,800
I Don't Think Any School
In Town Would Take Me.

486
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,400
I'm Sure That's Not True.

487
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,700
I Can't Risk Going Back
To Boarding School,

488
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,000
Being Away From You And Eric.

489
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,600
But I Don't Want You
To Lose Your Future.

490
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,600
Wow. Oh, Wow.

491
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,300
You Really Can Be

492
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,400
Damned If You Do
And Screwed If You Don't.

493
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Dan Humphrey,

494
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,100
Headmistress Queller
Is Requesting

495
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,500
To See Y U Iher Office
After Class.

496
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,950
Nate.

497
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,760
Hey. Are You Okay?

498
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,460
Yeah,I'll Be Fine. It's,Uh...

499
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,520
My Parents Have So Much Other Stuff Going On Right Now...

500
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,160
They'll Get Over It. Either Way,It Was Worth It.

501
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,430
Worth It? Yes. Blair,I Know How Much Your Future Means To You.

502
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,030
And You've Worked So Hard For Yale And Everything--

503
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,600
What Are You Talking About?

504
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,090
You Don't Have To Lie. I Saw The Key In Your Bedroom.

505
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,330
That Key Isn't Mine.

506
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,440
I Was St Hiding It For Someone Else.

507
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,600
Wait...

508
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,470
That's Why You Were Suspended?

509
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,900
You Told The Headmistress It Was Yours

510
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,610
Because You Thought It Was Mine?

511
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,530
That's The Most Romantic Thing Anyone Has Ever Done For Me.

512
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,650
I Love You.

513
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,280
Please. You And I Just Can't Happen Right Now.

514
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,950
Why Not?

515
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,980
I Don't Want To Be With You.

516
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,460
Good Catching Up.

517
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,440
You're Home Early.

518
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,880
Please Don't Tell Me You're Expelled. Not Yet.

519
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,460
Your Position At That School Is Already Too Precarious.

520
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,550
One False Move, And You Know What?

521
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,280
I Can't Do Anything To Help You. I Know. I Know.

522
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,110
I Just Wanna Hide Under The Covers

523
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:24,680
And Make It All Go Away. And Apparently,You Do,Too.

524
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,060
You And Bart Just Got Back. Why Are You Packing Again?

525
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,260
Well,I Was Just Gonna Go For A,You Know,

526
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,710
A Little Spa Trip For The Weekend.

527
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,750
'Cause You're So Stressed Out From Your Vacation?

528
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,600
Aren't You Gonna Answer That? No,I Don't Think So.

529
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,590
Mom, Is Dan's Dad The Reason

530
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,600
You Haven't Answered Bart's Proposal?

531
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,580
You Can't.

532
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,270
Please,Mom,Not This One.

533
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,180
Look,I Will Not Base My Personal Life

534
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,600
On Your Preferences.

535
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,530
Dan Is My Boyfriend.

536
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,500
And I Know We're Too Young To Talk About Forever,

537
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,220
But Right Now That's What It Feels Like.

538
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,400
I Know It Does,Sweetie, But-- But What?

539
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,330
Tell Me That Rufus Is That Important To You.

540
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,110
Tell Me That Whatever The Two Of You Have

541
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,940
Is The Most Important Thing In Your Life,

542
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,160
Because That's What Dan Is To Me,Mom.

543
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,890
The Most Important.

544
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:41,670
I Would Rather Be Chuck's Stepsister Than Dan's.

545
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,250
Please Don't Do This To Me.

546
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,690
Dan Means That Much To You?

547
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,340
Yeah,He Does.

548
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,490
In Fact,I Have To Go. Wait. Where?

549
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,720
School. There's Something I Have To Do.

550
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,230
And I Hope There's Something You Have To Do,Too.

551
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,830
What Are You Doing Here?

552
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,450
I Brought This For You.

553
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,570
What's The Catch?

554
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,020
I Know This Might Come As A Shock,

555
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,780
But Not Everyone Operates From An Agenda.

556
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,170
In Fact, Some People Do Things

557
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,320
Simply Because It's The Decent Thing To Do.

558
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,770
Smash It,Burn It,Whatever. There Are No Copies.

559
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,470
What About The One You Gave To Chuck?

560
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,560
It's Blank,Which I'm Sure He'll Be Thrilled To Discover.

561
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,820
And About What's On That Tape-- Having Observed You

562
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,890
In Your Natural Habitat These Past Few Days...

563
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,750
Nate Seems Like One Of The Good Guys,

564
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,390
And You Seem To Really Care About Him.

565
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,860
Mr. Humphrey,You Have A Partial Scholarship At St. Jude's.

566
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,880
You Are Number Two In Your Class,

567
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,960
Have A Stellar Recommendation For Dartmouth From J.L. Hall.

568
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,050
It Looks As If Your Dreams Are Well Within Grasp.

569
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,210
Thank You,Thank You. Yeah,I Guess They Are.

570
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,470
But It Seems You're In With A N Crowd This Year,

571
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,340
Dating Serena Van Der Woodsen...

572
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,630
Is That On My File?

573
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,760
Who Had The Key To The School?

574
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,790
I Don't Know.

575
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,720
Let Me Remind You One Last Time

576
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,760
That You Are In A Different Position Than The Others.

577
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,260
You Need This School.

578
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,700
Headmistress Queller, I Have Something To Tell You.

579
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,740
I Must Say,Your File Reads More Like A Rap Sheet.

580
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,070
You Cut More Sophomore Classes Than You Attended,

581
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:53,860
Cheated On Tests, Talked Back To Teachers. Look,I Understand That This Is A Serious Matter.

582
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,140
That's Why It's Important To Me

583
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,800
That You Know-- You Being New Here--

584
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,310
That The Person That You Just Described

585
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,740
Is Not W I Am Anymore.

586
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,300
Oh,No? Who Are You Now?

587
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,210
Well,My Grades Are Up,

588
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,360
My Attendance Is Nearly Perfect,

589
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,510
And I've Stayed Out Of Trouble.

590
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,440
Until Now.

591
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,120
Please Understand

592
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,650
That I Never Intended For Anything Bad To Happen.

593
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:22,890
And It May Have Taken Some Time, But I Am Here Now,

594
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,220
Accepting Responsibility For My Actions.

595
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,580
Whatever You Think Is Fair.

596
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,000
Yes,Let's Discuss The...

597
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,960
Consequences.

598
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,190
Ahem.

599
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,280
I'll Be Brief.

600
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,720
And...

601
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,860
I'll Be Not Interested. Is That How You Speak To The Person

602
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,390
Who Just Paid Your Rent For A Year? What Did You Just Say?

603
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,240
Congratulations,Vanessa.

604
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,770
You Just Won 365 More Days In Your Ikea-Furnished Closet.

605
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,920
You Went To My Building? You Talked To My Landlord?

606
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,320
No,I Don't Speak Ukrainian,

607
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,920
But I Do Speak Envelope Of Cash.

608
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,780
And He Understood Me Perfectly.

609
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,140
I Can't Believe You. Blair Waldorf Is Not Indebted To Anyone,

610
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,020
No Matter How Much I Appreciate What You Did.

611
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,730
You're Welcome,I Guess?

612
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,950
Good. Now This Transaction Is Finished,

613
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,630
And I'm Free To Return To Disliking You.

614
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,350
I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way.

615
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,140
Oh,And One More Thing.

616
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,410
If You Didn't Pay Your Rent With It,

617
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:47,080
What Did You Do With Chuck's Money?

618
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,230
I May Have Created

619
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,200
A Medical Grant For Teens With Genital Herpes...

620
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,010
In His Name.

621
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,150
I Can't Believe She Didn't Expel Me.

622
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,990
Yeah,I Know. It's Shocking.

623
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,160
I--You--25 Hours Of Community Outreach.

624
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,180
That's Not Bad At All.

625
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,910
I Mean,I Probably Would've Done It Anyway

626
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,550
Being As I'm On The Committee. That Had Occurred To Me. Yeah.

627
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,200
Wait. What Are You Saying?

628
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,070
No,No,I'm Not Saying Anything. Believe Me.

629
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,910
So You Don't Buy What She Said

630
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,240
About Me Being The Poster Child For The New Honor Code?

631
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,340
Look,I Know For A Fact

632
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,520
My Mom Didn't Plead My Case Or Donate Anything,Okay? I Didn't Say A Thing.

633
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,950
Are You Really Turning This

634
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,590
Into An "Upstairs,Downstairs" Thing?

635
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,060
No. No,You Are. I'm Being Completely Silent.

636
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,390
I'm Just Happy That You're Not Being Expelled

637
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,730
Or Leaving Town Anytime Soon. Are You Hungry? We Should... Always.

638
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,120
But You Still Believe That There's A Double Standard,

639
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,570
That People Like Me Get Specl Trtrtment.

640
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:46,480
Ms. Van Der Woodsen. Your Mother Sent Me To Pick You Up.

641
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,400
Oh. Great.

642
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,880
That Was... Thoughtful.

643
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,410
I Think You Get No Special Treatment At All.

644
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,980
Your Life Is Completely Uncharmed And... Average.

645
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,180
It's Okay. I'll Walk.

646
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,850
No,Come On. I'm--I Was Kidding. I Was Kidding.

647
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,760
You Going To Brooklyn?

648
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,440
It's A Rare Occasion

649
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,320
To Celebrate The Merging Of Two Families.

650
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,340
And I Couldn't Be Happier To Be Here Tonight

651
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,850
To Celebrate Lily's Acceptance Of My Proposal.

652
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,590
So To My Lovely Bride

653
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,940
And Our Growing Family.

654
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,310
You Packed Light.

655
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,900
Please Try To Understand.

656
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,190
I Think I Do.

657
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,350
I'm Just Sorry.

658
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,640
So Am I.

659
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,760
Mom Looks About As Happy As Grandma At Last Call. I Know.

660
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,500
It Seems Bart's Personality-- Or Lack Thereof--Is Contagious.

661
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,060
I Don't Even Know

662
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,810
How She Breathes With Her Blouse Buttoned That High.

663
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,580
How Glad Are You To See Our Families Merge,Sis?

664
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,700
So Glad That If You Ever Call Me That Again,

665
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,240
It'll Be The Last Thing You Ever Say,Chuck.

666
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,170
I Love It--Our First Brother/Sister Squabble.

667
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,700
I Hope You're Going To Make Yourself Available

668
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:13,240
For More Missed Childhood Memories--

669
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,670
Bathing Together, For Example.

670
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,640
You're Probably Wondering Why I Asked You Here.

671
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,660
After Our Last Conversation, Yeah.

672
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,050
Do You Think It's Possible

673
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,240
For Two People Who Have Been Through As Much As We Have

674
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,820
To Really Forgive And Forget?

675
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,080
If We Really Want To, I Think We Can.

676
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,700
A Lot Of Mistakes Have Been Made.

677
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,090
If You're Ready To Forgive Me...

678
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,410
Then Nothing Can Tear Us Apart.

679
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,130
I Promise.

680
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,710
What You Said Before...

681
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,970
I Love You,Too.

682
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,130
Always Have,Always Will.

683
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,100
So...

684
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,170
Your New Stepbrother Told Me About Your Problem At School.

685
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,760
Frankly,I Wasn't Surprised,

686
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,670
Given Your Propensity For Recklessness And Adventure.

687
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,250
I'm Sorry?

688
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,300
Don't Tell Your Mother, But I Made A Call.

689
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,670
You Did What? It Was Harder Than Usual.

690
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,280
That New Headmistress Of Yours Is A Real Piece Of Work.

691
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,370
I Had To Go Over Her Head.

692
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,530
Sorry I Couldn't Get The Charges Completely Dropped,But,Um...

693
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,420
At Least I Got You A Minimal Sentence.

694
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,390
One Thing About Being On The Inside--

695
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,320
Once You Get There,

696
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,840
You Don't Always Get To Choose Where You Stand... Or Sit.

697
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,920
I Was Just Looking Out For My Family.

698
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,320
The New Van Der Woodsen/Bass Library

699
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,820
Should Be Completed For Eric's Graduation.

700
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,400
I Can See That Lily And I

701
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,060
Are Gonna Have Our Hands Full With The Two Of You.

702
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,940
Will You Excuse Me? I Need Some Air.

703
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,630
Sometimes You Need To Step Outside,

704
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,600
Clear Your Head

705
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,740
And Remind Yourself Of Who You Are...

706
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,070
And Where You Want To Be.

707
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,600
Hey. Aren't You Supposed To Be At Your Mom's Engagement Thing?

708
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,260
Yeah,Well, I Had To Get Out Of There.

709
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,550
It Was Getting A Little Hard To Breathe,You Know?

710
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,390
Those Parties Can Be That Way.

711
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,650
So Are You,Um, Packing Up Your Music?

712
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,530
Nah. I Just...

713
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,010
Need To Find Something New To Write About.

714
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,860
And I Will.

715
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,160
Hey. You're A Little Overdressed

716
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,710
For The Study Date I Didn't Know We Had.

717
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,380
You Were Right About Everything.

718
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,070
You Wanna Talk About It?

719
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,770
Can I Just Sit Here With You For A While?

720
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,660
Yeah.

721
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,560
Chaucer? Yeah,I Got A Test On Friday.

722
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,340
Mine's Thursday.

723
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:39,370
And Sometimes You Have To Venture Outside Your World

724
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,530
In Order To Find Yourself.

725
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,930
As For Me, I'm Happy Right Where I Am.

726
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,000
I Only Wanna Be With You.

727
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,070
X.O.X.O.,Gossip Girl.
