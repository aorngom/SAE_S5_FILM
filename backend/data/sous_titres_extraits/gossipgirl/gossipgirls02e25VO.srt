1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,650
Gossip girl here--

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,030
Your one and only source

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,740
Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,270
Georgina? where are you?

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,780
You can tell jesus that the bitch is back.

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,970
- Emma.   - Got a credit card fake i.d.

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,470
And i want bacardi and a boy.

8
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,010
That beautiful dinner you made--

9
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,370
You were gonna propose weren't you?

10
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,020
I just don't know where we stand right now.

11
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,040
Tell me if what you feel for me is real.

12
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,260
It's just a game.

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,970
- Chuck why did you just do that? - Because i love her.

14
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,430
I can't believe blair won!

15
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,460
Yeah, who even voted for her?

16
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,860
- Me. about 150 times. - That was really sweet.

17
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,540
I just wanted to make sure she had the perfect night.

18
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,120
- Where's the prom king?   - We broke up.

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,990
But everything was so perfect.

20
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,860
Turns out fairy tales end when they do for a reason.

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,800
Like everything on the upper east side

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,940
High school graduation is done a little differently.

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,420
Who needs pomp and circumstance when you have paparazzi?

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,980
Ever since "gossip girl" broke my arrest

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,920
It has been everywhere.

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,420
Do you know eric found it in "pravda"?

27
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,470
You're famous because you got arrested.

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,610
Of course this happened to you.

29
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,460
I just can't wait for this day to be over.

30
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,840
The end of high school means the end of me on "gossip girl."

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,620
No, she has plagued you more than anyone.

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,440
You were her first blast ninth grade, if i remember correctly.

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,410
It involved a white dress some rain

34
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,470
And a recently docked aircraft carrier?

35
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,360
Okay, let's just hope that my mug shot is

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,180
The last thing she ever prints about me.

37
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,310
Look on the bright side.

38
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,130
Gossip girl does not report on college

39
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,110
So this is your last day to be under her rule.

40
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,960
Okay   can you just take my mind off of me?

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,340
- Talk about anything.  - Did he say it like...

42
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,140
- Anything but-- "i love her"?   - "i love her"?

43
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,770
- "i love her?"   - i totally set myself up for that one.

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,850
B.i don't know why you're acting like this is new information.

45
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,230
You know how chuck feels about you.

46
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,510
The problem isn't his feelings.

47
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,220
It's his inability to express them to the right person.

48
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,520
Who cares who he tells if he doesn't tell me?

49
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,460
Does he even know that you and nate broke up?

50
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,060
Have you not told him?

51
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,290
It's not like we stay up at night

52
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,180
Braiding each other's hair and having heart-to-hearts.

53
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,590
Then why are we still here? we've already paid the check.

54
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,060
Serena.

55
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,940
- So we'll meet afterwards for the party. - will do.

56
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,120
- Good luck up there, son. i'm proud of you.  - Thanks.

57
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,540
It's like getting a smile from the president.

58
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,310
And how are you?

59
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,740
I'm good. and you?

60
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,280
Good, good. i start my internship

61
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,960
At the mayor's office next week.so that's the big news.

62
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,550
As for today i got my mom and my grandpa

63
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,460
To agree to sit together so that's something.

64
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,260
- And things with you and  - Blair?

65
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,490
Yeah, it's over. but it's okay.

66
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,720
It turns out,we just had to go through something to be sure.

67
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,270
Ever since it ended i can't stop thinking

68
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,350
About how horribly i handled everything between us.

69
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,750
So i just wanted to say i'm sorry.

70
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,350
Thanks.

71
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,070
It means a lot. and thanks for what you did last year.

72
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,310
If i hadn't taken the s.a.t.s i'd never be going to n.y.u.

73
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,570
Right after i get back from my

74
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,660
Backpacking trip through europe, of course.

75
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,890
Look at us--so civilized.

76
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,160
Hey stop by my party tonight.

77
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,970
Party? what party?

78
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,260
After-grad party.

79
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,060
I figured i'd at least do something

80
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,700
To commemorate my time here. so i hope to see you there.

81
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,100
Both of you.

82
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,730
Is that a program?

83
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,010
Yeah. and smile.

84
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,140
Today's the first day of the rest of your life.

85
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,120
Way ahead of you.

86
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,560
This graduation is a celebration for us   too.

87
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,650
No more mean girls.

88
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,310
We have suffered under their dictatorship for way too long.

89
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,470
Starting next fall, there'll be peace in the kingdom.

90
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,480
J. wanna throw your hat in the ring?

91
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,260
What are you talking about?

92
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,050
Queen. what else is there to talk about?

93
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,960
The fact that there's not gonna be a queen next year?

94
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,600
What would high school be without hierarchy?

95
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,730
Bearable? a nice place to spend time?

96
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,580
Ladies.

97
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,850
I thought we were matching our headbands under our caps.

98
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,630
- What's going on? - your minions were just telling me

99
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,140
About the search for the next queen.

100
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,550
They don't get to choose the next queen. i do.

101
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,650
And take off that hideous scarf, penelope.

102
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,020
You can see if from space.

103
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,190
Not so fast   j. don't waste your time appealing to blair.

104
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,960
We don't listen to her anymore.

105
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,380
The coronation happens at midnight at nate archibald's party.

106
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,380
Whoever brings us the biggest piece of untold

107
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,860
Constance gossip wins and you've got competition.

108
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,470
The new girl   emma boardman transferring in next year.

109
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,340
Nice to meet you   little j.

110
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,040
See you at midnight? unless you want to concede right now...

111
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,200
Oh   and next year

112
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,060
You don't want to take the subway to school.

113
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,990
You're more than welcome to sleep at my house. it's on park.

114
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,820
Well   so much for that.

115
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,610
At least we have all summer to prepare for hell.

116
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,890
No. the cycle of abuse must be broken.

117
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,160
The monarchy ends tonight.

118
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,410
Hey. why are you sitting here all alone?

119
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,260
I'm waiting to approve a special insert

121
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:42,459
My name was left off the list of graduates.

122
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:45,000
Fate sure knows how to run with a bit.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,352
Well at least you're special.

124
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:48,656
- Mr. Humphrey? - Oh thank you.

125
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:51,488
"We apologize for the inadvertent omission

126
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:53,488
"of Daniel Humphrey from the graduation program.

127
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:56,624
He is indeed graduating. Congratulations Don."

128
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,591
That's perfect.

129
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,846
I haven't seen you around.

130
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:13,439
Have you been looking?

131
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,053
How are you?

132
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,614
I'm fine.

133
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:20,318
No  I'm great.

134
00:06:20,383 --> 00:06:23,389
Um  But I could be better.

135
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:28,060
I... was wondering if you heard that I...

136
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,789
I'm...

137
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:34,203
I'm so happy high school's over.

138
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,564
Congratulations.

139
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,132
You too.

140
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,668
Everyone  let's line up

141
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:40,139
So we can make our way down  please.

142
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:41,668
Girls on on side   boys on the other

143
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,132
Girls on on side   boys on the other

144
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:45,307
Right. Well good luck up there.

145
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,284
How could I have forgotten?

146
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:55,563
We reserved our seats together.

147
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:58,492
Oh  Lily and Rufus!

148
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:01,067
Oh  We haven't seen you

149
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,000
- Since we broke matzo together.  - Hi.

150
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,035
- You look wonderful.   -Thank you.

151
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,138
Love--It's put color in all of our cheeks.

152
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:10,299
We were talking on the way over here

153
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,146
About what a wonderful couple you two make.

154
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:18,000
So we decided you should take the plunge like us.

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,695
Dating at our age is not enough.

156
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,542
Marry before it's too late.

157
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:26,142
Well  It's not exactly

158
00:07:26,142 --> 00:07:27,678
Uh   We're just enjoying the journey.

159
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,494
Well  Apparently at one point

160
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:31,246
We had a destination

161
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:33,453
But that no longer seems to be the case.

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,927
Subtle.

163
00:07:35,992 --> 00:07:39,670
Mm   I was going for honest.

164
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:03,461
Dear friends   colleagues

165
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,461
As we stand here today

166
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,461
We bear witness to a bright new beginning.

167
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:10,085
Just standing in front of him

168
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:11,700
I-I couldn't do it.

169
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:14,068
I can't believe I chickened out.

170
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,429
It's okay  B.

171
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:16,725
This is the beginning of something new.

172
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:18,628
Now we can all move on.

173
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:22,100
The possibilities are endless after all.

174
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:24,468
Yes. To great things.

175
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:26,468
And so what if i'm not going to yale?

176
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,243
you were recently incarcerated

177
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:30,243
And I'm afraid to talk to Chuck

178
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,612
because he might hurt me again.

179
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,915
This is our moment.

180
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,283
Nobody can take that from us.

181
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:40,147
I urge you to go out into the world

182
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,842
And show them who you have become.

183
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:43,458
Not so fast.

184
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,961
You're not graduating until I give you my diplomas.

185
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,562
Mine are labels and labels stick.

186
00:08:50,627 --> 00:08:54,065
Nate Archibald-- class whore.

187
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,097
Dan Humphrey-- the ultimate insider.

188
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:59,233
Chuck Bass--coward.

189
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:02,640
Blair Waldorf--weakling.

190
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:04,912
And as for Serena Van der Woodsen

191
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:09,776
After today  you are officially irrelevant.

192
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,487
- O.M.G.   - I know.

193
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,887
Congratulations  everyone. You deserve it.

194
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:20,158
Now please join me in welcoming the class of 2009.

195
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:23,326
Class  please stand.

196
00:09:33,231 --> 00:09:34,934
You were right  B.

197
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:36,637
Nobody can take this day away from us.

198
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,037
Gossip girl is going down.

199
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,135
Gossip girl has ruined our graduation

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,135
And it's only 2:00.

201
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,919
We have to stop her.

202
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,639
I don't know. Messing with gossip girl?

203
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:48,439
Think of the consequences.

204
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,270
You can't ask us to jeopardize our futures

205
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:52,904
for your personal vendetta.

206
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:55,079
Besides  she didn't even say anything about us

207
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:56,496
Not even penelope.

208
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,847
Oh  soup dumplings.

209
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:03,015
This is not my personal vendetta.

210
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,447
She attacked all of us and was wrong.

211
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:06,790
Completely.

212
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:09,126
Totally.

213
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,390
Well  I'm gonna go do some damage control just in case

214
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:14,262
So don't wait for me.

215
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:15,646
Well  what about you two?

216
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:16,965
Well  of everyone here

217
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:19,862
You guys probably have the most secrets you're hiding.

218
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:22,133
I'll gather intel.

219
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:24,965
I'll run some stats.

220
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:31,941
I'm sorry...

221
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,148
About before.

222
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:36,612
About what part exactly?

223
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,445
the pre-graduation squabble

224
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:42,550
Or the fact that you no longer want to marry me?

225
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:46,294
What exactly is our problem anyway?

226
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,326
You tried to give me money behind my back

227
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:50,294
When i said no.

228
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:56,565
We both make mistakes.

229
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:58,741
But if we can't accept that about each other

230
00:10:58,806 --> 00:10:59,989
How do we move forward?

231
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:01,173
I don't know.

232
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,341
But we can't go back.

233
00:11:04,406 --> 00:11:07,077
I need to um see my guests.

234
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:11,780
Can we talk?

235
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:14,276
Always. Is something wrong?

236
00:11:14,356 --> 00:11:16,852
I know you have high aspirations for me

237
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:18,884
So in the spirit of full disclosure

238
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:21,427
There's something you need to know

239
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:23,587
Something that may... it may come out.

240
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:25,123
I'm intrigued.

241
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:26,972
Last summer... I had an affair

242
00:11:26,972 --> 00:11:28,756
With an older woman.

243
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:31,795
Oh my boy.  Welcome to washington.

244
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:34,770
She was married at the time.

245
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,600
Go on.

246
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,090
And she...

247
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,260
Well   she paid me.

248
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,890
Well...

249
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,410
Whatever happens i'll protect you.

250
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,840
Let's hope it doesn't come out.

251
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,460
Yeah.

252
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,880
Have you seen your girlfriend?

253
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,500
- You don't know? - What?

254
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,620
Blair and i broke up.

255
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,520
This party is not so hot.

256
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,350
There's a killer doughnut place around the corner.

257
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,330
Can you guys believe gossip girl?

258
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,420
"the--the insider"? what is that?

259
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,150
- A really good movie? - that's a tabloid tv show.

260
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,930
Come on. seriously£¬guys. she can't keep getting away with this.

261
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,440
we all just have to band together and take her down.

262
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,690
Serena   we just graduated. gossip girl   high school

263
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,270
All these people backbiting and conniving--

264
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,820
Don't you think we should be moving on with our lives?

265
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,920
Well   high school's over

266
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,610
But--but they're still my friends. you're still my friend.

267
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,770
Yeah.

268
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,570
What you--you don't think so?

269
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,920
No   no   i do but honestly...

270
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,260
School's finished

271
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,180
And our parents...

272
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,130
That--that doesn't really look great.

273
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,340
Next year we're gonna be in different cities.

274
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,380
And when you think about it

275
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,160
What's really keeping us together?

276
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,320
So that's it?

277
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,260
You--you get your diploma and you're just moving on?

278
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,630
Well   congratulations   dan.

279
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,340
Have--have a good life.

280
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,820
So... doughnuts?

281
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,610
No   let's just go home.

282
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,990
- I want to--i want to get out of this suit. - all right.

283
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,480
The number of posts in the last six months about constance

284
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,080
and st. jude's is more than double

285
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,440
Of the next mentioned school.

286
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,090
number one on our hit list

287
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,910
Would seem to indicate a personal connection.

288
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,090
And i refuse to believe the students at our school are

289
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,300
Any worse than those at horace mann or spence.

290
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,780
So gossip girl most likely goes to or went to constance.

291
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,720
Yeah   exactly. why else the focus?

292
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,330
Well,i would also assume that she is our age.

293
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,010
The blasts all started when we were in the ninth grade.

294
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,260
An upperclassman simply wouldn't care.

295
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,680
So you're saying gossip girl's a senior,like us?

296
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,010
Well,if she's a senior

297
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,230
Then--then that means she's in the room right now.

298
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,080
So who could it be?

299
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,510
Rebecca sherman? no her head's always in a book.

300
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,380
- She's not paying enough attention. - Okay.

301
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,300
Not her either.

302
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,910
Then i submit nelly yuki.

303
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,360
Low profile

304
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,100
Good with computers...

305
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Many grudges mostly against me.

306
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,550
No   i have been with her way too many times

307
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,210
When gossip girl has sent out a blast.

308
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,010
There's no way it's her. i'm gonna speed this up.

309
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,000
What are you doing?

310
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,440
sending a tip to gossip girl.

311
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,840
- Chuck,get the room quiet for me. - i'm way ahead of you.

312
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,210
If i could have everyone's attention   please.

313
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,900
We'd like to thank you all for being here today.

314
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,320
Jonathan? what?

315
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,980
Gossip girl is... a guy?

316
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,390
It's him. look.

317
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,730
What just happened? What's going on?

318
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,450
Tell 'em who you are.

319
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,130
Wait. so if you're not gossip girl

320
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,470
You must know who she is.

321
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,320
No. i just hacked into her server over spring break.

322
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,210
I was bored.

323
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,580
And now we have access to every e-mail that gets sent to her.

324
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,790
I can't believe she gets

325
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,640
All these posts that she doesn't report.

326
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,650
No. no. boring.

327
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,660
Apparently you dye your hair.

328
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,610
Yeah   we have this theory

329
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,680
That either she can't substantiate some of them...

330
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,440
Or she waits till the perfect moment for maximum damage.

331
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,640
I wish i could be more helpful.

332
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,700
No   you--you have been so helpful.

333
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,500
Can i actually borrow you for a minute?

334
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,400
I'd like you to help me dig deeper.

335
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,290
Nothing in here's good enough to beat the new girl...

336
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,060
Except for this.

337
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,580
No way. would you really use that?

338
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,270
I-i don't think i can.

339
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,090
If you did you'd totally win.

340
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,640
Yeah,and then i could abolish the monarchy forever.

341
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,930
You going to nate's party?

342
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,160
No. i thought vanessa and i would hit a movie instead.

343
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,930
And here we go. all right

344
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,220
It's your last party of high school.

345
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,960
Now i know you don't love your classmates

346
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,710
But you just shared four years with them. honor that.

347
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,110
And i suspect there may be a couple of people

348
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,640
That you'd like to stay friends with,or at least one person.

349
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,790
Yeah. yeah   serena said kinda the same thing.

350
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,180
So h-how am i gonna get these doses of sage wisdom

351
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,680
When i'm living at the dorms at n.y.u.?

352
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,860
I'll appear to you like obi-wan.

353
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,080
Now go   young jedi.

354
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,070
All right. bye. have fun.

355
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,780
Our kids graduated high school today.

356
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,880
And i felt... old.

357
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,320
And so i wanted to do something young and crazy

358
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,250
And you're the only one i wanted to do it with.

360
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,301
Something I found in Chuck's room.

361
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:25,062
Well then I bet it's good.

362
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:31,109
Are you dressing for someone?

363
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:33,909
Yes.

364
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:36,405
Someone I hope is finally ready to love me

365
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,709
The way Cyrus loves you.

366
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:43,684
Cyrus told me.

367
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,980
You told Chuck how you felt and...

368
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,619
He ran away.

369
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:52,387
You seeing him tonight?

370
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:54,162
Yes.

371
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:59,162
Don't let him get away again

372
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:21,183
Oh..Hey..drunky.

373
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:22,943
Don't embarrass yourself.

374
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,223
Dan. You're here.

375
00:18:34,288 --> 00:18:36,895
There's something I have to tell you

376
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,198
And it's only because I'm drunk

377
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:42,270
And I'll probably never see you again.

378
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:44,799
I   um....

379
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,743
Oh God. I have to go.

380
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:51,327
Was she just about to tell me she loved me?

381
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:52,846
I'm so glad we came.

382
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:04,815
Blair£¬I need to talk to you. Gossip girl knows.

383
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,350
Ominous.But ill-timed.

384
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,397
You can tell me tomorrow or never.

385
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:09,997
About new year's?

386
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:12,669
Look,the mean girls want the best piece of gossip

387
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,694
In exchange for keys to the kingdom.

388
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,604
I just thought you'd want to know.

389
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:20,604
If gossip girl were gonna post that information

390
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:22,603
She would have done it this morning.

391
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:26,042
and like I said,the mean girls don't control anything.

392
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:28,777
Blair, wake up.

393
00:19:28,842 --> 00:19:31,944
You're not queen anymore. You haven't been for a while.

394
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:35,209
And you're not going to be either

395
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,952
If you tell anyone what you know.

396
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:39,416
I'm sorry I wasted my time on you.

397
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:41,416
You don't have what it takes.

398
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:45,255
You never did. Now if you'll excuse me.

399
00:19:55,993 --> 00:19:59,064
Bring me your leader.

400
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:00,599
It's not midnight.

401
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:04,136
My gossip's too juicy to wait.

402
00:20:12,183 --> 00:20:14,615
I wanna talk.

403
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,222
I prefer to talk after.

404
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,118
What do you think about my coat?

405
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:26,918
I like it. Why?

406
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,173
- And now? - Even better.

407
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:40,069
And...what about my headband?

408
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:42,837
I... admire it.

409
00:20:42,903 --> 00:20:50,981
And...my stockings?

410
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:54,148
Oh I adore them.

411
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:59,524
And my dress?

412
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:06,195
I worship it.

413
00:21:09,524 --> 00:21:11,427
How do you feel about me?

414
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:18,867
Say it.

415
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,506
I...

416
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,057
- What is it now? - Oh not again.

417
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:34,785
Serena Van Der Woodsen

418
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:36,785
Just couldn't leave well enough alone.

419
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:39,664
Since she had to find out the truth about me

420
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:43,857
I'm going to tell you the truth about everyone.

421
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:46,369
Every gossip bomb I've got is about to drop

422
00:21:46,434 --> 00:21:50,130
And if you've got a problem with that,take it up with her.

423
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,130
Ever wonder why Miss Carr left town?

424
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,913
A little bee told me Dan Humphrey had sex with her

425
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:56,225
During the school play.

426
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:58,049
Remember the sparks between Humphrey's sis and Nate?

427
00:21:58,049 --> 00:21:59,873
Oh my God.

428
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:01,489
During a hot photo session.

429
00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:03,041
Thank God it stopped at pg-13

430
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,649
Or someone could have ended up in jail like her brother.

431
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:06,177
Is that true?

432
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:07,721
What? You were in jail?

433
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:09,185
And as for Blair Waldorf say "uncle."

434
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,592
We hear she kept it in the Bass family on new year's.

435
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:15,360
but rumor has it Chuck spent some time in Brooklyn--

436
00:22:15,426 --> 00:22:17,489
Metaphorically speaking of course.

437
00:22:17,554 --> 00:22:20,096
- You slept with Jack? - You slept with Vanessa?

438
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:26,832
Serena Van Der Woodsen here's looking at you.

439
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,249
Jack?Blair? Really? That's calculating.Even for you.

440
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:34,298
I was sad and he tried to comfort me.

441
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:36,282
You call that comfort? More like collusion.

442
00:22:36,347 --> 00:22:37,634
Like you didn't do that with the dregs of d.u.m.b.o.

443
00:22:37,634 --> 00:22:38,922
I'm standing right here.

444
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:40,674
I can't believe you slept with miss Carr.

445
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:41,518
And you were in jail?

446
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:42,362
I can't believe you let some guy take photos of you.

447
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,891
Wh-what was he doing there?

448
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:45,356
No,no,no. It wasn't as bad as it sounds. Okay?

449
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:48,124
You guys just stop it,okay? She's trying to create

450
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:50,140
A divide between us. This is exactly what she wants.

451
00:22:50,205 --> 00:22:51,668
We can't let that happen.

452
00:22:51,668 --> 00:22:53,132
You want to know something?

453
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:54,669
I don't think it's her that created the divide.

454
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:56,140
I think it was you.

455
00:22:56,205 --> 00:22:58,908
You're the reason we're on "gossip girl" in the first place.

456
00:22:58,973 --> 00:23:00,556
If it wasn't for you we'd all be safe.

457
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:02,140
Okay that's enough. We all did what she said we did.

458
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:05,147
- You can't blame Serena for this. - Yes we can.

459
00:23:05,213 --> 00:23:07,068
She declared war on gossip girl.You brought this on us.

460
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:08,923
That's,that's not fair.

461
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,067
Serena was just trying to help everybody.

462
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:13,147
What do you know about anything

463
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:15,395
Besides your label was the only one that was true.

464
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,562
You mean what she said about the "insider"? Are you crazy?

465
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:20,155
You're friend with Nate Archibald

466
00:23:20,235 --> 00:23:23,099
You played on the soccer team.You got into Yale

467
00:23:23,164 --> 00:23:25,339
You got the lead role in the school play

468
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,338
You got published in "the New Yorker  "

469
00:23:27,404 --> 00:23:29,155
You had sex with a teacher.

470
00:23:29,155 --> 00:23:30,906
Plus you dated the most popular girl in school

471
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:33,467
And ignored the rest of us.

472
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:35,435
No. I meant them.

473
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,870
You pretend not to be like us but you are... to the bone.

474
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,740
And you should have known better.

475
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,680
Thank you.

476
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,640
Kudos S. Way to go out with a bang.

477
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,270
Now what did you want to tell me before?

478
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,410
Oh. It doesn't matter now.

479
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,490
- It just happened. - Leave me alone.

480
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,290
You're not mad at me because of that.

481
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,900
Just like I'm not mad at you about Vanessa.

482
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,860
Stop telling me what I feel.

483
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,040
We're just doing what we always do--finding excuses.

484
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,430
Well... I won't do it anymore.

485
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,280
I know you told Serena you love me.

486
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,670
Serena heard wrong.

487
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,560
Last year you told Nate. This year you told Serena.

488
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,610
You tell everyone but me. Why can't you tell me?

489
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,740
Is gossip girl right about you being a coward?

490
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,960
That's not true and you know it.

491
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,870
Gossip girl can be right about you all she wants

492
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,310
But I won't let her be right about me.

493
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,380
I will not be weak anymore.

494
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,470
You can't run.

495
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,580
You have to stay here and hear it this time.

496
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,860
Chuck Bass...

497
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,810
I love you.

498
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,650
I love you so much...

499
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,880
It consumes me.

500
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,060
I love you...

501
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,430
And I know you love me too.

502
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,100
Tell me you love me

503
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,140
Then everything we've done--

504
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,870
All the gossip and the lies

505
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,800
And the hurt

506
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,760
Will have been for something.

507
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,650
Tell me it was for something.

508
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,220
Maybe it was.

509
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,030
But it's not anymore.

510
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,100
Oh my gosh. Do you remember the casbah?

511
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,100
That concert?

512
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,100
Barely...

513
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,470
In the best way.

514
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,210
Oh my God. You covered "how will I know"

515
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,430
And you dedicated it to me

516
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,260
And I sat there trying not to laugh. Oh God.

517
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,070
I was so in love with you.

518
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,400
What are we doing?

519
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,330
Things were so much easier when we were younger.

520
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,290
Unlike our kids we just jumped into things.

521
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,650
I mean, why can't we just be more like that

522
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,480
Just figure it out as we go along?

523
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,960
Maybe this didn't turn out to be

524
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,960
The romance we thought it would be when we first met.

525
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,200
Well. It's more like choose your own adventure.

526
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,180
Maybe it just wasn't the right time. Maybe it never will be.

527
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,040
What if it is?

528
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,450
What if we're just too stubborn to see it?

529
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,820
I don't want to miss out.

530
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,830
Well... Neither do I.

531
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,780
I don't have a ring

532
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,190
So this will have to do.

533
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,480
Rufus. What are you doing?

534
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,150
Marry me, Lily.

535
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,500
Marry me.

536
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,400
I know that'll make me your... uh your fifth husband.

537
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,420
So?

538
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,770
Yes.

539
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,860
Give me your hand.

540
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,320
Come here.

541
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,230
Hey. Don't worry about this.

542
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,380
Okay? Everyone's gonna get over it eventually.

543
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,500
When?

544
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,290
Nate, high school is over. If I don't fix this tonight

545
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,420
Some of these people will never talk to me again.

546
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,050
And--and what happens next year?

547
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,850
What... she does this to the next

548
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,500
Serena and Nate and Dan and Blair?

549
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,390
Well. What else can you do?

550
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,750
It is too easy for her to sit behind a computer

551
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,370
And not face the damage she's done.

553
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,070
No.

554
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,860
But she doesn't know that.

555
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,070
You didn't get to use your gossip.

556
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,610
Well here's something new--

557
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,770
I told chuck I loved him... again

558
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,320
And he didn't say it back... again.

559
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,340
Blair. I'm not gonna tell people that.

560
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,540
Why not? I'm giving you what you need to be queen.

561
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,910
I don't want to be queen.

562
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,320
I just wanted a chance to have a life in school

563
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,340
And look what it almost made me do.

564
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,370
That's the thing....

565
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,910
You need to be cold to be queen.

566
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,220
Anne Boleyn thought only with her heart

567
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,450
And she got her head chopped off

568
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:12,100
So her daughter Elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man.

569
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,390
She married her country.

570
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,230
Forget boys.

571
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,950
Keep your eye on the prize jenny humphrey.

572
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,370
You can't make people love you

573
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,920
But you can make them fear you.

574
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,120
For what it's worth

575
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,000
You're my queen.

576
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,350
I choose you.

577
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,960
Thank you.

578
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,440
It's already been over an hour.

579
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,650
The bar's closing soon.

580
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,720
She's gonna come. I know she is.

581
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,540
Whoa Whoa whoa. Wait. Wait.

582
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,670
Dan is gossip girl?

583
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,950
Gossip girl? You crazy?

584
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,010
Then what are you doing here?

585
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,790
I loopt you. Are you waiting for gossip girl?

587
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:08,120
And I know you don't approve.

588
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:11,287
I'm gonna go close the tab.

589
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:13,480
This grudge match thing--

590
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,415
It d--it doesn't seem like you.

591
00:30:17,495 --> 00:30:19,591
What's--what's going on?

592
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:23,926
I don't want to be irrelevant.

593
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:26,869
Irrelevant? you're serena van der woodsen.

594
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:30,902
Gossip girl might be right about me

595
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:33,031
But she's--she's wrong about you.

596
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,302
Without serena van der woodsen

597
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:37,606
Who would i have dreamt about?

598
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:40,517
I might have spent my whole life on the outside

599
00:30:40,582 --> 00:30:42,646
If you hadn't let me in...

600
00:30:42,711 --> 00:30:45,285
Which i'm holding against you.

601
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,085
- Thank you.  - Thank you.

602
00:30:51,861 --> 00:30:54,595
Oh, my God.

603
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:57,620
Oh, that makes sense.

604
00:30:57,685 --> 00:30:59,331
Wait. they're a team.

605
00:30:59,396 --> 00:31:01,460
Team of what?

606
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:02,867
Wait. Why are you all here?

607
00:31:02,932 --> 00:31:04,835
I got a text saying to meet you.

608
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,331
- Yeah  - So did I.  - So did I.

609
00:31:13,508 --> 00:31:16,114
You wanted to meet gossip girl.

610
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:18,339
Well   look around. You just did.

611
00:31:18,404 --> 00:31:20,114
I'm nothing without you.

612
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:23,218
And while most high school friendships fade

613
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:25,890
It's my hope that what happened today will bond you forever.

614
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:27,586
now that all my secrets are out

615
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,218
You have a clean slate...

616
00:31:29,283 --> 00:31:31,522
Until college.

617
00:31:31,587 --> 00:31:33,793
Congratulations.

618
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,161
I'm coming with you. oh.

619
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,497
- Drinks on me.  - Yes.

620
00:31:40,562 --> 00:31:43,633
Yes. thank you.

621
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:51,072
I'm sorry about what i said.

622
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,177
You don't have to apologize.

623
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,745
Where's chuck?

624
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,712
It's over...

625
00:32:01,778 --> 00:32:03,345
once and for all.

626
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:07,216
But i'm gonna be strong.

627
00:32:07,296 --> 00:32:09,920
Still, it doesn't feel right without him here.

628
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:13,888
You know everyone else is here.

629
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:20,735
Yeah...

630
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,206
Everyone's here.

631
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,281
Oh it's beaufiful

632
00:32:35,347 --> 00:32:37,281
It looks so good on you.

633
00:32:41,748 --> 00:32:45,411
Oh! i've dreamed about this for so long.

634
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:47,426
Do you want to fire it up?

635
00:32:47,491 --> 00:32:50,419
I can't. blair and I have a meeting at rouge tomate.

636
00:32:50,484 --> 00:32:53,187
Huh. that's cryptic.

637
00:32:55,764 --> 00:32:57,634
Both.

638
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,859
So how are you today?

639
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:02,499
Miserable.

640
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,835
But at least college

641
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,603
Will be the fresh start it's supposed to be.

642
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:10,804
No chuck   No nate.

643
00:33:10,884 --> 00:33:12,308
No anybody   really.

644
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:13,015
Except gossip girl.

645
00:33:14,108 --> 00:33:15,439
Forget I said that.

646
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:17,271
It's okay.  I read them   too.

647
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:21,827
"Spotted--chuck bass in france. chuck bass in germany.

648
00:33:21,892 --> 00:33:23,395
Chuck bass in italy."

649
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,677
I hope he has so much fun that they have to quarantine him.

650
00:33:26,942 --> 00:33:29,529
Open your present.

651
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:30,900
What?

652
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:37,075
Oh! it's to remind you of who you are.

653
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,029
I love it. I am gonna put it up on my wall at brown

654
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:41,526
As soon as I get back from europe. oh!

655
00:33:41,526 --> 00:33:43,215
Come with me.

656
00:33:44,205 --> 00:33:47,112
I chased a guy for years who wasn't that into me

657
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:50,245
And going to a glorified state school.

658
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,756
My mother married an entertainment lawyer.

659
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:55,349
so I need to just stop moving

660
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:56,933
And contemplate the failure of my life.

661
00:33:56,933 --> 00:33:58,890
Well   When you're ready to start moving again

662
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:03,525
- You know I'll be here.  - Yes   of course I do.

663
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,111
Humphrey Where's your mind?

664
00:34:13,192 --> 00:34:14,132
I know it sounds crazy

665
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:17,055
But I actually-- I kind of miss high school.

666
00:34:17,846 --> 00:34:20,773
I miss blair waldorf and her daily ego demolitions

667
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:23,077
Nelly Yuki stealing my lunch

668
00:34:23,142 --> 00:34:25,445
Even Chuck Bass who would get so close to talk.

669
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,620
Wow. you miss Chuck Bass.

670
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:28,782
Well   not as much as you probably miss Chuck Bass.

671
00:34:28,782 --> 00:34:30,568
But yeah  I  uh I think it's safe to say

672
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,280
That the nostalgia's officially begun.

673
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,135
Apparently the upper east side feels the same way about you.

674
00:34:36,135 --> 00:34:37,373
What's up   Dan  Vanessa?

675
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:39,841
Shouldn't you be getting the deputy mayorher coffee or something?

676
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:44,308
Well   I think she'd rather I gave her something else.

677
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,900
- Yeah she made a pass at me.   - god. is she hot?

678
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:48,564
Actually   yeah   she is.

679
00:34:48,644 --> 00:34:49,272
You're both disgusting.

680
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,572
I don't want to be the guy gossip girl made me out to be.

681
00:34:53,637 --> 00:34:57,987
So what are you gonna do?

682
00:34:58,052 --> 00:35:01,251
Go backpacking... if you'll have me.

683
00:35:01,316 --> 00:35:03,379
Well, it's too late. i'm...

684
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:04,883
I'm taking someone else.

685
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:07,316
- Oh, really? who?  - It's me.

686
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,363
Him.

687
00:35:09,363 --> 00:35:11,331
Yeah, we're gonna have a great time. Melissa and i.

688
00:35:11,396 --> 00:35:14,099
Oh. really?

689
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:19,427
Daniela.

690
00:35:19,507 --> 00:35:21,339
- Close.  - It's Vanessa but thanks for trying.

691
00:35:24,504 --> 00:35:25,688
Please let me go with you.

692
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:28,144
I'm always doing what everyone else wants me to do.

693
00:35:28,144 --> 00:35:29,587
I want to do something for me.

694
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:31,031
And we'll just go as friends.

695
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:33,425
Don't worry. it won't be anything romantic   Unless

696
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:35,446
you know   we drink a little too much in Vienna one night.

697
00:35:35,446 --> 00:35:36,903
How could you say no to that?

698
00:35:37,327 --> 00:35:39,785
Seriously.

699
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,190
As long as you take off that ridiculous tie

700
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,590
So i can maybe try to picture you with a backpack.

701
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,690
What's wrong with my tie?

702
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,030
Mm. i need a coffee.

703
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,980
He's always wearing a tie.

704
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,140
So i'm the one who does the good deed

705
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,740
And that guy goes off with the girl?

706
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,230
It's good to be that guy.

707
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,970
Do you...you go here to n.y.u.?

708
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:58,800
I was sort of heard you on the phone.

709
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,870
I'm starting in the fall. uh i just transferred from b.u. scott.

710
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,910
I'm dan. nice to meet you   scott.

711
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,910
- Maybe i'll£¬uh i'll see you around. - yeah.

712
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,090
We got this for you.

713
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,050
I'll take that. thank you.

714
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,050
What are you doing here?

715
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,140
What i should have done months ago.

716
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,330
In about five seconds your phones are all going to go off

717
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,970
With the latest gossip girl blast.

718
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,270
She is nothing if not punctual. allow me.

719
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,560
Remember all those secrets jenny amassed

720
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,340
When she was trying to protect you nelly?

721
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,190
Well now the world knows them too.

722
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,610
So looks like we have a winner.

723
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,400
Now if you don't mind...

724
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,360
How can you do this?

725
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,520
Letting some girl from brooklyn carry on our legacy?

726
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,290
Haven't you ever heard of a foreign queen?

727
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,870
Besides her dad is marrying lily bass£¬

728
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,410
So i think that makes her richer than all of you.

729
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,670
Not enough.

730
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,190
Okay so starting next year no more headbands

731
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,230
Except for this one.

732
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,620
- Thanks you can keep the change. - oh big spender.

733
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,330

Georgina where are you? what happened to poppy?

746
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,680
You don't have to worry about her ever again.

747
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,310
You got your money. that's all that matters.

748
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,920

Georgina sparks?

754
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,900
Yes that's right.

755
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,520
I recently enrolled in gallatin.

756
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,780
Here's my paperwork and my check.

757
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,660
Thank you miss sparks.

758
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,890
Is there anything else?

759
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,980
I'd like to request a roommate-- blair waldorf.

760
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,290
She's my best friend and i just can't wait to live with her.

761
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:54,990
Serena.

762
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:56,680
Carter.

763
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,720
Aren't you supposed to be in dubayy?

764
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,930
You know you can't lose me for long. where you headed?

765
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,990
Everywhere.

766
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,840
I have something you might want to know before you go.

767
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,920
I hope it doesn't have to do with blair.

768
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,150
No it has to do with you.

769
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,540
It's about santorini what you were looking for there.

770
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,850
While i was on the trip you so graciously gave me

771
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,050
I found it again.

772
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,650
Only it's not in santorini anymore. it's in fiji.

773
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,430
At least he was last week.

774
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,230
You found my father?

775
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,190
Get in. let's go.

776
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,540
Why aren't you in europe?

777
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,200
I was in paris

778
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,810
But only to get your favorite macaroons

779
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,010
From pierre herm?

780
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,570
And germany?

781
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,620
To pick up your favorite falke stockings.

782
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,310
You know how i adore them.

783
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,380
What are you doing here then?

784
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,830
You were right.

785
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,030
I was a coward running away again.

786
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,950
But everywhere i went

787
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,480
You caught up with me.

788
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,470
So i had to come back.

789
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,000
I want to believe you...

790
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,800
But i can't.

791
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,990
You've hurt me too many times.

792
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,840
You can believe me this time.

793
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:01,780
That's it?

794
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,150
I love you too.

795
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,250
But can you say it twice?

796
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,230
No i'm serious. say it twice.

797
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,680
I love you.

798
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,160
