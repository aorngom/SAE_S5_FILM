<I>gossip
girl here--</I>

00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:06,500
<I>your one and only source</i>

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,800
<I>into the scandalous lives</i>
<i>of manhattan's elite.</I>

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,900
<I>top story on my home page--</I>

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,600
<I>serena van der woodsen,</i>
<i>everybody's favorite "it" girl</i>

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,100
<I>has just returned</i>
<i>from a mysterious absence</i>

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,700
<I>and was learning the hard way</i>

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,100
<I>that you can never</i>
<i>go home again.</I>
(cell phone rings)

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,100
You'll never believe
what's on "gossip girl."
Someone saw serena getting off

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,100
Serena?
Serena's at school.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,500
<I>why'd she return?</I>
let me guess--
You told everyone

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,900
Eric's just visiting grandpa
in rhode island.

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,800
Your aunt carol in miami.
He tries to take his own life,

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,300
And you're worried it's gonna
cost you mom of the year?

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
Must be a lot of rumors
why you're back.
None of them mention you.

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,600
Nate's gonna wait for serena.
He can get in line
behind that guy.

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
I don't need some new boy
influencing her,

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Distracting her
from her needs.
A kid like dan is

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,400
Guess who's dad is cool?

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,500
It's a trick question.
Yeah,
'cause it can't be ours.

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
You're going out with serena,
and i'm going

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,100
To kiss on the lips. Who said
this family wasn't cool?

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,500
I thought everything
was good between us.

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,300
It was... before i found out
you had sex with my boyfriend.

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,800
Great,
just in time for brunch.

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,900
I told her to stay away.

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,400
I'm not sneaking around
with you.
Just to talk.

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,800
You said you'd never
speak to her again.

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,600
So you slept with
your best friend's boyfriend.
Is that true?

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,500
Then she ran away
and lied about it.

31
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:31,000
Poor daniel--So little time,
so many sluts to defend.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,100
This world,
it's--It's crazy.

33
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,800
And you're a part of it.

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,300
Blair, how can i fix this?

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,100
You don't, serena.
You just stay away.

36
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,700
<I>but now that serena is back,</i>

37
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,300
<I>will the upper east side</i>
<i>ever be the same?</I>

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,800
<I>it takes two tangle,</i>

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,300
<I>and girls like these</i>
<i>don't go down without a fight.</I>

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,100
<I>and who am i?</I>

41
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,600
<I>that's a secret</i>
<i>i'll never tell.</I>

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,100
<I>you know you love me.</I>

43
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,200
<I>x.O.X.O., gossip girl.</I>

44
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,200
(Girls choir) * g-L-A-M

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,600
<I>there's plenty of upside</i>

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,700
<I>to being the spawn</i>
<i>of the fabulously wealthy.</I>

47
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,500
<I>but the downside?</I>

48
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,200
<I>super successful parents</i>

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,100
<I>except nothing less</i>
<i>from their offspring.</I>

50
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,100
<I>and when it comes to college,</i>
<i>that means the ivies.</I>

51
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,200
<I>it's more than just</i>
<i>getting into college.</I>

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,400
<I>it's setting a course</i>
<i>for the rest of your life.</I>

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,700
<I>and for those few</i>
<i>who aren't legacies,</i>

54
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,500
<I>the pressures are no less.</I>

55
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,300
<I>when parents have sacrificed</i>
<i>for their children's futures,</i>

56
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,500
<I>what kid would</i>
<i>wanna let them down?</I>

(Woman) thank you, ladies.

68
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,700
Good morning, students.
I ask all of you

69
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,400
To show a little sympathy
for our junior class.

70
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,800
They are almost through
with ivy week.

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
As is
our long-Standing tradition,

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,600
The constance billard girls

73
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,300
Will be in charge
of friday night's mixer,

74
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,800
And the st. Jude's boys

75
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,900
Will provide the ushers for
the visiting representatives.

76
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,400
(Woman) for those of you
who dream

77
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,500
Of attending
an ivy league school,

78
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,300
This mixer is the most important
event of your life.

79
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,700
But no pressure.
(Both chuckle)

80
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,400
<I>ah, it's not that bad.</I>
<i>it looks like i shaved</i>
<i>with a wood chipper.</I>

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,500
<I>i was going</i>
<i>with more of a chain saw.</I>
<i>not helping.</I>

82
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,500
<I>not trying to.</I>
<i>hey, look on the bright side--</I>
<i>you're not a hemophiliac.</I>

83
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,800
<I>otherwise, you'd--</I>
<i>you'd be in the emergency room.</I>

84
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,900
<I>and that's helping?</I>
<i>mm, not really.</I>

85
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,900
<I>(rufus) dartmouth's</i>
<i>gonna love you.</I>
<i>yeah, i gotta believe</i>

86
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,700
<I>being able to shave is</i>
<i>a prerequisite for attending.</I>

87
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,600
<I>no one is better qualified,</i>

88
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,000
<I>no one is smarter,</i>
<i>more well-Rounded...</i>
<i>or wounded?</I>

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,900
<I>i have a trust fund</i>
<i>to fall back on, dad.</I>

90
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,400
<I>you know, all i have</i>
<i>is what's up here.</I>
<i>oh.</I>

91
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,600
<I>(rufus) well, that is</i>
<i>the most important thing.</I>

92
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,200
<I>college is</i>
<i>about academic excellence,</i>

93
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,500
<I>not your stock portfolio.</I>

94
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
<I>besides, you're gonna do great</i>
<i>in your interview.</I>

95
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,300
<I>you take after your dad</i>
<i>that way.</I>

96
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,600
<I>spotlight doesn't phase us.</I>

97
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,500
<I>ooh, you better hope there's</i>
<i>not a spotlight involved.</I>

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,200
<I>i'm your sister.</I>
<i>it's what i do.</I>

99
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,000
<I>not when</i>
<i>it's about dartmouth.</I>

100
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,200
(Woman) remember, students...
nathaniel,
a little wake and ba

101
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,700
We have
our interviews today.

102
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,300
My point exactly.

103
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,400
(Whispers)
i have my 1-Hitter.

104
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,500
(Woman) ...but underclassmen

105
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,000
Should consider this week
a dress rehearsal.

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,200
You are not only representing
yourselves this week,

107
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,400
But generations from our school
and your families.

108
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,200
<I>try not to cut me off</i>
<i>next time.</I>

109
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,400
<I>you almost knocked me</i>
<i>over the side of the bench.</I>

110
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,300
<I>i didn't cut you off.</I>
<i>(laughs)</i>

111
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
<I>i didn't mean to.</I>
<i>you win fair and square,</i>

112
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,500
<I>and nothing</i>

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,100
<I>till you get in</i>
<i>the old alma mater, that is.</I>

<i>open, looking out west.</I>
<i>yeah, of course,</i>

115
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
<I>but let's get serious here.</I>

Have you seen serena?
I wonder where she is.

131
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,200
And you know what <i>i</i> wonder?

132
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,600
How i'm supposed
to hear anything about yale

133
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,700
With all this talk
about serena.

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,400
<I>do you remember when dad gave</i>
<i>me my first yale sweatshirt?</I>

135
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,700
<I>i don't think</i>
<i>any piece of clothing</i>

136
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
<I>has ever fit me more perfectly,</i>

137
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,500
<I>not to mention how adorable</i>
<i>i found that bulldog.</I>

138
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,900
<I>remember when i asked you</i>
<i>if i could get a bulldog?</I>

139
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,800
<I>good call, by the way,</i>
<i>saying no.</I>

140
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,800
<I>and now the big day</i>
<i>is finally here.</I>

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,200
<I>soon nate and i</i>
<i>will be away at college.</I>

142
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,700
<I>him coming down to yale,</i>
<i>me going up to dartmouth.</I>

143
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,900
<I>dad flying in</i>
<i>for the princeton game.</I>

144
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
<I>i hope it doesn't make you</i>
<i>feel old watching me grow up.</I>

145
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,400
<I>eat up, miss blair.</I>

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,500
<I>your mom would want you</i>

(Woman) and now
headmaster prescott...

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,800
So serena's really not here?

149
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,900
That's what i said.
When you weren't
supposed to be talking.

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,800
(Man) thank you, miss tedrow.

151
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,100

00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,500
<I>you know, you shouldn't have</i>
<i>stayed at your brother's again.</I>

154
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,900
<I>i mean, why sleep there? It's</i>
<i>not like he can even see you.</I>

155
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,300
<I>his eyes are closed.</I>

156
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,700

158
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,500
<I>i know, and if i can get out</i>

159
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,000
<I>it's my sole mission in life</i>
<i>to impress that brown rep.</I>

160
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,000
<I>well, i am so thrilled to hear</i>
<i>you say that's still your plan,</i>

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,400
<I>because, i mean,</i>

162
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,100
<I>i know it's something</i>
<i>we've always talked about,</i>

163
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,400
<I>but honestly,</i>
<i>since you've been back,</i>

164
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,200
<I>i've, uh, wondered if your mind</i>
<i>was even on college.</I>

165
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,800
<I>look, mom, i've had my mind</i>
<i>on a lot of things.</I>

166
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
<I>but since recent events,</i>

167
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
<I>going away to college</i>
<i>sounds pretty good.</I>

168
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,500
<I>how, um, how did you</i>
<i>leave things with dan?</I>

169
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,400
<I>i don't want</i>
<i>to talk about it.</I>

170
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,800
<I>what's going on</i>
<i>with you and blair?</I>
<i>mom, please!</I>

171
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,000
<I>it's o--</I>
<i>look, all i wanna do</i>

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,700
<I>is just finish high school</i>
<i>in peace</i>

173
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,800
<I>and go away to a state</i>

174
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,000
<I>with lots of people</i>
<i>who don't know who i am</i>

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,500
<I>and just start over, okay?</I>

176
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,300
<I>take a cab. Don't walk.</I>

177
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,600
(Under breath) oh, god.

178
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
(Normal voice) god,
please don't tell me it's over.

179
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,800
What? You were there.
I-I would say it's pretty over.

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
I meant the assembly.

181
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,900
Oh, right. No, yeah,
no, it just ended now.

182
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,300
Damn it.

183
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,800
Anyway, good luck.

184
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,600
Yeah, you, too.

185
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,100
Oh, too bad you missed
the assembly.

186
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,400
Not that it matters.

187
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,900
Brown doesn't offer
degrees in slut.

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,900
<I>spotted--</I>

189
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,400
<I>s. Not so fashionably late</i>
<i>and dressed down by b.</I>

190
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,200
<I>game on, ladies.</I>
(whistle blows)

191
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,000
(Will.I.Am) * baby, where'd you
get your body from? *

192

196
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,000
Look, i made a mistake
with nate, okay?

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,700
But then youab

198
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,200
We don't have to be friends,
but--Oh!
(Whistle blows)

199
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
Ugh!
What's up, waldorf?

200
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,300
Sorry. It slipped.

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,100
I'm fine.

202
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,900
I really want to believe
that was an accident.
Then you must be delusional.

203
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,400
* where'd you get
your body from *

204
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,000
* baby, where'd you get
your body from? *
(blows whistle)

205
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,800
Thank you.

206
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,500
* i got this from my mama,
all this stuff right here *

207
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,800
Ooh!
(Whistle blows)

208
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,900
Running out of colors here,
blair.

209
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,600
And i'm running out
of patience. Enough, okay?

210
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,800
It's enough
when i say it's enough.

211
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,400
* ladies

212
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,100

Oh!
(Whistle blows)

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,300
(Blair groans) god!

215
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,000
(Whistle blows)
(man) girls, break it up!

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,600
Get off of me!
Is that enough yet?!

217
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,400
* she pretty like her mama,
and if her mama real ugly *

218
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,000
So we've actually
come to physical blows, huh?

219
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,800
Truce?

220
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,500
Ow! My leg!

221
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,300
(Man) serena,
you're out of here.
(Kati) oh, my gosh.

222
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,500
Ow. Ow.
I hope it's broken.

223
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,100
<I>hey, upper east siders.</I>

224
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,500
<I>we hear that world war iii</i>
<i>just broke out,</i>

225
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
<I>and it's wearing kneesocks.</I>

226
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
<I>choose your side</i>
<i>or run and hide.</I>

227
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,000
<I>we have a feeling</i>
<i>this one's to the death.</I>

228
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,400
Be the dartmouth usher?
Well, i've given this
a lot of thought,

229
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,900
And i think i can answer
your question in three parts.

230
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,100
And i'd like to start
with the third part first,

231
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,900
If it's cool, unless, uh,
that would be confusing.

232
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,800
In which case, i can start
at the beginning. (Chuckles)

233
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,000
Um, the dartmouth
"principles of community"

234
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,300
Highlight integrity,

235
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,100
Responsibility
and consideration.

236
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,300
Uh, well, from st. Jude's,
i've learned integrity.

237
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,600
From being an older brother,
i have learned responsibility,

238
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,300
And from my parents,

239
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,800
Who have sacrificed everything
to send me to this school,

240
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,100
I've learned consideration.

241
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,500
It really comes down
to one thing--

242
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,100
Dartmouth is my dream,

243
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,200
And i've never asked dartmouth,
but...

244
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
I think
it's been dreaming of me.

245
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,100
That--That was a joke,

246
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,300
Or an attempt at one.

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,200
Next question.

248
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,200
(Man) you are the ideal
dartmouth candidate.

249
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,300
Thank you, sir.

250
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,700
And it would be an honor
to attend dartmouth.

251
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,600
I've grown up hearing
all about it from my father.

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm just not sure
it's my first choice,

253
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,200
And if there's only
one usher position available,

254
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,100
I'm sure there's someone
who wants it more than me.

255
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,500
Why should i be chosen
to be an usher?

256
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,200
I'm chuck bass.

257
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
(Mr. Tedrow) excuse me.

258
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,600
Hey.

259
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,400
You get the one
you wanted?

260
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,300
Uh...

261
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,300
No. No, actually,
you did...

262
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,600
Which makes total sense
because i'm second in our class,

263
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,400
And you're somewhere around--

264
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,800
What, i don't know,
uh, last?

265
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,000
No hard feelings, huh?

266
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,100
Why should there be?
I mean, how many libraries

267
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,600
Has your dad had to endow
to get you this spot?

268
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,000
You've earned it.
Look, man, you don't know
anything about my family.

269
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
I'm sorry.
You're right. You're right.

270
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,800
I'm sure j.L. Hall
will be very impressed

271
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,300
With your passion
for the dartmouth experience.

272
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,900
Who the hell is j.L. Hall?
He's the ivy rep.

273
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,600
You might want
to pick up his book

274
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,900
If you want anything
to talk about.

275
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,700
"The petting zoo"--

276
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,500
That's the name
of his book.

277
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,100
Whoa. Angry guy, huh?

278
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,500
Short fuse.
I'm trying to work on that.

279
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,700
Well, let me know
how that goes for you.

280
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,400
Yeah, i'll--
I'll keep you posted.

281
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,500
It's a tough week.
Not for me, apparently.

282
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,900
Oh, you got
an usher position?
No, i didn't.

283
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,400
Uh, in an ironic though
not totally unexpected twist,

284
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,000
Nate got the one i wanted.

285
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,200
Yeah, well, i guess that's life
when you're not a legacy.

287
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,700
Well, hey, just 'cause
you're not an usher

288
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,500
Doesn't mean you're not
gonna get into an ivy.

289
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,300
Yeah? Wh--Uh, where'd
your parents go to school?

290
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,200
Harvard and brown.

291
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,900
That's--That's all
i'm saying.

292
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,900
I can't believe
serena did this.
Yeah, such a cheap shot.

293
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,000
(Beep)
finally.

294
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,300
Hello to you, too. I heard about
the field hockey throw down.

295
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,000
All those mouth guards
and short skirts--

296
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,700
I hope somebody filmed it.

297
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,000
(Scoffs) you're heinous.
Which is probably
why you called.

298
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,200
You know me well.

299
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,400
Women like to pretend they're
complicated. I know better.

300
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,100
My leg's numb now.
How about a heating pad?

301
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,500
Sure.
Okay.

302
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,000
Serena came home
for a reason.

303
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,900
One can only guess.
I'm done guessing.

304
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,000
I want answers,
and no one likes to be

305
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,400
On the ground floor of a scandal
like chuck bass.
I am a bitch when i wanna be.

306
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,000
Opportunity to cause
some trouble, uncover a secret?

307
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Take "yes" for an answer.

308
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,900
Let's turn back to school.

309
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,100
I left something important
behind.

310
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Oh, danny boy,
how was your day?

311
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,700
He's about to hype dinner.
'Cause no matter
how good it was,

312
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,700
It's about to get
a lot better.

313
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I've outdone myself
with the bolognese.

314
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,700
(Man) * tray tables up

315
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,300
* time for the test

316
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,300
* we're going down

317
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,900
* we did our best

318
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,200
(Muffled) sorry about
the melodramatic entrance.

319
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,500
You didn't get it?

320
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,600
No, i didn't get it.

321
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,800
And that i do not get.

322
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,100
They...

323
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,500
They gave it to nate...

324
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,000
(Muffled) archibald!

325
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,800
Oh!

326
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,300
* bad things don't happen

327
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,900
Last year, uh, i believe
he had an original thought.

328
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,500
It died of loneliness.

329
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,200
* this can't be happening

330
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,900
I'm sorry.

331
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
<I>you're</i> sorry?

332
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,200
Yeah, i know how much
you and mom sacrificed.

333
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,300
The whole reason you send us
to a school like this

334
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,300
Is so we can go
to a college of our choice.

335
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,900
What if that's all
for nothing?

336
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,800
It's <i>not,</i> okay?

337
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,100
It's not.

338
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,100
So you don't get
to be the usher

339
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,200
Of some whatever party.

340
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,400
Dad, can i just, um,
stew alone for awhile?

341
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,700
* and then i still care

342
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,100
We're humphreys, dad.

343
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,100
Not exactly royalty uptown.

344
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Are you okay with that?

345
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,300
No,

346
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,800
But i'm used to it.

347
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,700
This is way too good.
(Dialing cell phone)

348
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,200
Mom, how's paris?

349
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,900
You're not going to believe

350
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,700
Where i found
our little princess.

351
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
Really?

352
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:54,900
(Mouse button clicking)
(chuck) admit it.

353
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,900
Even for me, this was good.
If you weren't such a perv,

354
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,400
I'm sure the c.I.A.
Would hire you in a second.

355
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,600
Defending my country--There's
a future i never imagined.

356
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,000
With good reason.
What is she doing there?

357
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,200
Well, what's anyone
doing there?

358
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,200
It's a facility
for the disturbed or addicted.

359
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,500
You must have
your own wing.

360
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,600
You don't get nearly
enough credit for your wit.

361
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,700
So the question is,
what do you do now?

362
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,000
Well, i was thinking...

363
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,500
Total social destruction.

364
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,400
And here i thought
you were getting soft.

365
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,300
So this is your bed,
huh?

366
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,900
Leaving <i>now.</I>

367
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,000
You can repay me
another time.

368
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,300
I've been in these sessions
every day for the last week,

369
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,500
But nothing is going to change
unless she stops hiding him here

370
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
And lets him
have his life back.

371
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
This is not called hiding,
serena.

372
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,100
It's called recovery.

373
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Telling everyone he's staying
with aunt carol in miami?

374
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,700
He's not ready.
He's not, or you're not?

375
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,400
Okay, let's take
a deep breath.

376
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,700
It's good to see
honest conversation.

377
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,100
What does she know
about honesty?
Serena.

378
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,600
But i really think a decision
like this includes eric as well.

379
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,700
Oh, you mean <i>i</i> have
a say in this? Wow. Thanks.

380
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,000
Eric, of course.
We're here for you.

381
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,800
Look, if you're ready
to leave, you tell us, okay?

382
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,800
No matter what mom says.

383
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,900
I would really like
to get out of here...

384
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,400
Oh, no.

385
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,300
But maybe i'm not ready yet.

386
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,500
Hey, what about
for a few hours?

387
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
You can be my date
to the ivy week party tonight.

388
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,900
Serena, that party is
an important event for you.

389
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,600
Well, he'll be around
people he knows.

390
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,300
It'll be fun, comfortable.

391
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,300
Uh, actually,
that sounds great.
(Woman) well, there we go.

392
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,600
Compromise.
That wasn't so hard, was it?

393
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,500
You know what?
I have to go,

394
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Help them set up
for tonight at the school.

395
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,000
It's my job as both
parent committee chair

396
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,000
And responsible mother.

397
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,400
It'll be great, okay?

398
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,400
Hi. How are you?
Good.

399
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,900
Rufus humphrey.
Mm-Hmm.

400
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,300
Uh, my kid, dan,
goes to st. Jude's,

401
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,500
And he really should have been
selected as dartmouth's usher.

402
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,100
Maybe there was a mix-Up,

403
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,700
Some kind of a glitch
in the system?

404
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,800
I'd like to believe that

405
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Because i like to believe
the best in people.
I'm sorry, mr. Humphrey.

406
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
The usher positions
have been filled.

407
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,400
There's nothing we can do.
Uh, is there anything else?
Any other positions?

408
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,800
Uh, you'll have to discuss this
with our committee chairwoman.

409
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,700
Sure, perfect. I'd love to.
Where can i find her?

410
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,400
I'm not sure.
She must be running late. I...

411
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,600
Oh, there she is now.

412
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,700
Why am i not surprised?

413
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,000
Lucky for you,
she seems to be in a good mood.

414
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,900
Until she sees me.

415
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,900
Rufus.

416
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,700
Told ya.
Excuse me.

417
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,600
You got a minute, lil?
Not for you.

418
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,800
You're in.

419
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,000
What?
The ivy week party tonight.

420
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Your name will be
on the program and everything.

421
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,700
You got me
the dartmouth spot?
I knew you could do it, dad.

422
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,900
(Scoffs) no, you didn't,
and no, i didn't.

423
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,800
How do you feel about
the refreshment committee?
Well, there is--There is

424
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,100
Not until now.
Oh, god.

425
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,400
What? Everybody gets thirsty.
It's really a position of power.

426
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,000
How did you secure me
this prominent

427
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,800
And simultaneously embarrassing
position?
By offering

428
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,500
Serving snacks?

429
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,300
I'm the head
of the entertainment committee.

430
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,000
(Chuckles) a-Another committee
that didn't exist

431
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,300
Until you left
the house today.

432
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,100
Way to go, dad. Wait.
So who's the entertainment?

433
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
Uh, since it was
such short notice,

434
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,800
The only person
i could get was myself.

435
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,600
Kind of a staid affair for
early '90s postpunk math rock,

436
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,199
Don't you think?

437
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,199
I'm bringing
a couple of the guys.

438
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,700
It'll be rufus unplugged.
Need a roadie?

439
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,838
??

440
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,200
And we can just make this
a full-Fledged humphrey affair?

441
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Look, i did the best i could.

442
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,700
At least you get to officially
be a part of this thing.

443
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,800
You can talk
to that author you love,

444
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,400
Ask him anything you want.
Like his, uh, preference
for soft drinks?

445
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,000
If you get at all anxious,
sweetie,

446
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,800
If you feel light-Headed
or panicky--

447
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,499
I'll be fine, mom.

448
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,100
All i have to do
is be normal.

449
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,799
Or at least <i>act</i> normal.

450
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,200
Works for mom.

451
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Do you see the yale rep?

452
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,700
I thought you wanted
to go to brown,

453
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,400
And blair wanted
to go to yale.

454
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,800
Yeah, i know.

455
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,100
Mm.

456
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,900
My father would never forgive me
if i didn't introduce myself.

457
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
He says that you two
used to do crew together.

458
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,200
Crew?

459
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,900
Oh, hi.
I'm serena van der woodsen.

460
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,200
Blair, i didn't know you were
interested in doing crew.

461
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm not. I was just saying
that there's a family connection

462
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Because of my father--
In fact, i didn't know

463
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,100
You were interested
in athletics at all.

464
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,200
Well, especially ones where
you might get your hair wet.

465
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,500
She's really more
of the indoors type of girl.

466
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,599
Oh, my goodness.
Your glass is almost empty.

467
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,100
Let's get you a drink.
Uh, no, i'll take him.

468
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,400
Oh, don't worry about it.
So tell me about yale.

469
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,899
Can you please explain

470
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,399
How serena's
commandeering the yale rep

471
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
While you're supposed
to be his usher?

472
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,200
I switched.

473
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,600
I'm trying to get
into princeton.

474
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,500
Oh, don't your la perlas
in a bunch.

475
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,399
Look who's arrived--
Dr. Ostroff.

476
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,800
Blair, dr. Donald ostroff.

477
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,200
<I>interesting choice of guest, b.</I>

478
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,500
Such a pleasure. I've heard
s-Such wonderful things...

479
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,900
<I>coincidence? I think not.</I>

480
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,400
I liked your book.

481
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,100
Oh, thanks. What did you think
of the epilogue?

482
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,600
Some people really love it.

483
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,300
"The new york times"
called it a "cheap cop-Out."

484
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,999
Warner bros.
Is making a movie.

485
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,600
I think they're gonna
change the end.

486
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,200
Well, i can see
how the ending

487
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,100
Might not seem all that...
commercial.

488
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,400
Uh...

489
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,700
Would you like
something to drink?

490
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,600
Lily, how are you?

491
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,100
Oh, bart, hello.
How are you?

492
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,100
Hey, eric.

493
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,699
How's, uh, miami?

494
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,600
It was good, thanks.

495
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,100
You know, go, marlins.

496
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,800
Would you excuse me, please?

497
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
So the neuroscience project
i'm working on

498
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,600
Involves the cellular
signaling pathway

499
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,500
Of neuronal
nitric oxide synthase.

500
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,100
It's initiated when
glutamate binds to n.M.D.A.R...

501
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,400
Hi. You're eric, right?

502
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,600
Yeah, you're jenny,
dan's sister, right?

503
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,800
Yeah, we, um, met at...

504
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,100
Bendel's.
Yeah, i remember.
Oh, cool.

505
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,100
Eric, good to see you.
You enjoy miami?

506
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,300
Uh, yeah.
S-Save the manatees.

507
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,699
Manatees?

508
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,500
It's a long story.
I've got time.

509
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,799
It's a little dark and...

510
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,200
I can handle it.

511
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,100
(Dan) you wanna
go to yale then?

512
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,400
No, brown. It's just
this thing with blair.

513
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,399
Oh, yeah. Yeah, i get it.
I mean, since you don't have

514
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,099
To actually worry
about getting into college,

515
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,600
Why not make the entire evening
about screwing over blair?

516
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,900
No, thanks.

517
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,500
Hey.

518
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,600
Wait, you're seriously
not gonna talk to me?

519
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,900
Like, literally not speak?

520
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,300
Hey.

521
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,400
Oh, much better.

522
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,200
Thanks, guys.

523
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,700
So, um, what's he like?

524
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,099
Like a dartmouth
english lit professor

525
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,600
I have nothing
in common with.
Mm.

526
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,400
Guess i could tell him

527
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,700
How everything i have
i got because i'm an archibald.

528
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,100
You should mention dr. Seuss.

529
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,800
Theodor geisel is his real name.
He went to dartmouth.

530
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,000
Uh, hall said he got the idea
for "the petting zoo"

531
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,200
From "the lorax."
The what?

532
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,400
Um, you know what?
Never mind.

533
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,200
Just--Just mention
how his prose style

534
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,199
Is influenced
by early faulkner.

535
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,900
You'll be all right.

536
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,200
Uh, or not.

537
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
I was actually gonna
get some fresh air.

538
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,200
How about you
take these over to him?

539
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,200
All right.

540
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,600
Yeah, i guess i could
leave my post unmanned

541
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,400
For a minute or two.

542
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,300
Where do you think
you're going?
Home.

543
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,499
(Scoffs) i don't think so.

544
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,600
Now you get back out there
and you finish what you started.

545
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,100
You mean what you started?
I don't wanna go to dartmouth.

546
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,000
There, i said it.
Now back off.

547
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,799
So we moved into the hotel,
and, uh...

548
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,900
It was just the two of us,

549
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,800
And i was <i>really</i> lonely.

550
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,100
So...
that's when you...

551
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,199
So i ended up
at the ostroff center.

552
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,800
And my mom says that they have
the best counselors,

553
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,900
But what they really
get paid for

554
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,700
Is to to keep
their mouths shut.

555
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,600
Look,
i-I won't say anything.

556
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,900
I promise.

557
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,600
So do you wanna
go back in?

558
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Yeah, and answer
more questions about florida?

559
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Well, i have a grandma
who lives in fort myers.

560
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
I can help
think of some material.

561
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,200
May i please
have everyone's attention?

562
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,900
Welcome again

563
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,899
To the constance billard/
st. Jude's ivy week mixer.

564
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,700
I'm blorf,

565
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,900
Chair of the community outreach
committee.

566
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,699
Every year,
our schools choose to support

567
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,699
One local institution that
we feel benefits our community.

568
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,500
This year,

569
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,200
Our schools have chosen to honor
the ostroff center.

570
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,100
This semester, our choice
is a very personal one

571
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,500
Because the center
has helped one of our own.

572
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,100
What is going on here?

573
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,000
It's because
of their excellent program

574
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,600
Which aids so many
young addicts and alcoholics

575
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,500
That a student here with us
today is clean and sober.

576
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,700
At least, for now.

577
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,199
Can i please have
serena van der woodsen

578
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Join me onstage?

579
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,100
<I>spotted at ivy week mixer--</I>

00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,400

581
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,100
<I>and only</i> one <i>gets out alive.</I>

582
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,800
<I>better take cover.</I>

583
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,299
Please tell me
this isn't happening.
It's not.

584
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,900
No.
No, you're
not goinhere.

585
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,700
You're gonna stay
right here, okay?

586
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,800
Whatever you're doing,

587
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,600
Think about who's standing
in this room right now.

588
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,500
Don't try to deny it.
Chuck saw you.

589
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,600
Hi. I'm serena van der woodsen.

590
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,800
I just wanna thank my friend,
blair waldorf,

591
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,300
For recognizing
the ostroff center

592
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,900
And all of the good things
that they do.

593
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,800
Thanks, blair.

594
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,000
At the center,

595
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,299
One of the main things
that we learn is forgiveness.

596
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,700
She's in rehab?
No, it's not her.
It's her brother who's there.

597
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,300
What?
You can't tell anyone, okay?

598
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,500
I won't, but why
is she doing this?

599
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,900
I've learned about how,

600
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,400
In order to move forward
with our future,

601
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,500
We must forgive those
who have wronged us in the past,

602
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,800
And we must, ourselves,
ask for forgiveness

603
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,500
From those
whom we've wronged.

604
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,999
Without this forgiveness,
innocent people get hurt--

605
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,200
All right, thank you, serena.
Thank you. Thank you.

606
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,300
<I>honesty may be the best policy</i>
<i>in some zip codes,</i>

607
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,400
<I>but not in this one,</i>
<i>and not this week,</i>

608
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,400
<I>'cause</i>
<i>"i was a teenage drug addict"</i>

609
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,400
<I>is not exactly</i>
<i>a winning college essay.</I>

610
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,999
And now can i please have
dr. Ostroff join me onstage?

611
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,399
Why is blair outing you

612
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,100
For a drug problem
that you don't have?

613
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,000
You don't, do you?
Mom!

614
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,400
Ot lll, we's nike  have
some free, open relationship.
And that's <i>my</i> fault?

615
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,900
Look, what's happened to eric

616
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,600
Has put a huge strain
on our family,

617
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,599
But we are still a family.

618
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,000
Why do you think
i did what i just did?

619
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,700
Will you excuse me?

620
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,500
I'm gonna go end this
with blair now.

621
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,800
Blair,
what the hell was that?

622
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Will you excuse us,
please?

623
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,900
Sure.

624
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,100
So we good now?

625
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
Are we square?

626
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,500
No, because nothing i do

627
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,700
Will ever be as bad
as what you did to me.

628
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,200
Look, i'm asking you,
please.

629
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,699
I'll stop if you will.

630
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,700
You're just saying that
because today you lost,

631
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,200
And you're gonna keep losing.

632
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,900
Now if you'll excuse me,
unlike you,

633
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,100
I have a future
to get back to.

634
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,400
Serena.

635
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,799
Serena!
What? What, do you want
to congratulate me

636
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
On destroying my future?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

637
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,400
I just wanted to ask
if you're okay,

638
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,300
'Cause what you did in there
for your brother,

639
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,000
That was...
that was very cool.

640
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,800
Wait, how did you know
about my brother?
It--It's okay.

641
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,300
Really, no one
will ever hear it from me,

642
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,100
But if you ever need
anybody to talk to,

643
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,300
Or not talk to,

644
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,400
I'd be happy to do either.

645
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,300
I'll keep that in mind.

646
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,900
And, um,

647
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,100
I know i said
some things about you

648
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,500
And your world,

649
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,000
D i'sorry.

650
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,100
Obviously, i don't know
anything about your life.

651
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,000
Thank you,

652
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,100
But i've really
got to get out of here.

653
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,500
Yeah, sure, sure.

654
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,500
But...

655
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,799
Maybe, you know,
i can take you up

656
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,300
On that getting together
and not talking thing sometime?

657
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,400
Will you call me?

658
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,900
Yeah.

659
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,300
Okay, let's go.
Let's get out of here.

660
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,200
No, there's someone
i need to talk to first.

661
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,300
Please, mom,
i can do this.

662
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,100
Okay.

663
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,100
Blair, can i talk to you?
It'll just take a moment.

664
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,800
Sure. Sure.

665
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,300
Serena's not a patient
at the ostroff center.

666
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,400
Eric, you've always been a sweet
kid, and i can understand you

667
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Trying to protect
your sister--
I am.

668
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,199
I've never even seen you
take a drink.

669
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,800
I'm not an alcoholic.

670
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,100
<I>i</i> did this.

671
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,400
And today,
serena protected me.

672
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,400
Eric, i...

673
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,000
I didn't...

674
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
See that coming? Yeah.

675
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,000
Oh, it must be a shock

676
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,300
For someone who thinks
she knows everything.

677
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,399
And what was that all about?

678
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,300
<I>another bomb</i>
<i>lands in blair's lap.</I>

679
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,200
<I>will she use it as ammunition,</i>

680
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,700
<I>or will she finally surrender</i>
<i>and put down her arms?</I>

681
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,900
Nothing.

682
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,000
So you really impressed
the guy, huh?

683
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,500
Must be the way
you poured those sodas.

684
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,300
Yeah, about that, uh...

685
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,200
I know i may have been a little
light on the gratitude...

686
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,600
Yeah, a touch.

687
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,200
But i appreciate it,
all of it,

688
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,300
Even if i sometimes
don't show it.

689
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,099
We're real men, son.

690
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,800
We don't like
to share our feelings.

691
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,800
But...

692
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,299
I know
what you're capable of,

693
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,000
And nothing--

694
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,900
My last name,

695
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,000
My bank account--

696
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,400
Is gonna keep you
from getting what you deserve,

697
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,300
Not if i can help it.

698
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
And i see that dartmouth

699
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,299
Has an electroacoustic
music program.

700
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,000
What do you think
of me applying?
What?

701
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,300
Yeah, and jenny's smart.
We'll get her early admission.

702
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,500
Maybe we'll all go.

703
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,100
So not remotely funny.

704
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,400
Nate.

705
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,300
Huh?

706
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,400
Hello?

707
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,900
Oh, yeah,
i'll be right there.

708
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,100
Where the hell could you
possibly have to be right now?

709
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,100
I'm late for a run
with my dad.

710
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,200
Who's jessica?

711
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,700
(Chuckles)
aw, jersey girls.

712
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,099
Let's just say

713
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,000
They're the princeton tigers
for a reason.

714
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,500
All right, i'll see ya.

715
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,400
(Captain) you feel this?
Feeling good?

716
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,800
Good.
All right,
'cause i'm gonna...

717
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,200
Hey, good to see you, son.
Turns out jed's a runner, too.
I would

718
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,600
If i knew he was gonna
get me out here this early.
I'm glad to see

719
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,599
You're feeling better, nate.
I was, uh, just telling jed

720
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,300
About your little bout
of food poisoning last night.

721
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,900
What do you say, kiddo? You want
to show him how it's done?
Let's go.

722
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,000
Nate is the captain
of his lacrosse team,

723
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,400
As well as being an all-Star
cross-Country runner.

724
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,400
Hi.
Hey!

725
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,600
Um, is it okay
that i'm here?

726
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,099
Yeah. Hi.

727
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,300
Uh, will your mom be mad?

728
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,100
That you're here? That would
require her stopping by.

729
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,099
Saturday mornings are spent
at bliss, and after last night,

730
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,100
I think she could use some
extra time on the massage table.

731
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,000
Right. Well, here.

732
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,100
Somebody has an admirer.

733
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,900
They're for my sister...
from the brown rep.

734
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,300
Um, apparently his cousin
did some time here in his youth.

735
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,600
Well, that's good, right?

736
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,400
I mean, at least
her entire future isn't blown.
I don't think

737
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,700
That's making her feel
a whole lot better right now.

738
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,499
Whenever
something's bothering you,

739
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,600
I can always find you here.

740
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
You here
for another catfight?

741
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,300
What's that?

742
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,900
A letter.

743
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,900
I wrote it to you when you
were away at boarding school.

744
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,900
I never sent it.

745
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,900
"Dear serena,

746
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,700
"My world is falling apart,

747
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,100
"And you're the only one
who would understand.

748
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,400
"My father left my mother
for a 31-Year-Old model...

749
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,500
"A male model.

750
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,299
"I feel like screaming

751
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,200
"Because i don't have
anyone to talk to.

752
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,600
"You're gone..."

753
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,300
"My dad's gone.

754
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
Nate's acting weird."

755
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,300
(Voice breaks)
"where are you?

756
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,300
Why don't you call?"

757
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,000
"Why did you leave
without saying good-Bye?

758
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,400
"You're supposed
to be my best friend.

759
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,500
I miss you so much."

760
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,400
"Love, blair."
(Paper rustles)

761
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Why didn't you send it?

762
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,800
I would've--

763
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,100
You would've what?

764
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,400
You knew, serena,

765
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,100
And you didn't even call.

766
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,799
(Voice breaks) i didn't know
what to say to you

767
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,500
Or even how to be your friend
after what i did.

768
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,000
I'm so sorry.

769
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,000
Eric told me what happened.

770
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,800
I guess your family's been
going through a hard time, too.

771
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,199
