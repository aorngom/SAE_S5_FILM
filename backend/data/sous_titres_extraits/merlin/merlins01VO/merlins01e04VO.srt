1
00:00:00,185 --> 00:00:01,426
In the time of magic,

2
00:00:01,426 --> 00:00:03,308
the destiny of a great kingdom 

3
00:00:03,308 --> 00:00:06,056
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

4
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:08,377
His name...

5
00:00:08,377 --> 00:00:10,437
Merlin.

6
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:49,433
Merlin.

7
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,980
Camelot welcomes you, Lord Bayard of Mercia.

8
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,820
The treaty we sign today marks an end to war

9
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,510
and a beginning to a new friendship between our people.

10
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:41,228


11
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:49,002


12
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:56,266


13
00:01:58,654 --> 00:02:03,914


14
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,050
Why do I always get the donkey work?

15
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,010
You're a servant. It's what you do.

16
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,530
My arms'll be a foot longer when I finish.

17
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,710
It's characterbuilding.

18
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,150
As the old proverb says, hard work breeds...

19
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,960
...a harder soul.

20
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,790
There's no way a proverb! You just made that up.

21
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,910
I didn't!

22
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,890
Sorry.       That's all right.

23
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,970
Excuse me.       I'll give you a hand.

24
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,890
Hi.

25
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,640
I'm Merlin.       Cara.

26
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,730
You're Arthur's servant.

27
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,390
That must be such an honour.       Oh, yeah. It is.

28
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,390
Well, someone's gotta keep the place running.

29
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,430
Thank you, Merlin.       Hmm?

30
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,270
Oh, right! Yeah.

31
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,540
Uh, no problem.

32
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,560
It was nice meeting you.

33
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,000
Shouldn't you be busy running the place?!

34
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,560
Ugh! When's the last time these were cleaned?

35
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,340
Last year some time. Before the feast of Beltane.

36
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,470
Did it end in a food fight?       Don't all feasts?

37
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,110
I wouldn't know.

38
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,140
The airs and graces of the court are a mystery to me.

39
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,710
Not tonight, they won't be.

40
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,270
I'm gonna be at the banquet?

41
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,370
Not quite.

42
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,620
You'll be there to make sure my cup doesn't run dry.

43
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,060
If I have to sit through Bayard's boring speeches,

44
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,800
I don't see why you should get out of it.

45
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,090
Be sure to polish the buttons.

46
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,880
Do you want to see what you'll be wearing tonight?

47
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,110
Won't this do?

48
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,649
No.

49
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,280
Tonight, you'll be wearing the official ceremonial robes

50
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,410
of the servants of Camelot.

51
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,200
You can't be serious.

52
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,130
Nice hat.       Thanks.

53
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,740
She's pretty, isn't she?

54
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,989
For a handmaiden, I mean.

55
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,020
Pretty for a princess, let alone a handmaiden.

56
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,010
People of Camelot, for a great many years,

57
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,200
we have been mortal enemies.

58
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,300
Our blood stains the ground

59
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,050
from the walls of Camelot to the gates of Mercia.

60
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,980
And though we remember the dead,

61
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,140
we must not allow any more to join them.

62
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,230
As a symbol of our goodwill, and of our newfound friendship,

63
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,530
I present these ceremonial goblets

64
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,680
to you, Uther,

65
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,730
and to your son, Arthur,

66
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,950
in the hope our friendship may last.

67
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,250
Merlin, I need to speak to you.

68
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,670
What is it?       Not here, please.

69
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,300
I don't know who else to tell.

70
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,800
Tonight, we toast a new beginning for our peoples.

71
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,950
We look to a future free from the toils of war.

72
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,440
When he gave Arthur the goblet, I knew.

73
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,070
Whoa. Start from the beginning.

74
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,920
Two days ago, I was bring Bayard his meal.

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,920
He wasn't expecting me to walk in...

76
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,200
What are you trying to say?

77
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,190
If he knows I said anything, he'll kill me.

78
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,510
I will not let that happen, I promise.

79
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,720
Tell me what you saw.       Bayard is no friend of Camelot.

80
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,160
He craves the kingdom for himself.

81
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:10,520
Cara...tell me, what has Bayard done with the goblet?

82
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,630
He believes if he kills Arthur,

83
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,890
Uther's spirit will be broken and Camelot will fall.

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,150
What was he done to the goblet?

85
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,950
He put something in it.       What?

86
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,720
I shouldn't. He'll kill me.       Please tell me.

87
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,100
Is it poison?

88
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,260
And may the differences from our past remain there.

89
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,140
To your health, Uther,

90
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,670
Arthur,

91
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,340
the Lady Morgana...

92
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,200
...the people of Camelot

93
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,910
And to fallen warriors on both sides.

94
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,550
Stop! It's poisoned. Don't drink it.

95
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,790
What?       Merlin, what are you doing?

96
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,450
Bayard laced Arthur's goblet with poison.

97
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,960
This is an outrage!

98
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,240
Order your men to put down their swords. You're outnumbered.

99
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,670
I will not allow this insult to go unchallenged.

100
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,420
On what grounds do you base this accusation?

101
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,640
I'll handle this.

102
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,650
Merlin, you idiot,

103
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,940
have we been at the sloe gin again?

104
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,050
Unless you want to be strung up,

105
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,730
you'll tell me why you think it's poisoned  now.

106
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,740
He was seen lacing it.       By whom?

107
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,650
I can't say.

108
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,480
I won't listen to this any more.       Pass me the goblet.

109
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,359
If you're telling the truth...

110
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:53,740
I am.       ..then you have nothing to fear.

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,460
No  if this does prove to be poison,

112
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,950
I want the pleasure of killing you myself.

113
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,770
He'll drink it.

114
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,840
But if it is poisoned, he'll die.

115
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,670
Then we'll know he was telling the truth.

116
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,460
What if he lives?

117
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,610
You have my apologies,you can do with him as you will.

118
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,800
Uther,please.He's just a boy.He doesn't know what he says.

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,780
You should have taught him better.

120
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,040
Merlin, apologise. This is a mistake.

121
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,150
I'll drink it.       No, no, no. It's all right.

122
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,340
It's fine.

123
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,050
He's all yours.

124
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,350
It's poison. Guards, seize him!

125
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,840
Merlin, can you hear me?

126
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,560
We have to get him back to my chambers.

127
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,850
Bring the goblet. I need to identify the poison.

128
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,380
Lay him on the bed, quickly. He's struggling to breathe.

129
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,640
Gwen, fetch me some water and a towel.

130
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,540
Is he gonna be all right?

131
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,950
He's burning up.       You can cure him, can't you, Gaius?

132
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,231
I won't know until I can identify the poison. 

133
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:00,323
Pass me the goblet.

134
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,550
Ah. There's something stuck on the inside.

135
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,950
What is it?

136
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,650
Looks like a flower petal of some kind.

137
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,790
He's on fire.       Keep him cool.

138
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,540
It'll help control his fever.

139
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,770
Ah. The petal comes from the morteaus flower.

140
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,250
It says, "Someone poisoned by the morteaus can only be saved

141
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,080
"by a potion made from the leaf of the very same flower.

142
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,940
"It can only be found in the caves deep beneath Balor forest.

143
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,320
"The flower grows on the roots of the morteaus tree".

144
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:55,370
That's unfriendly.       Cockatrice. It guards the forest.

145
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,560
Potent venom. A single drop means certain death.

146
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,012
"Few who've crossed the mountains of Isgaard 

147
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:05,318
in search of morteaus have made it back alive

148
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,800
Sounds like fun.       Arthur,It's too dangerous.

149
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,650
If I don't get the antidote, what happens to merlin?

150
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,760
The morteaus induces a slow and painful death.

151
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,340
He may hold out four, maybe five days, not for much longer.

152
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,850
Eventually, he will die.

153
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,350
My lady,I am sorry I haven't been here to attend to you.

154
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,300
Don't worry.I'm all right. How's Merlin?

155
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,780
If Arthur returns with the antidote, he'll be fine.

156
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,830
Then he'll be fine. 

157
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,030
You should be with him. I'll manage.

158
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,430
I know what he means to you. Go.

159
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,110
Thank you.

160
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,804
What's the point of having people tasters for it

161
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:11,214
if you're going to get yourself killed anyway?

162
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:12,957
I won't fail.No matter what you think.       

163
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:14,972
Arthur,You are my only son and heir.

164
00:13:14,972 --> 00:13:17,900
I can't risk losing you for the sake of some serving boy.

165
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,024
His life's worthless?       

166
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:21,438
No,because he's worth less than yours.

167
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,863
I can save him.Let me take some men. 

168
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:26,000
We'll find the antidote and bring it back.

169
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,150
No!       Why not?

170
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,550
Because one day, I will be dead and Camelot will need a king.

171
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,449
I won't let you jeopardise the future of this kingdom

172
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:34,596
over some fools servant

173
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:35,930
It's not a fool servant

174
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,170
Gaius says that if we...

175
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,490
Oh, Gaius says?! That's exactly what makes it so.

176
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,700
Please, Father. He saved my life.

177
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,749
I can't stand by and watch him die.

178
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,280
Then don't look.

179
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,263
This boy won't be the last to die on your behalf. 

180
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,302
You're going to be king.

181
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,240
Something  you have to get used to.       

182
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,296
I can't accept that.

183
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,433
You're not going.       You can't stop me.

184
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:02,301
That's it! Arthur.That's end to it.

185
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,774
You're not leaving this castle tonight.

186
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,970
Say what you like about the food

187
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,340
but you can't beat our feast for entertainment.

188
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,990
Morgana,sorry.Are you all right?       Disappointed.

189
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,876
I was looking forward to clumping a couple of run 

190
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:29,726
ahead of the the label.

191
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,076
Guards could've handled Bayard.       

192
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:34,123
Yeah.But why let them have all the fun?

193
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,630
Morgana,You shouldn't get involved. It's dangerous.

194
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,519
Spare me the lecture. I've already had it from Uther.

195
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,299
If it is a bit of consolation.You weren't the only one.       

196
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:44,663
Not that I listen to him.

197
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,110
Sometimes you must do what you think is right.

198
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,580
Damn the consequences.

199
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,780
You think I should go.       Doesn't matter what I think.

200
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,200
If I don't make it back, who will be the next king of Camelot?

201
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,180
There's more than just my life at stake.

202
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,510
What kind of king would Camelot want?

203
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,070
One that would risk his life for that of a lowly servant?

204
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,670
Or one who does what his father tells him to?

205
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,480
Halt! No!

206
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,500
He's getting hotter.

207
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:46,565


208
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,820
What language is that?       None. The fever's taken hold.

209
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,240
None of those words are his own. His pulse is weaker.

210
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,740
What is it?       That can't be right.

211
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,570
The rash isn't supposed to appear until the final stage.

212
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,970
What does that mean?

213
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,453
It says that once a rash appears, 

214
00:16:13,453 --> 00:16:15,829
death will follow within two days.

215
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,980
You said four days.       Something's increased the potency.

216
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,220
It warns that "the effect will be more rapid

217
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,200
"if an enchantment is used during preparation".

218
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,970
Enchantment? Bayard's no sorcerer.       No, he isn't.

219
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,700
Then who did this?

220
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,400
It can't have been.

221
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,500
She wouldn't dare to come here

222
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,460
Unless...       Unless what?

223
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,020
What happened to that girl?       Which girl?

224
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,130
Before Merlin burst into the hall,

225
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,480
Bayard's servant girl took him outside.

226
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,590
She had dark hair. Very beautiful.       Find her. Quickly.

227
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,140
Arthur...

228
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,270
I especially ordered Arthur not to go.       Worked like a charm.

229
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,790
Not another word.       My lips are sealed.

230
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,404
Should have put him under lock and key.

231
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:34,476
You can't chain him up every time he disagree with you. 

232
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:35,947
Just you watch me.

233
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,010
I won't be disobeyed,especially by my own son!

234
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,380
No. Of course you won't.

235
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,200
You knew about this, didn't you?

236
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,050
Morgana...

237
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,289
Don't lie to me.

238
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,640
Arthur's old enough to decide.

239
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,870
He's just a boy.       Have you seen your son recently?

240
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,430
You have to let him make his own mind up.

241
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,910
Even if it means letting him go to his death?

242
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,730
Let me guess, she wasn't there?

243
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,710
Noone has seen her since the banquet.

244
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,900
Who is she?       Not who she claims.

245
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,140
You know, don't you?       Cara.

246
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,050
Though, that's not her name. Not her real name.

247
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,370
Then who is she?       A powerful sorceress.

248
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,580
We should tell Uther. Maybe he could send riders after her.

249
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:06,090
She'd be long gone. Impossible to know where.

250
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,520
Oh, no.       What?

251
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,344
She knows the only place an antidote 

252
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:13,166
will be found is Balor forest.

253
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,440
Arthur could be walking into a trap.

254
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,130
Arthur.

255
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,610
Arthur. Ohh.

256
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,990
Hello?

257
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,300
Are you all right?

258
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,270
Stay back.

259
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,450
It's all right. I'm not going to hurt you.

260
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,460
Who did that to you?

261
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,330
My master.

262
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,410
I ran away from him but then I got lost.

263
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,390
Please don't leave me.

264
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,970
I won't. I'm not going to.

265
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,090
You can take me away from here?       Not yet.

266
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,740
There's something I have to do first.

267
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,930
Why have you come to the caves?       I'm looking for something.

268
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,640
It can only be found here.

269
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,320
What is it?

270
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,470
I know this place. I could help you.

271
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,457
It's a type of flower that grows inside the cave. 

272
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:20,421
It's very rare.

273
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:25,790
The morteaus flower? I know where they are.

274
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,020
I'll show you.

275
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,620
Arthur, it...it's a trap.

276
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,580
It's a trap.

277
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,931
His fever's getting worse, isn't it?       

278
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:08,088
The poison's setting in.

279
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:16,870


280
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,960
Could you get me some wolf bean?        Yes, of course.

281
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,460
Merlin, you must fight it.

282
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,050
There they are.

283
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,290
Keep back from the edge.

284
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,120
Don't worry. We'll be out of here soon.

285
00:24:14,516 --> 00:24:21,199


286
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,890
What are you doing?!

287
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,900
I expected so much more.

288
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,530
Who are you?

289
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,200
The last face you'll ever see.

290
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,440
It seems we have a visitor.

291
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,020
Very good.

292
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,590
But he won't be the last.

293
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,110
I'll let his friends finish you off, Arthur Pendragon.

294
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,850
It's not your destiny to die at my hand.

295
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,110
Who are you?!

296
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,860
Arthur. It's too dark.

297
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,950
Too dark.

298
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:08,418


299
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,970
Merlin.

300
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,970
What are you doing?

301
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,490
Come on, then. What are you waiting for?

302
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,040
Finish me off!

303
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,640
Leave them, Arthur.

304
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,590
Go. Save yourself.

305
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,990
Follow the light.

306
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,890
Faster. Go faster.

307
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,620
Follow the light!

308
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,170
Move. Climb.

309
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,640
Inform the King! Arthur has returned to Camerlot.

310
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,060
What are you doing? Let me pass.

311
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,480
I'm sorry, sire. You're under arrest by order of the King.

312
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,850
You disobeyed me.

313
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,600
Of course. A life is at stake. Do not let Merlin die

314
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,570
because of something I did.

315
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,600
Why do you care? The boy is just a servant.

316
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,712
He knew the danger he was putting himself in

317
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,018
He knew what would happen if he drank from that goblet, 

318
00:30:14,018 --> 00:30:17,881
but he did it anyway. He saved my life.

319
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,600
There's more.

320
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,409
There was a woman at the mountain 

321
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:23,038
She knew I was there for the flower.

322
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,230
I don't think it was Bayard who tried to poison me.

323
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,920
Of course it was.

324
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,580
Gaius knows what to do with this.

325
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:39,420
Put me in the stocks for a week, a month even. I don't care.

326
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,720
Just make sure it gets to him. I'm begging you.

327
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,380
No!

328
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,324
You have to learn there's a right 

329
00:30:51,324 --> 00:30:53,979
and a wrong way of doing things.

330
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,600
I'll see you're let out in a week.

331
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,280
Then you can find yourself another servant.

332
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,870
He hasn't got much longer. Arthur got the flower?

333
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,530
I don't know. Uther won't allow anyone to see him.

334
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,230
Is there nothing we can do to help?

335
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,880
Only the leaf of the morteaus can save him.

336
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,840
We must find out if Arthur has it.

337
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,860
I could sneak into the dungeon.       

338
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,975
That would be very dangerous.

339
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,410
I've got to. Merlin will die if I don't.

340
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,730
Be careful.

341
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,350
Food for the prisoner.

342
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,480
Set it down over there.

343
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,700
Thank you.

344
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,140
Wait a minute.

345
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,220
I couldn't possible eat this. It's disgusting.

346
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:49,630
The state it's in, I'm not sure it's fit for anyone.

347
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,980
You. Wait!

348
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,190
Waste not, want not. 

349
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,850
We're not all as precious as our Royal Highness.

350
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:50,220
Food for Prince Arthur.       Stay where you are!

351
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,870
How is he?

352
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,910
Have you got the morteaus?       Here.

353
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,100
His breathing's worse. We must hurry.

354
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,100
Why have you stopped?

355
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,971
The poison was created using magic. 

356
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,500
We may need magic for an antidote.

357
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,360
But we can't. It's forbidden.

358
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,590
Even if we could.

359
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,960
I'll try and make it work without.

360
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,360
Oh, I need some fresh water.

361
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:49,108


362
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:17,185


363
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,410
Thank you.

364
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,210
Hold his nose.

365
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,740
Swallow, Merlin.

366
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,780
Swallow it.

367
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,200
He's stopped breathing.

368
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,540
What's happening?

369
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,580
Gaius?

370
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,260
His heart has stopped.

371
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,370
He's dead?

372
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,690
He can't be.

373
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,370
It can't be.

374
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,580
It wasn't his destiny.

375
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,190
It's my fault.

376
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,370
If I'd have got here sooner, if I'd have been quicker.

377
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,390
No, no.

378
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,550
It was me.

379
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,850
I should've looked after him better.

380
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,360
It's my fault.

381
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,730
You should be ashamed of yourself,

382
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,340
you're old enough to be her grandfather.

383
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,110
Merlin! You're alive!

384
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,560
I'm the ghost come back to haunt you.

385
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,290
Sorry, I'm just...

386
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,960
I thought you were dead.

387
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,030
It's fine.

388
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,680
It's more than fine.

389
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,230
Um... What happened?

390
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,810
The last thing I remember is drinking the wine.

391
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,820
Forgive the interruption. May I speak with you?

392
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,820
Not now.       It is important.

393
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,349
Word of Bayard's arrest got back to Mercia. 

394
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:01,632
We're about to be attacked.

395
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,640
What I have to tell you may have bearing on your plans.

396
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,530
It will only take a moment.

397
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,054
I know who tried to poison Arthur.       

398
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:16,480
So do I  he's locking in my dungeon.

399
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,670
It wasn't Bayard.

400
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,210
The poison was magical.

401
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,870
I'd recognise the hand that made it anywhere.

402
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,490
Nimueh.

403
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,900
You must be mistaken.       I wish I was.

404
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,960
It can't have been. We'd know her.

405
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,870
Her face is not easily forgotten.

406
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,690
She's powerful. She enchants the eye that beholds her.

407
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,970
We never knew it was her.       Have you any proof?

408
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,366
The poison used against Merlin 

409
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:47,178
was made more potent by the use of magic.

410
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,931
You saying she conspired with Bayard to kill Arthur?       

411
00:38:49,932 --> 00:38:52,187
No, Bayard is innocent.

412
00:38:52,187 --> 00:38:55,970
Look at what's happening? This is what she's wanted all along.

413
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,480
a war to bring strife and misery to Camelot.

414
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,520
How long before Bayard's armies reach our walls?

415
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,530
A day. Less. We should send cavalry to meet them.

416
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,453
Instruct your men not to leave Camelot 

417
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:14,386
until I give the word.

418
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:15,557
Sire.

419
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,880
You're making the right decision, sire.

420
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:29,390
Do you think Arthur should be told the truth about Nimueh?

421
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,300
OK, let the bragging begin.

422
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,440
How'd you manage it?

423
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,430
I'm not sure.

424
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,080
All I do know is I had help.

425
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,980
Someone knew I was in trouble

426
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,200
and sent a light to guide the way.

427
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,280
Who?

428
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,950
I don't know.

429
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,910
But whoever it was,

430
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,370
I'm only here because of them.

431
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,080
I'm glad you're back.

432
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,680
Arthur?

433
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,340
The woman you met in the forest,

434
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,100
what did she tell you?

435
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,040
Not much.

436
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,580
She was too busy trying to get me killed.

437
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,260
It was strange, though.

438
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,450
In what way?

439
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,310
I was at her mercy.

440
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,030
She could've finished me off but she chose not to.

441
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,680
She said it wasn't my destiny to die at her hand.

442
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,280
You must have been scared.

443
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,840
Had its moments.

444
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,170
Those who practise magic know only evil.

445
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,625
They despise and seek to destroy goodness 

446
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:06,710
wherever they find it,

447
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,370
which is why she wanted you dead.

448
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,320
She is evil.

449
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,460
Sounds as if you know her.

450
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,440
I do.

451
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,800
To know the heart of one sorcerer is to know them all.

452
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,660
You did the right thing,

453
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,850
even though you were disobeying me.

454
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,642
I'm proud of you, Arthur.

455
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,370
Never forget that.

456
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,090
Still alive, then?

457
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,970
Uh, yeah, just about.

458
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,330
I understand I have you to thank for that.

459
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,500
Yeah, well, it was nothing.

460
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,240
A half decent servant is hard to come by.

461
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,780
I was only dropping by to make sure you're all right.

462
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:19,079
Be back to work tomorrow.

463
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,500
Yeah, of course. Bright and early.

464
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,460
Arthur?

465
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,890
Thank you.

466
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,240
You too.

467
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,140
Get some rest.

468
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:44,700
Arthur may give you a hard time, but he's a man of honour.

469
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,420
There aren't many who'd risk what he did for a servant.

470
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,086
It all would've been for nothing 

471
00:42:49,086 --> 00:42:50,744
if he didn't know how my identity is.

472
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,840
Eat your dinner.

473
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:59,038
I don't understand why she went to all the trouble 

474
00:42:59,038 --> 00:42:59,640
of framing Bayard.

475
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,080
She could've just kept quiet and killed Arthur.

476
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,470
Destroying Arthur and Camelot wasn't all she was after.

477
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:09,570
She knew you'd be forced to drink that wine.

478
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:12,790
It was you she wanted to kill.

479
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,385
Seems someone else knows 

480
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,434
you're destined for great things, Merlin.

481
00:43:26,824 --> 00:43:29,436


482
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,270
I owe Lancelot my life.

483
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:34,130
I am paying for that debt the only way I can.

484
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,980
It's my life's ambition  to join the Knights of Camelot.

485
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,080
Arise, Sir Lancelot.

486
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,340
I shall not return...       Don't go£¬Lancelot.

487
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,192
OK, it's now or never.

488
00:43:50,038 --> 00:43:57,372
