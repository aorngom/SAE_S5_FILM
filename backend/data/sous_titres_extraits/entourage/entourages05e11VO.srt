00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:24,713
- Hello?
- <i>Are you sleeping?</i>

4
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:27,006
No, I'm fly-fishing.
Who is this?

5
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:29,331
It's Jamie.
I'm sorry to wake you.

6
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:32,597
I'm up.
I'm not sleeping.

7
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:34,753
- Jamie-Lynn Jamie?
- Yeah.

8
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:38,053
- What's going on?
- Nothing,

9
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:41,736
I just got back from Europe
and my internal clock is all off and,

10
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:45,410
- I thought if you weren't sleeping...
- I'm not sleeping.

11
00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:49,571
- Well, then why don't you come over?
- <i>Is this a trap?</i>

12
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:52,264
'cause the last time I saw you
you weren't exactly thrilled with me.

13
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,557
Maybe this time
you'll keep your mouth shut.

14
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:57,099
And what am I keeping
my mouth shut about?

15
00:01:57,321 --> 00:01:58,413
Just come over.

16
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:00,890
Is this a booty call?

17
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,244
When are you gonna learn that talking
just gets you into trouble?

18
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:15,216
Where are you going?

19
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:18,248
You scared the shit out of me.
What are you doing up?

20
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:20,468
My call time's in an hour.
I'm getting ready to shoot.

21
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:22,633
The real question is
what are you doing up?

22
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:25,213
Since I'm banned from set,
I figured I'd head back into town

23
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,615
- and do that favor Dom needed.
- It's 4:00 in the morning.

24
00:02:27,735 --> 00:02:30,278
But he said he needed us to take the car
back to the leasing company.

25
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:32,529
Not till the first.
It's the 14th.

26
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,298
Now,

27
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,222
- where are you going?
- You know I'd never lie to you.

28
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:39,000
Please don't make me tell you.

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,164
You having gambling
troubles or something?

30
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:43,166
- No, I'm all good.
- All right,

31
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:45,048
as long as you're all good.

32
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:46,711
You all good?

33
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:51,544
- I'm pumped about the scene today.
- You get any sleep?

34
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:54,727
I watched all my old
movies last night.

35
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:58,868
Verner was right, I do have bad habits.
But today I've got my head on straight.

36
00:02:58,988 --> 00:03:00,366
You're gonna kill it, Vin.

37
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,708
You too, right?

38
00:03:03,952 --> 00:03:05,903
Trying to trick me
into tell you where I'm going?

39
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:07,025
Never.

40
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:09,367
Have fun.

41
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,684
What do you mean
he wouldn't tell you?

42
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:19,708
I don't know.
He's got something he's got to do.

43
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:22,411
What could Turtle possibly
have to do that doesn't involve us?

44
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:25,082
- Seriously.
- I don't know. Look, I have to focus.

45
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,489
- We're ready for you, Vince.
- Okay.

46
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:29,579
- And these guys--
- Yeah, we know.

47
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:31,422
We're persona non grata.

48
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,852
- Send our regards to V.V.
- Sorry.

49
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:35,608
I'll be in the trailer.

50
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:38,241
- Wish we could see it, bro.
- You will on the big screen.

51
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:40,223
- Knock 'em dead.
- You know it.

52
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:44,177
Now, Vincent, this is the most
critical moment for your character.

53
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:47,824
His life is hanging in balance
both literally and figuratively.

54
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,970
So we must feel his vulnerability.

55
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,694
- I completely get it.
- Because this vulnerability,

56
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:56,106
it's what lies
at the core of McCabe.

57
00:03:56,226 --> 00:03:58,703
Like an onion,
without a core there's no layers.

58
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,768
Whatever you need, I will deliver.

59
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:02,659
Good. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

60
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:05,206
I appreciate it.
Are we ready to shoot?

61
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:08,580
Okay, let's do this.

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,202
Harness set.

63
00:04:10,322 --> 00:04:13,156
- Here we go.
- Everyone, this is for picture.

64
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:15,667
Fire!

65
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:17,959
- Wind.
- Roll camera.

66
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:20,069
- Roll camera.
- Rolling!

67
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:23,308
<i>Smokejumpers</i> scene 43 take one.
Mark.

68
00:04:24,268 --> 00:04:25,295
Action!

69
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,279
Yeah, Wilson, it's McCabe.

70
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:37,867
I'm code three.

71
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:40,491
Winds took me about 100 yards
from the drop point.

72
00:04:56,623 --> 00:04:58,062
What are you doing?

73
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:01,119
I was getting ready
to do my walk of shame.

74
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:03,144
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?

75
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:05,034
Oh, poor Turtle.

76
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:07,241
Are you feeling used?

77
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,703
No, I'm very very happy.

78
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:12,740
And I want to keep you happy in case
you decide you want to call again.

79
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,734
If you have somewhere to go,
you can go.

80
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:18,251
I got nowhere to go. In fact,
I'll move in if you want me to.

81
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:22,450
I'm hungry.
I want to eat.

82
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:25,954
- I can go get us something if you want.
- I was thinking we could go out.

83
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,997
Okay.

84
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,540
Yeah, I'd love that.

85
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:33,217
Get your ass back here first.
I want to work up an appetite.

86
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:38,466
<i>Smokejumpers</i> scene 43 take 51.

87
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:40,639
Cue the fire.

88
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,471
And action!

89
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,097
Wilson, it's McCabe.

90
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:57,182
I'm code three.

91
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:01,739
Winds dragged me about 100 yards
from the drop point northeast.

92
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:04,545
I don't think
I'm gonna make it, man.

93
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,244
Can you call my wife?

94
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:08,362
I need to talk to my wife.

95
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:10,331
Stop.
Take it from the top.

96
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:12,015
And more passion.

97
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:14,515
- Where?
- Everywhere.

98
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,464
All right, come on.
Let's do it.

99
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:19,841
Okay, action.

100
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:22,176
Yeah, Wilson, it's McCabe.

101
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:26,283
This'll have to be the last take.
Otherwise we go into meal penalty

102
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:28,266
I don't give a fuck
about meal penalty.

103
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:29,851
You call my wife.

104
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,353
Tell her I love her.

105
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:33,938
Take it from the middle.

106
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:37,465
- From where?
- The middle, "call my wife."

107
00:06:41,597 --> 00:06:44,280
I got to talk to my wife, Wilson.
I'm not gonna make it.

108
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,866
- Vincent.
- can you call my wife? Tell her--

109
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:49,202
I need more passion.

110
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:51,789
There should be fear or panic.

111
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,673
You think this is it.

112
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:56,210
And the girl you're calling,
that's your childhood love.

113
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:59,203
There should be sorrow, remorse,

114
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:01,809
sadness.

115
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:08,086
Wilson, I don't think
I'm gonna make it, man.

116
00:07:08,452 --> 00:07:09,849
Can you call my wife?

117
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,394
- Tell her I love her!
- I don't see it.

118
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:16,398
I can't see it.
I can't see it in your face.

119
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:18,483
You've got to show me
that you love her.

120
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,943
- Give me what I need.
- I'm trying.

121
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:23,006
Try harder.
From the middle.

122
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,322
You got to call my wife for me.

123
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:29,892
- It's lunch time.
- Shut up!

124
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:32,580
You call my wife
and you tell her I love her.

125
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:34,916
Who taught you to act?

126
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:37,611
- Stop interrupting me.
- Make me stop then.

127
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:40,560
Make me believe that
what I'm seeing is real.

128
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,935
Make me believe I'm not watching
a fucking high school play.

129
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:46,427
- Cut me down.
- Oh no, you stay there.

130
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:48,875
You finish this scene, god damn it.

131
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:50,640
- Cut me down.
- Jesus christ!

132
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:52,707
Coming down.
Should I call lunch?

133
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:54,390
All right.

134
00:07:57,181 --> 00:08:00,632
You push me all you want, but I don't
appreciate you insulting me personally.

135
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:03,069
I don't appreciate you taking
3 hours to get a simple scene.

136
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,278
Maybe if you knew
what you wanted it would be simple.

137
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:07,473
I know what I want.
I do know what I want.

138
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:10,905
I just did 50 takes and you seem to keep
asking me to do something different.

139
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,612
I just need something that works.

140
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:14,647
- They all work.
- No they don't.

141
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:17,959
I don't have one usable take.
Not one.

142
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,752
Just tell me what you want exactly

143
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:22,044
- and I will give it to you.
- We're in penalty.

144
00:08:22,164 --> 00:08:24,200
I wish it were that simple,
but it's not.

145
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,699
You can't give me what I want
because you're not capable of it.

146
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,808
Maybe you shouldn't have
done this movie with me.

147
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:31,702
I tried not to.
But your little friend at the studio

148
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:34,777
jammed you down
my goddamn fucking throat.

149
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:37,617
- You were never right for this role.
- Come on. That's bullshit.

150
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:40,287
You just refuse to believe it
because you wanted someone else.

151
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:42,566
This is ridiculous.
This is not gonna work, not ever.

152
00:08:42,686 --> 00:08:46,154
You know what? You're the dictator,
so you figure out a way to make it work.

153
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,439
You're right, Vincent.

154
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:51,528
You're fired.

155
00:08:55,274 --> 00:08:57,030
Now you can call lunch.

156
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:05,195
There he is.

157
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,063
Welcome home, Andrew.

158
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:08,587
Feels good, Ari.

159
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:10,636
Should we hit a titty bar
to celebrate?

160
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,796
Talk to your newest boss
Mr. Andrew Klein.

161
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,809
In fact, everyone listen up.

162
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:19,124
This is Andrew Klein.
Today and every day, consider him me

163
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:22,398
and me the me dealing with
more important stuff than you.

164
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,150
Why are you standing there like 
you just swallowed a dildo anally?

165
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,524
- I told you he was me.
- I'm sorry. He told me to say it.

166
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:30,475
- And his timing was impeccable.
- What's up?

167
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:32,283
- E called.
- Tell him I'll call back.

168
00:09:32,443 --> 00:09:34,619
- It's about Vince.
- It's about Vince too.

169
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:35,814
So talk.

170
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,434
My girlfriend works
for Josh Hartnett's agent.

171
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:41,664
She said they just called offering him
Vince's role in <i>Smokejumpers</i>.

172
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,262
- What?
- E said it was urgent.

173
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:46,855
Jesus christ,
get him on the phone.

174
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:48,257
Now!

175
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,614
- Verner fired him.
- Why?

176
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:57,126
- The prick says I can't act.
- Jesus christ.

177
00:09:57,246 --> 00:10:00,014
Look, he never wanted him in the movie
from the start. It was pure sabotage.

178
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,396
- <i>I'm coming up there</i>.
- Why? We're packing to leave.

179
00:10:02,556 --> 00:10:04,557
Well, don't.
It's not over yet.

180
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:07,056
- He wants us to wait.
- Wait?

181
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:09,670
Wait for what?
I just got humiliated.

182
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,524
You're gonna come
beg for my job back?

183
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,573
I don't beg.

184
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,122
I don't need this that bad.

185
00:10:14,242 --> 00:10:16,544
Yes you do, Vince.
Now please, just wait.

186
00:10:16,664 --> 00:10:18,447
Fine, but you'd better hurry.

187
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:21,438
Get Jerry Bruckheimer
on the phone

188
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:23,742
and tell him I need
to get to Big Bear fast.

189
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:26,827
And beg him
to let me borrow his ride.

190
00:10:26,947 --> 00:10:29,363
- Everything all right?
- No, but it will be.

191
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,593
You really found
an out-of-the-way spot, huh?

192
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:38,386
- I like it here.
- Oh yeah?

193
00:10:39,227 --> 00:10:40,983
I lived in New Orleans
for a little while

194
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:43,187
and this is the best
jambalaya in California.

195
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:45,405
Still out of the way though.

196
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,223
What's the problem, Turtle?

197
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:50,194
No problem. Hey, you want
to hide me, consider me hidden.

198
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,281
I eat here all the time.

199
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:54,604
Really?

200
00:10:54,724 --> 00:10:57,662
- Hi, Jamie baby. How you doing?
- I'm good, Val. How are you?

201
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,036
Really.

202
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,420
Listen, I just want to apologize again
for opening my big mouth.

203
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,127
Let's not bring it up.

204
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:09,863
- I really only told my boys.
- Yeah, but your boys told everyone.

205
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:11,777
And I have a crazy ex-boyfriend,

206
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:14,587
and when he found out,
let's just say it was not good.

207
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:16,916
If you got a problem
with some guy...

208
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:18,514
He's on the chargers.

209
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,562
- Is he the kicker?
- Nope.

210
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:24,770
- I'll keep it low.
- You promise this time?

211
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:26,397
I pinkie swear.

212
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:31,980
Why'd you call last night?

213
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:34,280
My therapist says
I'm attracted to losers.

214
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:36,978
- Lucky me.
- I thought you were cute.

215
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:39,295
So you like me?

216
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:41,469
I liked you on that plane.

217
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,542
So do you like jambalaya?

218
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:48,926
You know, I've never had it,
but if you say it's good I'll try it.

219
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:50,813
You always this easy?

220
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:53,081
Yeah, I've been told
I lift the spirits

221
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,279
of everyone around me
since I was yea big.

222
00:11:56,648 --> 00:11:57,733
That's nice.

223
00:11:57,965 --> 00:12:01,349
So your therapist really said
you were attracted to losers?

224
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:03,142
Yeah, but she's a quack.

225
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,087
Hi. A jambalaya and an étouffée.

226
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:07,772
We'll just split 'em both.

227
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:28,812
Vinnie Chase. Where the fuck
do I find Vinnie Chase?

228
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:37,716
What a way to make an entrance.

229
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:40,339
It's nothing compared to what
I'm gonna do to this kraut director.

230
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,045
It's either you or me.
And if I go in, I'm going in blazing.

231
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:45,557
- Settle down. Where's Vinnie?
- Right in there.

232
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,377
How you doing, buddy?

233
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:55,511
Want to get the fuck out of here
is how I'm doing.

234
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:56,996
Take a deep breath and relax.

235
00:12:57,116 --> 00:12:58,692
- It's all gonna be fine.
- How?

236
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,447
Because a jew has arrived
and he doesn't like germans.

237
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,161
Now where do I find him?

238
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,771
Der kommissar
is leaving his bunker now.

239
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:07,037
Hang tight.

240
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:09,379
Go get him.

241
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:13,379
Verner Vollstedt,
do you have a minute?

242
00:13:13,783 --> 00:13:15,576
- Who's asking?
- Ari Gold.

243
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:18,558
Oh, the super-duper agent.

244
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:22,680
I'm afraid your client already
has used all my spare minutes.

245
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,221
Well, I'll be brief.

246
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:27,518
Tell Mr. Norton we'll shoot
in less than five minutes.

247
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:31,600
I hear we have a problem.

248
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,539
No, we don't have a problem.
I have a problem

249
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:36,694
because your client will not
perform the services I request.

250
00:13:36,854 --> 00:13:39,311
My client has performed just fine
in every movie he's ever done

251
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:41,076
including a blockbuster

252
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:44,100
for an Oscar-winning
American director.

253
00:13:44,515 --> 00:13:47,598
This is a film
about human beings with layers.

254
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:50,093
It's not about
some swimming superhero.

255
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:52,605
I don't care if it's a movie
about a dancing cucumber.

256
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:53,735
He will deliver

257
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:56,497
and I need for you to get back out there
and help him to do that.

258
00:13:56,617 --> 00:13:57,965
I think that's impossible

259
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,438
unless the ghost
of sir Laurence Olivier

260
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:03,120
were miraculously
to inhabit his body.

261
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:05,624
Your client is soulless.

262
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,469
You don't have
the authority to fire him.

263
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,054
The studio will not let you.

264
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:11,223
Have you even let them
know that your movie

265
00:14:11,343 --> 00:14:13,040
is in complete disarray?

266
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,900
I have three days to shoot
Mr. Norton in the woods.

267
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,183
And by the time the crew
comes to save his character

268
00:14:19,303 --> 00:14:20,915
the role that Vincent couldn't play

269
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:24,314
will be taken by someone
the studio will be very happy with.

270
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:25,608
Josh hartnett?

271
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:27,470
Yeah, I know all.

272
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,662
When you took this movie,
Vinnie Chase was attached,

273
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:32,303
- and that's how you will finish it.
- Are you threatening me?

274
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:34,444
If you consider me telling you
that you'll be lucky

275
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:36,739
to get a der wienerschnitzel
commercial in this country

276
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:39,469
if you don't go back to work,
then yeah, it's a fucking threat.

277
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,134
I don't respond to threats.

278
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,074
This conversation is over.

279
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:49,164
Nothing is over.
When I'm done with you

280
00:14:49,284 --> 00:14:52,934
it'll make the battle of Normandy
look like a game of fucking paintball.

281
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:00,694
Hold on.
Hello?

282
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:02,671
I have Ari Gold for you,
Miss Gordon.

283
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,391
Oh yes, put his through.

284
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:07,466
Dana, how's my favorite
studio head who I made?

285
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:10,160
Great. You know, two days
at our theme park in Sydney

286
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,623
is quite a stress reliever.

287
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:13,742
Imagine three children
just got tossed off

288
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:15,876
the roller coaster and tense up.

289
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,715
- What do you mean?
- What I mean is your director

290
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:22,258
has fucking collapsed

291
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:25,386
- <i>like a house of cards.</i>
- Tell me what the fuck is happening?

292
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,060
He doesn't know what he's doing.
He doesn't know what he wants.

293
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,621
We need to get him off this thing
and find someone that does.

294
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:32,584
I am on a plane with John Ellis.

295
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:34,750
I will be on the ground
in L.A. in 90 minutes.

296
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,945
In 90 minutes you could be
back blowing hack writers

297
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:40,958
just to get them to meet you
to have a cup of coffee.

298
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:42,194
Wake the fuck up!

299
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:43,663
I'm calling the set.

300
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:45,864
Be by your phone
for when I call you back.

301
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:53,546
- What did he say?
- Nothing worth interpreting.

302
00:15:54,732 --> 00:15:56,304
All right,
I'm gonna call Shauna.

303
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:58,731
Have her release a statement
that Vince walked off the movie.

304
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:00,325
Hold off.
No press, all right?

305
00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:03,094
Dana gordon is on this.
All will be well.

306
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:08,304
Unless Edward Norton just blew up.

307
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:14,268
It's really sweet of you to do this for
your friend. That's such a sad story.

308
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:18,710
He'll bounce back.
In about 15 to 20 years probably.

309
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,840
Oh, damn.

310
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:26,432
- He's got a big head.
- That looks good on you.

311
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,990
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

312
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,951
So are most of your friends
from growing up

313
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:33,304
big successes like Vince
or more like Dom?

314
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:36,582
I got a few Doms.
There's only one Vince.

315
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:38,689
He's like a hero where I'm from.

316
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:41,545
People are gonna freak out when
they see him bounce back like this.

317
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:43,502
And what's your plan?

318
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:45,282
My plan for what?

319
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:47,051
For life.
Do you have one?

320
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,557
It might not look it,

321
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:51,300
but I'm plotting a few things.

322
00:16:51,788 --> 00:16:53,334
Oh yeah?
Like what?

323
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:59,214
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to put you on the spot like that.

324
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,982
No, it's okay.
It's just...

325
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:04,213
Things haven't exactly
panned out careerwise.

326
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:08,043
Why don't you take over
this limo business

327
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:09,677
and I will be the driver?

328
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:11,457
Hot girls driving limos--

329
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:13,952
I love that.
Call it lim-hos.

330
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:17,409
I don't know about the name.

331
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,585
I'm not sure about having
a business partner who's in jail either.

332
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:23,186
I'll find my niche.

333
00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:24,576
I believe it.

334
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,812
Or maybe you really are
just attracted to losers.

335
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:30,398
Or maybe I see potential.

336
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,707
James Cameron
is finishing up <i>Avatar</i>.

337
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:37,976
Ridley Scott just left for england.
Ron Howard is doing <i>Angels and Demons</i>.

338
00:17:38,136 --> 00:17:41,438
Half the town is out of work. You
can't find me one available director?

339
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:43,064
Kevin Smith isn't doing anything.

340
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:45,539
Are you looking at the DGA list
or are staring out the window

341
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:48,153
at the line in front of the sprinkles
fucking cupcakes store.

342
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:50,618
- You sound so stressed.
- Shut the fuck up.

343
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,730
This gets more humiliating
by the second.

344
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,090
Did Pete Berg call back?

345
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,443
No, but his assistant
assured me he got the message.

346
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:58,429
You get him.
You get me?

347
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:01,333
You want me to call
Barbet Schroeder?

348
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,480
I did three days as an extra
on <i>Barfly</i>.

349
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,870
- How fucking old are you?
- What are we doing?

350
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,285
I'm not getting rehired.
You're not finding a director.

351
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:10,139
It's over.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

352
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:12,236
At what point
do we take back our self-respect?

353
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:14,722
We take it back when I say.
Dana Gordon owes me.

354
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:16,897
You think she's gonna
let you replace the director?

355
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:20,162
After what I did for her, she would let
us double penetrate her if I asked her.

356
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:22,605
Listen, I'm sorry.
Okay, listen.

357
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:24,699
We promised this year
we were gonna listen to me.

358
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:27,693
Now we got to stay put until
Dana Gordon tells us what's what.

359
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:30,520
That's her right now.
Just chill.

360
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:34,640
- Give me something good.
- I have nothing good.

361
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,578
That German cocksucker
reamed me out for 45 minutes.

362
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:39,450
Ream him back.

363
00:18:40,324 --> 00:18:42,603
If John Ellis finds out about this
I'm fucked.

364
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:45,586
You are the president
of the studio.

365
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:47,833
Doing my first $100 million movie.

366
00:18:47,953 --> 00:18:50,759
Remember,
Verner works for you, okay?

367
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,931
He's a high-paid employee,

368
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:55,627
but like any employee
he can be replaced.

369
00:18:55,747 --> 00:18:57,395
Nobody is replacing
anybody, all right?

370
00:18:57,515 --> 00:18:59,241
- I told Verner that.
- What did he say?

371
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:01,179
He said he wants
to discuss it face to face

372
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:03,762
to give me his side of the story.
He's on his way here now.

373
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:04,969
So am I.

374
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:06,975
- You don't need to come.
- I do need to come.

375
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:09,943
And I'm gonna bring Vinnie
and he's gonna tell you the truth.

376
00:19:10,308 --> 00:19:12,488
All right, everybody.
We're moving out.

377
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,350
- Where to?
- The studio.

378
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,620
- Quickly.
- This is ridiculous.

379
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:26,502
I was the one in the crew who made
all the money back in high school.

380
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:28,801
In fact, if is wasn't for me,

381
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:30,814
Vince wouldn't
have been able to come out west.

382
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:31,958
Really?

383
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:33,738
Well, Drama put us up,

384
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:36,446
but it was my 15 gs
that covered all the expenses.

385
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,824
You know, the flights,
the food, whatever,

386
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:41,654
how'd you make all that money
in high school?

387
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:44,142
It's not like I sold drugs.

388
00:19:44,888 --> 00:19:46,146
I was a bookie.

389
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,013
Very entrepreneurial.

390
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,192
Not something
I want to carry over as an adult.

391
00:19:50,352 --> 00:19:52,110
I think that was a good move.

392
00:19:52,696 --> 00:19:54,691
I always wanted
to open a restaurant.

393
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,241
You know, good food,
maybe some delivery.

394
00:19:57,401 --> 00:19:59,034
- Call it "Turtle's."
- Cute.

395
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:01,911
But doesn't exactly
imply speedy service.

396
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:04,642
How about Kenny's?

397
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:06,622
- Your name is Kenny?
- No.

398
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:09,413
You're one of those guys.

399
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:12,557
You don't even ask what your real
name is 'cause you'll never tell.

400
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:15,519
I haven't been called by my real name
since I was five years old.

401
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:17,361
Even my mother calls me Turtle.

402
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:19,166
Then I won't ask.

403
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,485
It's Sal.

404
00:20:28,332 --> 00:20:29,344
Sal?

405
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:32,837
I like that.

406
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:37,352
How'd you like to spend
the weekend in La Jolla with me, sal?

407
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,712
Really?

408
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,611
Really.

409
00:20:48,772 --> 00:20:50,333
They can't do
their best work.

410
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:52,675
I don't understand
why they are here.

411
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:56,403
Because it's a free country
and not Germany circa 1939.

412
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:57,622
Ari, please.

413
00:20:57,742 --> 00:21:00,387
Listen, I should be on the set.
On my set working.

414
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:02,516
I shouldn't be here wasting time

415
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,142
explaining why this is
not a workable situation.

416
00:21:05,302 --> 00:21:08,385
Dana, this guy has had it out
for Vince since we started this movie.

417
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:10,347
- Who's this man?
- Okay, look,

418
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:11,732
this is silly.

419
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:14,399
We are a week into a production
that is already

420
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,399
over budget by $2 million.

421
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:19,640
I'm over budget because I'm saddled
with an actor that can't do the job.

422
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,945
But listen, I got calls into Leo.

423
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:24,370
He and I worked together
on a commercial in Austria.

424
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,520
He's in Boston right now
shooting <i>Shutter Island</i>.

425
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,983
- I got calls into other actors as well.
- Like who?

426
00:21:29,103 --> 00:21:30,971
- Like Joaquin Phoenix.
- Booked.

427
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:32,543
- Christian Bale
- Booked.

428
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,994
I'll take fucking
Ashton Kutcher over this guy.

429
00:21:36,114 --> 00:21:38,099
That's enough.
Dana, what are you gonna do?

430
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:40,794
Because I'm not gonna sit here
and let this guy insult Vince anymore.

431
00:21:40,914 --> 00:21:43,597
- Thank you.
- And I'm his manager, you jerkoff.

432
00:21:43,717 --> 00:21:47,032
How many people does it take
to handle one talentless actor?

433
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:50,479
Look, I think I was doing a great job.
At least I was killing myself trying to.

434
00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:53,899
But I'm not willing to take this shit.
So you tell me what you want to do.

435
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:55,334
I know what I want to do.

436
00:21:55,454 --> 00:21:58,153
I want you guys to get back
on the set and finish this movie.

437
00:21:58,505 --> 00:21:59,738
Would be happy to.

438
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:10,129
I got a call right now
from Pete Berg.

439
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:11,922
Directed a little movie
called <i>Hancock</i>.

440
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:14,628
Made about $1 billion.
He was my college roommate.

441
00:22:14,748 --> 00:22:16,672
- What's this crap?
- It's the end of the line.

442
00:22:17,174 --> 00:22:18,418
Pete, how are you, buddy?

443
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:20,674
My man.

444
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:22,567
- What's up, man?
- You get my message?

445
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:25,311
I talked to your guy
and I told him I cannot do it.

446
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:28,534
I promised Joy we're going on vacation.
We're going on vacation right now.

447
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:30,930
That's fantastic.

448
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,677
No no, I don't think you heard
me. I said I cannot do it.

449
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:35,547
- We're going on vacation.
- Give me it.

450
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,734
- I said no.
- I love it.

451
00:22:37,894 --> 00:22:40,237
- I'm getting on the airplane.
- He's not interested.

452
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:42,967
- Love you, Ari.
- We'll talk soon. I love you too.

453
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:45,050
All right,
he had already read the script.

454
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,867
He loves it.
Sign off on him.

455
00:22:46,987 --> 00:22:49,621
Tell the kraut to grab his passport
and get the fuck out.

456
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:51,707
I'm not going to take
anymore of this shit now.

457
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:54,941
Oh yes, you fucking are.
Get your ass back here.

458
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,408
I hired you
and you have a movie to finish

459
00:22:57,528 --> 00:22:59,396
that you're getting paid
a lot of money to do

460
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:01,762
and that is exactly
what is going to fucking happen.

461
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:04,219
- Do you understand me?
- I do.

462
00:23:04,726 --> 00:23:06,227
Anyone else turned on right now?

463
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:08,585
- I want to talk to John Ellis.
- You can't.

464
00:23:09,297 --> 00:23:10,851
God damn it.
I can.

465
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:12,782
John Ellis!

466
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:18,941
- Where's John Ellis?
- Conference room.

467
00:23:19,246 --> 00:23:21,780
- What the hell's going on?
- He's running for the chairman.

468
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,330
Want me to stop him?

469
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,345
- You cannot go in there.
- John ellis!

470
00:23:29,392 --> 00:23:30,782
This guy's insane.

471
00:23:35,942 --> 00:23:37,268
What are you doing?

472
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:42,492
Verner Vollstedt.
I need a word.

473
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:44,602
What the hell is going on?

474
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:49,954
You should have
let me take him down.

475
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:51,905
I don't think
it would have helped much.

476
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:53,281
It wouldn't have hurt.

477
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:55,816
I could have shredded
his acl in a flash.

478
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:58,776
How does Ellis make a decision like that
based on three days of footage?

479
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,776
It's his studio.
He can do whatever he wants.

480
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:02,944
- What if he doesn't like what I did?
- He'll like.

481
00:24:03,104 --> 00:24:05,967
- You like what he did, right?
- I was banned from the set mostly.

482
00:24:06,087 --> 00:24:07,285
He'll like what you did.

483
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,201
Word to the mother, bitch.

484
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:12,788
Yeah, keep sucking down
that tar, Vermin.

485
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,367
Really?
Jesus, John.

486
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,869
What's your decision?

487
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:29,471
- What did he say?
- He said, and I quote,

488
00:24:30,064 --> 00:24:33,284
"This is why I hire women
to blow me, not run my studio."

489
00:24:33,404 --> 00:24:35,560
- Meaning what?
- Meaning he's shutting down the movie

490
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,429
and I might have to blow
him to keep my job.

491
00:24:39,046 --> 00:24:40,273
I can't believe this.

492
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:43,168
It's over budget,
overly complicated.

493
00:24:43,946 --> 00:24:45,532
- It's over.
- This is unbelievable.

494
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,251
If it's any consolation,

495
00:24:47,508 --> 00:24:50,105
he thought you were great
in what he saw and so did I.

496
00:24:50,495 --> 00:24:51,519
Sorry, guys.

497
00:24:56,157 --> 00:24:59,029
- Vin, I don't know what to say.
- There's nothing to say.

498
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,163
No one could have seen this coming.

499
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:04,337
So what now?

500
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:09,225
Let's go home.

501
00:25:20,037 --> 00:25:21,422
Why are you making fun of me?

502
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:23,767
I just thought we were going
to spend the weekend in bed,

503
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:25,511
and you want to pet shamu.

504
00:25:25,631 --> 00:25:27,237
I am not trying to avoid the sex.

505
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,532
I have been here for 12 years
and I have not been to Sea World.

506
00:25:31,205 --> 00:25:33,423
Fine, Sea World from 10:00 to 1:00

507
00:25:33,643 --> 00:25:35,245
- then back to bed.
- Thank you.

508
00:25:39,223 --> 00:25:40,979
Oh, shit.
It's Vince.

509
00:25:41,564 --> 00:25:42,589
I'm not here.

510
00:25:44,552 --> 00:25:46,113
Yo, buddy, what's up?

511
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:50,275
Oh, man.

512
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:58,129
Of course I'll be there.

513
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,535
We're gonna need to buckle up
before we take off, sir.

514
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,388
Yeah, and we're gonna
need some scotch

515
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:17,791
after we take off.
And plenty of it, sister.

516
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:20,611
Is that Vincent Chase in 13b?

517
00:26:20,731 --> 00:26:21,806
In coach?

518
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:26,135
Excuse me.
Sorry, guys.

519
00:26:27,624 --> 00:26:29,306
Sorry I'm late, guys.

520
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:32,709
- We've you been, Turtle?
- Nowhere.

521
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:35,050
Just running some errands.
How you doing, Vin?

522
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:38,040
Hey, we always said if we had
nothing we'd go back to Queens.

523
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,216
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- It always is.

524
00:26:45,057 --> 00:26:46,213
Seriously, Turtle.

525
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,238
What's the big mystery?
Where've you been?

526
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,804
No mystery.
Just had some stuff to do.

527
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:53,323
- What stuff?
- Don't worry about it.

528
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:55,451
You okay?

529
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:57,563
Been better.
