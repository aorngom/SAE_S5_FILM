1
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,633
How you doing?

2
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,836
Hey, how you doing?
Hey, honey, how are you?

3
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,242
If I was you, I'd save some energy
for the mansion, bro.

4
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,611
I got plenty of energy
in my reserve tanks, Drama,

5
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,980
- don't you worry.
- Turtle, you don't want to wind up

6
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,417
with a girlfriend
one day before the lingerie party.

7
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,478
Good point.
I ain't talking to none of youse.

8
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,250
I don't know what you guys
are making a big deal about.

9
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,485
I've been to the Mansion,
it's not that great.

10
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,823
You were at an afternoon
fundraiser for Alzheimer's.

11
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,421
I don't think that's what Mr. Hefner
had in mind when he opened the joint.

12
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,159
I'm sure he was dreaming
about your fat ass

13
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,032
- running around the place in pajamas.
- Easy easy.

14
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,626
Yeah, I remember back
in the day...

15
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,036
me, Kadeem Hardison
and C.T. Howell

16
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,870
used to sit at Hef's table
surrounded by Playmates.

17
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,069
Now they won't even
let me in the joint.

18
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,170
You sat at
Hugh Hefner's table?

19
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,443
Yeah, during
the "Melrose" years.

20
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,474
Don't you mean
the "Melrose" months, Drama?

21
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,383
Not if you count reruns,
dickhead.

22
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,480
Oh, don't worry, Johnny. E will have you
doing laps in The Grotto.

23
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,287
- Right, E?
- Yeah, Shauna's calling Hef's people

24
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,294
to see what Drama's
drama is this time.

25
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:11,320
- I didn't do anything.
- So, these are for the Mansion, Vince?

26
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,527
Yeah. Mom's out of town,
I got the kids tonight.

27
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,535
Okay, well then
you don't want to wear those,

28
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,934
because George Clooney's
guy came in

29
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,030
and bought the exact
same pair this morning.

30
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,371
It'd be like wearing
the same gown to the Oscars.

31
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,673
- Yeah. Nobody has these.
- Ooh.

32
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,772
I will make sure that we don't sell
any more for the rest of the day.

33
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,249
- Fancy. Thanks, Jenny.
- No problem.

34
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,081
Don't work too hard,
huh?

35
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,280
Vince, can you advance me
six weeks salary?

36
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,653
You know the system,
Turtle. Ask E.

37
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,421
E, can I please advance
six weeks salary?

38
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,019
What do you need $1,200 for?

39
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,155
For these cashmere PJs,
baby!

40
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,859
Turtle,
mine only cost $400.

41
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,061
You can go to the Mansion
in Underoos and get laid.

42
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,866
You could go wrapped
in bearer bonds and not get laid.

43
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,373
- Put the pajamas back.
- I'm coming back for these.

44
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,932
Feel how soft.
Feel.

45
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,410
Bearer bonds.

46
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,345
Lemon water
and lettuce, Drama?

47
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,871
You disgust me.

48
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,441
It's all part of my
two-day pre-Mansion regimen.

49
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,316
I got to look lean
for the ladies.

50
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,752
Why don't you sleep
in Saran Wrap

51
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,187
like you did on
the wrestling team?

52
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,884
I sucked weight
in that sauna suit.

53
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,053
If you behave yourself, Turtle,
I might just put you on my program.

54
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,686
Did Playboy
even call back?

55
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,323
I'm waiting. God knows what you did
to piss off Hef, Drama.

56
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,731
- I didn't do anything.
- Wait. Can we talk about the house?

57
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,669
- Let's talk about it, Marvin.
- There's nothing to talk about!

58
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,194
You guys
got to get out.

59
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,470
The studio paid for five months
and you've been there for a year.

60
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,977
We should rent a place
with an outdoor pool anyway.

61
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,502
- Maybe I should buy a place.
- That's a good idea.

62
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,914
I could be the first Chase
to own his own home.

63
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,112
Sorry, bro.
I beat you to that.

64
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,552
Johnny, I've been doing
your taxes since 1989.

65
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,059
You never owned a home.
What are you talking about?

66
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,722
Condo? Triplex?
On Robertson?

67
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,357
South Robertson?
You lived next to the 10 freeway, Drama.

68
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,731
That place.
You only had it for six months,

69
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,395
and then they
foreclosed on it.

70
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,268
That don't count.

71
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,432
Technically,
it still makes me first.

72
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,374
Technically,
you're a fucking moron.

73
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,707
- What's our price range?
- What's on the burner?

74
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,906
We're meeting with Warner's
to discuss "Aquaman."

75
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,245
- That's what I wanna hear.
- "Aquaman."

76
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,409
You'd make a sexy superhero.

77
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,941
I'm going to hear what
they have to say.

78
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,546
- Vince is gonna consider doing this.
- Oh, I am?

79
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,556
Remember, sweetie...
one for them, one for you.

80
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,854
"Queens Boulevard"
was definitely one for you.

81
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,019
Okay, assuming I do
another one for me,

82
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,995
how much can we spend
on a house?

83
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,261
A million,
a million-two tops.

84
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,928
I'll call Susan Roberts.
She's the best broker in town.

85
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,061
$1 million, guys.

86
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,971
We were sharing a two-bedroom
on Seward a year and a half ago.

87
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,100
- Not bad!
- Not bad?

88
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:39,339
My mom just sold
her house for $160,000

89
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,244
and we had a skylight.

90
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,346
This is it?

91
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,480
Maybe this is
the guesthouse,

92
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,114
and the real house
is around back?

93
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,425
Craftsman's are very hot
right now, Vince.

94
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,197
I just sold one to that actor
from "Smallville."

95
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,296
Where's Smallville?

96
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,649
No way. Not again.

97
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,418
A million bucks sure ain't
what it used to be.

98
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,655
You're not kidding.

99
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,687
You can't be living
in a dump like this.

100
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,564
- It's bad for your self-esteem.
- They don't even have a pool.

101
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,227
You used to work
at a mortuary, Turtle.

102
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,896
Why don't you grab a shovel
and start digging?

103
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,370
What, E,
you think we should take it?

104
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,838
No, definitely not.

105
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,364
I know it's a bit
of a fixer-upper,

106
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,434
but you are getting in
at a great price

107
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,105
in an up-and-coming
neighborhood.

108
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,046
You know to tell you
the truth, Susan,

109
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,606
it's not exactly
what we had in mind.

110
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,174
What did you have in mind?

111
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,812
Have you ever seen
"Cribs"?

112
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:59,917
I have a Spanish estate
up Outpost.

113
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,984
It was Marlon Brando's
old place.

114
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,360
- Ooh.
- I like Brando.

115
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,957
It's in a slightly
higher price range, though.

116
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,832
- How slight?
- Don't worry about it. It's Brando's.

117
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,131
I'll set it up.

118
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,438
Hey, Shauna.

119
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,739
I just got off the phone
with the Playboy people.

120
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,041
- Drama straightened out?
- He's straightened out all right.

121
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,047
He's banned for life.
There's a better chance

122
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,641
- you'll see the Pope in pajamas.
- Why, what'd he do?

123
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,016
The moron went to Hef's zoo,
set all the chimps free.

124
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,146
- Unbelievable.
- One of the monkeys

125
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,849
went Siegfried & Roy
on Miss August,

126
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,882
and they said she's lost out on becoming
the Saturn national spokesperson

127
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,587
because of the damage
to her face.

128
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,096
Okay, look,
I got to go.

129
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,598
What's next?

130
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,192
Got to get the Godiva chocolates
for Star Jones.

131
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,635
Better make room
in the fucking trunk.

132
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,036
This is bullshit.
It was Macchio.

133
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,234
- "The Karate Kid" freed the monkeys?
- I'm not kidding.

134
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,573
I took him as
my "plus one."

135
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,238
We got wasted on Cuervo.

136
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,146
Next thing I know, he's standing
in the Miyagi crane position

137
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,911
kicking the cage wide open.

138
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,577
Well, Hef thinks
it was you.

139
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,484
- Yeah, I know.
- What are we gonna do about it?

140
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,388
- "We," Drama?
- Yeah, we.

141
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,358
You guys wouldn't go
to the Mansion without me.

142
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,527
- Right?
- Don't worry.

143
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,553
We'll bring you back
a Playmate doggie bag.

144
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,122
Come on, guys.
If Johnny doesn't go, none of us goes.

145
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,829
- Thanks, bro.
- In fact, Ari's got to handle this,

146
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,303
or we're headed for dollar shots
at Beefsteak Charlie's.

147
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:23,001
Fucking Drama! They don't have
a Beefsteak Charlie's out here.

148
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,441
Shut up, Turtle.

149
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,911
I guess I'll keep
my appointment for UVA Sun.

150
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,573
You got to come with me
to get my pajamas.

151
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,706
Sure.

152
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,909
Where you gonna get
the money from?

153
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,316
Don't worry about that.
I got a plan.

154
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,162
That's an assigned space,
Ari.

155
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,597
Fuck Peter Hill!
Never heard of him.

156
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,031
I hope they tow you.

157
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,796
They don't have the balls.
Trust me.

158
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,236
Ari, we got to call Hugh Hefner
to get Drama's ban

159
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,705
- lifted at the mansion.
- What am I, his pimp?

160
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,708
- Ari.
- For you, Vinny, anything.

161
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,801
All I ask in return
is that you say yes to "Aquaman."

162
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,904
He's here, Ari.
One step at a time.

163
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,973
Don't you mean
one stroke at a time?

164
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,653
I can't give you
a cash refund for this, Turtle.

165
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,656
It was a gift from
corporate to Vince.

166
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,180
Come on, Cathy,
hook me up.

167
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,853
I'll throw in an eighth
of the Hack's Crip weed you like.

168
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,759
That's a very
generous offer, Turtle,

169
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,559
but I'm a friend
of Bill W's now.

170
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,395
And he's got better weed
than the Hack?

171
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,800
"Bill W"'s code.
It means she's in recovery.

172
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,531
Who needs
to recover from weed?

173
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,335
Tell you what, Turtle,
I'll give you a store credit.

174
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,036
What the fuck
am I gonna do with that?

175
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,952
We want you
in the Warner family, Vince.

176
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,046
I'm all about family, John.

177
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,614
In fact, after seeing
your 200' yacht

178
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,990
in last month's "Robb Report,"
can I call you Dad?

179
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,689
- Vince?
- Yeah.

180
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,098
Do you know how long
Clint Eastwood's been with this studio?

181
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:58,126
- Huh-uh. No.
- 70 years.

182
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,298
We give him $90 million
to make movies now.

183
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,276
- Does whatever he wants.
- I heard he uses 60 and pockets 30.

184
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,040
That's why he only
does one take.

185
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:12,315
The point is we don't
micromanage our talent here.

186
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,615
No. They are
very talent-friendly.

187
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,715
Wow, you know, I mean,
this all sounds great.

188
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,319
And I'd love to make a movie
with you guys, definitely.

189
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,524
I don't really see myself
playing a superhero...

190
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,726
speaking underwater,
flying.

191
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:32,170
We're not talking about making
a comic book fluff movie here.

192
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,434
No, we want this to be
a darker, grittier film.

193
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,465
Remember this is the studio
that did "Batman," right?

194
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,205
Not "The Phantom."

195
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,076
Oh, what are
we talking about?

196
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,775
Burton's "Batman"
or Schumacher's?

197
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,282
Why don't you let us show you
what we're talking about?

198
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,585
Sure.

199
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,785
Dana, let's
bring in the suit.

200
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,894
Bring in the suit.

201
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,378
- Huh huh?
- Yeah. Isn't that something?

202
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,780
Isn't that something?

203
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:22,151
No way I'm gonna be up on a 70' screen
looking like an underwater Elton John.

204
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,952
Vinny, the suit will not
look like that on film.

205
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,754
Tom Cruise
is, like, 5'4",

206
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,487
on screen he looks
like Yao Ming.

207
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,358
- It's just a prototype, Vince.
- Yeah!

208
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,194
Ari, it's over.

209
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,757
Do not mention this
movie to me again.

210
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,736
All right, now find me
something else I can do.

211
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,238
I'll deal with this.

212
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,472
How you doing, sweetheart?
I got a MAC store credit.

213
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,344
- No.
- $2000 for $1200!

214
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,509
Better hurry this shit up,
Turtle.

215
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,484
We're gonna be late
for our mannies and peddies.

216
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,352
All right, hold on.
I got a MAC store credit here.

217
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,687
$2,000 for $1,200!

218
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,214
Or if you have
a major credit card,

219
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,591
you can come with me
to Barney's and buy me my pajamas!

220
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,529
All right, the suit sucks,
but the script is good.

221
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,192
I'm telling you, Vince,
this movie is gonna be a big hit,

222
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,099
and then you can do
whatever you want.

223
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,230
Ooh, it's weird how you're
starting to sound like Ari.

224
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,537
No, it's weird how you always
want me to agree with you.

225
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,009
Ha!
Cashmere PJs paid in full

226
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,016
no thanks to your ass!

227
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,382
Uh-oh,
something's wrong.

228
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,649
Is this
"Aquaman"-related

229
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,849
or am I not going
to the Mansion?

230
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,517
No, Ari is taking care
of the Mansion,

231
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,685
we're not talking about
"Aquaman" anymore.

232
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,025
They showed Vince the suit
and he hated it.

233
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,031
That's 'cause Vince
ain't a costume guy.

234
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,295
On Halloween this guy goes
dressed as himself.

235
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,561
Thank you, Turtle!

236
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,195
You see, he knows me.

237
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,068
Maybe I should let him
be my manager.

238
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,664
- Pfft.
- Charge you 5%.

239
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,800
This guy's ripping you off.

240
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,037
You know, Vince,
wearing a costume

241
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,705
can be very liberating
as an actor.

242
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,613
You remember how much
I enjoyed being a Power Ranger.

243
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,640
You were a Power Ranger
on City Walk.

244
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,881
You were trying to get people
to change their long-distance plan.

245
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,980
- So? It's still liberating.
- Look, Johnny,

246
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,958
I don't wanna wear the Aquaman suit,
or any other suit.

247
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:10,393
I don't want to play anyone
who doesn't wear a T-shirt.

248
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,162
- Hey.
- Is that Ari? Is that Ari?

249
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,100
Hey.
Hold on a second.

250
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,966
- Okay.
- Ask him about the Mansion.

251
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,630
Tomorrow morning?
See you then.

252
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,503
- Yo... yo.
- Relax. It's the realtor.

253
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,407
We're going to look at Brando's house
first thing in the morning.

254
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:25,842
- Ha, Brando.
- Brando.

255
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,419
Now that's a house
worth living in.

256
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,122
This is one
of Marlon's first homes.

257
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,859
He sold it
to Johnny Depp in '95.

258
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,095
Johnny was living here
when he was making "Ed Wood."

259
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,967
Ah, great movie.

260
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,063
Johnny Depp's got
the kind of career I want.

261
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,165
Johnny Depp did
"Pirates of the Caribbean."

262
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,039
If I'm not mistaken, he wore
a swashbuckler costume

263
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,601
and carried a sword.

264
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,636
I heard he dresses
like that in real life.

265
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,671
Nice!

266
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,207
And by the way,
wasn't Marlon Brando in "Superman"?

267
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,278
Yeah, he played
the father... no tights.

268
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:13,155
And by the way,
you're starting to annoy me.

269
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,820
On a clear day,
you can see Catalina.

270
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,659
This is where you
should be living, Vince.

271
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,665
In a kingdom,
like a prince.

272
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,167
Don't you mean a kingdom
like a king, you idiot?

273
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,693
Nah, E,
everyone wants to kill the king.

274
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,229
But the prince,
he just sails along

275
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,902
telling all the ladies,
"One day I'm gonna be king."

276
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,070
- Ah!
- Queens got it pretty good too.

277
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,342
Queen's got to fuck
the king, Drama.

278
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,145
Yeah, but she don't got
to do nothing else.

279
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,880
I love this place, Susan.
How much is it?

280
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,820
They're asking 4.3,

281
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,686
but the owner is
a real star-fucker.

282
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,658
If I tell her it's for you,
I'm sure she'll drop to four even.

283
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,287
Oh, that's great,
it's only four times our price range.

284
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,923
But it's at least
nine times nicer than that Craftsman.

285
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,762
So you'd still be coming
back out on top.

286
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,392
I love your
math skills, Turtle.

287
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,427
I'll take it. Call Marv,
have him start the paperwork.

288
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,632
Okay.

289
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,403
You can't afford
this house, Vince.

290
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,104
I can't afford anything we have.
Never stopped me before.

291
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,510
It's always worked out.

292
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,104
We don't have time
to house-hunt.

293
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,013
We got to get a job.

294
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,950
Ari.

295
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,145
What's up?

296
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,813
I just had
a tête-à-tête with Hef.

297
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,516
- How'd it go?
- The good news is

298
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,683
I just sold Playboy TV
to North Korea.

299
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,317
Kim Jong-II loves
"Night Calls."

300
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,988
Bad news is your boy Drama
will not be joining us.

301
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,465
Ari, you carry about as much weight
as Lara Flynn Boyle.

302
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,194
A lifetime ban
is a lifetime ban.

303
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,998
Who are we
without our integrity?

304
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,095
A little break
at the slipper.

305
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,538
That was Ari.

306
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,371
No go, Drama.
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,708
It's not the Mansion, but we can
always have chicken wings at Hooters?

308
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,139
Nah, this is
my problem.

309
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,652
I'll deal with it.

310
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,502
- Hey, buddy.
- Johnny Drama.

311
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,166
What the heck are
you doing here?

312
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,267
I want you to call up
Hugh Hefner

313
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,835
and tell him it was you
that freed the monkeys.

314
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,744
When were you
at the Playboy Mansion, Ralph?

315
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,750
Uh, that was over
10 years ago, honey.

316
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,020
My life is
different now, John.

317
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,715
I'm a daddy.

318
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,283
You know?

319
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,260
- You crazy, fucker?
- Just make the call.

320
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,388
I'm not into
that game anymore?

321
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,489
- I got a new series now.
- Really?

322
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,999
Well, you know,
it's a pilot.

323
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,002
I don't know shit about
any monkeys, Drama.

324
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,561
Bullshit. I remember you
screaming the P.E.T.A. Chant

325
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,072
- before you freed them.
- P.E.T. A?

326
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,403
You got the wrong guy,
asshole.

327
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,999
I bought my wife
a chinchilla coat.

328
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,534
- If it wasn't you, then who did it?
- How should I know?

329
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,102
We were drunk
off our asses.

330
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,082
Come on, Ralph.
You're married.

331
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,845
You got a family.
You got a life.

332
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,978
I got nothing
but the Mansion.

333
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,011
Can't you make
the phone call?

334
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,853
Drama, when it comes
to the Mansion,

335
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,256
it's every man
for himself.

336
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,123
But you said you're done
with all that.

337
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,857
I lied.
I'm going tonight.

338
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,127
I ought to kick your ass.

339
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,997
You wanna try?

340
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,601
I'll deal with you later.

341
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,629
See you tonight,
motherfucker!

342
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,074
I hope so, John.

343
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,976
Pound some Cuervo
like the old days, huh?

344
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,754
Turtle, you know you forgot to take
the price-tags off your pajamas?

345
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,818
I didn't forget.
I'm returning these Monday.

346
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,124
Guy's a genius.

347
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,655
What's the use of spending
$1,200 on PJs if nobody knows it?

348
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,260
You're all class, Turtle.

349
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,839
- Hey, Marvin.
- Eric, put Vince on the phone.

350
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,435
It's Marvin.
He wants to talk to you.

351
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,105
He's right here!

352
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,773
Ahh.

353
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,282
- Waw waw waw.
- Hey, Marvin!

354
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,844
When you asked me how much you could
spend on a house, what did I tell you?

355
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,287
- You were a little vague.
- "Vague"? Bullshit!

356
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,757
I told you you could
spend $1 million.

357
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,886
I'm spending less than that.
The bank is coming up with the rest.

358
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,657
You cannot afford
that house.

359
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,858
At best, you could last
for a couple of months.

360
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,062
Then what? You're gonna be
out on the street like your brother.

361
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:21,061
You don't have a younger brother
like you to mooch off.

362
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:24,303
Marv, I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

363
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,605
I'm up in the hills...

364
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,202
He's angry.

365
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,027
Where are
you going, Ari?

366
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,691
I have a meeting,
so...

367
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,757
At the Playboy Mansion?

368
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,966
You know, Playboy Mansion,
strip clubs, whorehouses...

369
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,305
I go where the meetings are.
It's my fucking job.

370
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,140
I want three weeks in the south
of France with the children.

371
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,079
Oh my God, baby!

372
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:05,242
- Of course you can go.
- With you.

373
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,081
And if you're not home
by 2:00 a.m.,

374
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,178
I'm gonna be standing
at the gate screaming,

375
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,883
"Ari Gold, super agent,
forgot his Viagra!"

376
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,051
Sounds good.

377
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,730
Can you pop
your trunk, please?

378
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,165
Trunk's broken, buddy.

379
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,469
Pop your trunk, please.

380
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,604
All right.

381
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,914
- Pat!
- Drama, you wanna get out of there?

382
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,890
Hey, we got another
stowaway, partner.

383
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,125
Pat, I've known you
for like 10 years.

384
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,789
Can't you guys
let me slide?

385
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,229
Not a shot in hell.

386
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,632
Bringing in stowaways
can get you banned for life.

387
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,068
It's not their fault.
They didn't know I was in the car.

388
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,163
Guys, it was my idea.

389
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,605
- I told him to.
- Don't listen to him.

390
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,303
He's my kid brother
and he's trying to take the blame.

391
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,971
Johnny.

392
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,775
Go on, go have fun.
Don't worry about me.

393
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,007
My night's done.

394
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,677
Can you call me a cab?

395
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,688
Try using your thumb
down on Sunset.

396
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,121
Patrick.

397
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,729
Would you look at all
the nice fake titties in this place?

398
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,330
I thought
you liked naturals.

399
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,204
I believe in a woman's
right to choose.

400
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,905
- Nice pajamas.
- It's formal nightwear, but thank you.

401
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,675
That's it,
this is proof.

402
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,011
God is definitely
a man.

403
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,016
Oh!

404
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,450
Excuse me, sweetheart.

405
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:23,716
- Ooh.
- Oh!

406
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,087
Good luck returning those.

407
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,857
Sorry.

408
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,253
Fuck!

409
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,893
Yeah!

410
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,302
Hey, get out of the street,
you faggot!

411
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,967
- Nice legs, fudge packer!
- Fuck you!

412
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,374
Right here, college boys!

413
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,207
What?!

414
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,773
Yo, Drama.

415
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,285
I detected a weakness
in Hef's security detail.

416
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,446
I'm not coming back.
I'm almost home already.

417
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,456
I took care of you
as always, all right?

418
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,618
Just come back to where it all began...
the monkey cages.

419
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,423
I know you don't
want to talk about it right now.

420
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,430
I had an amazing meeting
at Warner's.

421
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,092
Oh, Ari, please don't ruin
the Mansion.

422
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,192
You're gonna want
to hear this, believe me.

423
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,862
You know
what I want to hear?

424
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,269
I want to hear what
the lovely Hef girls have to say.

425
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,934
Look how rude you are,
with your back to these lovely ladies.

426
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,909
They're better
to look at than listen to.

427
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,741
Sorry.
What do you got for us?

428
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,610
What does
the middle "A" stand for, Ari?

429
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:23,945
Arrogant?

430
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,847
- Abrasive?
- Argumentative?

431
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,784
- Annoying?
- Asshole?

432
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,049
"Et tu, Vinny?
Et tu?"

433
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,261
You okay?

434
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,432
Good job, kid.

435
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,933
- Hey, did you see Macchio?
- No.

436
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,129
- Keep your eyes open.
- All right, come on.

437
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,003
Yeah, well, the thing is,
once the show hits syndication,

438
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,201
you got to like find
some tax deductions, you know.

439
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,436
Vince,
I'm telling you...

440
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,639
real estate?
Best investment ever.

441
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,170
See, if it's not acting,

442
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,772
we'll make our money
through real estate.

443
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,841
I should start commissioning
some of your capital gains

444
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,149
so I can start seeing
some income out of this relationship.

445
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,246
Oh, shit.
Miss April.

446
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,314
Guys, I got to hide.
I'll see you in a bit.

447
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,694
Guy's got three houses,
we don't have one?

448
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,218
He's a worker,
though, Vince.

449
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,493
The guy does a TV show,
a radio show, he's a D.J.

450
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,692
He does a million things.

451
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,896
You do "Aquaman," you got
five houses. Boom.

452
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,427
Don't you need to be home
to your wife, Ari?

453
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,303
No, I make
the goddamn rules.

454
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,070
I got till 2:00.

455
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,543
What are you saying?
You're pissing me off!

456
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,308
What are you getting
in my face about?

457
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,714
- Just be a man and admit it!
- Johnny!

458
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,411
- Admit you did it!
- I told you I didn't do it.

459
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,386
I already told you that,

460
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,785
you ex-evening soap star!

461
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,586
- I did an indie, asshole!
- Excuse me... Johnny!

462
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,388
Johnny Chase...
The Monkey Boy.

463
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,519
- Hef.
- Vince.

464
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,530
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

465
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,031
Johnny's my brother,

466
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,465
and he swears it wasn't him
that let the monkeys free.

467
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,366
Well, what's
the real story, John?

468
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,463
Well, Mr. Hefner,
I'm not one to rat,

469
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,531
but it was this guy
that sprung the apes.

470
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,406
With all due respect,
Mr. Hefner,

471
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,274
I never went near
that zoo, never.

472
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,610
Well, you boys better
remember who did,

473
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,706
or you're both
out of here.

474
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,718
It was a long time ago.

475
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,310
And we were so drunk.

476
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,753
We were sitting at that table
by The Grotto over there.

477
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,757
We were banging out
shots of Cuervo and, uh...

478
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,782
It was me and you
and...

479
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,423
Pauly!

480
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,260
Let the fuck go of me!

481
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,960
That's my fucking bad arm
you piece of shits!

482
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,799
They shouldn't be locked up
in cages in this house and you know it.

483
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,065
I'm gonna fucking
get you, bro!

484
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,699
- Get him out of here.
- Lifetime ban, Pauly.

485
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,231
Oh, bro... no!

486
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,506
I think he just called
Hugh Hefner "bro."

487
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,014
I'm sorry, guys.

488
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,743
Sorry, Vince.

489
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,378
- Thank you, Mr. Hefner.
- You have a good time.

490
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,082
- Thank you, Mr. Heffner.
- And behave yourselves.

491
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,783
- We will.
- I appreciate it.

492
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,382
Thanks, Hef!
Good night!

493
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,587
Yes, I'm back.

494
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,960
- Bro, thank you!
- Ah, of course.

495
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,522
Ralph, man,
sorry about that.

496
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,693
- I had you wrong.
- Come on, let's get a drink.

497
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,329
Yeah yeah yeah.
We'll talk about that pilot.

498
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,339
Listen, there's nothing
in it for you.

499
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,779
Hey, Vince, we gonna throw parties
like this at the new house?

500
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,720
No. E doesn't think we can
afford the new house.

501
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,689
E's a fucking buzz kill.

502
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,782
I thought you don't need
all the toys, Vince?

503
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,623
Yeah, I don't need them.
I like them.

504
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:25,027
The worst thing that happens
is they kick you out.

505
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,623
They give you time
to pack up your shit, bro, trust me.

506
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,634
They ain't kicking
us out, all right?

507
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:30,965
Vince is a superstar.

508
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:32,833
If it ain't this,
it's something else.

509
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,772
M.C. Hammer could've used a guy
like you, Turtle, back in the day.

510
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,469
I don't know about you,
but I'm in this for the long haul.

511
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,102
Oh, yeah,
what do you think we're in it for?

512
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,273
Well, I don't know.
Did you really hate the script?

513
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,840
No.
I mean, I liked it.

514
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:49,183
I don't wanna end up
looking like an idiot on the screen.

515
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,280
Wow. I've never seen you
this insecure.

516
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,019
I'm not insecure.
I'm just not confident enough to think

517
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,653
- that I can be a superhero.
- Now that I see an opening...

518
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,255
Warner's is willing
to bank $100 million

519
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,094
on the fact that
you are a superhero.

520
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:04,158
They loved you so much
in the meeting today,

521
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:07,535
they want to shoot back-to-back movies,
like "Lord of the Rings."

522
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,473
That do anything for your confidence?
They wanna give you...

523
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,239
five for the first,
seven for the second.

524
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,041
God willing,
if there is a third,

525
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,208
they want to give you 12.
Boom!

526
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,878
That's like $50-fucking-million,
Vince.

527
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,546
No, it's 12.

528
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,920
That's $1.2 million for E.

529
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,857
And I'm still gonna be making
$200 a week?

530
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,521
That's bullshit, Vince.
Raise!

531
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,759
Vince, you wanna buy that house?
Do this movie.

532
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,197
Mm-hmm.

533
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,101
All right.

534
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,106
Can you get me
suit approval?

535
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,109
You can wear tube socks
and a yarmulka!

536
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,110
All right, fuck it.
Lock it down.

537
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,119
That's what
I'm talking about!

538
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,450
Nice working, baby!

539
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,513
Hey, you know, Aquaman's
got a brother.

540
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,354
I'm just saying.

541
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,383
I'm telling you
he's got a brother.

542
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,725
God damn,
I wish I wasn't married!

543
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,458
"Aqua-brother" right here.

544
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,592
He's betting you the 1.2!
It was 1.2!

545
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,932
I'm telling you
Aquaman's got a brother.

546
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,096
No he doesn't.

547
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,299
We need more jungle juice
for the kids!
