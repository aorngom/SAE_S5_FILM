1
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:25,442
This place is sweet.

2
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,283
- What? The airport?
- No, the film festival, bro.

3
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,879
Take it all in.

4
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,289
Your first film festival
only happens once, Vince.

5
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,885
I let my first one
pass me by.

6
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,361
Barely remember a thing.

7
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,421
What was that first
festival again, Drama?

8
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,330
'Cause we barely
remember it either.

9
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,732
Palm Springs International '93.

10
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,532
I was the toast
of the town.

11
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,129
I thought I told
you guys about this.

12
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,503
Fuck Palm Springs.

13
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,633
Did they have 6"
of fresh powder over there?

14
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,735
No, but they did
have a sandstorm

15
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,905
that nearly blew
Bob Hope off the podium.

16
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,472
I hear the slopes
out here are insane.

17
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,915
Give me a break.

18
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,579
Anywhere you can ski
in short sleeves is for pussies.

19
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,417
They got no ice out here.

20
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,923
- Well, who wants to ski on ice?
- Men, E.

21
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,290
- Men who like speed.
- I'm with Drama.

22
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,124
There's nothing like
the possibility

23
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,629
of a good
head-on collision.

24
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,927
If you can ski Hunter Mountain,
you can ski anywhere.

25
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,196
- Yeah.
- First, we're boarding, not skiing.

26
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,499
Second of all, you guys
have been on boards twice.

27
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,004
One of those times
was in the store

28
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,506
- when we were testing them.
- Sounds like a challenge.

29
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,702
I'll put up a G for the first man
down the hill,

30
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,837
unless I win, then you all
have to walk home barefoot.

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,541
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

32
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,379
What's Sundance without
the spirit of competition? I'm in.

33
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:35,114
Hey, E, you sure
Cameron's coming?

34
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,713
I don't see his name
on any of these signs.

35
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,121
It's in the bag.

36
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,888
They're probably cleaning
the wings of his 767 right now.

37
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,259
Or maybe he's got
some new vehicle that burrows

38
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,287
its way through
the center of the earth.

39
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,731
Sorry, I'm late.
The dog sled only does 30.

40
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,860
- Hey, Shauna.
- Hi, You look gorgeous.

41
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,461
- Thank you.
- How was the flight?

42
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,472
- Good. Made it.
- Car's outside. Come on.

43
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,804
- I'll catch up. I'm gonna hit the head.
- Hurry up.

44
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,811
Nothin' like
a good shit.

45
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,385
Hey, give me
one of those towels, will you, kid?

46
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,490
Here. Trash it.

47
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,160
- Harvey, right?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,430
I'm Eric Murphy.
I represent Vincent Chase.

49
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,299
Ari Gold represents
Vincent Chase.

50
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,032
Ari's his agent.
I'm his manager.

51
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,835
Tell me something.
The managers, agents...

52
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,138
what the hell is the difference
between you guys?

53
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,905
Managers are
the ones who care.

54
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,806
That's good.
I like that.

55
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,680
You're not serious,
are you?

56
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,177
21A.

57
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,849
Attention, please.

58
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,688
United Airlines flight 6566...

59
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,751
Guys, this is
your driver Cassie.

60
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,320
She's a good California girl,
so be nice.

61
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,059
Cassie's leaving on Sunday

62
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,294
to track down dolphin poachers
for Greenpeace.

63
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,634
Actually, it's not Greenpeace.
It's the Peace Corps.

64
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,400
That's sweet. Hi.

65
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,635
Whatever. This is Vincent,
Turtle and Drama.

66
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,166
Cassie, how you doin'?
Peace Corps, huh?

67
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,577
- Where you gonna be stationed?
- The Sudan.

68
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,582
Those are some
lucky Sudaners.

69
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,710
That's called Sudanens,
jackass.

70
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,413
Actually,
it's Sudanese,

71
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,116
but with your accents,
I'll let it slide.

72
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,316
Watch out
for these two.

73
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,053
They get out of line,
smack 'em.

74
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,085
- Oh no, they're sweet.
- Smack 'em anyway.

75
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,428
- Let's go.
- Guess who's breaking bread at 2:50?

76
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,560
- Who eats at 2:50?
- Harvey Weingard.

77
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,162
Oh! Harvey's a prick to work for,
but he's a genius.

78
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,605
Everything he touches
turns to Oscar gold.

79
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,042
- You're the man, E.
- Fantastic. Good job, man.

80
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,510
Thank you.

81
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,349
I don't get why we
have to share a room.

82
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,951
Seriously. I need
my own space to operate.

83
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:57,554
Yo, guys. E found the movie.
E gets his own room.

84
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:01,089
You can attack this gift basket
if you stop complaining.

85
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,126
Ahh! Multiple Sidekicks!
E-bay, baby!

86
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,637
Yeah.
What do I get?

87
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,140
In Palm Springs, I had
a king-size bed all to myself.

88
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:11,666
Yeah, he tried to bang a bunch of
senior citizens, but he's a non-closer!

89
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,680
- Oh, you slay me, E.
- Drama, one more complaint out of you,

90
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,375
and you're not getting
those two tickets I scored

91
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,940
to the Alejandro
what's-his-name's screening.

92
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,578
- Teva! The Spanish Spielberg!
- Yeah.

93
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,451
Thank you. I thought
they were sold out.

94
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,513
You know what?
Fuck all you guys.

95
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,889
When I score this guy's
matador movie next year,

96
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,393
I'm gonna get
my own condo.

97
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,862
Well, let's go check out
our quarters.

98
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,063
You gotta be shittin' me.

99
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,801
Bottom! Oh!

100
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,056
Give me a call when you guys
want me to pick you up.

101
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,822
What was that number again?

102
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,227
Don't worry,
I already got it. Come on!

103
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,572
Drama, if you were
a stand-up guy,

104
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,098
you'd back off Cassie.

105
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,236
- Why would I do that?
- Because I saw her first.

106
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,940
Bullshit.
I distinctly recall

107
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,812
hitting the airport curb
before you did.

108
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,183
Actually, guys, I walked out
and I saw her first.

109
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,884
Look at their faces!
I'm kidding.

110
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,720
There's a whole mountain
full of women.

111
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,920
- You guys are gonna compete over one?
- It's a little weird.

112
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,623
You come to Utah to hit on
a girl from Pasadena?

113
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,631
You can't choose
who you fall for, bro.

114
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:43,032
On the way here, I was dreaming
of hooking up with a nice Mormon girl.

115
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,596
Why don't you go after a Mormon?
They're all over the place.

116
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,164
Everyone knows they know how
to treat their men right.

117
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,005
They're like
Catholic girls times 100.

118
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,409
You think the night before
a Mormon wedding a guy says,

119
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,415
"How am I gonna sleep with the same
eight women for the rest of my life?"

120
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,917
I've been married.
Loving one girl right is tough enough.

121
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,818
- Loving eight would be impossible.
- Vince could do it.

122
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,685
I don't know.
What if I get divorced?

123
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,782
Paying alimony
would be a killer.

124
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,658
Nah, they don't get half.
They only get an eighth.

125
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,219
They get a ninth, you moron, or else
Vince would get left with nothing.

126
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,028
You're looking out, E.
Always saving me money.

127
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,500
- Oh! Oh!
- What what what?

128
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,401
You don't let your guard down!
Come on!

129
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,673
- Don't take the bear!
- Oh, ho ho ho!

130
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,767
Oh, he went behind
the back!

131
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,441
Drop the girl!

132
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,540
All right!
I give, I give. I give.

133
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,676
Got your ass
Sonny Corleone-style, Gold.

134
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:36,154
Good aim could keep you in
minimum wage for the rest of your life.

135
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,090
What's up, man? You're on fire,
baby. You kidding me?

136
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,355
Every distributor
in town is here to see "Q.B."

137
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,986
Can he pick 'em,
or what?

138
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,122
Harvey Weingard, "King of Sundance,"
is looking to buy it too.

139
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,359
- How do you know?
- E stalked him in the airport bathroom.

140
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,493
Really? Took the initiative.
I like it.

141
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,230
We should put a gold star
on his forehead.

142
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,704
I did a little more than
take initiative. I got us a lunch.

143
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:57,004
- Bullshit.
- Yeah, it's true.

144
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,476
2:50 today.

145
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,105
2:50, everyone knows 2:50
is a jerk-off meeting.

146
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,411
What's he gonna do,
clear his throat until 3:00 comes?

147
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,383
You don't have
to worry about it,

148
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,319
- 'cause he said not to bring you.
- Not to bring me? Really?

149
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,049
Without me, he'd be producing

150
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,750
Kevin Smith movies
for the rest of his life.

151
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,123
Guys, I gotta run
or I'm gonna miss the Teva flick.

152
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,025
Are we not hitting
the slopes at all today?

153
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,860
Not me.
I'm gonna grab Cassie

154
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,765
and introduce her
to Spanish New Wave cinema, brother.

155
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,269
- New Wave is French.
- It's still in Europe.

156
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,497
Yeah, Europe.

157
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,870
You really want to go
head-to-head with me?

158
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,239
Bring it on, bitch.
Toodleoo.

159
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,040
Go back,
put on the gloves. I go in,

160
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,707
'cause they're real and beautiful.
And I celebrate them.

161
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,444
Hey, don't let him kid you.
This guy's a fagelah!

162
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,419
Good to see you, baby.
You know Vinnie Chase.

163
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,751
- Vinnie.
- Yes.

164
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,517
- Hello, Vincent.
- Hello.

165
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,548
- Eric.
- Yeah, hi.

166
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,559
- Ticket?
- Sidekick?

167
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,295
Sonny Bono presented me
with the bronze ribbon himself.

168
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,737
My mom's got it
hanging up in the foyer.

169
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,003
Wow. Sonny Bono.

170
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,033
Did you ever meet Cher?

171
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,343
No, but I did play
racquetball

172
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,212
with Rob Camilletti
for years.

173
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,376
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

174
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,909
Could you slide down one?
Thank you.

175
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,716
What'd I miss?

176
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,556
First time
I came to Park City,

177
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,494
just to give you an idea,

178
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,497
Redford was fucking
Sónia Braga.

179
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,056
Harvey, it's 2:54.
We got six minutes left.

180
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,297
- Let's talk about something real.
- I know about Cameron.

181
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,363
The big shaygitz is coming tomorrow.
The big Jew is here today.

182
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,875
And I don't have to see
"Queens Boulevard"

183
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,240
to validate you, my friend.

184
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,576
- So what do you got?
- Whoa, Eric, aggressive. I like that.

185
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:45,015
What I got is a book.
It's an adaptation of a Kem Nunn novel.

186
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,849
- You know it..."Tapping the Source"?
- The surfing thing?

187
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,378
I've been trying to make
this movie for 15 years.

188
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,688
And I'm just looking for the right actor
to ride the wave with me.

189
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,523
I read a draft of that script.
It's pretty good.

190
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,359
- It's fucking great!
- I thought Josh Hartnett was doing it.

191
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,228
Hartnett's out.
He has no motor skills.

192
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,530
He can't stand up
on a moving object.

193
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,729
So what do you boys think?

194
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,795
I have excellent
hand-eye coordination.

195
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,636
Great. We start
shooting in Australia

196
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,471
in three weeks.
See you there.

197
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,534
Bye.

198
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,948
Bravo! Bravo!

199
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,253
Bravo! Bravo!

200
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,161
Jesus! You're like
the proud mother, Drama!

201
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,859
Shut up, Turtle.
The guy's a god.

202
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,060
Johnny's
very passionate.

203
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,933
Passion is my business,
honey.

204
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,200
Don't call her "honey."

205
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,299
- Okay, we'll begin the Q&A.
- Ooh, ooh!

206
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:47,142
- You up there.
- Great film! Congratulations!

207
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,874
Very powerful stuff,
Alejandro.

208
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:52,247
I notice you use a lot
of authentic people in films.

209
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:58,223
Authentic people are so much better
than cartoons or robots.

210
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,589
That's a good one, Drama.

211
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,321
Blow me, dickhead.

212
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,795
- Okay, next?
- Wait. I'm not finished.

213
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,297
It's only one question
per person.

214
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,425
That wasn't a question,
that was a statement.

215
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,732
- Sounded like a question to me.
- No, this is a question...

216
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,739
in two parts.

217
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,970
Are you interested in seeing any films
while you're here, Alejandro?

218
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,467
And would you ever consider an American
with some Chilean blood in him

219
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,674
for the part of Raoul
in "The Bull Fighter"?

220
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:26,879
I would consider anyone
who would bring truth to the role.

221
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,854
Good, 'cause I'm the sixth lead
in "Queens Boulevard,"

222
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,120
and I would be delighted
if you would be my guest.

223
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:40,965
What do you think?

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,628
If the dates don't conflict
with "Aquaman," it sounds great.

225
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,638
Vincent, this is Jen and Corine.
They're corporate publicists.

226
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,300
I'm the one who sends you your cases
of Budweiser every month.

227
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,138
But I'm the one that
sent you your Maserati.

228
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,008
Vincent, please don't
drink and drive.

229
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,013
Hi, girls. Nice to see you.
Find real work.

230
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,480
Vinnie, I need you.
Come here.

231
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,779
And that's Ari Gold,
and he's a real asshole.

232
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,719
- I just got done with Harvey.
- And?

233
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:05,588
Grab your scuba tanks,
because we are going to Australia, baby.

234
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,489
Melbourne.
The Gold Coast.

235
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,221
The Great Barrier
"Refer madness."

236
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,729
We don't understand
how we're gonna do both movies.

237
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,163
We're not gonna do both.

238
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,530
So what,
we have to pick one?

239
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,296
No we don't.
It's a no-brainer.

240
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,495
It's been picked for us.

241
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,003
One is real
and the other isn't.

242
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,869
We had Cameron come watch
the movie for nothing?

243
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,032
We didn't have him
watch it for nothing.

244
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,066
We used this to leverage
something real.

245
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,978
You don't come to Sundance
for the snow, you come for the heat.

246
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,038
Africa's great.
You're gonna love it.

247
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,209
Give me a buzz if you see
any seven-footers.

248
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,412
My cousin Joey's
a scout at St. Johns.

249
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,718
How did you know the Sudan
was in Africa, Mr. Geography?

250
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,748
I know everything
about the Sudan.

251
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,885
For example,
it's in Northern Africa.

252
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,088
Population 38 million.
Give or take a few.

253
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,189
Their currency
is the "dinar."

254
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,861
Their major exports are oil,
petroleum products and ground nuts.

255
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,631
Wow, Turtle.

256
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,471
It's great you have this
intellectual curiosity for the Sudanese.

257
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,841
I'm a humanitarian at heart.

258
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,642
Especially when it comes
to indigenous cultures.

259
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,841
Yeah, I'm curious too.

260
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,510
How the fuck did you
know all that?

261
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,883
I "googled" it,
motherfucker. Keep up.

262
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,818
$3 million and it goes
in three weeks.

263
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,688
The money will be
in Vinnie's bank account

264
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,557
before he touches
down in Sydney. Boom!

265
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,459
Can't we stall Harvey till Cameron
sees "Queens Boulevard"?

266
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,464
You can't stall Harvey.
You out of your mind?

267
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,228
He's gonna announce this before
the premiere of "Queens Boulevard."

268
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,498
He knows how to maximize
his press. Here's the deal.

269
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,902
Don't fuck
this thing up again.

270
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,805
"Tapping the Source" is
an unbelievable opportunity for you.

271
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,935
Whoa, Ari. James Cameron
flew all the way here just to see me,

272
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,774
and you just wanna
blow it off?

273
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,872
What?

274
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,544
Ari?

275
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,882
Are you hyperventilating?

276
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,751
- No, l...
- What is it, the altitude?

277
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,756
- No, he...
- Want me to call the paramedics?

278
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,054
He didn't just come
to see you.

279
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,492
Who else did
he come to see?

280
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,258
He came to see...
Ryan Gosling's got a movie here.

281
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,766
James Franco. There's a lot of guys
that have movies here.

282
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,030
You are on a short list
for "Aquaman."

283
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,469
- But you're on a list.
- Do you ever tell the truth?

284
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,268
I tell the parts
that matter.

285
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,434
I didn't think this would come up.
This is meant to be.

286
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,103
Vinnie, I am telling you.
And it's right there for us.

287
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,841
- Should I tell Harvey yes, or...
- Hold on, Ari.

288
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,247
- No problem.
- Just give me a second to think?

289
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,307
Take your time,
baby.

290
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,750
E?

291
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,414
What are you hearing about
the Gosling and Franco movies?

292
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,013
- They good?
- I hear they're great.

293
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,458
I hear every movie at Sundance
is the best movie ever made.

294
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:22,926
- I don't know.
- Well?

295
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,430
You know, it sounds like
the safe move, Vince.

296
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,955
- What do you want me to say?
- It's the only move.

297
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,332
Okay.

298
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,563
Fine.

299
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,902
Tell Harvey
"no fucking Speedos."

300
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,804
There you go, baby.
"Men at Work."

301
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,309
The land down under. We're gonna
get drunk with Russell Crowe

302
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,175
and we're gonna head-butt
some kangaroos.

303
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,522
Yo, you think
this is a cash bar?

304
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,892
I'm getting Vince.

305
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,664
You get the little one.

306
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,830
What?
He's cute, too.

307
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,237
Bullshit!

308
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,368
I gave you Jake Gyllenhaal
in Telluride.

309
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,837
We all loved you
in "The Station Agent," Peter.

310
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,246
Fucking hope so. That's why
I signed on with you people.

311
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,650
If you would've signed earlier, we
could've slipped you into "Bad Santa."

312
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,950
Actually, I passed on that.
Thank you.

313
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,388
You're one of the biggest actors
in this town, Peter.

314
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,517
What is that, a play on words,
dickhead?

315
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,551
I tolerate agents.
I don't like them.

316
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,896
Peter!

317
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,027
- Don't listen to a word this bum says.
- Fuck off, Harvey.

318
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,697
Whoa, he's an angry
little fucker, isn't he?

319
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,228
- Tiny meshuguna.
- You all right?

320
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,298
What's the word, Ari,
on the picture?

321
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,639
You ready to get wet,
big man?

322
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,009
Let's go surfing.
We are in.

323
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,604
- Yes! Okay.
- Yes, we're in.

324
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,137
- There they are right there.
- Where?

325
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:53,310
Look,
Vinnie's right there.

326
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,149
See you in Australia!

327
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,848
It's all a matter
of preference.

328
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,687
Do you prefer tall,
lean and handsome?

329
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:04,025
Or, uh, short,
fat and ugly?

330
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,224
You know what?
He's right.

331
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,757
Do you want somebody
who's cute, funny and cuddly?

332
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,396
Or somebody who's bitter,
out of work

333
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,996
and losing his hair
by the minute?

334
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,870
- I'm not losing my hair.
- Yeah, you are.

335
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,933
Guys, I believe in love.

336
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,674
And love has no face,

337
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,682
and no weight...

338
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,014
definitely no receding hairline.

339
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:29,680
Look, I want to talk to you both
about something.

340
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,955
Best friends should
treat each other

341
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,120
with loyalty and respect.

342
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,562
They should never compete
for the same woman.

343
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,032
Because even
if one of them wins,

344
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,627
then they both lose.

345
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,638
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

346
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,697
You guys figure out a way
to get along,

347
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,471
and I will be right back.

348
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,171
That was deep.

349
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,249
She's right.

350
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,376
This is crazy.
What are we fightin' for?

351
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,979
This girl's gonna be
gone by tomorrow.

352
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,820
By tomorrow night,
she'll be a memory.

353
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,294
And we gotta spend
every waking minute together.

354
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,262
So what do you want to do?

355
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,526
- I want the memory.
- So do I.

356
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,193
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me? Fuck you!

357
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,827
I said it first.

358
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,271
Shauna tells me that James Cameron
flew all the way out here

359
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,400
- just to see your movie.
- Uh, well, yeah, sort of.

360
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,606
God, that is so cool.
I lived for "Titanic" in high school.

361
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,170
Oh my God.
Me, too.

362
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,546
I must have seen it like,
400 times.

363
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,318
E...

364
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,984
how many times did we see
"Aliens" in high school?

365
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,390
What are we doing?

366
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,089
- We're playing it safe.
- Since when do we do that?

367
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,859
Since you got yourself
millions in overhead.

368
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,390
James Cameron.
This is once-in-a-lifetime.

369
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,596
I mean, the guy makes
a movie every ten years.

370
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,936
I'm with you, but I can't keep
telling you to take these crazy chances.

371
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,134
This is your life.
It's not mine to fuck around with.

372
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,610
This is our life.
Don't forget that, all right?

373
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,078
I need you acting
from your gut.

374
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,707
That's why
I have you here.

375
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,683
What if he doesn't like
"Queens Boulevard"?

376
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,912
So we'll do
another commercial.

377
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,855
Maybe Cassie will help us
sell Pepsi to the Sudanese.

378
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:18,662
Come on, you want
to roll the dice?

379
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,858
Yeah, I want
to roll the dice.

380
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,867
Good.
Let's roll the dice.

381
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,334
Should I call Ari
right now?

382
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,462
Hey, are you guys
gonna yap all night,

383
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,700
or are we gonna party?

384
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,299
We'll see him
at breakfast.

385
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,810
We'll see him
in the morning.

386
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,040
Uh, I shouldn't.

387
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,814
Aw, come on. You're going away
to Africa for two years.

388
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,550
They got nothing
but shit bush-weed over there.

389
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,889
You know, Cassie,
you've inspired me.

390
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,826
I'm not gonna join
the Corps, per se,

391
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,955
but I think when I get home,
I'm gonna log in some time

392
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,658
downtown at the soup kitchen.

393
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:58,432
You know, every time I see
a homeless person, I cry.

394
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,564
- Seriously.
- Come on.

395
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,302
Guys, are you for real,

396
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:07,506
or is this an act and you're both
still trying to get with me?

397
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,071
Actually, I'm still
trying to get with you.

398
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:14,484
Me too. I'm just
a way better actor than he is.

399
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,545
Look, Cassie...

400
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,954
this is our last night together.

401
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,824
If you're interested
in either of us,

402
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,055
we think you should choose.

403
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,087
Yeah, who's it gonna be?

404
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,281
What?

405
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,396
Why don't you guys show me
your bunk beds?

406
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:45,268
- Hey, good luck on the premiere.
- Hey, thanks, my friend.

407
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,910
Come on, Drama,
don't be a dick.

408
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,710
Don't touch me, Turtle!

409
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,546
I can't hear you.
I can't see you.

410
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,347
I don't even
wanna know you.

411
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,648
You're yelling, all right?

412
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,712
What's your problem, Drama?

413
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,383
Me and Drama had
a little incident.

414
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,619
- What kind of incident?
- Don't fucking say it.

415
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,184
No no, say it.

416
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,028
We accidentally
crossed swords.

417
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,194
- Ew.
- Really?

418
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,468
Were there
any women there at least?

419
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:17,134
Yeah, dick, it was a threesome,
okay? It's no biggie.

420
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,439
Crossing is
an occupational hazard.

421
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,309
Guess who just closed a deal

422
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,610
on the new Osmond
pay-per-view Christmas special?

423
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,413
NC-17, baby. Gonna get Marie
to undo the top button.

424
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,009
I gotta go find Alejandro.

425
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,146
Don't be an asshole.

426
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,450
- Ari.
- What's up?

427
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,720
- We got a problem.
- What's up, Vinnie?

428
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,886
- We need to talk.
- What's going on?

429
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,157
E's gonna talk I'm gonna
go talk to Peter Sarsgaard.

430
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,256
All right.
What's goin' on?

431
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,790
We decided we're gonna wait

432
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,461
for James Cameron
to see "Queens Boulevard."

433
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,800
Very funny.
What's up?

434
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,668
No joke. Seriously.
Tell Harvey thanks,

435
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,675
- but we'll catch him on the next one.
- You don't flip-flop on Harvey.

436
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,177
- He's about to do a press conference.
- You should stop him

437
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,076
- to avoid a problem.
- He's right in there.

438
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,978
Why don't you go stop him?

439
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,212
- Fine. He's in here?
- Yeah.

440
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,346
- Vincent.
- Good luck, Vince.

441
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,754
There you are. I was getting ready
to call in the dogs.

442
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,782
- I'm right here.
- There's my guy.

443
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:11,557
- Hey, Billy. What's up?
- I hope this thing doesn't suck.

444
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,427
Since when do you worry?

445
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,262
I had a dream last night
people hated it.

446
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,860
They tore me and you
to pieces.

447
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,565
I shaved my head.
I'm a fuckin' mess.

448
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,664
I'm sure it's great.
Have you shown it to anybody?

449
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,108
- Me, my editor, and my mother.
- What'd your mother think?

450
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:28,476
She thought it was garbage,
but she's a fuckin' moron.

451
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,481
- Mr. Walsh!
- Fuck off, supersuit!

452
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,449
I don't talk to people like you
before a screening.

453
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,951
Flatter me!
Listen to me.

454
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,215
- I made up my mind. Let it go.
- You don't wanna f...

455
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,279
What will be will be.

456
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,928
We better get
in there now.

457
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,825
Stop grinding me.
I'm not gonna say it again.

458
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,731
It ain't intentional,
asshole.

459
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,759
Check it out.
It's Cameron.

460
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:58,567
That Vincent Chase is
the coolest kid I ever seen.

461
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,237
I'd go see any movie
he was in

462
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,906
even if it was
a big piece of shit!

463
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,041
One more question,
Mr. Cameron.

464
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,641
Was the sinking of the ship

465
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,152
an attempt
to foreshadow

466
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,848
the forthcoming sinking
of the tech market in 2000?

467
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,188
Uh, no. Actually, I just wanted
to make young girls cry.

468
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,717
Um, can I get some
of the Sour Patch Kids please?

469
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,320
You little shitbag!

470
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,957
You wanted a job for Vince.
And now you fucked me?!

471
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,591
Do you know who I am?

472
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,602
You're gonna beg to get back
into the pizza business!

473
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:25,933
I'm trying to do what's best...

474
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,996
Ah, fuck you!
You and that fucking kid!

475
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,439
The two of you are about
to go down a river of shit!

476
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,568
You hear me?! That's it.
You're finished.

477
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:36,342
I will never offer that kid
a fucking job again!

478
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:39,612
Ari Gold's gonna catch
a smack, too!

479
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,753
Fucking Harvey.

480
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,413
Is this on?

481
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,484
Okay, good.
Thank you all for coming.

482
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,759
Um, I just wanna take
this time to thank,

483
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,598
uh, our brilliant director
Mr. Walsh.

484
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,193
- Yeah!
- Vinnie!

485
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,865
Uh, and I would also like
to thank Vinnie over here.

486
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,431
Uh...

487
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,443
Yeah, Vince!

488
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:10,209
The guy's a fucking genius.
Say something, Vinnie.

489
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,409
Thanks, Billy.

490
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,919
The guy's a great director.

491
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,749
I hope you like the movie.
And if you don't,

492
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,920
Billy's staying at the Marriott
in room 512.

493
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,563
Oh, and... if anybody's
gotta use the can,

494
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,571
the movie's running
almost four hours, so do it now.

495
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,436
Thank you.

496
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,964
Four fuckin' hours?

497
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,246
You made
a four-hour movie?!

498
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,147
This is my fucking
"Deer Hunter," Rick.

499
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,387
How'd it go with Harvey?

500
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:53,255
- Fine. He wished you luck tonight.
- Yeah? Cool.

501
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,126
- Here we go.
- Come on.

502
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,047
Four hours long, and they cut me out
of the whole fucking movie!

503
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,317
But the line you spoke

504
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,325
was delivered
with such angst, Johnny.

505
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,156
Thank you, Alejandro.

506
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,889
I do have
an abundance of that.

507
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,556
You are amazing.
That was brilliant!

508
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,690
This is going to do
great shit for your career.

509
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,633
We got press to do
tomorrow morning,

510
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,296
- so don't party too hard tonight.
- That movie played great.

511
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,134
I'll bet you
Cameron loved it.

512
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,606
- What?
- I don't want to say anything.

513
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,940
- But he left pretty early on.
- How early on?

514
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,172
- 10 minutes in.
- Fuck.

515
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,204
That can't be good.

516
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:54,480
Yo, I just got an audition for
the next Alejandro Teva film.

517
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,482
What, you guys
aren't happy for me?

518
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,185
- Cameron left after 10 minutes.
- Fuck it!

519
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,626
We're scorching hot
in the indie world. You kiddin' me?

520
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,687
You hear it in there?
They loved us.

521
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,426
We can make art house flicks
for the next 10 years.

522
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,457
Who wants a shot of Jack?

523
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,937
Fuck it! Let's go boarding.

524
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,380
We probably should have
taken a lesson

525
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,314
before we came up here.

526
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,977
This hill is a lot bigger
than the one I did at Big Bear.

527
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,009
Maybe Cassie's right...

528
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,579
competition amongst friends
isn't such a great idea.

529
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,191
Yeah?

530
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,459
Yeah,
he's right here.

531
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,194
It's Ari.
Says it's an emergency.

532
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,134
Ho! What's up?

533
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,570
Vinnie, say hello
to James Cameron.

534
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,836
Call me Jim,
Vince.

535
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:52,342
Okay, Jim.

536
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,709
Uh, what-what's happenin'?

537
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,407
I could only stay
for a bit of the film.

538
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,349
But I've got to tell you,
it was all I needed to see.

539
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,376
How'd you like to come
play "Aquaman" for me?

540
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,821
Uh, sure,
l-I could do that for you.

541
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,758
Fantastic. Let's get together
next week. We'll talk about it.

542
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,226
Okay, great.

543
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,559
I'll see you then.
Looking forward to it.

544
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:15,088
Talk to you later.
Bye.

545
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,370
Cameron just offered me
"Aquaman."

546
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,168
- What?
- Yes!

547
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,835
- Yeah, baby!
- Good job, E.

548
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,242
Gotta figure out a way
to get you off this mountain.

549
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,076
I don't need you breaking your neck
before you start this movie.

550
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,946
Are you kidding?
We just got "Aquaman"!

551
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,974
I'm raising the stakes.

552
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,987
10 G's to the first guy
who gets down there.

553
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:39,479
- 10 G's?
- I'll give you a head start, Turtle.

554
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,059
Later.
