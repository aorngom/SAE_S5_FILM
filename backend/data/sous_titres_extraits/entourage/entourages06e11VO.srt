- WELL, YOU'RE NOT.

23
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:49,624
TOMORROW'S AUDITION
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

HE'S SAD JAMIE'S
LEAVING, JOHNNY.

26
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:55,663
WHY ISN'T HE WITH HER
INSTEAD OF HERE ABUSING ME?

27
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:57,999
'CAUSE SHE'S AT
A MEET AND GREET WITH
HER NEW CAST MATES

SLEEP THERE LATER.

I CAN JUST ROLL WITH E.

35
00:02:12,748 --> 00:02:16,417

WOW, E MAKING OUT

45
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:43,110
- WHEN WERE YOU WITH HER?
- WHEN WERE YOU?

46
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:46,247
- LAST WEEK.
- HA, I BEAT YOU
BY FOUR MONTHS.

47
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:49,550
- I'M SICK.
- E, I'VE HAD MOST
OF THIS TOWN.

48
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:52,787
IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN THAT
OUR TREES WOULD DABBLE IN THE
SAME FORT AT SOME POINT.

49
00:02:52,788 --> 00:02:55,089
I FIGURED IT WOULD HAPPEN WITH
VINCE AT SOME POINT, NOT YOU.

50
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:57,258
- HEY, WE'RE STILL YOUNG.
- GOD, I'M NAUSEOUS.

51
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:59,927
- NOW YOU'RE INSULTING ME, E.
- YEAH, AND LIGHTEN UP.

52
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,796
FOUR MONTHS IS
A LONG TIME AGO.

53
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,865
THIS GIRL WASN'T
FOR YOU ANYWAY.

54
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:06,200
- WHY NOT?
- 'CAUSE SHE'S REAL SLUTTY.

55
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:08,436
LET'S ROLL.

56
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,938
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SHE'S REAL SLUTTY?

57
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,574
SHE MIGHT HAVE
GIVEN ME SOMETHING.

58
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:15,910
- SHUT UP.
- I CAN'T BE SURE.

59
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:18,079
I WAS ON A REAL HOT
STREAK WHEN IT HAPPENED,

60
00:03:18,113 --> 00:03:20,581
BUT SHE WAS
THE PRIME SUSPECT.

61
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:23,484
- YOU JOKING?
- RELAX, E, YOU'LL BE FINE.

62
00:03:23,552 --> 00:03:26,654
- YEAH, YOU COVERED UP, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

63
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:29,090
DID YOU?

64
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:30,858
I SAID YEAH.

65
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:33,160
YOU TWITCHED.

66
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:35,062
THE CLASSIC
NO-CONDOM TELL.

67
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:38,399
- YOU DIDN'T WEAR A BAG?
- I DIDN'T HAVE ONE.

68
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,934
SHE TOLD ME
SHE WAS ON THE PILL.

69
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:41,369
OH, E.
ROOKIE MISTAKE.

70
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:42,770
I'VE GOT TO GO HOME
AND TAKE A SHOWER.

71
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:44,939
I'D PICK UP SOME CLOROX
IF I WAS YOU.

72
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:48,109
TOMORROW MORNING
I'M WAKING UP AND I'M CALLING
MY DOCTOR FIRST THING.

73
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:51,312
LOOKS LIKE WE BOTH
NEED A LITTLE IRISH
LUCK TOMORROW.

74
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:54,315
- GOOD MORNING, MR. GOLD.

00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:57,585
THEY SAID YOU WERE
UNHAPPY WITH YOUR ASSISTANT.

77
00:03:57,619 --> 00:04:00,254
I'VE BEEN UNHAPPY WITH
THE LAST THREE THEY SENT.

78
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:03,324

IT IS.

81
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:09,463
EXCEPT THIS IS CRANBERRY.

82
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:11,899
- WHAT?
- SEE THE RED BERRIES?

83
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:14,835
UM, I ASKED FOR BLUE.

84
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,737
- DID YOU CHECK?
- NO.

85
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:19,207
- BYE, MATT.

87
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:24,579
- RUNNING A LITTLE LATE, ARI?

88
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:26,681
TERRANCE, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

89
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:28,583
PERHAPS IT'S BUDGETARY CUTS.

90
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:30,618
THERE WAS NO ONE
MINDING YOUR DESK.

91
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:33,688
PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE
SECURITY ESCORT YOU OUT
THE WAY YOURS DID ME.

92
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:35,389
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD DO THAT.

93
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:36,858
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

94
00:04:36,892 --> 00:04:38,726
I HAVE SOME BUSINESS
I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS.

95
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,061
AT YOUR AGE?

96
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:41,929
SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE MORE
IMPORTANT CONCERNS?

97
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:44,665

I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW QUICKLY YOU'VE GOTTEN
BACK ON YOUR FEET.

101
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:54,742
I'M MORE THAN BACK
ON MY FEET,

102
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:56,344
I'M TOWERING OVER YOU.

103
00:04:56,378 --> 00:05:00,214
AH, ARI, STILL THE SAME
SNIPPY LITTLE BOY.

104
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:04,652
TERRANCE, IF YOU HAVE
BUSINESS TO DISCUSS,

105
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:08,289
START DISCUSSING,
'CAUSE I'M BUSY WITH
MY OWN BUSINESS.

106
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:11,359
OBVIOUSLY I NEED THIS
TO BE DISCREET.

107
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:19,200
YOUR STAR PUPIL
WHAT, YOWALKS OUT ON YOU--

108
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:20,668
I WANT YOU TO BUY ME OUT.

109
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,971
WHY WOULD I WANT TO?

110
00:05:24,006 --> 00:05:25,940
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S UP
TO YOU TO DECIDE.

111
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:28,376
I'M PUTTING IT OUT
THERE TO YOU FIRST

112
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,578
BEFORE I'M OFFERING IT
TO ANYONE ELSE.

113
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:32,346
WELL, WHY AM I
SO FORTUNATE?

114
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,216
I JUST WANT A SIMPLE DEAL,
MINIMUM HASSLES.

115
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,752
NOW IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,
WE COULD GO THERE.

116
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:40,321

SO BE IT.

117
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:45,793
WELL THEN, I'LL GO.

118
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:48,396

COME ON.

120
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,769
I KNOW YOUR BUSINESS
INSIDE AND OUT.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

121
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:56,103
<i>I DON'T THINK IT IS.</i>

122
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:58,706
OUR BACKEND ON "SEINFELD"
AND "FRIENDS" ALONE

123
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,975
WILL KEEP YOU IN GREEN
FOR DECADES.

124
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,878
- YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
- I JUST DID.

125
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:06,914

133
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:26,234
DRAMA MUST HAVE PUT

NOW CAN WE PLEASE PUT
THE COMPUTER AWAY AND ENJOY
3500 CALORIES?

IT'S A NEW DAY.

166
00:07:45,147 --> 00:07:46,447
- BAD ASS.
- YEAH.

167
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:48,349
- SO HOW YOU FEELING ABOUT IT?
- CONFIDENT.

168
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:50,585
- I GOT THIS DOWN COLD.
- NICE.

169
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:52,787
- JOHNNY.
- HEY, PHIL.

170
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:54,989
- ROCK IT, MAN.
- LATER, BRO.

171
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:56,290
- HEY, GUYS.
- YOU READY?

172
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:58,226
YEAH, I'M READY.
YOU GUYS READY?

173
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,461
ABSOLUTELY.
WE'RE JUST WAITING
FOR THE DIRECTOR.

174
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:02,430
- COOL.
- THERE HE IS.

175
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,968
- HE'S DIRECTING?
- YEAH, YOU KNOW HIM?

176
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:10,738
- UH-HUH.
- GREAT. AWESOME.
I'LL SEE YOU INSIDE.

177
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,076
<i>Doctor:
HOW MANY SEXUAL
PARTNERS HAVE YOU HAD?</i>

178
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,645
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT
THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR.

179
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:20,214
I STILL NEED TO GET A GENERAL
IDEA OF YOUR HISTORY.

180
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,617
I DON'T KNOW,
THE NORMAL AMOUNT.

181
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:25,253
MULTIPLE PARTNERS.
ANY GROUP SEX?

182
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:27,755
- IS THIS REALLY RELEVANT?
- YES.

183
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:31,459
UH, I HAD A THREESOME ONCE
WITH TWO GIRLS.

184
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:35,429
- EVER GIVEN ANAL SEX?
- I TRIED ONCE.  NO.

185
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:37,365
- EVER RECEIVED?
- NO.

186
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,201
<i>- DO YOU USE PROTECTION?
- USUALLY.</i>

187
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:42,770
NOT THIS TIME,
OBVIOUSLY.

188
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:46,240
AND THIS PARTNER TOLD YOU

189
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,075
THAT SHE MAY
HAVE SOMETHING?

190
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,077
WELL, NO, BUT A FRIEND
OF MINE WHO WAS WITH HER

191
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,679
THINKS SHE MAY HAVE
GIVEN HIM SOMETHING.

192
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:53,381
- OH.
- YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

193
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:56,784
WELL, WE'RE STILL GONNA
NEED TO GET A SWAB.

194
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:58,452
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THAT THING?

195
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:01,856
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE HOPING
I WON'T DO.

196
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,492
BUT IF YOU'RE LEAVING
FOR FOUR MONTHS IT'S SILLY
FOR US TO GO OUT NOW.

197
00:09:04,526 --> 00:09:06,360
I'LL BE BACK.

198
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:07,862
- LET'S GO.
- HOW WAS IT?

199
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:09,664
I FEEL VIOLATED.

200
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:12,166
I'LL CALL YOU.

201
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:14,869
OF COURSE WE WANT IT,
IF WE CAN GET IT AT
THE RIGHT PRICE.

202
00:09:14,903 --> 00:09:16,771
BUT 100 SOUNDS
RIDICULOUS.

203
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:18,639
IT'S BEYOND RIDICULOUS.
BUT IF WE CAN PULL THIS OFF--

204
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,541
WE'RE THE LARGEST
AGENCY IN THE WORLD.

205
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:23,211
- MUSIC, PUBLISHING, SPORTS.
- IT'S GOT A NICE RING TO IT.

206
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:24,879
NOT FOR 100,
IT DOESN'T.

207
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:26,747
THE QUESTION IS
WHAT'S HIS REAL PRICE?

208
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:28,716
THE QUESTION IS WHY
IS HE COMING TO YOU FIRST?

209
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,618
SAYS WE CAN MAKE
AN EASY DEAL.

210
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:32,653
YOU TWO HATE EACH OTHER.
THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY EASY.

211
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:34,689
- NO, IT DOESN'T.
- I WORKED FOR TERRANCE
FOR 14 YEARS.

212
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:36,424
HE DOESN'T LIKE EASY.
HE LIKES A FIGHT.

213
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,326
SO HE'S TRYING TO MAKE
ARI LOOK STUPID.

214
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:40,094
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
- NO, I DID.

215
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:42,597
HE WON'T.
YOU JUST TELL ME
IF WE WANT THIS.

216
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:45,099
NOT FOR 100, WE DON'T.

217
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:49,003
HI, MR. GOLD.
I'M JAKE STEINBERG.

218
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:50,738
H.R. SENT ME UP TO REPLACE
YOUR LAST ASSISTANT.

219
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:52,940
I DON'T CARE.
GET ME EDDIE KAPOWSKI
ON THE PHONE.

220
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:56,177
ANY RELATION TO KELLY KAPOWSKI?
YOU KNOW, "SAVED BY THE BELL"?

221
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:58,512
YOU'RE FINISHED.
GO.

222
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:01,082
YOU'RE FUCKING FIRED.

223
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:03,818
- ( phone rings )
- KAPOWSKI HERE.

224
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:05,453
<i>It's Ari.
I got a gig for you.</i>

225
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:07,154
TALK TO ME.

226
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,757
I NEED YOU TO FIND EVERY
PIECE OF CURRENT INFORMATION

227
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,292
ON TERRANCE McQUIEWICK.

228
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:12,960
SORRY, ARI.
NO CAN DO.

229
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:15,763
- I'VE GOT A CONFLICT.
- WHAT KIND OF CONFLICT?

230
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:18,132
<i>- Can't say.
- DOES IT INVOLVE ME?</i>

231
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,600
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

232
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:22,236
IS THAT SON OF A BITCH LOOKING
AT ME FOR SOME REASON?

233
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:24,171
<i>Ari.</i>

234
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,973
<i>- ARE YOU?
- Ari.</i>

235
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:28,743
- WOULD YOU DO THAT?
- NO, I WOULDN'T.

236
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:30,578
HOW WOULD I KNOW
IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME?

237
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:32,380
<i>You wouldn't.
But I'm not.</i>

238
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:35,650
- WHERE ARE YOU?
- I'M NOT WHEREVER YOU ARE,
SO RELAX.

239
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:38,719
EDDIE, I HAVE GIVEN YOU TONS
OF BUSINESS OVER THE YEARS.

240
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,421
I WANT ONE ANSWER.

241
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:43,558
HAS TERRANCE McQUIEWICK
HIRED YOU TO LOOK AT ME?

242
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:45,593
NO, ARI.
TERRANCE HASN'T HIRED
ME TO DO ANYTHING.

243
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:48,896
BUT THAT'S ALL
I CAN TELL YOU, ALL RIGHT?
I'M SORRY.

244
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:53,467
- I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING.
- OH, YOU DO?

245
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:56,070
IT WAS A HARMLESS
LITTLE CLICK OF THE MOUSE.

246
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:58,606
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
REQUEST TO BE MY FRIEND?

247
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,642
<i>- I DON'T ACCEPT THEM ALL.
- I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RUDE.</i>

248
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:04,912
THIS IS REALLY
CONVENIENT TIMING THOUGH,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

249
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:07,381
NO, IT'S TERRIBLE TIMING,
'CAUSE NOW YOU'RE GONNA
LEAVE ALL UPSET.

250
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,650
SORRY FOR YOUR GUILT.

251
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:11,819
JAMIE, PLEASE.
THIS IS HARD ENOUGH
ALREADY.

252
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:13,754
CAN YOU PLEASE JUST TRUST ME
AND FORGET ABOUT IT?

253
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:16,190
I KNOW I'M FORGETTING
SOMETHING.

254
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:19,026
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.
I LOOKED UNDER THE BED,
I OPENED EVERY DRAWER.

255
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:21,128
<i>I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU AND I ARE OKAY.</i>

256
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:23,664
- THEN DELETE HER.
- DELETE HER?

257
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:26,267
YEAH, TAKE HER OFF
YOUR FRIENDS LIST.

258
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:33,507
DONE.
FEEL BETTER?

259
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,009
NOT REALLY.

260
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:37,411
- JAMIE, COME ON.
- DO YOU WANT ME TO GO?

261
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,946
<i>NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.</i>

262
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:41,382
BUT THIS IS GONNA BE
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

263
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,484
IT'S GONNA BE
AMAZING FOR YOU.

264
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:48,389
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS YOU.

265
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:50,725
BABY, NO.
DON'T CRY.

266
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:53,494
I'LL BE WAITING RIGHT HERE
FOR YOU WHEN YOU GET BACK.

267
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,568
<i>Lloyd:
Johnny, you're making
yourself crazy.</i>

268
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:02,837
NO, THEY'RE MAKING ME CRAZY.
THIS WAS A SETUP.

269
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:05,306
- NO, IT WASN'T.
- WHY DIDN'T YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS?

270
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,676
WHY DIDN'T YOU PREPARE ME?
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME I HAD
A CONFLICT WITH THE DIRECTOR?

271
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,012
I CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF ALL
YOUR CONFLICTS, JOHNNY.

272
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:14,048
<i>- THIS GUY'S AN ANIMAL.
- Charm him with your
winning smile.</i>

273
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:16,417
MR. CHASE,
THEY'RE READY FOR YOU.

274
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:18,286
GREAT, THEY'RE READY.

275
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,354
JOHNNY DRAMA,
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT.

276
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:24,759
NOW STEP UP AND SHINE BRIGHT
FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE.

277
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:26,194
I GOT TO GO.

278
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:27,828
BREAK A LEG.

279
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:31,299
- JOHNNY CHASE, EVERYONE.
- OKAY.

280
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,935
- HEY, EVERYONE.
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU
WAITING, JOHNNY.

281
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:36,337
<i>- TECHNICAL PROBLEMS
WITH THE CAMERA.
- THAT'S OKAY.</i>

282
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,472
JUST AS LONG AS YOU
WEREN'T FREEZING ME OUT

283
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,208
'CAUSE THIS GUY IS
STILL MAD AT ME.

284
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:41,642
WHY WOULD HE BE
MAD AT YOU?

285
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,678
LAST TIME JOHN AUDITIONED
FOR ME ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES

286
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:45,580
KEPT CHECKING HIS EMAIL.
JOHN GOT A LITTLE UPSET.

287
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:48,816
YEAH, BUT IT'S OKAY NOW.
YOU CAN TALK IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY AUDITION.

288
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,786
YOU CAN SCREAM AND YELL--
WHATEVER. NOTHING FAZES
ME ANYMORE.

289
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,222
THAT'S GOOD, JOHNNY,
'CAUSE WE DON'T WANT
TO TRY AND FAZE YOU.

290
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:56,891
JUST RELAX.
EVERYBODY HERE IS HOPING
THAT YOU'RE THE GUY.

291
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:59,493
IN FACT, I'M GONNA TURN
THIS OFF RIGHT NOW

292
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,162
SO THERE'S NOTHING
TO DISTRACT YOU, OKAY?

293
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:04,498
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
LET'S DO THIS.

294
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:11,172
( clears throat )

295
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:12,707
OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

296
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:15,910
TWO SECONDS.
( exhales )

297
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:17,345
HERE WE GO.

298
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,680
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
LET'S DO THIS.  OH!

299
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,817
I'M SORRY.
I GUESS I'M HERE EARLY.
NOBODY WAS--

300
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:25,520
THAT'S OKAY, DEAN.
WE'RE JUST RUNNING
A LITTLE BEHIND.

301
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,756
<i>- WE'LL BE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.
- I'LL JUST WAIT OUTSIDE.</i>

302
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,692
- HEY, DRAMA.
- DEAN.

303
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,362
<i>GOOD LUCK, MAN.
SORRY.</i>

304
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,164
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.
- HE'S TESTING TOO?

305
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:40,535
<i>- I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME.
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT DEAN, JOHN.</i>

306
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,738
- FUCKING SUPERMAN.
- HEY, YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

307
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:45,373
IT'S YOUR JOB TO LOSE.

308
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:51,379
OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

309
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:55,049
GOD, I HAVEN'T AUDITIONED
IN LIKE THREE YEARS.

310
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:00,154
( breathing heavily )

311
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:06,460
DO YOU GUYS MIND IF I
JUST STEP OUT FOR A SECOND?

312
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:08,563
WE'RE KIND OF ON
A TIGHT SCHEDULE.

313
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,265
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- HEY, JOHN.

314
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:14,569
- THAT'S A MELTDOWN.
- UH-HUH.

315
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,571
COME ON, JOHNNY, YOU'VE GOT
TO GET BACK IN THERE.

316
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:20,007
BRO, I CAN'T.
I THINK I'M HAVING
A HEART ATTACK.

317
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:23,678
JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ONLY HAVING
A PANIC ATTACK.

318
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:27,048
I'VE HAD 100 PANIC ATTACKS
IN MY LIFE, THIS ISN'T
A PANIC ATTACK.

319
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:29,217
<i>- JOHNNY.. - Vince.</i>

320
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:32,720
<i>- Yes, Johnny?
- I THINK I PEED MYSELF.</i>

321
00:14:32,754 --> 00:14:34,889
UH...

322
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:37,625
OKAY, JOHNNY,
I'M COMING TO GET YOU.

323
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:40,828
HURRY, BRO.

324
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:42,797
I'VE GOT TO GO.

325
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:45,933
SOMEONE'S RUNNING BEHIND.

326
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,102
- YEAH, I HAD
A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.
- OH, I DIDN'T KNOW.

327
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:50,171
- IT WAS A LAST MINUTE THING.
- EVERYTHING OKAY?

328
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:53,040
YEAH YEAH.
BUT IF HE CALLS, JUST PUT
IT RIGHT THROUGH, PLEASE.

329
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:55,776
SURE.  HERE ARE
YOUR OTHER MESSAGES.
ALSO, MY FRIEND RICKY CALLED.

330
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,745
HATE TO GET INVOLVED, BUT I
THINK SHE KIND OF LIKES YOU.

331
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,082
- OH, COOL.
- SO SHOULD I TELL HER
YOU'LL CALL HER?

332
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:03,651
YEAH, I'M GONNA BE TAKING
A BREAK FROM THE DATING
POOL FOR A WHILE.

333
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,687
- MURPHY GROUP, HEY.
- WHAT'S UP, SCOTT?

334
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:09,023
WHAT'S UP, MAMA?
SO I HEARD YOU HAD

335
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:10,491
A WILD PARTY NIGHT
AT VILLA.

336
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,927
OH YEAH?
HOW'D YOU HEAR THAT?

337
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:14,996
WELL, THE GIRL THAT YOU WERE
SUCKING FACE WITH, TARA,

338
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:17,832
I KNOW HER--
WELL, SOME FRIENDS OF MINE
ACTUALLY KNOW HER...

339
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:20,468
- WELL.
- I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

340
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:23,671
- SCOTT.
- YEAH?

341
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,375
WHAT DO YOUR FRIENDS
KNOW ABOUT HER?

342
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:30,111
UH, SHE'S NOT LIKE YOUR
GIRLFRIEND OR ANYTHING?

343
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:32,046
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE GIRL.

344
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,215
- WELL, YOU KNOW HER
A LITTLE BIT.
- WHAT DO I KNOW?

345
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:36,384
- I DON'T KNOW.
THE SAME THING I KNOW.
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

346
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:39,187
THAT SHE KEEPS IT MOVING.
SHE GETS AROUND.

347
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:41,455
SHE GETS AROUND?
SCOTT, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
HAVE YOU BEEN WITH HER?

348
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,491
NO, NOT MY STYLE.

349
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,793
- THE GIRL'S LIKE A PETRI DISH.
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

350
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:48,896
I KNOW THAT CLIFF CANTOR
AND RICK SALOMON DOUBLE
TEAMED HER

351
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:51,899
AT A PARTY A COUPLE
WEEKS AGO, WHICH IS NOT
EXCELLENT FOR YOU.

352
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:54,135
- JESUS.
- OH HEY, LISTEN.

353
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:57,138
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU LIKE HER,
YOU CAN CHANGE HER.

354
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,240
<i>A NICE BOY LIKE YOU CAN
REFORM A GIRL LIKE THAT.</i>

355
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:01,542
- YOU GOT TO GET
THE DOCTOR ON THE PHONE.
- VINCE JUST CALLED.

356
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,644
- HE'S ON HIS WAY TO
THE HOSPITAL WITH DRAMA.
- WHY?

357
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,479
HE THINKS DRAMA
HAD A HEART ATTACK.

358
00:16:05,514 --> 00:16:07,348
- OH MY GOD.
- THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY
TO CEDARS.

359
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:10,184
TEXT ME WHERE I'M GOING.

360
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:13,487
<i> I'VE BEEN UP
AND ON MY FEET </i>

361
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:15,690
<i> SINCE THE BREAK OF DAY </i>

362
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,526
<i> YOU'VE BEEN DOWN THE ROAD
THERE, BABY... </i>

363
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,461
( barking )

364
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,266
MELINDA.
MY LOVE, HOW ARE YOU?

365
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,302
ARI GOLD, LONG TIME.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

366
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:30,905
I HAVE A MEETING.
TV STUFF, BORING.
FUNNY RUNNING INTO YOU.

367
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,974
- I JUST SAW YOUR HUSBAND.
- REALLY?

368
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:36,844
YEAH, STILL NOT LOOKING
QUITE ALIVE ENOUGH TO
HAVE GOTTEN YOU.

369
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,746
UH-HUH.  HOW WAS
YOUR LITTLE REUNION?

370
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,715
- THERE'S STILL SOME
BITTERNESS THERE.
- I BET.

371
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,151
YEAH.  SO HAS HE SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT LATELY?

372
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,721
- ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT?
- ANYTHING ABOUT OUR
BITTERNESS?

373
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,757
UH, NO, ARI.
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT
YOU VERY OFTEN.

374
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,192
OH, COME ON, MELINDA.

375
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:53,694
YOU USED TO TALK ABOUT
ME VERY OFTEN BEFORE
YOU MET TERRANCE.

376
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:55,363
- WHAT IS THIS?
- WHAT?

377
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:57,131
DID YOU COME HERE
FOR A REASON?

378
00:16:57,165 --> 00:16:59,100
- YES I DID.
- THEN SPEAK.

379
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:02,103
TERRANCE CAME
TO ME THIS MORNING,
AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW,

380
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:04,672
BECAUSE HE WOULD LIKE
FOR ME TO BUY HIM OUT.

381
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:06,374
I DIDN'T KNOW.

382
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:08,709
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.
BUT I KNOW YOU KNOW.

383
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:11,345
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, ARI.

384
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,415
MELINDA, COME ON.
WE HAD A MOMENT
OF FLIRTATION.

385
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,451
I'M SORRY IF YOU'RE
BITTER ALSO BECAUSE I
CHOSE MY WIFE OVER YOU.

386
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,888
BUT I REPRESENTED YOUR TALENPRE.

387
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:22,757
REVISIONIST HISTORY, ARI.

388
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,426
YOU CHOSE YOUR WIFE
OVER ME 'CAUSE YOU
COULDN'T GET ME.

389
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,329
AND YOU REPRESENTED ME
OVER HER 'CAUSE I HAD
MORE TALENT.

390
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,799
LINE UP OUR RESUMES,
I THINK MOST WOULD AGREE.

391
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:35,803
MELINDA, I KNOW HOW MUCH
TERRANCE TRUSTS YOU.

392
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:38,239
NOW IF YOU GUYS WANT OUT,
I'IN.

393
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:41,042
BUT I GOT YOU YOUR FIRST JOB,
SO DON'T LET ME BE PLAYED.

394
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:43,711
HONEY, YOU KNOW
YOU NEVER GET PLAYED.

395
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:45,846
AND ALL I'LL TELL YOU
IS THIS--

396
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:47,849
<i>I'M NO LONGER ON THE INSIDE.</i>

397
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:50,184
LOOK UP A 25-YEAR-OLD
D-CUP NAMED KELSEY.

398
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:52,687
- MAYBE SHE CAN HELP.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

399
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:55,857
I MEAN MY HUSBAND
IS A LYING SCUMBAG

400
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,492
AND I HAD NO IDEA
HE WAS TRYING TO SELL

401
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,528
UNTIL RIGHT NOW.

402
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:04,165
SO YOU HIRED
EDDIE KAPOWSKI?

403
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,834
I'M LATE FOR MY
POLE DANCING CLASS, ARI.

404
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:13,808
GUESS I'M REALLY GOING.

405
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,110
YEAH.

406
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:19,347
YOU'RE SO STRONG.
NO TEARS AT ALL.

407
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:21,782
I'M A GUY.
WE DON'T CRY.

408
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:24,519
NOT EVEN ON REALLY SAD
OCCASIONS?

409
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:26,654
I'M CRYING ON THE INSIDE.

410
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,596
TURTLE, I'VE BEEN
THINKING A LOT ABOUT

411
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:39,433
THIS WHOLE SEPARATION
AND THE FACEBOOK THING.

412
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:41,269
YOU'VE BEEN THINKING
SINCE LUNCH?

413
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:43,871
I GUESS BEFORE THAT TOO.

414
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:47,041
IT'S WHY I GOT
SO UPSET.

415
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:49,310
I MADE THIS DECISION
TO LEAVE

416
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:51,846
AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF ME.

417
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,514
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

418
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,950
IF YOU WANT TO SEE
OTHER PEOPLE WHILE
I'M GONE, I UNDERSTAND.

419
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:59,153
- I DON'T WANT
TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE.
- YOU SAY THAT NOW.

420
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:02,123
- JAMIE.
- TURTLE, I SWEAR THIS
IS NOT A PUNISHMENT.

421
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:05,193
I JUST THINK
IT'S THE RIGHT THING.

422
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,794
YOU DROP THIS ON ME
WHILE WE'RE AT THE AIRPORT?

423
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:09,864
I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T WANT
YOU TO END UP HATING ME.

424
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,400
JAMIE, I COULD
NEVER HATE YOU.

425
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:17,271
- I'VE GOT TO GO.
- JAMIE.

426
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:20,007
IS THIS 'CAUSE
I DIDN'T CRY?

427
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:22,076
NO.

428
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:32,220
THIS IS BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

429
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:48,369
WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE
I'M GONNA CHANGE EVERYTHING
ABOUT MY LIFE--

430
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:49,871
WHAT I EAT, WHAT I DRINK.

431
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:52,073
WHO YOU BANG.
I KNOW I'M GONNA
CHANGE THAT.

432
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,775
- LET'S HOPE I C  STILL BAN.
- YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

433
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,811
DRAMA, WHAT DID TARA GIVE YOU?
YOU NEVER SAID.

434
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:58,913
I'M DYING OVER HERE
AND YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU?

435
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,182
SORRY.

436
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:05,253
- DO YOU ITCH AT ALL?
- NO.

437
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:10,057
- HELLO, JOHN.
- HEY, DOC.

438
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:12,860
HOW AM I LOOKING?
AM I EVER GONNA GET
OUT OF HERE?

439
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:15,229
- YOU ARE FREE TO GO.
- THANK GOD.

440
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:18,533
- IT WAS JUST A PANIC ATTACK?
- NO, IT WAS A LITTLE MORE
SERIOUS THAN THAT.

441
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:20,468
- I TOLD YOU.
- SO WHAT IS IT?

442
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:22,470
TAKOTSUBO CARDIOMYOPATHY.

443
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:24,906
ITS SYMPTOMS MIMIC
A HEART ATTACK

444
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,308
BUT ARE BROUGHT ON BY
REAL-LIFE EMOTIONAL STRESS.

445
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:30,011
- YOU HAVE ANY OF THAT?
- TONS.

446
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:33,314
IT'S OFTEN MISDIAGNOSED.
FORTUNATELY IN HOLLYWOOD,
WE SEE IT A LOT.

447
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:35,750
THOUGH NINE TIMES OUT OF 10
IT'S SEEN IN WOMEN.

448
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,785
- IN WOMEN?
- SO WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO DO?

449
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,688
RELAX.  I'M GONNA GIVE HIM
SOME MEDICATION TO HELP.

450
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:43,591
THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE COULD
BRING ON A REAL HEART ATTACK.

451
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,626
FORTUNATELY THIS TIME
IT DIDN'T.

452
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,595
- THANKS, DOC.
- TAKE CARE, GUYS.

453
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:49,764
OH, LOVED "GATSBY," VINCE.

454
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:51,666
<i>- THANKS.
- THANKS, DOC.</i>

455
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,202
SEE, JOHNNY?
YOU'RE ALL GOOD.

456
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:55,903
I'M NOT ALL GOOD
AT ALL, BRO.

457
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:57,438
LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE
TO MYSELF.

458
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:58,839
YOU HAD A LOT
RIDING ON THIS.

459
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:00,875
WE'LL MAKE A COUPLE CALLS.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

460
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:03,411
- ( phone rings )
- GREAT, IT'S MY DOCTOR.

461
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:05,179
WELL, ANSWER IT.
YOU'LL BE FINE TOO.

462
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:07,481
HELLO.

463
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,250
SPEAKING.

464
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:11,285
OKAY.

465
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,154
<i>YEAH.</i>

466
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,290
OKAY.
BYE.

467
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:18,526
- WELL?
- THEY DON'T GIVE
RESULTS OVER THE PHONE.

468
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:20,828
- I'VE GOT TO GO
IN TO THE OFFICE.
- WANT ME TO ROLL WITH?

469
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,831
I'M FINE.
I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU GUYS LATER.

470
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,200
I'VE GOT TO CALL LLOYD.

471
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:29,303
WE HAVE MUCH TO BE THANKFUL
FOR TODAY, JOHNNY DRAMA.

472
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:31,439
- OH YEAH, WHAT?
- I SPOKE TO PHIL YAGOTA.

473
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,207
<i>- Yeah?
- AND HE'S GONNA
SEE YOU AGAIN.</i>

474
00:21:33,242 --> 00:21:35,610
REALLY?
THEY'RE GONNA SEE ME AGAIN.

475
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:36,911
- THAT'S GREAT.
- HOW?

476
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:38,646
I'M A MIRACLE WORKER.

477
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,682
YOU MAY NEED A NOTE
FROM YOUR DOCTOR THAT SAYS
THIS WAS IN FACT REAL.

478
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,086
WAS IT REAL?
AND TWO, YOU MAY NEED
TO PASS A PHYSICAL.

479
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,523
BUT YOU'RE STILL ALIVE,
JOHNNY DRAMA, BOTH LITERALLY
AND FIGURATIVELY.

480
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:52,159
LOOK, TELL HIM I SAID
THANKS BUT NO THANKS.

481
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:54,795
WHAT WHAT WHAT?

482
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,831

I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA DIE
TODAY, AND FOR WHAT?

483
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:58,799
"MELROSE PLACE
THE NEXT GENERATION"?

484
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:02,436
JOHNNY, YOU GOT OUT OF
YOUR "FIVE TOWNS" CONTRACT
FOR THIS.

485
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:04,505
YEAH WELL, MAYBE IT
WAS MEANT TO BE.

486
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,607
I'M GONNA TAKE SOME TIME
AND REASSESS.

487
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:09,277
<i>- REASSESS WHAT?
- My life.</i>

488
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:11,679
I STRONGLY ADVISE
AGAINST THIS, JOHNNY.

489
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:15,016
YOU TAKE ANOTHER BREAK
FROM THE SPOTLIGHT, YOU COULD
VERY WELL BE GONE FOR GOOD.

490
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,851
I HAD A REAL WAKE-UP
CALL TODAY, LLOYD.

491
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:19,053
<i>- Johnny...
- I'LL BE IN TOUCH.</i>

492
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:23,391
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

493
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,760
NO.

494
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:28,095
BUT FOR NOW
IT FEELS RIGHT.

495
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,731
SICK, TWISTED,
DEMENTED ACTORS.

496
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,233
WHY DID I EVER GET
INTO THIS BUSINESS?

497
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,635
- LLOYD, LLOYD.
- WHAT? WHAT?

498
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,571
ARI GOLD IS HEADING
UP THE ELEVATOR.

499
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,606
OH GOOD GOD!

500
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:41,375
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ME.

501
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,811
<i> IT'S ME, BITCHES... </i>

502
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:48,883
- ARI?
- WHERE'S TERRANCE?

503
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,285
CONFERENCE ROOM.

504
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:56,090
<i>Terrance:
...WHERE WE'VE REALLY
FALLEN BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL</i>

505
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,658
IS IN REALITY--

506
00:22:57,693 --> 00:22:59,994
I'M SORRY,
ARE YOU GUYS BUSY?

507
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:02,129
WHAT IS THIS, ARI?

508
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:06,033
AND I WANTED TO AN UNANNOUNCED
RETURN THE FAVOR.

509
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:09,070
- THIS IS NOT VERY DISCREET.
- I HATE DISCRETION.

510
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:11,973
I WANT TO PUT
MY CARDS ON THE TABLE.
ANYONE WANT TO SEE THEM?

511
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:15,176
EVERYONE, GET OUT.
QUICKLY.

512
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:24,452
- SO YOU'VE RECONSIDERED?
- I HAVE.

513
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,655
- BUT NOT FOR 100.
- DO YOU HAVE AN OFFER?

514
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:29,657
I DO.

515
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:40,535
- WHAT'S THIS?
- IT'S A VAGINA.
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

516
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:42,503
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS?

517
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:45,406
IT MEANS THAT I'M AMAZED
THAT IT'S TAKEN YOU THIS LONG,

518
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,377
BUT ONCE AGAIN YOU HAVE
LET A VAGINA GET YOU
INTO TROUBLE.

519
00:23:49,378 --> 00:23:51,212
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, ARI?

520
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:54,315
I THINK YOU KNOW.
YOU AND I HAVE ALWAYS
UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER

521
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,218
WITHOUT SAYING TOO MUCH.
THAT'S WHY WE WERE
SO GOOD TOGETHER.

522
00:23:57,219 --> 00:24:00,621
BUT YOU FUCKED ME
AND NOW YOU'VE FUCKED
SOMEONE ELSE.

523
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:01,956
AND NOW I'M GONNA
FUCK YOU.

524
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,691
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
THINK YOU KNOW.

525
00:24:03,725 --> 00:24:05,793
WELL, I KNOW YOU
GOT BUSTED AGAIN.

526
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:09,197
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO SELL THIS COMPANY IN THE
MIDDLE OF AN UGLY DIVORCE.

527
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:11,699
ESPECIALLY WITH MELINDA.
SHE'S TOUGH.

528
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:14,268
MELINDA AND I ARE GREAT,
THANK YOU.

529
00:24:14,303 --> 00:24:16,237
HOW ARE YOU AND KELSEY?

530
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:19,874
THAT STUPID BITCH
TOLD YOU?

531
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:22,710
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF A FUCKING PRENUP?

532
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,947
- OH, YOU HAVE ONE?
- I'D KILL MY WIFE BEFORE
I GOT A DIVORCE.

533
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:29,217
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING:
THIS IS MY FIRST MARRIAGE,
NOT MY FOURTH.

534
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:32,086
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU
WANT TO MAKE A DEAL.

535
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:34,755
NOW IF YOU THINK YOU'RE
GONNA LOWBALL ME, NO.

536
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,226
EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN
IS GONNA LOWBALL YOU ONCE THEY
FIND OUT YOU'RE DESPERATE.

537
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,629
I'M NOT DESPERATE.
I JUST DON'T WANT A BATTLE.

538
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:43,698
- 65.
- 85.

539
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,000
THAT'S MY DROP DEAD NUMBER.
NOT A DOLLAR LESS.

540
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:47,802
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW.

541
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:49,704
<i>OTHERWISE I'LL OPEN
IT UP TO BIDDING.</i>

542
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,672
AND YOU'LL OPEN YOURSELF
UP TO HUMILIATION.

543
00:24:51,707 --> 00:24:53,674
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE
ON A BEACH SOMEWHERE

544
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,878
WHEN NIKKI FINKE STARTS
FLASHING PICTURES OF YOU
TRYING TO GET YOUR DICK HARD?

545
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,715
I'LL FUCK NIKKI FINKE
BEFORE I LET HER AFFECT
MY BUSINESS DECISIONS.

546
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,084
- 85, ARI.
- I'LL GIVE YOU 75.

547
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:05,753
PROVIDED THAT AFTER
I DO MY DUE DILIGENCE,

548
00:25:05,787 --> 00:25:08,189
I DON'T FIND OUT THAT
YOU SCREWED UP EVERYTHING
I DID HERE.

549
00:25:08,223 --> 00:25:10,591
<i>YES OR NO?</i>

550
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:13,694
HAVE THE PAPERS DRAWN UP.

551
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:15,696
CIAO.

552
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:21,802
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW?

553
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:24,772
HEY, LLOYD.
IF YOU'RE HIDING SOMEWHERE,

554
00:25:24,806 --> 00:25:28,442
GO DEEPER BECAUSE I WILL
FIND YOU SOON ENOUGH.

555
00:25:41,924 --> 00:25:44,292
( sobbing )

556
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:52,533
- MR. MURPHY.
- YEAH.

557
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:00,308
IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.

558
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:03,744
THE WORLD'S A CRAZY PLACE.
YOU GOT TO SEARCH FOR
WHAT IT'S TELLING YOU.

559
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,414
- WOULD YOU GET OFF ME?
- SORRY.

560
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:09,250
SHE'S JUST FREAKED IS ALL.
GIVE HER SOME TIME
TO SETTLE IN.

561
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:11,385
<i>- SHE'LL CALL.
- YO.</i>

562
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,088
YO, ITCHY.
WHAT'S UP?

563
00:26:14,122 --> 00:26:16,924
UNLIKE YOU, DRAMA,
I STILL HAVE A DISEASE-
FREE TRACK RECORD.

564
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,659
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS, E.

565
00:26:18,694 --> 00:26:19,994
STILL NOT REALLY WHAT
I WOULD CALL A GOOD DAY.

566
00:26:20,062 --> 00:26:22,230
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
THE WORST DAY?

567
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:24,432
- JAMIE BROKE IT OFF.
- WHAT?

568
00:26:24,466 --> 00:26:27,268
SHE DIDN'T BREAK IT OFF.
SHE TOLD ME TO SEE
OTHER PEOPLE.

569
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:30,404
- I SAY YOU EMBRACE IT.
- DON'T DO IT, TURTLE.

570
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,839
LOS ANGELES IS A CESSPOOL.

571
00:26:31,874 --> 00:26:34,041
I SCREWED UP.
I WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH.

572
00:26:34,076 --> 00:26:36,777
- SHE WAS TESTING
ME AND I FAILED.
- DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

573
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,479
NO, REALLY.
I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED HER.

574
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,214
ALL DAY LONG SHE WAS SAYING
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO.

575
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,283
IF SHE DIDN'T WANT TO
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE.

576
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:43,918
NOW YOU GOT TO START
THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF.

577
00:26:43,952 --> 00:26:47,355
I HAVE NO SELF.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO
I AM WITHOUT JAMIE.

578
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:48,956
I'M GONNA PUKE.

579
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:51,292
OKAY, WE NEED TO GO
OUT AND HAVE SOME FUN.

580
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:53,227
FIND SOME NICE CLEAN GIRLS.

581
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:55,696
- NOT ME, I'M DONE.
- E'S GONE CELIBATE.

582
00:26:55,731 --> 00:26:58,332
- NO, I'M GONNA GET SLOAN BACK.
- E, YOU HAD A LITTLE SCARE.

583
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,068
NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
I HATE DATING.

584
00:27:01,103 --> 00:27:03,938
I WANT TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP.
I WANT TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH SLOAN.

585
00:27:03,972 --> 00:27:05,339
E, SHE SAID
SHE DIDN'T WANT YOU.

586
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,141
WELL, TOUGH SHIT.
SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO TAKE ME.

587
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:08,843
- ( laughs )
- ( phone chimes )

588
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,412
U.C.L.A. GIRL WANTS TO KNOW
WHY WE'RE NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE.

589
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:13,314
- YOU GONNA CALL HER?
- NOPE.

590
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:15,416
- CALLING JAMIE.
- SHE JUST LEFT.

591
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,084
I'LL LEAVE HER A MESSAGE.

592
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,154
GUYS, I'M LEAVING
IN A WEEK TOO, YOU KNOW?

593
00:27:20,189 --> 00:27:22,823
FOR FOUR MONTHS.
I'D LIKE TO HAVE
A LITTLE FUN.

594
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:25,526
I'M FREE TO CHASE
PUSS WITH YOU, BRO.

595
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,164
COME ON.

<i> YOU CAN TAKE A BLIND SOUL

612
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:28,422
<i> YOU CAN TAKE A BROKEN HEART
AND MAKE IT GO AGAIN </i>

613
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,125
<i> OR YOU CAN BREAK HIS HEART
AND MAKE HIM LESS THAN A MAN </i>

614
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:33,895
<i> YOU CAN MAKE A MAN
FEEL LIKE A KING </i>

615
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:36,364
<i> LET ME HEAR YOU SAY LADIES. </i>
