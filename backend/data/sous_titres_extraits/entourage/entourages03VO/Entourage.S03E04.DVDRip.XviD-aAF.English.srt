1
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,276
Try this, motherfucker.

2
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,798
Who died?

3
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,273
No one yet.

4
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,993
- What?
- Looks like I woke you up this time?

5
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,554
No, but you did wake
my wife and kids, dickhead.

6
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,478
Vinnie better be sitting in prison
with a DUI or something.

7
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,795
- No.
- Then what do you want, cunt muscle?

8
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,989
Sorry about the family.

9
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,076
- Speak.
- It's Monday morning,

10
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,793
we have the number one movie,
and you promised us offers.

11
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,512
There will be offers.

12
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,472
Be in my office at 11:30
and you'll hear all about 'em.

13
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,919
- Nice.
- Oh, and, E?

14
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,520
You have to get up
a lot earlier than this to wake me.

15
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,835
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,836
Cunt muscle?

17
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,269
- Why hurry?
- You don't want to be late for Ari.

18
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,276
- Not on a big day like today.
- Seriously,

19
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,517
they're gonna be offering
you everything under the sun. Get in.

20
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,915
- Shut the door.
- Start the car, Turtle.

21
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,190
- Let's go.
- Yo, cocksuckers, wait up.

22
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,629
- Fuck!
- I see.

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,796
So I'm not getting everything
under the sun?

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,193
Out, Turtle.

25
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,836
- When is this nightmare gonna end?
- It's not gonna, so get used to it.

26
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,552
Sorry I overslept, boss.

27
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,636
- So where to? The Jew agent?
- Whoa, Dom!

28
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,353
- You don't talk like that.
- They frown upon "Jew"?

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,878
Seems you got a lot of problems
with how I carry myself, E.

30
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,070
Just trying to help you avoid new problems.

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,033
What kind of new problems? I'm not
the same old Dommy. I'm a new Dom.

32
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,469
I've been rehabilitated
by the State of New York.

33
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,511
And if they believe in me, so should you.

34
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,596
Come on, Vinnie, you're making bank.

35
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,312
You can't get your boy a whole shirt?

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,316
- You talking to me?
- Take it easy.

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,874
I don't want you to excite my man.
He likes bad boys.

38
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,990
Aren't you, Lloyd?

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,348
Not.

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,391
Come on in, boys.

41
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,237
If the Oriental even looks at me,
I'm taking him down.

42
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,840
Hey, Dom, you're out here with us.

43
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,393
- Right, Ari?
- You know what?

44
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,433
Today only, I'm gonna open up my doors
like Ellis fucking Island. Come on in.

45
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,632
Bedraggled wretched crew,
watch me work my magic.

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,831
- He must have something good.
- He must have something great.

47
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,440
Flight. Dead Poet's Society in space.

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,711
Character-driven, great script,
Darren Aronofsky is directing.

49
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,479
They're offering you $8 million.

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,679
The Sandman. You are a retard
at a Red Cross tent in the Sahara.

51
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,075
It's Being There meets Lawrence of Arabia.

52
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,908
David O Russell's directing,
they're offering you $9 million.

53
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,269
Take it, Vin.

54
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,073
We got a stack of great ones just like those.

55
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,712
- So what's the point, Ari?
- The point is they all want our boy,

56
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,514
- but what our boy wants, we gotta work for.
- What do I want?

57
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,598
Is this what goes on in here?

58
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,108
The line starts behind me, motherfuckers.

59
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,116
This ain't blow. It's powdered cream.

60
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,754
- What the fuck is going on?
- Yeah, what's up?

61
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,836
We're going to the coke capital of the world.

62
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,836
- Medellin.
- Medellin?

63
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,111
Boom! You'll play Pablo Escobar,
like you wanted.

64
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,957
- I thought that script was dead.
- It was.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,390
Then Phil Rubenstein gave it CPR.
He saw Aquaman, and he loved it.

66
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,873
Holy shit!

67
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,911
- Who's Phil Rubenstein?
- He's the animation king,

68
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,757
made like $600 trillion.

69
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,791
Made like, Madagascar and Shrek.

70
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,274
And now he wants to work
with real people, and he loves you.

71
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,753
- That's great!
- That's not all.

72
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,438
Paul Haggis is directing it.

73
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,436
First thing since he crashed the Oscars.

74
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,517
- Paul Haggis?
- He loves you too. Only one problem,

75
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,757
- we gotta get Phil Rubenstein to say yes.
- How do we do that?

76
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,678
We go to Santa Barbara
and we charm his pants off.

77
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,915
He's gonna throw a kickoff party
for his new cult wine,

78
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,632
- and he invited us.
- Us?

79
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,829
I do know my wines.

80
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,111
I have to clear it with my parole officer
if I'm going across county lines.

81
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,515
- Can the boys come?
- They can come. He needs sleeves.

82
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,275
Tell this guy he can show you the money
or tell him he can suck your dick.

83
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,675
Dom, it's a little
more complicated than that.

84
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,712
The agent told Vince
he has multimillions in offers waiting.

85
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,797
But you're making him beg.
Hope you don't think I'm out of line.

86
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,831
Not at all,
you're making some good points.

87
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,677
Thanks, Vince.

88
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,435
How good is this shirt gonna look on me?

89
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,277
Not as good as it already looks on me.

90
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,235
Too slow to the draw, hombre.

91
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,872
You can change now.

92
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,116
- He's making good points?
- Tell Ari I'm not going to Santa Barbara.

93
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,231
Vince, this is the movie we wanted to do.

94
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,398
It's a chance for you to act, get away
from the bluescreen. This is our Scarface.

95
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,637
Tell him to make an offer.
Cos I ain't kissing no fucking ass, man.

96
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,398
Are you serious?

97
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,874
No. You know I'd kill to do this movie.

98
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,309
But you said you were gonna try
and get along with Dom.

99
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,318
I'm trying, but he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

100
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,070
I'm trying to get him on his feet. Let him spin
his wheels a little. It'll build his confidence.

101
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,351
- Will you just help me do that, please?
- OK.

102
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,914
We gotta leave
if we wanna beat Santa Barbara traffic.

103
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,157
Don't worry about the traffic, Turtle.
I've arranged for us to skip it.

104
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,553
Really?

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,719
You know, sitting here in this expensive suit,

106
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,830
flying in this expensive helicopter,

107
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,440
going to an expensive guy's house,

108
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,872
I finally feel like I made something of my life.

109
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,751
Thanks, Vince.

110
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,917
I'd feel the same fucking way
if I was wearing that shirt.

111
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,353
Look at this. This guy can make you
a $10 million offer, no problem.

112
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,391
Once he hangs with Vince for five minutes,

113
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,032
- that's what he'll do.
- Exactly.

114
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,868
Vince, being charming
is all about body language, bro.

115
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,512
Vince knows how to charm, Drama.

116
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,075
Yeah, women, but man charm
is a totally different animal.

117
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,159
You gotta get in close enough to entice
but not so close as to encroach.

118
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,350
Let's forget kissing-the-ring bullshit

119
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,075
and I get close to this guy while you're
talking to him? Apply a little pressure.

120
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,157
No, Dom. It'd be really great if you don't talk
to Rubenstein at all.

121
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,159
I didn't say I was gonna talk.
I won't say a word. I'll just stare like this.

122
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,749
- You boys are looking sharp.
- Thanks, Ari.

123
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,598
- I meant the other boys.
- Which one's Rubensteinberg, Ari?

124
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,598
It's Rubenstein, and please,
don't try to pronounce it again.

125
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,437
Vinnie, let's go get us a gig.

126
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,755
Hey, Vince, remember.

127
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,392
Not too close.

128
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,239
Any hard alcohol in this place?

129
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,319
Cos the pruno I made in the joint
tastes better than this shit.

130
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,390
This wine is great, Phil.

131
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,795
- Congratulations.
- I'm glad you like it, Vince.

132
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,831
And I just screened Aquaman
and you were great.

133
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,839
Thanks. I just saw Madagascar
with my nephew and that was really great.

134
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,279
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

135
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,278
If you have any open animals in the sequel
I'd love to be involved.

136
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,880
Great. What animal
could you see yourself playing?

137
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,548
I don't know. A cheetah maybe?

138
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,795
A cheetah. That's great.

139
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,479
Great. You're both great. Let's make a deal.

140
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,080
Ari, could you leave Vince with me for a bit?

141
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,633
Yeah.

142
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,798
Great. Come on, Vince. I'll show you the vines
where I handpick my pinots.

143
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,914
I get toffee, mocha...

144
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,750
...and a hint of terra firma.

145
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,756
Terra firma is dirt, Drama.

146
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,712
Yeah, well, wine comes from dirt, E.

147
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,194
I gotta take a leak. I'll be back.

148
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,357
It smells like lead pencils to me.
What does it smell like to you?

149
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,790
- Don't stick a glass in my face, Turtle.
- What's with the attitude?

150
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,196
- Vince will be fine.
- They've been out there for 20 minutes.

151
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,310
I'm sure Vince is just charming his ass off.

152
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,954
It's just a matter of time
before he locks the deal.

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
As long as Dom don't fuck it up. Look.

154
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,194
- Oh, fuck.
- Jesus.

155
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,511
It's nice to see you still have
your childhood friends around you.

156
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,074
Kid never forgot where he came from,
never went Hollywood.

157
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,156
Except I think he tweezes
his eyebrowses now.

158
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,514
Dom, let's go get a drink.

159
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,551
- I got a drink, E.
- They're free.

160
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,397
- Come on, all right?
- It's OK, Ari.

161
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,637
Talking to Dom, I get a real sense
who Vince is and where he came from.

162
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,150
I'm sure Phil hung out with some crazy guys
back where he's from.

163
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,590
Of course. In fact, I had
a childhood friend in Great Neck

164
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,315
whose family was Jewish mafia.

165
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,996
The best kind.

166
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,670
How would you like to hear a story that will
sum up exactly who Vince is, Phil?

167
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,153
I'd love to.

168
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,113
About ten years ago, me and Vince
were out at some dive bar in Queens

169
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,196
and he hooks up with this hot piece of ass.

170
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,708
As usual. And he blows out.

171
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,399
Me, I stay, I get zonked out of my mind,

172
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,431
I stumble out into the middle of the street

173
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,040
and I see my fucking car's been stolen.

174
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,071
I don't know what to do, so I call the fuzz,

175
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,999
I fill out all the paperwork, but it's 40 below
and I'm freezing my balls off.

176
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,634
So I ask 'em, "Can I stay
in the back of the squad car?"

177
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,832
They say, "Yeah, sure, no problem."
I'm sitting there, Phil, for 20 minutes

178
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,996
when it fucking hits me -

179
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,230
I didn't drive. My car wasn't stolen,
it was parked at my house.

180
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,191
Funny story. Let me ask you, Phil...

181
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,471
That's not the funny part.
Here's the funny part, Phil.

182
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,511
Cops run a check on my registration.

183
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,279
It comes back I got three bench warrants
out for my arrest.

184
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,311
That's it. They got me.

185
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,999
I'm already locked
in the back seat of their car.

186
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,828
Fucking idiot I am, I turn myself in by accident.

187
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,478
- That's hysterical, Dom.
- And touching.

188
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,750
Cos I call Vince up,
three in the morning,

189
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,951
and the kid busts open his piggy bank
and bails my ass out.

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,356
And the best part?
The hot broad that he had with him

191
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,790
had a good-looking sister. Right, Vince?

192
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,868
Still to this day, Phil, the best lay I ever had.
That's the kind of guy Vince is.

193
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,753
He's a brother to me, and I love him.

194
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,310
- To friendship.
- There we go.

195
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,476
Now you've said something there.

196
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,558
You mad I told that story, E?

197
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,034
- No, it was a good story.
- Great story.

198
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,311
Except it was me that bailed you out
and picked up the two hot sisters.

199
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,828
What? What were you drinking tonight?

200
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,709
Paging Mr Escobar.

201
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,150
- Mr Pablo Escobar.
- Don't fuck with me, Ari.

202
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,111
You're gonna get an offer in the morning.

203
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,513
- Are you sure?
- I am sure.

204
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,471
- Thank you!
- Thank you, Vinnie.

205
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,080
Rubenstein said he could tell
that you're a street kid.

206
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,519
Thanks to Dom's story.

207
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,915
- Come on, man.
- Dom, you did a good job.

208
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,757
- Tell him, E.
- Nope.

209
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,677
Great job, Dom. Come here!

210
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,031
Going to Colombia, baby!

211
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,273
I'm getting used to him,
but could we soundproof his room?

212
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,788
You got it, Turtle.

213
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,994
- So we got an offer?
- No, we got a problem.

214
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,474
Don't tell me that, Ari. You said you were sure.

215
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,114
I was. Just got off the phone
with Rubenstein's people.

216
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,515
Somebody robbed his house
at the party last night.

217
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,516
- What?
- Stole the original Shrek doll

218
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,870
right out of its apparently
impossible-to-break-into case.

219
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,353
- Jesus.
- Cops are all over it.

220
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,393
E, if this comes up smelling bad for us,
you can kiss Bogotá goodbye.

221
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,830
- Why would it come up bad for us?
- I'm thinking about your new housemate.

222
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,873
- Ari, there were 300 people there.
- 299 of them didn't serve time!

223
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,911
- That's a big accusation.
- I'm not making it.

224
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,952
But when Rubenstein,
who is so distraught he can't get out of bed,

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,798
remembers Dom's little jailhouse stories,
he will.

226
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,195
- So what did they get?
- The original Shrek doll.

227
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,028
You can rule out Turtle.
He'd only take a doll he could fuck.

228
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,469
- They got any leads?
- No, but Ari thinks he does.

229
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,954
- Morning, fellas.
- Morning, Dom.

230
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,029
Hey, Vin, any way you could
spot me a couple of bucks?

231
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,072
I found this new service.
The broads are hotter but pricier.

232
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,553
No problem. On my dresser.

233
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,839
Be right back to season out
the blandness of Drama's cooking.

234
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,549
- E, No way.
- I don't want to point the finger,

235
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,160
but I'd like to be sure before
everyone else does.

236
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,270
We'll talk to him,
but there's no way.

237
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,511
Hey, you want us to sweep
the house for that doll? Just in case?

238
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,518
- No.
- Yes. Just in case.

239
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,753
Let me guess. I'm making
too much noise with the whores.

240
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,392
I can ask them to bring it down.

241
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,477
They fake those screams.
They're just for effects anyway.

242
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,873
The girls are fine, Dom.

243
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,029
So what's up?
You got me real nervous here.

244
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,072
Somebody robbed Rubenstein's
house last night,

245
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,873
- took something very valuable.
- And you think it was me?

246
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,356
- I hate asking.
- You are askin'. Or is E askin'?

247
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,516
We both hate asking,
but the cops are gonna ask

248
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,551
and we'd feel better if we spoke to you first.

249
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,910
Jesus Christ.
My past will always haunt me.

250
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,516
- I'm sorry, Dom.
- Nah, you shouldn't be.

251
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,518
Truth is, I have stolen. Plenty.

252
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,630
And I hurt lots of people in my lifetime.

253
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,350
But I didn't do this.

254
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,633
I mean, you guys know me
since I'm eight years old.

255
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,190
Have I ever done anything
to hurt either of you?

256
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,229
No.

257
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,556
And now that you've been so good to me,
and allowed me back into your home

258
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,151
like no time has passed,
why would I do this now?

259
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,837
- You believe me, right, Vin?
- I believe you, Dom.

260
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,189
Yeah, Dom. I believe you.

261
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,914
You're out of your fucking mind.

262
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,350
I played poker with this guy, he has
a worse tell than Malkovich in Rounders.

263
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,995
- Did you see him?
- I don't remember that.

264
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,998
- It's disgusting, stop!
- Vince, I'm telling you, he did it.

265
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,031
I'm telling you I don't think he did.

266
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,039
- Should we hit a titty bar?
- It's ten in the morning.

267
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,514
- I don't see shit.
- Yeah, me neither.

268
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,552
Now, put that stuff back the way it was.

269
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,433
Was the red shirt on top
or was the white?

270
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,473
You gotta be kidding me. I told you to
remember exactly what everything was like.

271
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,988
I forgot, OK?
So what do you suggest I do now?

272
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,268
- Throw those out.
- What?

273
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,878
Those two shirts, throw 'em out.

274
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,558
If he sees that things are out of order,

275
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,830
he's gonna think we were
snooping around in here.

276
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,269
But if it's just gone, the fuck's he gonna say?

277
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,834
- Brilliant.
- Just do it, Turtle, and keep looking.

278
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,632
Where? We looked everywhere.

279
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,072
Yo, they're coming, they're coming!

280
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,799
Don't be so panicky.

281
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,479
- We didn't do anything wrong.
- Did you find anything?

282
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,988
No, but I may have figured out a way

283
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,190
- to descramble the pay-per-view.
- For real?

284
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,798
- Yeah.
- Nice.

285
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,034
Fuck are you guys doing?

286
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,358
We were just checking out the plumbing.

287
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,233
- You find anything?
- No. All clear.

288
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,792
We gonna be able to get Spice?

289
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,673
It represents a turning point
in my life!

290
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,871
Phil, I understand you're upset.
I am upset for you, OK?

291
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,151
But you can't just go randomly
pointing a finger. This is America.

292
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,192
- My maid saw him upstairs, Ari.
- Maybe he had to use the bathroom.

293
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,277
Because there was a problem
with the ten I have downstairs?

294
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,596
Phil, I feel for your loss, I do.

295
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,676
But we can't go throwing away a huge movie

296
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,870
that's gonna be as special as Shrek someday

297
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,512
based on a hunch.

298
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,279
A hunch got me to drop out of
law school against my family's wishes.

299
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,914
And I have a hunch now
that I know who did this.

300
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,794
I don't even care about catching him.
I just want my doll back!

301
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,628
Come on, we'll make a Pablo Escobar doll
and put it in Shrek's place.

302
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,678
- The doll or Medellin?
- The doll or Medellin.

303
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,678
- Well, we don't have the doll.
- Then you don't have Medellin.

304
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,756
Do you think I'm hiding the fucking thing?

305
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,712
What I think is that
you guys have got blinders on.

306
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,435
I think you grew up in a place where it's OK
to accuse anyone who didn't go to Harvard.

307
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,835
I grew up in a place
where if you're accused of something,

308
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,871
chances are you've done something wrong.

309
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,434
Vince doesn't think he did it,
so what do you want me to say?

310
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,152
Tell me if you think he did it.

311
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,238
- So you do.
- That doesn't matter. We need proof.

312
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,272
Oh, is that all?
Well, why don't we go get some?

313
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,199
I only brought five shirts with me
and two of them are gone.

314
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,073
- Can't help you, Dom.
- 40% of my wardrobe goes missing

315
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,759
- and you guys don't know dick about it?
- Nope.

316
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,558
They don't wear your size, Dom.

317
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,159
Hey, what's going on?

318
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,998
What's going on is
we know Dom took the doll.

319
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,554
- I got proof.
- Fuck you, you don't got shit.

320
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,275
Listen, you return the doll
and everything will be forgiven, OK?

321
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,038
There's nothing to forgive cos I don't got it.

322
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,277
- What proof do you have?
- Security tapes from Rubenstein's house.

323
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,835
You think the guy's got a billion dollars
and doesn't have cameras everywhere?

324
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,472
The jig is up, baby.

325
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,914
- He's bluffing.
- Am I?

326
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,076
I didn't steal it, so I can't be on that tape.

327
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,271
- I'm gonna press play.
- Press it.

328
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,880
If I'm on there
I'll suck your cock on Rodeo Drive.

329
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,434
But if I'm not, I'm gonna
crack open your fuckin' head.

330
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,630
- Either way, I lose.
- Either way you lose,

331
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,036
- so fuckin' press the button.
- All right, you ready?

332
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,351
Jesus, Ari. What the fuck is wrong with you?

333
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,833
Any shots of us at the bat mitzvah?

334
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,518
- I'll fuckin' kill him!
- Easy!

335
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,030
Put Shrek back in his cage!
I did this to save your ass.

336
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,514
- Get the fuck out.
- Everyone knows he did it.

337
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,997
- This is the worst thing you've ever done.
- I'll call you later. I'm leaving on my own.

338
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,315
- Hey, Vince.
- Fuck you too, Eric.

339
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,032
- And fuck you guys.
- What did we do?

340
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,275
Dom's our boy since we were kids.

341
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,357
Have we gone so Hollywood
we forget how to treat family?

342
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,639
Fuck this movie, E.

343
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,113
In fact, fuck Hollywood.

344
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,233
I would rather be working at the Dairy Barn
than to listen to people accuse my boy.

345
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,876
You know why? Cos I know Dom would never
intentionally do anything to fuck me over.

346
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,078
You know, don't you?

347
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,872
- I do now.
- Know what?

348
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,399
- How?
- You scratched your neck

349
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,032
when you told Ari he was bluffing.

350
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,991
- Really?
- That was his tell in cards,

351
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,031
not that stupid shit you keep doing.

352
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,072
- I feel like shit about this.
- Where the fuck is it, Dom?

353
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,479
- I knew we needed a strip-search.
- You knew you wanted a strip-search.

354
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,073
- You could have cost Vince this movie.
- I didn't mean to.

355
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,396
- Why did you do it?
- I seen Shrek like 400 times in the joint,

356
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,749
cos you can't watch adult content.

357
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,791
And when I saw it, I just grabbed it.

358
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,831
I was gonna put it back,
I swear to my mother,

359
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,872
but this maid kept looking at me
the whole night like she knew.

360
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,388
Thought about taking her out to protect you.

361
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,319
But then I thought it was just best to deny.
No excuses.

362
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,237
But I am sorry.

363
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,511
Yeah, I'm sorry too, Dom.

364
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,074
- I'm gonna go see if I can catch Ari.
- I'd wash that.

365
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,271
That little monster spent the night
inside the most unsavoury woman.

366
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,639
Jesus. Here, put that in the sink.

367
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,275
And I wouldn't call Ari.
I wouldn't even return it. No body, no crime.

368
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,311
He said we return the doll and we're all good.

369
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,112
It's the oldest trick in the book.

370
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,755
You'll return it, they'll slap the cuffs on me
and take the movie.

371
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,075
- He's right.
- Yeah, you're right.

372
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,078
That's the best career advice
you've ever given, Dom.

373
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,473
I got an idea.

374
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,550
Come on, admit it.
You miss him a little.

375
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,909
- A very little.
- He's only at the Oakwoods.

376
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,474
A Hummer and an apartment.
That's not a bad severance package.

377
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,192
No, not bad at all.

378
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,229
This is it.

379
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,391
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- No, I'll do it. I got the better arm.

380
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,479
Please.

381
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,273
Afternoon, Lloyd.

382
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,390
He's just finishing up a call, but go on in.

383
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,311
You two, out. It was a one-time thing.

384
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,949
- What's the word, Ari?
- Yeah. I just got a call from Rubenstein.

385
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,309
Apparently they found his doll somehow.

386
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,675
- So we're all good, then, right?
- No, we're not.

387
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,199
Just got off the phone with Warner.

388
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,789
They're so excited about Aquaman
that they've green-lit Aquaman 2.

389
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,109
- Well, that's good, no?
- No.

390
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,755
Start date is September 8th,
same day as Medellin.

391
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,949
English
