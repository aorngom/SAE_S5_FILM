3
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:19,256
Mahalo, my dear.

4
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:23,058
You got to love a place where
you get lei'd coming and going.

5
00:01:23,178 --> 00:01:24,792
Even if you don't get laid during?

6
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,774
Whatever. I actually enjoyed my R&R.
And I got some good color, right bro?

7
00:01:28,894 --> 00:01:30,542
Looking like George Hamilton.

8
00:01:30,662 --> 00:01:33,230
- But young.
- Yeah, the 50-year-old George Hamilton.

9
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:34,942
How'd it go?

10
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:36,982
Three coach, one first class.

11
00:01:37,102 --> 00:01:38,951
You weren't supposed
to get any first class.

12
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:41,521
It's the only seats they had left.
It was that or the night flight.

13
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:42,947
Forget that.

14
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,936
So who gets the extra leg room?

15
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:49,428
- Vince, obviously.
- No, not obviously.

16
00:01:49,548 --> 00:01:51,215
We'll settle it democratically.

17
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:54,199
Democratically implies
that everyone deserves a voice.

18
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,288
My contention is
broke-ass Turtle does not.

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,789
My contention is Vince is the king,

20
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:01,909
and if he says I get a voice
then let me be heard.

21
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:03,738
I don't care.
You guys fight it out.

22
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,420
You know what?
Me neither.

23
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,047
E and I will slum it like we did
the first 20 years of our lives.

24
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:10,050
Come on,
you're gonna make us feel bad.

25
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,918
I don't feel bad, pal.
Your short squat legs

26
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:15,304
will not extend comfortably
without a fight.

27
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,889
So how do we decide?

28
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:19,324
I'll pick a number one to 20.
The closest man gets it.

29
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:20,926
- Okay.
- No go.

30
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:22,980
- Why not?
- Because you favor Turtle.

31
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:24,224
What?

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,459
It might be subconsciously,
but you do.

33
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:30,153
I get it.
Excuse me, sir?

34
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,538
Would you mind settling this?

35
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:35,552
I have one first class ticket,
both of these gentlemen want it.

36
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,053
Will you decide?

37
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:40,779
- Him.
- Yes!

38
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:43,141
What the hell?
Why not me?

39
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:46,318
My subconscious likes him
more better, I guess.

40
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:53,189
- Fucking foreign cabbie.
- What's the big deal?

41
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:56,195
If it wasn't him there
would be none. Look at him.

42
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:58,154
Look at me,
heading straight into paradise.

43
00:02:58,274 --> 00:02:59,808
- I owe you, Vin.
- You think?

44
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:03,735
- Hello.
- Hey.

45
00:03:03,855 --> 00:03:05,938
- Can I take your jacket?
- Yes you can.

46
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:07,750
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

47
00:03:08,157 --> 00:03:09,403
Excuse me, miss?

48
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:11,555
Miss?

49
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:13,655
Fucking cunts.

50
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:16,825
Are you laughing at me?

51
00:03:17,484 --> 00:03:18,283
No.

52
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:20,052
Good.
Don't.

53
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:23,428
I was just trying to help.
Are you okay?

54
00:03:23,618 --> 00:03:25,785
I'm fine.
I just need a drink.

55
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,894
And a fucking aisle seat,
which they fucking had none.

56
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:33,489
Sir, will you switch with me?

57
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:35,718
My pleasure.

58
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,522
Thank you.
There you go.

59
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:42,860
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

60
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:47,913
I'm sorry if I seem rude.
I'm just--

61
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,332
I'm jamie.

62
00:03:51,222 --> 00:03:53,825
I know.
I'm Turtle. I love your work.

63
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:55,856
Thanks.

64
00:03:57,985 --> 00:04:00,796
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

65
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:03,195
I just broke up
with my boyfriend.

66
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,865
I don't want to talk about it.
I just want a drink.

67
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:09,324
Let me get you one.
What do you need?

68
00:04:09,703 --> 00:04:10,705
Scotch.

69
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:12,734
Watch this.

70
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:19,030
Scotch.

71
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:23,059
How about we make it a double?

72
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,771
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.

73
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:36,928
Love that you're sitting coach.
Very cool.

74
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:38,332
Thanks, kid.

75
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,093
How you doing, Drama?

76
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:43,035
Not good.

77
00:04:43,155 --> 00:04:45,405
But I took two vics,
so I will be.

78
00:04:58,414 --> 00:05:00,552
- Morning, Bradley.
- Is it, Ari?

79
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:01,973
What?

80
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:05,568
What do you got, Lloyd?

81
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,072
Yes, Ari?

82
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:13,183
What's wrong? Tom catch you
cruising for glory holes again?

83
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:16,253
Joke all you want,
but you are the cheater now.

84
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,679
- How was Geneva?
- Great. Went to Paris too.

85
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:20,958
Sorry I didn't bring you back
a Toulouse-Lautrec dildo.

86
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:23,575
- But you have me back.
- No, Benedict Arnold. I don't.

87
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:25,501
When were you gonna
tell me about this?

88
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:28,747
You know <i>Variety</i>
is one step above <i>Us Weekly</i>.

89
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,693
- <i>Us Weekly</i> didn't send this fax.
- What fax?

90
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:35,922
A $10 million offer from John Ellis.

91
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:37,923
What do you have to say now?

92
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,928
I don't know what to say.

93
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,003
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

94
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:53,231
- So it's cool if I call you?
- Wait a couple of days.

95
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:57,318
I'm kidding.
Yes, you can call me.

96
00:05:57,478 --> 00:05:59,285
What kind of world am I living in?

97
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:03,218
Turtle flies first and has airport
farewell scenes with Meadow Soprano.

98
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:06,051
He has been over there dragging out
that goodbye for a while.

99
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:09,054
Come on, they spent five hours together.
Maybe they struck up a friendship.

100
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:12,000
Whatever he struck up,
she should be sick of it by now.

101
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,676
- What are you doing?
- Just taking precautionary measures.

102
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:19,249
Economy class is a killer
that counts the blood clot as a friend.

103
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:21,714
And you're gonna prevent one
by blowing yourself?

104
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:23,870
Take it easy, guys.
Here comes Turtle.

105
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:27,227
What the fuck
were you two talking about?

106
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:29,259
A lot of stuff.
She is very cool.

107
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,225
Really?
And she thought you were cool?

108
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:33,712
I don't know, I guess.
You guys ready to roll?

109
00:06:33,832 --> 00:06:35,468
No, don't do that.
Don't do that.

110
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:37,798
- Don't do what?
- See what he's doing?

111
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:39,627
- I totally see.
- What's he doing?

112
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:40,993
I'm not doing anything.

113
00:06:41,113 --> 00:06:43,622
He's being coy
as if he's got a shot.

114
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:46,825
- Did you get her number?
- Home and cell.

115
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:48,327
Maybe he does have a shot.

116
00:06:49,596 --> 00:06:51,648
- I'm with Drama.
- Is it that ridiculous?

117
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:54,520
You fucking a martian
is less ridiculous, put it that way.

118
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,675
- You guys are mean.
- Really mean.

119
00:06:56,795 --> 00:06:58,772
Oh, poor little Turtle's sensitive

120
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:01,106
'cause he can't get
a hot famous actress.

121
00:07:01,383 --> 00:07:03,794
99% of the world's
average looking citizens

122
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:05,826
can't get that, Turtle,
so don't feel bad.

123
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:07,397
You're living in a fantasy.

124
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:09,287
Reality is when he calls her

125
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:11,996
she tries to lure him away
from Vince to be her bitch.

126
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:15,462
Reality is what happened over
the pacific, you angry old fuck.

127
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,273
Yeah, and what's that?

128
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:21,589
She jerked me off.
Happy?

129
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:24,752
Liar.
Get back here, you liar.

130
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:31,120
E Murph, Josh Weinstein.

131
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,671
Hey, Josh.
How you doing?

132
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,124
<i>I'm always doing great.
You know that.</i>

133
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:37,919
And while others may no longer
believe in Vince-- Ari gold--

134
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,044
<i>I still do.</i>

135
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:41,870
- Well he's still our agent, Josh.
- <i>For the moment he is</i>.

136
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,717
But Ari will officially become
head studio fascist tomorrow.

137
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:47,637
Let me show you
what I can do for you today.

138
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:48,954
What can you do?

139
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:50,612
Frank Darabont.

140
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:52,850
- <i>Vince a fan?</i>
- Who isn't?

141
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:55,413
<i>Shawshank</i> almost makes me wish
I did prison time.

142
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:57,805
Anyway, he's got a new project
he's working on.

143
00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:00,399
I got him to sit down with Vince
to talk about the lead.

144
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:01,983
- Really?
- Really.

145
00:08:03,788 --> 00:08:04,908
10 million, Ari?

146
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,229
You were hoping
for six or seven, tops.

147
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:09,721
I know, baby. It's crazy.
They want me bad.

148
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:12,662
And I keep sinking my own money
into this place.

149
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:15,414
<i>And for what?
A staff whose petty lives</i>

150
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:17,805
rise and fall with my successes
and their failures.

151
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:19,486
- E's on the phone.
- Call him back.

152
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:21,471
- Says it's urgent.
- I'll call him back.

153
00:08:21,927 --> 00:08:24,890
- I'm on the phone.
- I know, I put the call through.

154
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,214
I've been putting your calls
through for three years now,

155
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:29,489
and I haven't interrupted
or given you my opinion,

156
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:33,057
even when I know I can steer your
twisted mind into greener pastures.

157
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:34,900
But I can't keep
my mouth shut anymore.

158
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,854
- 'Cause it's filled with--
- Shut it!

159
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,145
I know you're gonna make
some rude, inconsiderate,

160
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:41,540
nasty comment about
my sexual orientation.

161
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,160
And I know you always do that
to deflect from your insecurities.

162
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,210
And I've lived with it
because I want to learn

163
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,320
and I believed that someday
you would promote me.

164
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,472
This is gonna be
a good thing for you as well.

165
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:54,519
If you think working for some
conglomerate is gonna fulfill you,

166
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:57,689
then fine, but please don't think
I'd ever make myself a corporate bitch.

167
00:08:58,195 --> 00:08:59,667
And by the way, even if I did,

168
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:01,760
your little gay quips
would not be tolerated

169
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,629
in a publicly-traded company.

170
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:05,823
People need you here, Ari.

171
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,093
I'll leave you with that.

172
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:13,114
You throw a lot of jew guilt
for a chinaman.

173
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:15,208
He's got a point.

174
00:09:15,328 --> 00:09:17,077
No homosexual harassment?

175
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,426
No, being your own boss.

176
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:21,380
That's why you put up
with all the stress,

177
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:23,467
because nobody
can tell you what to do.

178
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:25,484
You always tell me what to do.

179
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:27,837
So tell me what to do.

180
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:29,697
I can't decide this for you.

181
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:32,649
Like when I was trying to decide
whether or not to ask you to marry me,

182
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:34,126
I'll let the fates decide.

183
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:36,188
- <i>How</i>?
- By flipping a coin.

184
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:38,595
You flipped a coin to decide
whether to marry me or not?

185
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:40,041
I was joking, baby.

186
00:09:43,469 --> 00:09:45,257
Heads I leave,
tails I stay.

187
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:48,257
Well?

188
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:51,324
Two out of three.

189
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,811
I feel like we're cheating on Ari.

190
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:56,087
The guy won't call us back,
what are we supposed to do?

191
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:58,909
Take care of yourself. It's what
everyone else in this town does.

192
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,220
Except you, who gets taken
care of by Meadow Soprano.

193
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,359
Come on, Johnny,
leave him alone already.

194
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,555
No can do, bro. He made a statement
and I want it verified.

195
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,158
How you gonna verify it?

196
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:11,897
I got a friend-- an FBI friend
who will come down here

197
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:13,932
and administer a lie detector test.

198
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:15,618
I'm not taking a lie detector test.

199
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,437
How about if we get him
on that <i>Moment of Truth</i> show?

200
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:21,249
- At least then he'd make a buck.
- Not if he keeps lying.

201
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:24,465
I'm not doing anything to prove
anything to you guys, understood?

202
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:25,711
You need anything?

203
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:28,299
Well, this guy got jerked
off by Meadow Soprano,

204
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,774
so he's all good.
I'll take an iced tea.

205
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:33,223
I don't think he believes you either.

206
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,954
We're all right, thanks.
Here comes Josh with Frank.

207
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:38,390
- Wish us luck.
- Good luck.

208
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:40,325
- Frank.
- Vince.

209
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:42,728
- I'm a big fan.
- Hey, likewise. A great pleasure.

210
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:44,930
- Hey, Josh, what's up?
- Eric Murphy.

211
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:47,165
- Let's sit, shall we?
- Absolutely.

212
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:48,806
Got us a table up here.

213
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,403
Hey, Frank.

214
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:53,972
Loser.

215
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,574
Vinnie, E Murph.

216
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:58,810
So, how long have you and Jsh
been working together?

217
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,646
- W don't work together.
- Not yet.

218
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:04,082
Josh's dad and I are old friends.
We go way back.

219
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:06,300
Anyway, he told me
that you guys are good friends.

220
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,250
He suggested we sit down.
I said fantastic.

221
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,633
Yeah, absolutely.

222
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:11,923
So you have a new movie
you're getting ready to start?

223
00:11:12,043 --> 00:11:14,682
Yes, yeah. I got this thing
called <i>School of Athens</i>.

224
00:11:14,802 --> 00:11:17,596
It's based on the Renaissance
masterpiece by Rafael.

225
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:19,355
It's in the Vatican palace...
Anyway,

226
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:22,901
the really cool thing is
we get to shoot for 14 weeks

227
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,895
in the Greek islands.

228
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:28,704
- That sounds amazing.
- How nice is that?

229
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:30,985
What's the part
you had in mind for me?

230
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,528
In this, you mean?

231
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:35,302
Didn't you tell him
what I was thinking here?

232
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:36,451
Well, I...

233
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:40,021
Vince, look,

234
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,922
I'm afraid that there's nothing
in this particular film for you.

235
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,584
There are no male roles
in it under 45.

236
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:49,194
I thought josh said you wanted
to talk to me about the lead.

237
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:52,727
Yes, the lead in a tv series
Frank is exec producing.

238
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:56,385
- And you didn't tell them this?
- He didn't tell us anything.

239
00:11:56,898 --> 00:11:58,837
That's 'cause he's a scumbag.

240
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:01,453
Just like your old man, aren't you?
Good work.

241
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:03,225
Guys, I'm really sorry.

242
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:05,611
Your clients keep calling.

243
00:12:05,731 --> 00:12:07,913
- Can't stall forever.
- Tell them I'll call them back.

244
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:09,515
You've grown cold.

245
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:11,742
I've got something
that might warm him up.

246
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:13,652
You cougarlicious little freak.

247
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:16,555
Just so you know,
I'm paying 10¢ on the dollar

248
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:18,361
for your share of this company.

249
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:20,744
- Dana Gordon's on one.
- Put her through.

250
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:22,741
Any shot you could
pay me in euros?

251
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:25,875
You are a fucking asshole.

252
00:12:26,923 --> 00:12:29,145
How can I leave
such a charming man?

253
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:32,935
Am I your number two or not?

254
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:35,006
You'll always be
my number one whore.

255
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:37,576
- Thank you.
- Not sure it's gonna be at the studio.

256
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:40,892
You piece of shit.
You know I can do that job.

257
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:43,384
Just relax.
I'm struggling with this decision,

258
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:45,636
but I think
I'm not gonna take the job.

259
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:49,516
But don't worry,
I'm sure you'll be able

260
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,624
to grease the balls of the next guy
in line and get yourself under him.

261
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:54,506
There is no next guy.

262
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:57,905
There's a next girl.
Amanda Daniels.

263
00:12:58,349 --> 00:13:01,450
Doesn't she hate you? That should
work out well for you and yours.

264
00:13:01,935 --> 00:13:04,120
- Fuck me.
- I'll second that.

265
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:06,731
I'm so happy.

266
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:09,375
You've made me vary happy.
I hope you're happy too.

267
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:11,607
- Do I look happy!?
- What's wrong?

268
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:13,777
Has so much come been
squirted into those eyes

269
00:13:13,897 --> 00:13:15,965
you can't see
what's right in front of you?

270
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,316
If she takes that job,
Vince is fucked and I'm fucked.

271
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:19,868
Which means we're all fucked.

272
00:13:19,988 --> 00:13:22,454
And we're fucked in the way
you like to get fucked.

273
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:25,335
Not fucked in the way
that normal people like to get fucked.

274
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:28,430
- So what are you gonna do now?
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.

275
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:30,516
Not a word to anyone, Lloyd.

276
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:37,369
This is not tv, Vince.

277
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:38,870
Oh no?
What is it?

278
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,792
It's tv with Frank Darabont.

279
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:43,657
Know what, Josh? Sandbagging us
like that was a real dick move.

280
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:46,545
I thought it would be more impactful
if you heard it straight from Frank.

281
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,413
What the hell's so wrong
with doing tv?

282
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:52,267
Nothing for David Hasselhoff or for you.
But for Vince, doing tv is ridiculous.

283
00:13:52,387 --> 00:13:54,453
But you doing Jamie-Lynn Sigler isn't?

284
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:56,788
- Oh, here we go.
- You did Jamie-Lynn Sigler?

285
00:13:56,908 --> 00:13:58,158
You believe it?

286
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:00,734
- Not really.
- Nobody does.

287
00:14:00,854 --> 00:14:03,808
- It's been a pleasure as always.
- Wait a minute. Just hold on a second.

288
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,271
At least read the script.

289
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:07,632
It's Frank Darabont.
He's a genius.

290
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:09,408
There's lots and lots of money in tv.

291
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:11,939
I don't want to play the same character
for the next five years.

292
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,306
- I want to do movies.
- He's still a movie star, you know?

293
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:17,175
Lots of movie stars do tv.
George Clooney did <i>ER</i> for christ sakes.

294
00:14:17,353 --> 00:14:19,111
That was before he was George Clooney.

295
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:21,447
No one goes backwards
'cause you don't get back to movies.

296
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:23,741
You didn't see Leo
in the <i>Growing pains</i> reunion.

297
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:25,993
Maybe that part of your life is over.

298
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:29,054
Maybe you're not gonna be
a movie star anymore.

299
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:32,423
Look, guys, I'm sorry.

300
00:14:33,312 --> 00:14:35,669
I'm just telling you
what nobody else has the balls to.

301
00:14:35,953 --> 00:14:38,676
Why don't you walk away, Josh?
Walk away.

302
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,987
All right, man.
Take it easy.

303
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:48,599
My car is over there.

304
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:56,578
It's okay.

305
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,172
Five minutes.
Not a second more.

306
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:01,610
No need to be snippy.
I'm here for you, not me.

307
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,149
- Really?
- Well, I'm here for us really.

308
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:07,305
- I'd rather suck a rabid dog's dick.
- Clever, but seriously.

309
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:10,028
Seriously, what about us
would you like to talk about?

310
00:15:10,148 --> 00:15:11,663
I'd like to bury the hatchet.

311
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:14,283
The animosity between
the two of us has run its course.

312
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:16,752
Apology accepted.
What else?

313
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:19,204
All business,
it's admirable how you do it.

314
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:22,240
That's why I'm putting all my support
behind you for the studio head job.

315
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:23,958
I don't need your support.

316
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:26,693
That may be true, but you're gonna
need me to bow out of the race.

317
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:30,415
I have never needed
and will never need anything from you.

318
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:33,431
Amanda, it's very simple.
You want this job,

319
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:35,420
I want Vince in <i>Smokejumpers</i>.

320
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:37,422
I don't think he's good enough.

321
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,459
- You did represent him at one point.
- And now I don't.

322
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:42,616
Bitterness is not very becoming.

323
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:44,520
Neither is groveling,
and I'm not bitter.

324
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,307
But I'm not making deals with you.

325
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:48,557
Then unfortunately
I'm gonna have to stand in your way.

326
00:15:48,677 --> 00:15:50,569
If you wanted this job
you would have taken it.

327
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:53,323
But we both know you won't because
you'll miss your clients too much.

328
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:56,007
And we both know
that you've already fucked all of yours.

329
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:58,060
So maybe you could move on
to bigger and better.

330
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,045
You're gonna have
to find another way to bring

331
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:02,447
your once-upon-a-time-movie-star
client back from the dead.

332
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:04,416
- Not bitter, huh?
- Fuck you, Ari.

333
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:07,486
You can kiss your relationship
with that studio goodbye.

334
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:10,355
No, you can kiss your
motherfucking dream job goodbye.

335
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:12,391
'cause you're right,
I didn't want this job.

336
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:15,312
But now I'm gonna take it
just to spite you.

337
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:19,561
Yeah, call John ellis.

338
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:21,984
Tell him I'm gonna close
this motherfucking deal.

339
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:26,571
Let's not let Josh Weinstein
get us upset.

340
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:28,914
He didn't get me upset.
Frank Darabont did.

341
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:31,610
An academy award nominee
thinks I should do tv.

342
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,837
He didn't say you should do tv.
He said you'd be great for his tv show

343
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:36,915
if he can get you, which he can't.

344
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:38,810
- That's a good point.
- Thanks, E.

345
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,425
I just wish I know what Ari was doing.
If he takes the job, what?

346
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:43,548
We got to work
with a guy like Josh Weinstein?

347
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:46,069
If Ari takes the studio job
you got <i>Smokejumpers</i>.

348
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:48,779
And once you kill it in that,
you'll be back and bigger than ever.

349
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,147
That's another good point.

350
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:52,459
Thanks again.
I feel extra smart today.

351
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,577
Maybe that's 'cause you unloaded
a ton of bullshit earlier.

352
00:16:55,697 --> 00:16:57,575
But there is a problem
with the thought.

353
00:16:57,695 --> 00:17:00,530
- What's that?
- What if Ari doesn't give you the gig?

354
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,475
- You think he wouldn't?
- He's an agent.

355
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:06,479
Nothing would surprise me.
And when he goes from seller to buyer,

356
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,799
he's gonna start analyzing
all sorts of new angles.

357
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,782
You're really making us all
feel good today?

358
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:12,417
Just keeping it real.

359
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:14,319
- Sorry, bro.
- Call Ari.

360
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:18,149
- I already left him like five messages.
- We'll have to ambush him then.

361
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:37,309
So you ready to become
part of all this?

362
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:38,780
Oh, I'm ready.

363
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:53,144
You look awful, Lloyd.

364
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:55,110
I feel awful, E.

365
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,454
- So it's official?
- He's signing the papers now.

366
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:01,141
I'm sorry, Vince. I'm supposed
to exude confidence to clients,

367
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:04,136
but I just can't.
All I can do is shake and cry.

368
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:07,131
How about if I tell you
something funny to cheer you up?

369
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:08,981
You can try.

370
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:12,253
Turtle got jerked off
by Jamie-Lynn Sigler on the plane today.

371
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:13,879
Get the fuck out of here.

372
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:15,861
- Made you laugh.
- Boys!

373
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:17,849
This is a surprise.

374
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:19,802
I guess this is congrats.

375
00:18:20,897 --> 00:18:22,711
- You sold me out.
- Go ahead and be mad.

376
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:25,122
But I've grown four new ulcers
keeping your secret.

377
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:26,720
Come on in, guys.

378
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:32,597
I apologize for the disappearance.

379
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:34,900
It's been a tough day of soul
searching for me though.

380
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,354
Been a tough day for Vince too.
He got offered a tv show today.

381
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:39,638
Offered tv by who?
Not by my people.

382
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:41,538
Frank Darabont.
Josh Weinstein set it up.

383
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:43,110
Why are you talking to weinstein?

384
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,377
He called. We couldn't find you
so we took the meeting.

385
00:18:45,537 --> 00:18:47,138
You guys really are melting down.

386
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:49,543
Yeah, maybe we are.
So just tell us, as studio head,

387
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,569
are you gonna put me
in <i>Smokejumpers</i> or not?

388
00:18:51,689 --> 00:18:54,105
Did you ever think there was
a possibility that I wouldn't?

389
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:56,036
I just want to get my life
back on track.

390
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:58,732
I know that.
But I didn't take the job.

391
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:01,549
- Double whoopee!
- He's happy.

392
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:04,014
- You didn't take it?
- No, I'm still your agent.

393
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:07,366
Are you guys happy or is the movie
more important to you than me?

394
00:19:07,486 --> 00:19:09,334
Of course we're happy.
But what now?

395
00:19:09,454 --> 00:19:11,103
- We're gonna be all right.
- How?

396
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:12,821
- Things are coming.
- What things?

397
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:14,484
Dana Gordon on one.

398
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:16,734
Put her through.

399
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:22,401
Ari, I love you.

400
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:25,167
And I swear,
I'll rub your cock like it's 1990.

401
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:28,453
You're on speaker.
I got Vince and E here.

402
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:30,635
- Jesus Christ.
- Hi, Dana.

403
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,943
We all wanted to be in the room
to celebrate together.

404
00:19:33,063 --> 00:19:34,217
Celebrate what?

405
00:19:34,337 --> 00:19:36,695
Boys, you are talking
to the new head of the studio.

406
00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:39,431
Madam President,
what's your first order of business?

407
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:41,666
<i>Smokejumpers</i>, Vince.
You're in.

408
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:44,332
- You're kidding me.
- And she's gonna pay you your quote.

409
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:46,905
- It's the second lead.
- You're gonna pay him his quote

410
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:50,208
or Vincent Chase is going
to announce on <i>TMZ</i>

411
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:53,545
that the new head of the studio
calls agencies and offers up handjobs.

412
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:54,913
All right, enough.

413
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:56,948
Vince, I will take good care of you.

414
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,750
- Thank you!
- Thank you, Dana.

415
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,154
- I love you.
- I love you too. For real this time.

416
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:04,571
- I'll call you later about that tug.
- Goodbye.

417
00:20:04,691 --> 00:20:06,158
- How the hell?
- What happened?

418
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:09,761
I pulled off the old bait and switch.
They wanted your old friend Amanda,

419
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:11,963
and I gave them my old friend Dana.

420
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,732
Everybody wins.
Boom!

421
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,493
That's impressive, Ari.

422
00:20:15,613 --> 00:20:17,269
This is really big for you.
Really big.

423
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:18,804
I want you to kill this movie.

424
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:20,806
- I'll do my best.
- I know you will.

425
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:24,351
- Can I come?
- Of course you can.

426
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:30,615
All right, to things
being back on track.

427
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:32,317
- I hear that.
- Hear hear.

428
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,627
You know,
now that things are back on track

429
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:36,521
can we talk about my promotion?

430
00:20:36,641 --> 00:20:38,534
You know what?
I want to learn chinese first

431
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,525
so I can give it to you
in your native tongue.

432
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:44,029
Listen, we're here to celebrate Vince.
All right? Please, Lloyd.

433
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:45,731
Cheers.

434
00:20:46,336 --> 00:20:48,151
- I don't believe it.
- What?

435
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:51,121
Your girlfriend is here.

436
00:20:52,645 --> 00:20:55,011
- Don't embarrass me.
- How does he know Jamie?

437
00:20:55,131 --> 00:20:57,311
He claims she jerked him
on the plane today.

438
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:01,978
I'm sure she's got a fetish for guys who
are built like a <i>South Park</i> character.

439
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:04,398
Hey, Jamie.

440
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,101
That's for running around town

441
00:21:06,261 --> 00:21:09,060
telling everyone I jerked you off,
you fat little fuck.

442
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,899
Thanks a lot, Drama.

443
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,817
Jamie-Lynn,
wait wait wait.

444
00:21:19,937 --> 00:21:21,559
Look, I'm sorry.

445
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:24,503
Turtle didn't do anything.
It was me.

446
00:21:24,623 --> 00:21:27,148
I was busting his chops
today about you

447
00:21:27,268 --> 00:21:29,141
and I shot my mouth off
in a restaurant.

448
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:32,611
- He obviously told you.
- No, I made it up.

449
00:21:32,731 --> 00:21:34,813
Turtle didn't do anything.
He's totally innocent.

450
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:37,002
That's nice of you to try
and cover for your friend.

451
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:39,637
But the fact is
I jerked him off and he told you.

452
00:21:39,918 --> 00:21:42,039
I actually liked him
and would have fucked him too

453
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,268
if he would have
kept his mouth shut.

454
00:21:54,255 --> 00:21:55,300
What happened?

455
00:21:55,477 --> 00:21:57,295
I am so sorry, man.

456
00:21:58,091 --> 00:21:59,662
She actually liked you.

457
00:22:00,023 --> 00:22:01,503
- Really?
- No way.

458
00:22:01,623 --> 00:22:03,075
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

459
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:05,077
At least order has been restored.

460
00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:06,912
Everything's back to normal.

461
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:09,089
Baby bro is a movie star,

462
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:11,048
Ari is his agent

463
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:13,940
and Turtle is once again pussyless.

464
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:16,134
Glasses up.

465
00:22:17,274 --> 00:22:19,019
Did she really say she liked me?

466
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:21,397
Oh yeah.
She would have fucked you too.

467
00:22:21,587 --> 00:22:23,835
At least you got a nice jerk, huh?
