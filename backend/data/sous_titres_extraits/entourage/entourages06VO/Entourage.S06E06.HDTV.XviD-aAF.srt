1
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:24,087
Sometimes people have a connection
That just can't be explained.

2
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:28,208
- Why fight it?
- Because you know my uncle doesn't like you!

3
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:30,144
You know what he'll do!

4
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:32,629
Let me worry about your uncle.

5
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:36,567
You just worry about me.

6
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:41,188
Don't look, turtle.

7
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:43,190
It's gonna be over soon.

8
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:47,444
Oh, jesus.

9
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:49,496
You know when they say a guy
can never bang his girl again

10
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:50,981
After he watches her give birth?

11
00:01:51,015 --> 00:01:52,666
<i>That is what this is like.</i>

12
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,802
Okay, and cut! Cut the rain. Beautiful.

13
00:01:55,837 --> 00:01:58,705
<i>I want to do a lighting change.
We'll pick this up in 30.</i>

14
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,707
You're gonna do more takes?

15
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:02,843
I'm sorry. I just thought you had it.

16
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:04,845
<i>All right, everybody. We've got 30 minutes.</i>

17
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,630
- Hey!
- How was that?

18
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:09,216
- Fantastic.
- That wasn't so bad, right?

19
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,451
That was the worst thing
I've ever seen in my life.

20
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:13,020
Stop it.

21
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:14,538
Eww! It's like you just kissed me.

22
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:16,490
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

23
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:18,058
I've got to go into makeup. Can you stay?

24
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:20,878
- Class starts in an hour.
- Good luck, college man.

25
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:23,597
- Call me later.
- Eww! You just kissed me again.

26
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:25,765
<i>- You're gonna get hit, drama.
- Go ahead.</i>

27
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:28,368
Don't break your hand on my pythons.

28
00:02:28,403 --> 00:02:30,237
- Yo!
- Yo, e, where you been?

29
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:32,239
- You missed everything.
- Sorry, rough night.

30
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:33,824
Why? What happened?

31
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,076
Where can I get some coffee?

32
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,162
You called ashley sloan and
you weren't even in mid-fuck?

33
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:42,299
Oh, that's the worst. That's why
I always stick with "yeah, baby!"

34
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,784
Whose name would you
accidentally call out? Vince's?

35
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:47,621
- So how'd you cover?
- I told her she was hearing things.

36
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,273
- Jesus.
- I bet she took that well.

37
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:51,008
- Yeah, she left.
- Who wouldn't?

38
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:53,377
- Why didn't you chase after her?
- 'Cause he loves sloan.

39
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:55,262
- Ah.
- Why else would a sober man

40
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:57,514
Who isn't about to come
do something so stupid?

41
00:02:57,565 --> 00:03:00,851
I was distracted thinking about the job.

42
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:02,853
I wasn't expecting an offer to come so fast

43
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:04,221
Or how vince would feel about it.

44
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:05,689
Hey, don't blame me. I feel fine.

45
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,224
I think you knew you wanted the job.

46
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:08,759
You just didn't want to be sloan's bitch.

47
00:03:08,793 --> 00:03:11,478
He's already vince's bitch. It suits him.

48
00:03:11,496 --> 00:03:13,981
I appreciate that, turtle...
from one bitch to another.

49
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:15,616
I am no longer a bitch.

50
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,784
After today, I am a college man...

51
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,453
If I could focus.

52
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:21,989
Relax, turtle. Your girl is in good hands.

53
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:24,958
Just send her back as untainted
as possible. I've gotta go.

54
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:27,628
Yo, e. Do you want to hang
before your meeting with murray

55
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:30,163
- Or should I go with turtle?
- Nah, I think I'm gonna go talk to ashley.

56
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:31,848
- You mean sloan.
- Funny.

57
00:03:31,883 --> 00:03:33,717
- So what are you going to say to her?
- I don't know yet.

58
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:36,303
- Let me give you some advice.
- Oh, please do, drama.

59
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:38,956
I know you like to think of
yourself as honest abe and all,

60
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,809
But in this situation, lie like a mattress.

61
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:52,869
What are you doing, buddy?

62
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:55,122
I'm waking you up with my mind.

63
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:56,907
Good work.

64
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,993
- What time is it?
- It's late.

65
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:02,212
Shoot.

66
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:04,114
Daddy, you almost said shit.

67
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:08,051
Baby.

68
00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:11,588
Baby, please.

69
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,040
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:16,593
What do I got to do for you to forgive me?

71
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:19,262
- Not get me a car.
- It's nice, though, isn't it?

72
00:04:19,314 --> 00:04:22,399
- It's insulting.
- Baby, I ache.

73
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:24,601
I haven't been able to look left in days.

74
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:26,269
I can't work. I can't sleep.

75
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,222
- It's cold down there.
- Oh, what a shame.

76
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:32,225
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied to you.

77
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:34,745
Listen, from here on I swear

78
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,997
If one of my friends so much as jerks off

79
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:38,398
You're gonna be the first to know.

80
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,900
- I appreciate that.
- So you forgive me?

81
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:43,086
- I'm thinking about it.
- When I was in college

82
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:44,454
I got drunk and passed out.

83
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:46,506
Mike young teabagged me
and took a picture of it.

84
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,642
I've never told anyone.

85
00:04:48,676 --> 00:04:50,010
Where's the picture?

86
00:04:50,044 --> 00:04:52,295
I've offered millions for
it and been turned down.

87
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:58,101
- I forgive you.
- So I can get back in bed?

88
00:04:58,136 --> 00:04:59,936
I just made that bed.

89
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:02,856
I'll remake it. Come here and punish me.

90
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,144
<i>It is a very nice car.</i>

91
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:10,714
- Oh.
- What are you guys doing?

92
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:13,533
Um, daddy lost his contact lens.

93
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:15,952
- We're looking for it. I think
it's over here. - Mm-hmm. Yeah.

94
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:18,155
You guys are gross.

95
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,451
- Hey.
- Hey.

96
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:34,721
- Can I come in for a second?
- I was actually just about to run out.

97
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:37,174
- I just need one second.
- Okay.

98
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:39,059
I wish you would've called.

99
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:41,812
<i>I've got just a million things to do.</i>

100
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:44,464
- Well, I just wanted to apologize.
- For what?

101
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:47,918
- Well, I'm sorry I called you sloan.
- Oh, you did call me sloan?

102
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:50,771
- I thought I was hearing things.
- Well, you weren't, so...

103
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:53,407
'cause that's what you told me last
night... that I was hearing things.

104
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:54,775
I know what I told you.

105
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:57,160
It was embarrassing enough that you said it,

106
00:05:57,195 --> 00:06:00,747
But you made it worse when you
tried to convince me that you didn't.

107
00:06:00,782 --> 00:06:03,250
Well, I'm sorry.

108
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:05,819
- Why were you thinking about her?
- I don't know.

109
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:07,788
Probably because she called the day before.

110
00:06:07,822 --> 00:06:10,323
Well, why did she call? What did she want?

111
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:12,375
I have no idea. You were right
there. You heard the whole thing.

112
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:14,261
I heard your side.

113
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:17,180
I really hate being put in a position

114
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:19,216
- To be a jealous freak.
- You're not.

115
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:21,301
<i>- But I just want to know.
- What do you want to know?</i>

116
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:22,719
Have you been with her
since you've been with me?

117
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,055
- Have I been with her?
- Have you slept with her, eric?

118
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:27,507
- Come on.
- What?! Ashley, no.

119
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:29,843
No, I swear to god. Look, she called.

120
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:32,395
<i>Before that, I hadn't seen
her since the premiere.</i>

121
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,364
Okay.

122
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:35,899
Yeah?

123
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:40,437
Yeah, okay.

124
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:44,324
I like you, eric.

125
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:47,193
- I like you a lot.
- Well, I like you too.

126
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:50,029
- But just don't lie to me.
- I won't.

127
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:51,832
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:54,501
You're really cute when you're sorry.

129
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:57,420
Well, then I'm really real.

130
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,806
You have a meeting.

131
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:02,175
I have an hour.

132
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:04,377
Well, in that case.

133
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:08,148
But you so much as mutter anything
resembling that bitch's name

134
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:10,650
- And I will hurt you.
- Oh, not a problem.

135
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:17,223
And cut! That was great!

136
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,109
<i>- That was great.
- Huh! Whoo!</i>

137
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,394
- How was that one?
- That was good.

138
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:23,062
- Better?
- Yeah, definitely.

139
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,499
You can tell me. I can
handle a little criticism.

140
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:28,585
Your tongue's kind of strong.

141
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:31,237
- Really?
- It's no big deal.

142
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:34,124
It's just my teeth are a little sore.

143
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:35,959
I'll relax on this one.

144
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,928
- I think we got it.
- Yeah?

145
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:40,514
I love the passion on that take.

146
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:42,382
Jamie didn't feel great about that one.

147
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,968
- No? Let's do another one.
- No no no, I'm great.

148
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,920
You think we've got it, tim, let's move on.

149
00:07:46,938 --> 00:07:49,105
- It was great for me. Great, let's move on.
- Great.

150
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,590
- Timmy!
- Hey, dan.

151
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,058
- How are you?
- How are you? You see that take?

152
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:53,660
Oh, yeah yeah, it looked good.

153
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:55,345
Well, as good as one can
look kissing johnny chase.

154
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,280
- Mr. Coakley.
- How are you, johnny?

155
00:07:57,315 --> 00:07:59,533
What brings you down here
to our little operation?

156
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,785
Well, I heard miss sigler
had graced us with her talent.

157
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,269
I wanted to come down and say hello.

158
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:05,271
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm dan coakley.

159
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:07,624
- I'm a big fan.
- And the boss.

160
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:10,493
- Oh. Hi, nice to meet you.
- And you as well.

161
00:08:10,545 --> 00:08:12,495
Yeah, I was surprised we were
able to get you to do this.

162
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:15,782
- Well, johnny's a friend.
- Terrific.

163
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,051
Well, I love what I saw

164
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:20,887
And I've got a couple of things
I'd love to talk with you about,

165
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:23,957
<i>- If that's okay.
- Um, yeah, sure.</i>

166
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:25,692
All right. Timmy, how clo are you?

167
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:27,644
- As soon as we light the shot.
- Okay.

168
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:29,963
- Can I take you to lunch?
- Yeah.

169
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:31,848
Jawould have lunch. Maybe you and I

170
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:34,034
<i>You guys are friends. You can lunch anytime.</i>

171
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,186
Jamie and I have to talk
about our future together.

172
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:40,023
Sounds serious. Do I need
my agent or my lawyer?

173
00:08:40,074 --> 00:08:42,959
Or your bodyguard.

174
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:46,980
If you like anything I have,
we can call your people after.

175
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:49,482
Okay. Johnny, are you okay?

176
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,168
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

177
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:54,120
Let me just get cleaned
up. I'll meet you back here.

178
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:55,672
Okay, great.

179
00:09:00,294 --> 00:09:03,463
So, dan, you still seeing
that chick from "lost"?

180
00:09:03,497 --> 00:09:05,265
I got rid of her before the island did, john.

181
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:07,133
I was hitting that cutie
on "brothers & sisters."

182
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,469
Not sally field?

183
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:12,689
No, john, not sally field.

184
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:19,846
Maybe we could have office phone sex, baby.

185
00:09:19,864 --> 00:09:21,581
Haven't done that since the early '90s.

186
00:09:21,616 --> 00:09:23,216
You have glass doors.

187
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,784
<i>Yeah, it'll be lloyd's year-end bonus.</i>

188
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:26,853
<i>He'd rather that than cash. Trust me.</i>

189
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:29,422
You're disgusting.

190
00:09:29,457 --> 00:09:32,325
Too disgusting to spend a
couple of nights in cabo with?

191
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:35,979
God, ari, this fight has
made you very romantic.

192
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:37,497
I love you so much right now

193
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:39,149
I may even let you play golf with me.

194
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:40,934
Maybe we should fight more often.

195
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:44,203
No more fights. Smooth
sailing from here on out.

196
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,990
Where's the whore who is fucking my husband?!

197
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:49,376
Huh?! Where are you, whore?!

198
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,228
- What about you? Are you fucking my husband?!
- Baby, I'll call you back.

199
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:55,381
<i>Where is she?! What's her name?!</i>

200
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,885
- Mr. Gold... mr. Gold, I think we
have a problem. - No shit, lloyd.

201
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:01,154
What about you?

202
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:04,157
Are you the whore who's fucking my husband?

203
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:05,508
Who's your husband?

204
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:06,843
- Marlo.
- Where is she, ari?

205
00:10:06,877 --> 00:10:08,728
- Come on.
- Where is the nasty slut

206
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:11,431
Who is fucking my worthless
piece of shit husband?

207
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:13,333
<i>Come on, let's go talk in my office.</i>

208
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:15,702
- Please. Come on.
- Come on out, you skank!

209
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:17,403
- Come here. Come here.
- Where is she?

210
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:19,405
- Sit down.
- I want to look her in the eye

211
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:21,424
And I want to ask her

212
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:23,760
What she wants with my husband.

213
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:27,246
- Okay, just take a breath.
- Why? Are you protecting her?

214
00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:29,265
- No.
- Oh my god!

215
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,250
Are you fucking her too?

216
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:33,703
Is this some kind of sick threesome?

217
00:10:33,738 --> 00:10:35,605
Because unlike your lying ass,

218
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,507
I will tell your wife!

219
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,726
Just keep my wife out of this.
This is between you and andrew.

220
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,260
Oh, you got involved

221
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:43,947
When you advised him to follow his dick!

222
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:46,282
Now I want you to point me in the direction

223
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:48,568
And tell me where she is!

224
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:51,938
- I can't do that.
- Well, I'll find her eventually.

225
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:54,591
I see about 12 candidates already.

226
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,777
This is some whorehouse you are running.

227
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:01,197
- Listen, marlo... -
15 years in the valley

228
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:04,050
And andrew never worked with anyone under 50.

229
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:06,503
Listen, this is just a
terrible misunderstanding.

230
00:11:06,554 --> 00:11:08,922
All right, marlo? Calm down.

231
00:11:08,956 --> 00:11:11,508
You ruined my family, ari.

232
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:15,111
I want my family back.

233
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:17,313
You didn't lose them.
Go home to your children.

234
00:11:17,348 --> 00:11:20,100
- Let me talk to andrew.
- You've done enough talking.

235
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:21,735
Let me try again. I've known him long enough

236
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:23,403
To know this is just a crisis of character.

237
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:26,189
He loves his family. He wants to be with you.

238
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,641
You have to calm down
and work on forgiving him.

239
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:31,094
Oh, he fucks up and I have to work?

240
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,635
What are you looking at, bitch? Keep walking!

241
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:40,870
Where's andrew?

242
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:43,339
I don't know. Lizzie's office?

243
00:11:43,374 --> 00:11:46,526
Find them both now!

244
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,015
Use the mint soap so you don't
smell like girl for the interview.

245
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:54,234
It's not an interview. It's an offer.

246
00:11:54,268 --> 00:11:55,852
Sorry, hotshot.

247
00:11:55,886 --> 00:11:58,221
Your offer, which you
still seem hesitant to take.

248
00:11:58,272 --> 00:12:00,774
I just want to make sure he wants me for me.

249
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:03,476
- And not for vince, you mean.
- There's that.

250
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,278
What else is there?

251
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:07,530
I don't know.

252
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:09,315
Have some confidence, eric.

253
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:11,367
You are very wonderful.

254
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:14,204
<i>Thank you.</i>

255
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:21,694
<i>Hey, you have an extra toothbrush?</i>

256
00:12:21,712 --> 00:12:24,330
No, sorry.

257
00:12:29,553 --> 00:12:32,538
<i>Hey, e. Look, I'm so sorry about yesterday.</i>

258
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:34,040
<i>I didn't mean to be pushy.</i>

259
00:12:34,058 --> 00:12:35,642
<i>If you don't want the job, don't take it.</i>

260
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:37,210
<i>But I hope you think about it</i>

261
00:12:37,228 --> 00:12:39,062
<i>'cause I think it could
be really great for you.</i>

262
00:12:39,096 --> 00:12:42,381
<i>Anyway, good to see you. Okay, bye.</i>

263
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,602
<i>End of message. To delete
this message press 7.</i>

264
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:48,488
<i>Hey, could you throw me a towel?</i>

265
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:56,729
Ashley?

266
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:03,503
Oh. Maybe I should go back to school.

267
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:05,572
It does look fun, right?

268
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:07,674
Hey.

269
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:19,052
<i>- How's it going?
- Sweet car.</i>

270
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:21,821
- Thanks, man.
- Hey, I know you.

271
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:24,073
I don't think you do.

272
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:26,226
Yeah, you're jamie-lynn sigler's boyfriend.

273
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,978
<i>- Saw you in "people."
- Oh yeah, that's right. I saw that too.</i>

274
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:31,564
I love it. You're a star, turtle.

275
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,867
Holy shit. Vince. Man, what's up?

276
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:35,451
- Not much.
- What are you doing here?

277
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:37,287
Just taking my son to school.

278
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:39,372
- That's so cool.
- Sweet.

279
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:41,541
All right, I've got to head
in. What are you gonna do?

280
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:43,693
Well, I've got an hour.

281
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:45,879
So I'll mingle.

282
00:13:45,913 --> 00:13:47,814
All right.

283
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,986
You miss me already, johnny? I just left you.

284
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,004
<i>I got a problem, bro. You got a minute?</i>

285
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,573
<i>Yeah sure, what's wrong?</i>

286
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,408
Is turtle near you?

287
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:00,610
<i>No, he just left for class.</i>

288
00:14:00,644 --> 00:14:02,629
My boss is trying to bang jamie.

289
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:04,964
- What?
- I tried to stop him, bro.

290
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:06,983
- But he wooed her.
- Wooed her how?

291
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:08,835
He's a real smooth talker, this guy,

292
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:10,954
And real good looking.
And he fucks actresses.

293
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:13,323
<i>- What actresses?
- All of them.</i>

294
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:15,808
Not jamie. She's not that kind of girl.

295
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:17,744
She jerked turtle on a plane.

296
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:19,829
Johnny, calm down. Take a deep breath.

297
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:22,481
<i>- Nothing's gonna happen.
- Not on my watch it ain't.</i>

298
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:24,183
Johnny.

299
00:14:24,218 --> 00:14:26,686
Gotta go. Gotta go.

300
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:30,373
I've got 45 minutes till class.

301
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:33,626
- You wanna hang?
- Yeah.

302
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:37,063
<i>Mr. Gold, miss grant and mr.
Klein are here to see you.</i>

303
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:40,617
55 minutes it took lloyd to find you.

304
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:42,936
Humor me, tell me where you were.

305
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,855
Fucking in the bathroom,
blowing him under his desk?

306
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:48,057
Ari, I don't wish to be spoken to like this.

307
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:51,995
And I don't wish to have to worry about
where you are and what you're doing.

308
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,463
You don't have to.

309
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:55,248
That's right, I don't.

310
00:14:55,282 --> 00:14:57,216
Because you're fired, both of you.

311
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:58,635
- What? Why?
- Ari.

312
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,954
Did you not hear about his wife

313
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,722
Providing us with this
morning's entertainment?

314
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:05,742
- I was out working.
- Working who?

315
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:08,194
John stamos. And I signed him.

316
00:15:08,228 --> 00:15:09,729
With a pen or his cock?

317
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:12,031
Ari, don't talk to me like that.

318
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:14,417
Whatever. It doesn't matter who you signed.

319
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:16,269
<i>You both are unquestionably
good at what you do.</i>

320
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:18,588
But call me old fashioned,

321
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,207
This won't work for me. Not in my office.

322
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:24,444
There is no more of this. Tell him.

323
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:27,664
- Tell him.
- There is no more.

324
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:29,682
- It's over.
- She ended it.

325
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:32,251
I left my wife, I left my family,

326
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:34,654
- I gave up everything.
- I didn't ask you to.

327
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:36,555
In fact, I told you not to.

328
00:15:36,573 --> 00:15:37,824
I love her. I love you.

329
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:40,159
You barely know me. Grow up.

330
00:15:40,194 --> 00:15:42,895
Ari, I heard your warning

331
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,299
And I have done everything since
then to make this mistake disappear.

332
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,835
<i>How can you call it a mistake?</i>

333
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:50,753
I would like to go back to my desk now.

334
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:52,672
I'd like to go do my job.

335
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:54,524
Go.

336
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:57,093
You so much as eye-fuck
another agent in this building,

337
00:15:57,127 --> 00:16:00,013
I will deport you naked to the taliban.

338
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:03,316
Oh, I thought we really had something.

339
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:07,203
You weak pathetic pussy.

340
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:08,805
I was never a weak man.

341
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:11,491
This transition,
this... god!

342
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:14,577
- It's just broken me.
- You're breaking me.

343
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:17,764
Ari, don't fire me, okay?

344
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:19,499
You know how well I'm doing.

345
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:22,118
You look great.

346
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:25,771
Last night was rough.
Marlo froze all my assets,

347
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:28,775
My credit cards. I couldn't get $5.

348
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:31,944
Lizzie wouldn't take me
in. I slept in my car.

349
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:34,247
Thank god we live in I.A. It's 70°.

350
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:38,284
I don't... I don't know
where I'm gonna go.

351
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:41,771
- Go home.
- Come on, marlo would never have me.

352
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:43,556
<i>Actually, she would.</i>

353
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,343
One in very few guys get that
have-a-free- piece-of-pussy pass.

354
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:49,729
You, my friend, have it.

355
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:51,297
Marlo wants you back.

356
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:53,032
- Really?
- Yeah.

357
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:55,151
I don't know. I don't know.

358
00:16:55,185 --> 00:16:57,487
- I don't know if I
could ever... - andrew!

359
00:16:57,521 --> 00:16:59,822
There was a time when marlo made you smile.

360
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:02,742
Remember that time. Remind her of it.

361
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:05,011
And if that doesn't work you do
what every other married man does,

362
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:07,113
Think of someone else when you fuck her.

363
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:10,283
But get it together, for
yourself, for your kids.

364
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:13,870
Most importantly, for me. Andrew, go home.

365
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:16,506
You have no other options.

366
00:17:18,826 --> 00:17:22,161
Hey, ashley. It's me again.

367
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:24,931
Listen, I'm freaking out a little bit.

368
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:26,599
I just... I don't
really under...

369
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,718
Understand where you went.

370
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:30,987
Would you call me, please?

371
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:32,605
Eric, fuck off!

372
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,529
I think my girlfriend
just told me to fuck off.

373
00:17:39,563 --> 00:17:42,014
<i>- Ouch, bro.
- Yeah.</i>

374
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:45,017
Hey, eric, did you meet
the incomparable steve nash?

375
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:47,036
- We were just getting acquainted.
- How are you doing?

376
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,272
I'm courting eric to be our newest manager.

377
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:52,458
- It's a great place.
- Seems pretty impressive so far.

378
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:54,293
Hi. Your parking.

379
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:56,212
- Murray, always a pleasure.
- Indeed.

380
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:58,831
- Eric, good luck with your girl.
- Thanks, buddy.

381
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,835
- Let me show you around.
- Steve nash, huh?

382
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:04,670
We represent a lot of athletes.

383
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:06,923
- You like football?
- You kidding? I love football.

384
00:18:06,974 --> 00:18:09,091
Maybe I'll take you to
the super bowl this year.

385
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:10,543
- How's that sound?
- Sounds great.

386
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:15,431
<i>Come on, you're an actor. Why so shy?</i>

387
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:16,916
Put the camera away, please.

388
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,052
God, I'm creating art
here. Are you not an artist?

389
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,604
I don't do nudity.

390
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:25,024
Well, what if I get a friend over
here and then she can tape for us?

391
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:26,492
<i>Uh, no.</i>

392
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:28,327
- Two friends? I can do it.
- Still no.

393
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:31,080
You know what? I've got to
get this. I've got to get this.

394
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:33,899
Yo, johnny. No.

395
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:35,668
- I lost her, bro.
- What do you mean?

396
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:38,754
I was at the commissary watching them
eat and they somehow slipped away.

397
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:40,907
She has to do the scene. I'm
sure she'll be right back.

398
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:43,793
Yeah, well, I hope so.
She's not in her trailer.

399
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:46,212
Hey, jimmy, did you see jamie?

400
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:47,830
I want to run lines before we shoot.

401
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:49,682
She's with coakley.

402
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:51,717
He just called to see if
we could push her an hour.

403
00:18:51,752 --> 00:18:54,053
<i>- And you said yes?
- Why wouldn't I?</i>

404
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:57,590
<i>- Because the guy's a predator.
- Why would I care?</i>

405
00:18:57,624 --> 00:19:01,060
Jesus christ. This is bad,
bro. This is really bad.

406
00:19:01,094 --> 00:19:02,912
<i>Uh, what?</i>

407
00:19:02,946 --> 00:19:04,830
Christ, it's turtle.

408
00:19:04,865 --> 00:19:06,432
Tell him I'll meet him
at the car in 20 minutes.

409
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:09,318
- I'm not answering it.
- You got to answer the phone, johnny.

410
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:11,704
Hang on.

411
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:15,208
Yo, turtle. All good, all good.

412
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:16,692
<i>- Class good?
- Yeah.</i>

413
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:18,227
You sound weird. Everything okay?

414
00:19:18,262 --> 00:19:20,079
No no, all good.

415
00:19:20,113 --> 00:19:21,764
I just tried jamie. She didn't pick up.

416
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:23,332
I was gonna grab vince and roll back over.

417
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,284
No need to do that.

418
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:26,586
Well, I'm gonna do it anyway, weirdo.

419
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,505
<i>See you in a bit.</i>

420
00:19:30,757 --> 00:19:32,008
Vince.

421
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:34,460
<i>Vince!</i>

422
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:36,229
- Oh shit. Hello?
- Don't stop.

423
00:19:36,263 --> 00:19:38,097
<i>- Johnny.
- We're ready for you, drama.</i>

424
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:40,816
<i>- I'm coming, I'm coming.
- Johnny, what did turtle say?</i>

425
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:43,853
He said he needs an hour.
Go find something to do.

426
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:46,272
<i>- Uh, okay.
- Later.</i>

427
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:47,973
Later.

428
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:50,142
Maybe you should call one
of those friends of yours.

429
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,827
You know, eric, I really like you.

430
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:53,779
Sloan knows a good thing when she sees one.

431
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:56,832
- Yeah, well...
- It's a pity you two aren't still together.

432
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:59,285
We're friends though. We both moved on.

433
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:03,005
How does the new girl feel about
your friend putting you up for a job?

434
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,259
- She doesn't know.
- Trust me, I've been married four times.

435
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:09,662
It's only a matter of time before
she finds out. She won't be thrilled.

436
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,014
Well, truth is, I'm not really thrilled

437
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:14,050
About my ex-girlfriendputting
mr a job either.

438
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:17,520
Well, get over it 'cause all
she did was tell me about you.

439
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:20,523
I've done my research and I like you.

440
00:20:20,557 --> 00:20:22,858
That's how I work. So what else?

441
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:24,644
Murray, this place is amazing.

442
00:20:24,678 --> 00:20:26,812
I mean, this is exactly
what I've been looking for...

443
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:28,681
A place with people to bounce ideas off of,

444
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:31,450
Resources, somewhere to feel
like I really exist in this town.

445
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:34,403
- And your concern is?
- That this is about vince.

446
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:37,206
- You're very insecure.
- Not usually.

447
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,125
Look, I want vince. Who doesn't?

448
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,127
But my business was not built on talent

449
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:42,861
'cause talent comes and goes.

450
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,498
<i>This place was built on the
people who work in this office.</i>

451
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:48,084
<i>- So if vince fired me?
- You think he would?</i>

452
00:20:48,135 --> 00:20:49,635
Well, he has before.

453
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,754
The pitfalls of having one client.

454
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:54,390
It's not a great situation.

455
00:20:54,424 --> 00:20:56,542
Which is exactly why you need to be here

456
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,010
Where they'll be multiple vinces.

457
00:20:58,044 --> 00:20:59,645
And should one tell you to fuck off

458
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,681
<i>You'd have nothing more than a bad day.</i>

459
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:05,318
I'm worth more than 90% of my clients, eric.

460
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:07,403
Here's my offer.

461
00:21:10,941 --> 00:21:12,825
Well, uh...

462
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:14,393
Yeah, I mean, I make more than this now.

463
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:16,746
If vince fired you, you'd make nothing.

464
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,081
Here you'd still make that. It's pretty good.

465
00:21:19,116 --> 00:21:21,000
And you do good, it'll get better.

466
00:21:21,034 --> 00:21:23,619
<i>You want to be a part of something?</i>

467
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:26,956
Yeah, I do.

468
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,907
Good, start Monday.

469
00:21:28,925 --> 00:21:31,243
- I'm gonna kill it for you, murray.
- I have no doubt.

470
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:33,746
Now go home and find out what
you did to your girlfriend.

471
00:21:33,764 --> 00:21:35,798
Thanks. I'll see you on Monday.

472
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,371
<i>- Standby!
- You know coakley banged my old girl, right?</i>

473
00:21:42,406 --> 00:21:45,191
- Shut up.
- I'm serious. Rachel.

474
00:21:45,225 --> 00:21:47,993
- Ready to try another take?
- Yeah yeah yeah, let's do it.

475
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:51,113
- I don't remember any rachel.
- Yeah, this was years ago.

476
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:52,832
I was devastated over it.

477
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:54,600
Didn't really recover till I got this show,

478
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:57,153
Which was dan's way of
apologizing. He didn't make me...

479
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:59,905
Would you stop talking about this?
This is an important episode for me.

480
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:01,574
<i>Okay, let's roll cameras.</i>

481
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:03,659
Yeah yeah, sure. I'm sorry.

482
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,046
Sound rolling, scene 23, take 6.

483
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:11,617
<i>Okay, and background action.</i>

484
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:13,786
<i>Action!</i>

485
00:22:13,804 --> 00:22:15,588
Her uncle don't got nothing on me.

486
00:22:15,622 --> 00:22:19,008
He's some loudmouthed,
wide-bellied...

487
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:23,813
Line! What's that line again?

488
00:22:23,847 --> 00:22:26,565
Jesus christ. Let's cut.

489
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,302
Uh, johnny, that's like six
takes. What's the problem?

490
00:22:30,337 --> 00:22:32,772
I'm just having a hard time focusing.

491
00:22:32,806 --> 00:22:34,139
Want me to get you some ritalin?

492
00:22:34,157 --> 00:22:35,908
No no, I got it. Let's go again.

493
00:22:35,942 --> 00:22:38,027
Yeah, let's do it right
away. Right away, come on.

494
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:40,780
You really worried about
what he's doing with jamie?

495
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:43,048
Hell yeah, he's worried. And he should be.

496
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,400
Shut up, brandon. You don't know anything.

497
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:46,252
<i>Okay, let's roll camera.</i>

498
00:22:46,286 --> 00:22:48,987
- Okay.
- I know it hurt when I lost my girl.

499
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:52,074
Probably would have hurt even more
if I lost my best friend's girl.

500
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:55,277
Sound rolling, scene 23, take 7.

501
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:58,697
<i>And action!</i>

502
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:07,289
- I'll be right back!
- Drama!

503
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:11,060
I need a ride to studio 8.

504
00:23:11,094 --> 00:23:13,596
No, man. I'm sorry, I have
to wait for mr. Busfield.

505
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,798
- Talent first.
- Sorry.

506
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:17,633
So am I.

507
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,969
<i>Seriously, come on.</i>

508
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:25,357
Yo, drama. Drama!

509
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:36,802
Hello, mr. Chase. Can I help you?

510
00:23:36,837 --> 00:23:38,237
<i>- Where's coakley?
- In a meeting.</i>

511
00:23:38,271 --> 00:23:39,672
<i>He doesn't want to be disturbed.</i>

512
00:23:39,706 --> 00:23:41,807
Me neither, but it's my lot in life.

513
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:48,013
What are you doing here, john?

514
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:49,999
Uh, where's jamie?

515
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:52,551
Uh...

516
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:55,187
Would you give us a second, please?

517
00:23:57,023 --> 00:23:59,859
What, do you have some kind of
self-destructive career death wish?

518
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:01,694
I just want to know where she is.

519
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:04,580
She should be back on set. I
finished with her 20 minutes ago.

520
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:07,166
Did you fuck her, dan?

521
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,134
- What?
- Did you fuck her?

522
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:11,637
You hitting that, john?

523
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:14,740
No, but my boy is. Which
means you better not be.

524
00:24:14,774 --> 00:24:18,244
Oh, careful, johnny. You are not a
good enough actor to threaten your boss.

525
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:19,895
Yeah well, I'm a good enough friend.

526
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,631
- Keep that in mind.
- Relax.

527
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:24,750
I didn't fuck her.

528
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:32,608
But I'm going to. 'cause
all I can think about now

529
00:24:32,642 --> 00:24:35,861
Is how sweet it would be to ram
tony soprano's daughter from behind...

530
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:40,533
Big mistake, john.

531
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,100
I can have you killed.

532
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:44,570
- Yeah? By who?
- The writers.

533
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:52,661
Move out the way, dead man walking.

534
00:25:08,562 --> 00:25:11,764
Ashley. I see you in there.

535
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:13,933
Would you just please open
up and tell me what I did?

536
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:24,026
<i>What do you want from me, eric?</i>

537
00:25:24,077 --> 00:25:25,327
I just want to know why you're mad at me.

538
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:27,980
Because you're a liar and I hate liars.

539
00:25:27,998 --> 00:25:29,982
I haven't even seen you since
we left. How could I have lied?

540
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,168
<i>- It doesn't matter.
- Please, I'm sure I can explain.</i>

541
00:25:33,203 --> 00:25:34,703
Yeah, I'm sure you can too,

542
00:25:34,754 --> 00:25:37,289
And I'd rather not set myself
up to look like an idiot again.

543
00:25:37,323 --> 00:25:38,841
Ashley, come on.

544
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,377
<i>Fine, tell me again what's
going on with you and sloan.</i>

545
00:25:41,428 --> 00:25:43,012
What? Nothing.

546
00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:44,830
Tell me when was the last time you saw her.

547
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:46,582
Where is this coming from?

548
00:25:54,357 --> 00:25:57,893
She called you. Said she saw you yesterday.

549
00:25:57,944 --> 00:26:00,379
You fucking lied to me and
I fucked you after you did.

550
00:26:00,413 --> 00:26:03,682
I didn't lie to you. You asked me
if I'd been with her and I haven't.

551
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,868
Yes, I saw her yesterday by chance.

552
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:08,520
She put me up for this job which is
why I'm considering not taking it.

553
00:26:08,538 --> 00:26:11,023
But I haven't been with
her. I swear on my mother.

554
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,875
Yeah, I knew you'd have an explanation.

555
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:15,210
- You're smooth like that.
- Smooth? I'm not smooth.

556
00:26:15,245 --> 00:26:18,163
Ashley, nobody's ever
called me smooth. Please.

557
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:20,165
Eric, just forget whatever this situation may

558
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:22,468
Or may not be and admit you
still have feelings for her.

559
00:26:22,502 --> 00:26:25,754
- Come on.
- Don't be like every other jerk in this town.

560
00:26:25,805 --> 00:26:28,974
Here's your one chance
to clear it all with me

561
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:31,093
And let me think of you in a good light.

562
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:34,013
Ashley, look, I like you a lot.

563
00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:35,564
Do you still have feelings for her?

564
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:37,900
Just answer me truthfully, please.

565
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:45,223
Yeah, I guess I do. Sorry.

566
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:47,443
Me too.

567
00:26:48,394 --> 00:26:50,029
Goodbye, eric.
