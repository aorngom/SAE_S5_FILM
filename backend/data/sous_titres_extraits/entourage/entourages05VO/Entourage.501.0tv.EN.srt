00:01:01,774 --> 00:01:05,482
5x01 - Fantasy Island

2
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,671
Subtitles: Sub-way.fr

3
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:28,926
Our next film is <i>Medellin</i>,

4
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:32,103
the ultraviolent story
of Columbian drug lord Pablo Escobar

5
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:34,906
staring Vincent Chase
in a fat suit and bad makeup

6
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:37,458
that makes him look like
the lovechild of Jiminy Glick

7
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:38,910
and a case of twinkies.

8
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,938
<i>Now at last year's
Cannes film festival</i>

9
00:01:41,098 --> 00:01:43,415
Medellin <i>from wunderkind
director Billy Walsh</i>

10
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:46,030
<i>was all the buzz
until people actually saw it</i>

11
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,653
<i>at the now legendary
Hindenburg of a screening</i>

12
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:50,155
<i>which I myself attended.</i>

13
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:52,368
<i>Now I usually try to keep
my opinions to myself</i>

14
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,410
<i>until we actually review
a film on this show,</i>

15
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,729
<i>but this time I got on my feet and
I booed with the rest of the angry mob.</i>

16
00:01:57,889 --> 00:01:59,798
<i>I would have thrown fruit
if I'd had some.</i>

17
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:02,259
<i>This is the silliest thing
to come out of South America</i>

18
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:04,502
<i>since the musical </i>Evita<i>.
It's overacted,</i>

19
00:02:04,662 --> 00:02:07,272
<i>it's underdirected,
it's paced like a snail.</i>

20
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:10,278
- <i>Did I mention it's long too?</i>
- <i>You did. It is.</i>

21
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:12,944
<i>The year is young,
but this is a good bet</i>

22
00:02:13,104 --> 00:02:15,120
<i>for my top 10
of the year's worst.</i>

23
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,074
<i>And by the way, Vince,
Al Pacino called.</i>

24
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:18,850
<i>He wants his </i>Scarface<i> accent back.</i>

25
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:21,526
<i>It's a real disappointment for me
because I had Vinnie Chase</i>

26
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:24,051
<i>on my list of stars
to watch in 2005.</i>

27
00:02:24,263 --> 00:02:27,484
<i>I think I'm gonna have him on my list
of stars to watch fade in 2008.</i>

28
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,629
- Suck it, dickbag!
- <i>With a budget I cannot imagine,</i>

29
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:33,223
<i>is a straight to dvd release,
if you can believe it.</i>

30
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:34,877
<i>It can be found at--</i>

31
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:36,725
Sorry, E.

32
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,971
It's okay.
Not like I wasn't expecting it.

33
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:42,350
Still, once you hear it
coming out of their mouths

34
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,501
on tv about you personally, it stinks.

35
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:47,245
I remember crying myself to sleep

36
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:50,215
when Roger Ebert singled out
my performance in <i>License to Drive</i>

37
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,176
as the end of the golden age of cinema.

38
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:54,663
<i>Oh, baby, fuck critics.
What do they know?</i>

39
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:56,620
Nothing, baby.
Nothing.

40
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,016
Will you mind telling me
when someone else is in the room?

41
00:02:59,265 --> 00:03:00,629
- <i>Sorry, E.</i>
- That's okay.

42
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,820
I just like to know you're there.
How's France?

43
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,895
<i>It's lovely.</i>

44
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:06,147
When are we gonna see you again
three dimensionally?

45
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:08,058
- <i>Soon, I hope.</i>
- Not soon enough.

46
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:09,041
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

47
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:11,168
I Miss you, baby.

48
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:12,880
<i>I Miss you too, baby.</i>

49
00:03:13,398 --> 00:03:15,073
I'm gonna talk to E for a second.

50
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:17,108
I'll check back in after I wash up.

51
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:19,517
<i>Okay, baby.
I love you.</i>

52
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,621
I love you.

53
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:23,536
- <i>Chirp.</i>
- Tweet.

54
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:28,153
What? Like you never had
a long-distance relationship?

55
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:29,780
Not one with bird noises.

56
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:30,981
Whatever.

57
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,359
I'm gonna get some sleep.
I need my beauty rest.

58
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,764
I'm shooting the <i>Five Towns</i>
poster tomorrow.

59
00:03:37,454 --> 00:03:39,582
Unless you want to pound
some whiskey and talk.

60
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:41,925
Nah, I'm fine.
I just hope Vince is okay though.

61
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,960
Poor baby bro.

62
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,537
Are we ever gonna get
to use the bed?

63
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:24,805
Come on, honey.
There's nothing wrong with the hammock.

64
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:38,649
Hey, Ari.
Fuck Richard Roeper.

65
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:41,085
- Michael phillips is a dick.
- Yup.

66
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:43,358
- I liked Gene Siskel.
- Whatever.

67
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:45,397
Give me something good, Lloyd.

68
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:48,533
First draft of my letter
to one Richard E. Roeper

69
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:50,863
reviewing him personally--
His clothes, his hair,

70
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:52,504
his nasally midwestern twang.

71
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:54,964
- Screw Chicago and--
- Attention everyone, please!

72
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,088
Listen up.

73
00:04:57,874 --> 00:05:00,401
No one mention
Richard Roeper again.

74
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:01,980
Not today, not ever.

75
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,752
By doing so,
you are simply announcing

76
00:05:04,912 --> 00:05:07,211
that on Sunday nights
instead of doing your job

77
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:10,013
reading scripts,
you're watching tv.

78
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:13,758
the next person
to mention Richard Roeper

79
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:15,160
will be fired.

80
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,488
And, Lloyd,
you will also be fired

81
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:19,923
if you don't answer
the fucking phone!

82
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:21,492
Ari Gold's office.

83
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:25,403
- I liked <i>Medellin</i>, Ari.
- Then you're a fucking idiot.

84
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,172
<i>Carl Urtz on one.</i>

85
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:29,035
Everybody get to work!

86
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:32,673
Carl, my man. How you doing?
I saw your trailer last night.

87
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,111
Very very scary stuff.

88
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:36,581
Makes <i>Nightmare On Elm Street</i>
look like <i>Free Willy</i>.

89
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,509
I saw Roeper last night.

90
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:42,420
<i>Fuck Richard Roeper.
You know, I went to college with him.</i>

91
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:45,257
When we was pledging
we used to tie beer cans around his nuts

92
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:48,793
and make him walk across campus.
I think last night was payback.

93
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,221
- I've been thinking about Vince.
- Oh yeah?

94
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:52,532
For <i>Danger Beach</i>.

95
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:54,190
I thought you had Emile Hirsch.

96
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,268
No, we don't.
Have you read it?

97
00:05:56,428 --> 00:05:58,537
- Despite the title.
- It's a working title.

98
00:05:58,697 --> 00:06:01,506
Listen, I read it.
It's good. It's good.

99
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,142
- I want to sit down with Vince.
- He's in mexico.

100
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:06,882
Yeah, I heard he's hiding out
on the beach somewhere, huh?

101
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:08,817
Think again.
He's doing improvised readings

102
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:10,841
with Cuaron and Del Toro
till something pops.

103
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:12,750
I'm not messing around, Ari.

104
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,586
I want Vince for this movie.

105
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:17,414
Carl, if you think you can
get Vinnie Chase,

106
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:19,717
the star of the highest
grossing movie of all time,

107
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:22,334
at a cut rate just 'cause
you think he's in a rut--

108
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:23,733
<i>Ari, I love Vince.</i>

109
00:06:23,893 --> 00:06:26,598
I've always loved Vince.
How many things did he turn me down on?

110
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:28,633
- One or two.
- <i>Six, but who's counting?</i>

111
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:30,268
I'll pay his full rate.

112
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:33,939
- Is this an offer, Carl?
- As soon as I sit down with him.

113
00:06:34,223 --> 00:06:36,100
Listen, I gotta go
to Greece on Wednesday,

114
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,350
which means
I need to see him tomorrow

115
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,637
at The Grill for lunch.
See if you can make it happen.

116
00:06:40,797 --> 00:06:42,195
I'll do what I can.

117
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,155
Get E on the phone
right fucking now.

118
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:50,121
The murphy group.
Can I help you?

119
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,596
Just one second, please.

120
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,368
Just don't tell him the script
sucked like you did last time.

121
00:06:57,528 --> 00:06:58,847
Yeah, but it's not funny.

122
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:01,125
'Cause it's <i>Cold case</i>.
It's not supposed to be funny.

123
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:03,602
- Leave the comedy for the stand-up.
- All right.

124
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:06,338
A Mr. Ari Gold's on the phone.

125
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,438
Tell him I'll call him back.

126
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:09,939
You trust me?

127
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:11,975
Soon as I get a job,
then I'll trust you.

128
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:14,304
It's been three months,
you've had four screen tests.

129
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:15,843
You're gonna get a job soon.

130
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,772
You got to tell my mom this.
She's the one killing me.

131
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:21,873
Mr. Gold says it's urgent.

132
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,489
Will you put him through, please?

133
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:25,880
Sorry, Charley.

134
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:28,285
Well well well,
long time no hear.

135
00:07:28,445 --> 00:07:30,469
You got Bea Arthur
answering the phones for you?

136
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:32,600
- I'm in a meeting. What do you want?
- Ah, yes.

137
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,726
The Murphy group doubling in size
the past five months to two clients.

138
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:38,169
- I have three clients.
- You do?

139
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:40,238
I mean, I thought
I was your only client.

140
00:07:40,398 --> 00:07:41,965
Besides the guy on the wall.

141
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,975
You're the only one
that matters, Charley.

142
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:47,445
- What do you want, Ari?
- To bring our boy back from the abyss.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,749
- How are you planning on doing that?
- Already in motion. We got an offer.

144
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:53,084
- <i>You got an offer? For what?</i>
- Danger Beach.

145
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:55,797
- I thought it was Emile Hirsch.
- No, Vincent Chase is doing it.

146
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:58,001
Wow, you really are in the business.
You read it?

147
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:00,445
Oh yeah, I read it. I liked it,
except for the dumb title.

148
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,068
It's a working title.

149
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:05,124
- Are they gonna pay him?
- Wow, all about the money these days.

150
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,924
Makes me proud and yet a little sad

151
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:10,127
that you've lost that
prepubescent boyish charm.

152
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:12,396
Yeah, they're gonna offer him
his full quote.

153
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:14,306
Come on. That's unbelievable!

154
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:17,732
Well, start believing and start breaking
out your best travel agenting skills

155
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:19,980
because we need him here
by lunchtime tomorrow

156
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,672
to have a meeting with Carl Urtz.

157
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:23,209
What kind of meeting?

158
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:26,518
Carl wants to see if his eyes
are still as blue as ever.

159
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:30,155
- So do we have an offer or a meeting?
- We have an offer pending a meeting.

160
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:33,091
An offer pending a meeting
is not a fucking offer, Ari.

161
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:35,093
How long have you been
in this town, Opie?

162
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:37,229
An offer pending a meeting

163
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:40,966
is what you get
when you make a shit movie

164
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:44,169
and haven't been seen this side
of the border in six months.

165
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:46,282
We're living in a post <i>Medellin</i> world.

166
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,540
But amazingly enough,
if Vince shows up

167
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,140
with all of his limbs intact

168
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,689
and doesn't have some sort
of seizure in front of Urtz,

169
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:56,014
we are back in the game.
Okay, you'll call?

170
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,798
Hey, I've got to roll, man.

171
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,677
Yeah, Ari.
I'll call, I'll call.

172
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:01,191
Good luck, Charley.

173
00:09:01,646 --> 00:09:04,048
What luck? You got to take me.
I don't have a car.

174
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,778
You've been in LA six months
and you don't have a car?

175
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:08,460
I can't afford a car, all right?

176
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:10,595
Get me a job, then I can get a car.

177
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:12,013
Let's go.

178
00:09:20,398 --> 00:09:22,625
We gonna outdo
last year's poster, Johnny?

179
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:24,525
You know it, son.
You know it.

180
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:28,683
So I told the mofo
nobody upstages Johnny Chase.

181
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:32,780
Okay, perfect.
That's perfect.

182
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:36,652
Johnny, switch partners with Ron
and take Linda now.

183
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:38,019
No problem.

184
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:41,709
Beautiful, I love it.

185
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:43,587
Okay, spin her again.

186
00:09:43,747 --> 00:09:45,030
As you wish.

187
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:49,967
Could <i>Dancing With the Stars</i>
be next for us?

188
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:52,170
Beautiful, beautiful.

189
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,806
Okay, now some more serious stuff.
Everyone just give me a left side pose.

190
00:09:58,036 --> 00:10:00,178
Beautiful.
Lovely. Lovely.

191
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:02,267
Everyone give me a right side pose.

192
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:05,922
Johnny, you want to turn to the right?

193
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:08,645
- Uh, no, not really.
- Oh god, here we go.

194
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,289
- Why not?
- 'Cause actually, I don't go right.

195
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,575
- What do you mean?
- I mean I don't go right.

196
00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:16,761
It's my bad side.
Everyone knows that.

197
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:19,007
- I didn't know that.
- Have you ever seen the show?

198
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,591
No. But I'm in Europe a lot.

199
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:23,627
Well, we've done 54 episodes
and I've never gone right.

200
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:25,871
Even if we do 500 more I never will.

201
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:27,672
Come on.
Let's just get this done.

202
00:10:27,832 --> 00:10:29,765
Let him shoot you
without a padded bra, Linda,

203
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:32,927
- then I'll let him shoot my right side.
- I really don't see the issue.

204
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:36,381
You don't see this right here?

205
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:39,342
Maybe we should call the producers.

206
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:41,690
Maybe we should.

207
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:44,352
Okay, people, let's take a break.

208
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,619
Go ahead, call the producers.
What, is this guy threatening me?

209
00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:51,422
They know. Eddie Burns knows.
Everyone knows.

210
00:10:51,582 --> 00:10:53,962
Shooting me from the right
makes me look...

211
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:55,219
Freakish.

212
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:27,877
- The life, huh?
- Oh yeah.

213
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:29,799
- Anyone hungry?
- Getting there.

214
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,970
Could we make it
to the beach-side fiesta?

215
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,350
When you put it like that,
who could say no?

216
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:39,201
Yo, Vin.

217
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,035
It's the real world calling.

218
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:43,515
- Ma?
- E.

219
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:45,617
- Really?
- Should I answer it?

220
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:46,792
Yeah.

221
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:51,088
Yo, E, what's up?

222
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,917
<i>How's your office?
Any of your wannabes touching my shit?</i>

223
00:11:54,077 --> 00:11:57,261
Your office has remained untouched.
And I'm sure it will continue to be.

224
00:11:57,421 --> 00:11:58,575
<i>Let me talk to Vince.</i>

225
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:00,724
Not if you're gonna rain
on our parade of pussy.

226
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:03,184
- Put him on the phone, Turtle.
- <i>Vin, talk to E.</i>

227
00:12:05,553 --> 00:12:07,105
- Yo, E. How goes it?
- <i>Great.</i>

228
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:08,851
We got a project for you.

229
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:10,934
No hello?
No how are you?

230
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:12,670
Sorry about that. How are you?

231
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,465
- <i>How do I sound?</i>
- You sound good.

232
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:16,345
- I am.
- <i>Good.</i>

233
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:17,916
- How are you?
- I'm good.

234
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:19,788
Good.

235
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:22,730
- What you got?
- A cool genre movie.

236
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,249
The producer wants you.
Could you come back and meet him?

237
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:27,375
Sure. Send the script,
we'll set up a meeting.

238
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:29,222
- It's got to be tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

239
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,329
What's the rush?
I'd have to leave right now.

240
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,003
You can't leave before the fiesta.

241
00:12:33,163 --> 00:12:35,426
- I can't leave now.
- It's a really good script.

242
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:37,494
- Yeah, what is it?
- It's called <i>Danger Beach</i>.

243
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:40,564
- It's called <i>Danger beach</i>?
- Sounds stupid.

244
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:42,905
- It's a working title.
- What do you think, girls?

245
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,743
Should I do a movie
called <i>Danger beach</i>?

246
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:47,186
- Don't think so.
- Nobody here likes it.

247
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:50,015
- It's a working title.
- Yeah? Well it's not working for me.

248
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:52,443
- I'm getting hungry.
- <i>Vince, you got to trust me.</i>

249
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:55,320
<i>I do trust you, E.
And I love you and I Miss you.</i>

250
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,781
But I'm not going back right now.

251
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,998
Not on a day like this.
Not when Maria's cooking.

252
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:01,726
She cooks like you wouldn't believe.

253
00:13:01,886 --> 00:13:04,203
- Hey, I cook good things too.
- Course you do.

254
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,490
<i>I got to go. I'm being rude.</i>

255
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:08,844
- Okay, I'll talk to you later, E.
- Bye.

256
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:11,641
Later, sucker.

257
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:29,857
Look, man.
Don't worry.

258
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,949
I'll carry the Murphy group.

259
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,445
What do you mean
he's not coming back?

260
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,698
I mean, you want me
to say it in Spanish?

261
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:41,438
<i>Why do I have 300 clients</i>

262
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:42,760
and you have two

263
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,162
and you don't seem to care that one
of them is retiring in his prime?

264
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:48,106
What is it you think I can do, Ari?

265
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:50,401
- You two have a little rift?
- What?

266
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:52,167
Playing the <i>Medellin</i> blame game?

267
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,779
Let it go like a bad piece of pussy.

268
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:57,182
Just forget that you smelled it
and move on.

269
00:13:57,682 --> 00:13:59,476
<i>If he passes on this thing now,</i>

270
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:02,521
he might as well be Cat Stevens
doing butterfly strokes

271
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:05,190
in the Caspian Sea
searching for Mohammed.

272
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,518
'cause that's how he's gonna
be viewed in this town.

273
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:10,695
I spoke to him. I know him
better than you. He's not coming back.

274
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:12,130
Then we're going to him.

275
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,124
Drama's the only one
who knows where he is.

276
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:16,627
Call Drama and meet me
at the Van Nuys airport in 40 minutes.

277
00:14:16,787 --> 00:14:18,475
Really?
Are you supplying the plane?

278
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:20,279
That's how much I care.

279
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:24,676
- How'd it go?
- Shitty.

280
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:27,445
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- No, man, I let you down.

281
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,707
You didn't. We'll get 'em next time.
Don't worry.

282
00:14:30,222 --> 00:14:31,861
- Do me a favor though?
- What's up?

283
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:34,752
Drive me to the airport.
Take my car for the night.

284
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:38,894
Shit, fuck the audition.
Let's roll.

285
00:14:40,116 --> 00:14:42,160
You see what I'm talking about,
right, babe?

286
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,929
I look awful from this side.

287
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:46,398
<i>I wouldn't say awful,
but I see what you're saying.</i>

288
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:50,235
- You're the only one who gets me.
- <i>Just let them shoot you how they want</i>

289
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:52,504
<i>and if it doesn't look good
they won't use it.</i>

290
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:55,284
Baby, I love your naiveté,
but you don't get this town.

291
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:57,768
You've got to cover your own ass
'cause no one else will.

292
00:14:58,212 --> 00:14:59,611
They can say what they want,

293
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:02,239
but I know the reason
I got recast for the <i>Models Inc.</i> pilot

294
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,942
was because the director
kept shooting me from the right side.

295
00:15:05,553 --> 00:15:07,945
That's why test scores
said teenage girls were scared of me.

296
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:09,954
But how can anyone
be scared of you?

297
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,583
Shit. Who is it?

298
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:15,686
It's Tommy. They got Ben Silverman
coming down from his office.

299
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:17,676
You better get your ass out here now.

300
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,299
Jesus, the network chairman
is coming down right now.

301
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:24,469
- <i>Just do what he says, Johnny.</i>
- I can't do that, baby.

302
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:27,072
I struggled for 20 years
to get to where I am.

303
00:15:27,232 --> 00:15:29,708
I'm not gonna let them force me
to looking stupid again.

304
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:31,196
I won't do it, no way.

305
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,912
Tommy, thanks.
But you tell Silverman

306
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:36,021
I'm not doing it.
Not for him, not for no one.

307
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:38,216
<i>Johnny, you have me so worried.</i>

308
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:40,025
Hold on one second, baby.
One second.

309
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:43,571
I need to know exactly
where you sent Vince to in mexico.

310
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:45,056
No go. It's a hideaway.

311
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:47,092
Vince said nobody gets to go
unless he says so.

312
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:49,653
- He's coming.
- I can't talk right now.

313
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:51,120
It's an emergency.

314
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:56,341
An emergency?
Is baby bro in trouble?

315
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:58,128
Yeah, kind of.

316
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:01,051
I'm on my way.

317
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,808
Baby, I've got to fly.
Vince is in trouble.

318
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:05,816
I'll call you back
in two minutes, okay?

319
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:07,386
- Tweet.
- Chirp.

320
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,861
- Johnny Chase.
- Mr. Chairman.

321
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,501
Shoot me any way you want.

322
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:15,355
I've got to get to Mexico.

323
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:19,746
Fucking waste of time.

324
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:33,376
I could use another shot
if you guys are gonna do this.

325
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:52,866
Boss, the plane.
The plane.

326
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:55,594
How many times
you gonna do that joke, Turtle?

327
00:16:55,754 --> 00:16:57,521
Till it don't get a laugh, baby.

328
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,902
Come on, Carol, that was funny, right?

329
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,350
Fresh air.

330
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,418
- Oh my God.
- Jesus.

331
00:17:18,077 --> 00:17:19,951
- Look at you.
- E, what's up, bud?

332
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:23,420
- Nice suit.
- I love it. Good to see you.

333
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:29,794
You must be really desperate
to come running down here.

334
00:17:29,954 --> 00:17:32,702
Listen, the producer Carl Urtz,
six for six.

335
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:33,844
I know Carl.

336
00:17:34,004 --> 00:17:35,914
He makes 'em for cheap
and they make big bucks.

337
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:37,762
It's a perfect way to come back strong,

338
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:40,272
on a movie the genre
already has a built-in audience.

339
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:43,403
Is there any kind of role in this movie?
One that requires me to act?

340
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,769
The same kind of role
Shia Labeouf had in <i>Disturbia</i>.

341
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:48,274
You look scared a few times,
smile so girls want to fuck you

342
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,941
and laugh your way all the way
to the next <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>.

343
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:52,376
Sounds challenging.

344
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:54,928
Listen, we need to get
the 18-25-year-olds back.

345
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:56,899
The ones that have forgotten you exist.

346
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,496
They've forgotten that I exist?

347
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:01,293
Don't take it personally, bro.
The whole country's on meth.

348
00:18:01,677 --> 00:18:04,129
- So what do you think, Vince?
- I don't know.

349
00:18:04,504 --> 00:18:08,200
I don't feel like running back right now
for a non-challenging career move.

350
00:18:08,578 --> 00:18:10,828
We're having a good time here.
Even Turtle's getting laid.

351
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:11,900
Yeah, a lot.

352
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,972
It's vacation pussy.
Anyone can get that.

353
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:16,672
You see these girls back in the states,
they won't even look your way.

354
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:18,969
I think you're arguing
against our point there, Drama.

355
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,880
Look, we are desperate.
We haven't had an offer in six months.

356
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,919
- You guys are starting to sound alike.
- Starting to look alike too.

357
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:27,836
Vinnie, listen.

358
00:18:27,996 --> 00:18:30,021
What happens if another
offer doesn't come in?

359
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:31,849
It may not.
What then?

360
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:34,216
What if one doesn't?
You think I'm gonna suffer?

361
00:18:34,376 --> 00:18:36,094
Come on.
Look at this place.

362
00:18:36,254 --> 00:18:38,463
I live like a king for $79 a day.

363
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:40,978
I got great food,
fantastic women,

364
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:44,035
and I wake up every morning
with a big fat smile on my face.

365
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:47,045
Look at you guys.
Fighting the rat race.

366
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:50,154
Wearing uncomfortable shoes.
Angry all the time.

367
00:18:50,502 --> 00:18:52,858
Life is not all about
making money and movies.

368
00:18:53,018 --> 00:18:54,275
At least mine isn't.

369
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:57,782
Ari, it's siesta time.
It's time to chill.

370
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,363
We'll talk about it over dinner.

371
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:03,380
- We're not staying for dinner.
- I know.

372
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,257
You should stay.
The food's real good.

373
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:08,719
But know if you do stay,
you guys are sharing the hammock.

374
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,724
Vince, can I talk to you alone
for a second?

375
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:15,993
Is it gonna be another one
of your famous pep talks?

376
00:19:16,153 --> 00:19:17,999
Call it what you want.
Two seconds, come on.

377
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:19,613
Excuse me, ladies.

378
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:23,500
You really want
to go out on the bottom?

379
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:25,549
- Bottom?
- Yeah.

380
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,942
<i>Medellin</i> sucked
and the whole world knows it.

381
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:30,715
You disappear now that's all 
people are gonna remember you for.

382
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,993
When did I ever care
about what people think?

383
00:19:33,153 --> 00:19:35,469
All right, maybe you can
go out like this, but I can't.

384
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:38,495
I'm the one that found <i>Medellin</i>.
I got to spend the rest of my life

385
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:41,318
thinking I ruined my best friend's
career 'cause I couldn't make it good?

386
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:44,427
I know how good you are, Vince, and
I know you got big things ahead of you.

387
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:47,463
You've done everything for me,
but you've got to do one more thing.

388
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:49,960
Help me let you get back
to where you were supposed to be.

389
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,903
Then you can retire
on any beach you want

390
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:54,448
and you won't have to worry
about me killing myself.

391
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:55,791
That's a pep talk?

392
00:20:00,472 --> 00:20:03,243
All right, E.
I'll go for you.

393
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:05,709
Thank you.

394
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:09,354
Hey, Ari, get the plane ready.
We're going home.

395
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:11,456
Wait wait wait,
I need an hour.

396
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:14,025
Carol, I'm leaving tonight, baby.

397
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:15,884
You need to shave.

398
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:23,468
- My face feels weird.
- I feel you, bro.

399
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:26,371
I felt like an amputee
when I played that high school swimmer

400
00:20:26,531 --> 00:20:28,323
with alopecia back on "7th heaven."

401
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,600
Vince with alopecia
would still look better than you.

402
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,146
This script is not that bad.

403
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:34,204
Stop reading and driving
before you kill us.

404
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:36,690
Sorry, I picked it up this morning
and I couldn't put it down.

405
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,169
It is good.
You were right.

406
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:39,985
- Real dumb title though.
- Real dumb.

407
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:41,653
Reminds me of a Hitchcock movie.

408
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:43,883
What do you guys think
of <i>M Is For Amnesia</i>?

409
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,024
I think the tropical sun
melted your brain.

410
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:48,193
- No good, Vin?
- No good, Turtle.

411
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:50,621
- What about <i>High Tide</i>?
- I like that.

412
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:52,354
- It's pretty good, actually.
- See?

413
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:54,273
I have a purpose here.
What's yours, Drama?

414
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,091
It's my day off. Get off my ass.

415
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,264
- There he is.
- What are you doing here?

416
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,633
- Moral support.
- I told you I don't need any.

417
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:05,035
- Well, I'm here just in case.
- It'll be fine.

418
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:07,012
Tear it up, baby bro.
Tear it up.

419
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:08,723
You're back, Vin.

420
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:14,545
This is what you losers do
all these years? You wait?

421
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:17,070
Sometimes when I'm alone
I do that.

422
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:22,373
I'm going back to the office.

423
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,953
- Later.
- I got girl on girl too, Ari.

424
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:30,891
Will you roll up the window, you idiot?

425
00:21:41,506 --> 00:21:43,282
Look, Vincent Chase.

426
00:21:44,076 --> 00:21:47,351
- I thought he was dead.
- Only till he's alive again.

427
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:52,332
- Oh Jesus -
- What?

428
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:57,629
- So, Mexico, huh?
- It was phenomenal.

429
00:21:57,854 --> 00:22:00,864
I'm more of a Caribbean guy myself.
Lot of history.

430
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,408
So, <i>Danger beach</i>.

431
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:07,472
I have to say, I read it on the plane
and it is really really good.

432
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:10,798
- You sound surprised.
- The title threw me at first. But,

433
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:14,138
it's a unique story and this character
is better than I've seen in a long time.

434
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:16,741
Fantastic. And you know
we're working on the title now.

435
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:18,947
What do you think about <i>High Tide</i>?

436
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:22,120
<i>High Tide</i>. I like that.
I like that a lot.

437
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,289
- Hi, Carl. -
- It's got a-- Adam.

438
00:22:24,449 --> 00:22:26,338
Nice to see you.
You know Vinnie Chase.

439
00:22:26,498 --> 00:22:29,160
- I do. I used to represent Johnny.
- Oh yeah, that's right.

440
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:32,652
- Crazy running into you here.
- Indeed.

441
00:22:32,812 --> 00:22:36,125
Always good to see you, Adam.
Guess I'll talk to you soon.

442
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:40,278
I guess so.

443
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,073
He seems angry.

444
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:45,534
He's an agent.
They're all pricks.

445
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:49,881
Ari gold's office.

446
00:22:50,214 --> 00:22:52,383
Really?
Interesting.

447
00:22:55,886 --> 00:22:58,296
- Adam Davies calling.
- For me?

448
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:04,095
If you need a kidney, Adam,
I'm not willing to donate.

449
00:23:04,255 --> 00:23:07,674
But I'm willing to watch you slowly die
if you're looking for that.

450
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:10,202
- You lost your touch, Ari.
- Oh yeah? How's that?

451
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:11,977
Urtz doesn't want Vince.

452
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:15,183
<i>You were set up. He was just trying
to force me to close Emile Hirsch</i>

453
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:17,031
at $2 million less than I wanted.

454
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:20,244
Explain to your client that you
dragged him back here for nothing.

455
00:23:20,404 --> 00:23:23,155
- I'm gonna skull-fuck you, Davies!
- You just did, Ari.

456
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,936
- What did he want?
- Fuck you, Yoko. Get E on the phone.

457
00:23:28,183 --> 00:23:30,483
- I will beat Carl Urtz's ass.
- Will you calm down?

458
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,439
No, no calm. Let's go to his house
and beat him in front of his kids.

459
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,915
I know where he lives.
I used to drive him home from softball.

460
00:23:36,075 --> 00:23:38,255
I still see him at the rub and tug
every now and then.

461
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:41,488
- You have a girlfriend.
- I go there for facials, asshole.

462
00:23:41,648 --> 00:23:43,841
- Come on, let's go kill Urtz.
- Guys, will you stop it?

463
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:46,882
I appreciate the backing
but no one's killing Urtz, all right?

464
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:48,899
You should kill me
'cause it's my fault again.

465
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:52,053
Shut up. You couldn't have seen
this coming. Nobody could have.

466
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:55,080
And you didn't push me into "Medellin."
We did it together.

467
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:58,356
- Well, thanks. I appreciate that.
- Although you did approve the makeup.

468
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:01,578
The guy said it was gonna look good
on film. How am I supposed to know?

469
00:24:02,022 --> 00:24:03,155
It didn't.

470
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,447
Oh boy. So what now?
Back to Mexico?

471
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:09,951
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm not going out like this.

472
00:24:10,111 --> 00:24:11,876
I thought you don't care
what people think?

473
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:14,247
- I care a little.
- You're gonna be bigger than ever.

474
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:17,067
You're gonna take back the throne.
If I made it back,

475
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:18,970
so can you, baby bro.

476
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:20,677
Thanks, Johnny.

477
00:24:29,418 --> 00:24:31,586
It's right here. Kill
the lights. Kill 'em.

478
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,726
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm gonna golf, you're gonna caddy.

479
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,409
Five iron.

480
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:46,298
The maserati, really?

481
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:49,093
It is nice.

482
00:24:58,937 --> 00:25:01,213
- What are you, the godfather?
- I'm sending a message.

483
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:03,421
- Saying what?
- Aquaman will be back.
