3
00:01:15,145 --> 00:01:17,063
Oh, it's Ari again.

4
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,768
- All right, I'm gonna take this.
- You want to take it?

5
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,043
Thank you.

6
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:24,046
Can't you wait for a call back?

7
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:27,651
As a French might say,
no, I fucking can not.

8
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:28,795
<i>You know why, Eric?</i>

9
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:31,333
It's because I have a box
of rare truffles

10
00:01:31,413 --> 00:01:33,171
sitting on  my desk,
a gift from Harvey.

11
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:34,739
- Do you know why?
-  I can guess.

12
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,776
It's because you sold him on a movie
you're in no position to sell.

13
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:41,939
Now he thinks we're all travelling
to Cannes together.

14
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:43,966
Don't worry about it,
it's not your problem.

15
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:45,135
<i>Not my problem?!</i>

16
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:47,780
Did you know that Harvey
was a marine, Eric?

17
00:01:47,912 --> 00:01:49,070
A middle class Jew,

18
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:52,857
who grew up with everything,
yet he chose to join the marines.

19
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,819
- <i>Do you know why?</i>
- No, why?

20
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,626
It's because, and I quote,

21
00:01:56,973 --> 00:02:00,096
he wanted to know
"what it felt like to kill someone."

22
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:03,383
He will now kill me
when I'll tell him what you did.

23
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,983
Yo, I set a dinner.
I'm telling him tonight, so relax.

24
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:08,452
- You're gonna tell him in person?
- That's right.

25
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:10,445
What I wouldn't pay to see that.

26
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:12,213
Save you're money for botox, Ari.

27
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:14,256
All that negativity's starting
to take its toll.

28
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:15,593
Call waiting. Later, loser.

29
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:18,126
- Lloyd, I see dead people, why?
- I don't know

30
00:02:18,196 --> 00:02:20,160
but M. Night just call
to say he doesn't see you.

31
00:02:20,238 --> 00:02:22,427
Well, I'm at the cemetery
just like he said.

32
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,755
<i>Remind me again
why I put up with this shit?</i>

33
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:27,540
Because his movies have grossed
almost 2 billion dollars

34
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:30,623
- and because you're scared of him.
- Thank you, but I fear nothing.

35
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:36,774
- Little jumpy, Ari?
- We're in a cemetery, Night.

36
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:38,525
Even for you, this is bizarre.

37
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,218
Don't be an ass.
I'm shooting an IMAX commercial.

38
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:43,338
Oh, great.
And you want me to star on it?

39
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:45,456
That's why you've summon me
to the Valley?

40
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,865
No, I finish a new draft of a screenplay
and I don't trust messengers.

41
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,661
You like 6 weeks ahead of schedule.
You bring yourself in it?

42
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:53,198
I'm gonna improv a little something.

43
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:55,508
Oh, Indians and improv,
no greater match.

44
00:02:58,317 --> 00:03:00,559
- You gonna read it tonight.
- Of course I will.

45
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:02,704
Don't tell me you will if you won't.

46
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,283
My night, M. Night,
will be dedicated to nothing

47
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:07,323
but enjoying your latest creation.

48
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,121
I'm gonna drive by your office
in the morning and I'll pick it up.

49
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:11,935
- And I'm gonna quizz you.
- As always.

50
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,808
- Alright, Ari.
- See you, Night.

51
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:17,926
You've got the Misses'
best friends dinner tonight.

52
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,606
Oh, fuck!
Look at this thing, it's 200 pages.

53
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:24,187
Find me a flashlight, I'm gonna have
to read this at the table.

54
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:26,507
Why do we have to bring this guy
out with us, Johnny?

55
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:28,297
'Cause he's the mayor of Beverly Hills.

56
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:30,611
Then why do you care
if you don't live in Beverly Hills?

57
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,118
I care because the mayor

58
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:34,638
could use his political clout
to annex my condo in.

59
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,243
How do you like to see this place
rocking a 90210 zip code?

60
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:40,630
You're 40 feet from the border now,
what's gonna change?

61
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:43,493
It's like asking what changes
between North and South Corean borders.

62
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:44,997
Yeah, it's a good analogy.

63
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,426
Turtle, come here.
Look out that window.

64
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,092
You see that brand new fire station
out there? That's Beverly Hills.

65
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:53,005
Do you know, if they were looking here,

66
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:55,228
they'd see me burning,
they couldn't do anything about it.

67
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:58,288
I would have to wait hours
for LA County to come and save me.

68
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:01,091
I don't wanna wait, Vin.
I wanna be saved.

69
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:03,282
You are beyond saving, Drama.

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,656
- Vince can save me.
- How?

71
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:08,860
Guy just wants to roll with the big time
celebrity for the evening.

72
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:11,318
- Have a good time.
- But you're a big time celeb, Johnny.

73
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:12,599
Why do I have to go?

74
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:14,947
Well, apparently, he doesn't watch TV.

75
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:18,730
Look, the annexation vote
is on Wednesday.

76
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:20,994
He knows what I want and aluded

77
00:04:21,114 --> 00:04:22,892
to the fact
that one hand washes the other.

78
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:27,321
I need my hands wash, baby Bro.
And you are the soap.

79
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:29,196
It's Thursday night, Vince.
Fuck his hands.

80
00:04:29,197 --> 00:04:30,197
Shut up, Turtle.

81
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:32,271
- Is he a good guy, Johnny?
- He's a great guy.

82
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,560
We puff stogies at the Vanmall
all the time.

83
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:36,133
- Okay, we'll bring him out.
- Yes!

84
00:04:36,163 --> 00:04:37,208
Bring who out where?

85
00:04:37,246 --> 00:04:39,988
We roll with the mayor of Beverly Hills.
Too bad you got to miss it.

86
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:41,086
Oh, yeah. Too bad.

87
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:43,364
- Harvey should be fun, though.
- Shut up, Turtle.

88
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,272
Why you can't just
tell Harvey on the phone?

89
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:48,366
Maybe he loves to feel Harvey
spit me a lobster out of.

90
00:04:48,543 --> 00:04:50,822
No, I just want to be a man
and own up face to face.

91
00:04:50,897 --> 00:04:54,277
You know what? E went out on his own,
against the family on this,

92
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,119
he may have to take a little spit.

93
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:57,272
Thanks, Vince.

94
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,584
- Little scared of Harvey, huh?
- I'm not afraid of Harvey.

95
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:02,931
Because, I will go with you,
if you ask nicely.

96
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,015
The mayor, Vince.

97
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,427
No, I got myself into this,
I can get myself out of it.

98
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:07,666
That's the spirit, kid.

99
00:05:07,696 --> 00:05:10,708
And I'm not afraid of Harvey. I'm trying
to be professionnal and courteous

100
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,499
by doing this but I'm not gonna sit there
while he yells at my face.

101
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:14,651
You're gonna fight Harvey?

102
00:05:14,712 --> 00:05:16,897
- No, don't fight Harvey, E.
- Harvey's big, E.

103
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:19,200
Yeah, E, I think Harvey
can definitly take you.

104
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:21,993
You said that you can take me.
You want to go?

105
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:23,084
I will fucking...

106
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,153
I'm simply asking you
not to dilly-dally.

107
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:36,711
That's all.

108
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:39,729
And I'm not gonna rush their dinner.
This is my best friends engagements.

109
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:41,459
Come on.
She's been married twice before,

110
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,114
I'm sure we'll get another run of this.

111
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:45,126
I already stood in the driveway
waiting for you.

112
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,073
Just chew fast and don't order
an appetizer... or dessert.

113
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:49,242
Give me a break!

114
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:52,036
Oh, Joyce, you look beautiful.

115
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:53,992
- Thank you. I'm so excited.
- Me too.

116
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:55,956
Perfect timing, Ron's at the bar

117
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,726
and we thought we'd get
a before dinner drink. What do you say?

118
00:05:59,085 --> 00:06:00,211
- No?
- No, we're starving.

119
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:02,144
So, grab your man.
Let's get this thing rolling.

120
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:05,925
He's kidding, we would love
to have a drink... or two.

121
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,791
Slow down, Turtle.
It's the French country on the right.

122
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:19,637
Nice house.

123
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:21,803
He is the mayor of Beverly Hills, bro.

124
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:23,724
Pull over there, Turtle.

125
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:28,054
What you're doing?
Let the major know we're here.

126
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:29,749
You don't honk, you beheaded dog,

127
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:33,003
You ring the bell like an upstanding
Beverly Hills citizen would do.

128
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,364
Too late.

129
00:06:36,644 --> 00:06:38,050
Don't forget your corsage.

130
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:42,869
Mayor Lawry!

131
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:44,659
John Chase...

132
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,712
Is that Vinnie Chase I see in that car?

133
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:49,447
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm Turtle.

134
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:52,229
Vinnie, I am a big fan.
Big, big fan.

135
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,767
My kids,
they're just obsessed with Aquaman.

136
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:57,341
My daughter cried
when they replaced you in the sequel.

137
00:06:57,397 --> 00:07:00,615
Said she will not see it
no matter how good it is.

138
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,763
- Tell her thank you.
- I will. I will.

139
00:07:02,877 --> 00:07:04,128
Ready to go to hell?

140
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:05,785
Yeah, yeah. Huh...

141
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:08,666
Got to grab a jacket first.
Walk with me John.

142
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,363
Yeah, this guy's an affair
riding with us.

143
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,905
I really appreciate this.

144
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:16,843
My wife's been gone for over a year now
and I've been really lonely.

145
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:19,122
Hey, what are friends for, now?

146
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:21,775
Yeah, but I think
I'm gonna take my own car.

147
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,754
You sure you don't want
to have Turtle chauffeur?

148
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:27,324
Then we can get hammered
and have a really good night.

149
00:07:27,585 --> 00:07:30,218
You know what would make it
a really great night, John?

150
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:33,540
It's if that movie star brother
of yours could help provide me

151
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:37,245
some comfort of a foxy young thing
I don't have to pay for.

152
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:39,508
He could do that.

153
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:56,364
Hi, how are you?
Huh, I'm here to meet Harvey Wei...

154
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,552
- Mr. Murphy?
- Yes.

155
00:07:57,592 --> 00:07:59,099
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

156
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:06,145
How are you, Eric?

157
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:07,674
Hey, how are you, Harvey?

158
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:10,905
Good, good. Great, great.
I'm great. Sit, sit.

159
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,024
Try that wine.

160
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,565
- It's good.
- Good?

161
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:23,561
That's a '53 Margaux.
It's 33 hundred bucks a bottle.

162
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,896
I only drink it
on celebratory occasions.

163
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:27,845
This being one,
I ordered two bottles.

164
00:08:27,897 --> 00:08:28,974
Let's celebrate.

165
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:31,896
Listen, Harvey.

166
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,332
Well, would you look like at this?

167
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:34,559
See that little cunt?

168
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,272
That prick stole my VP of production.
He's lucky I don't go over there

169
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:40,429
and crack this fucking bottle
over his head.

170
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:42,735
I'm not gonna do that, though.

171
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:44,648
My doctor says I can't do that anymore

172
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:46,689
'cause my blood pressure
is off the charts.

173
00:08:48,648 --> 00:08:49,648
So...

174
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,228
You and me, E.,
stress free dinner.

175
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:55,407
- To Medellin.
- Medellin.

176
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:59,544
I have never been
so embarassed in my life.

177
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:01,169
What? Wait...
What's so bad?

178
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,843
You got the check
before we got our entrées.

179
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,789
- At least, I paid, right?
- You are such an asshole.

180
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:08,388
That may be.
But I'm an asshole

181
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:10,286
that's gonna be home at 9.30
ready to read.

182
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:11,802
Let's get an early start on this.

183
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:13,510
Grab my briefcase, you read to me.

184
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:14,597
Screw you.

185
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:16,361
Come on, baby, be a team player.

186
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,895
If Night pulls
another half billion dollars gross

187
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:20,790
out of his hat,
I'll get you some diamonds.

188
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,856
- Briefcase isn't here.
- What do you mean?

189
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:26,924
Just what I said.

190
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:29,132
You sure you didn't leave it
in the office?

191
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,743
What, you don't believe me?

192
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:36,461
Jesus Christ.

193
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:38,896
The valet probably stole it.

194
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,208
Don't be racist.

195
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:42,187
Valets steel shit, alright?

196
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:44,895
Just because they're mostly Hispanic
doesn't make me a racist.

197
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:46,355
You know what happens if it gets out?

198
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,563
If someone puts Night's new ending
on the Internet?

199
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:49,716
My life is over!

200
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,231
Nobody's gonna know you did it.

201
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,590
Yes they will. Because Night,
that little sick fuck,

202
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,928
printed my name
on every fucking page.

203
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,438
So maybe the valets put it in the truck.

204
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,631
It's gone, no fucking here.

205
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,221
They fucking stole it.
They motherfukers stole it!

206
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:09,209
What...

207
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:10,673
Did they replace it with this?

208
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:11,858
What the fuck is that?

209
00:10:12,584 --> 00:10:13,584
You tell me, freak.

210
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:14,931
I have no idea!

211
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,516
Well there's a whole bag!

212
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,938
The seats aren't stuck
as they suppose to be.

213
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,521
- What?
- They gave us the wrong car.

214
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:23,004
- Shut up.
- Get in there.

215
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:24,240
What are you, fucking blind?

216
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:26,032
You're the one
who drive it home, shmuck!

217
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:27,664
Why would I buy a black cock?

218
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:35,101
Where the fuck are our salads?

219
00:10:36,022 --> 00:10:37,943
Hey, pal. Pal!

220
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,072
How long we got to wait
for our lousy icebergwich?

221
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:44,258
You slice the fucking thing,

222
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:46,350
you put it on a plate
and you bring it over here!

223
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,298
Anyway, E,
what was I talking about?

224
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:52,599
You're saying that you, huh...

225
00:10:52,897 --> 00:10:55,546
you were pissed off on us
after we fucked you over in Sundance.

226
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:57,423
Yeah, I was raging.

227
00:10:57,711 --> 00:10:59,918
Sure, you little pricks
make me call a press conference

228
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,368
to annonce I'm in business with you
and then you bail on me?

229
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,724
I know, that was, huh...

230
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:05,796
that was a big mistake, Harvey.

231
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:06,960
It was a mistake?

232
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:09,619
That was some mistake.

233
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:12,973
Don't you ever make a mistake
like that with me again.

234
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:15,546
Because next time,
I'm not gonna be so kind.

235
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:17,587
I killed people.

236
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,966
Do you mind if I use the bathroom?

237
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:21,086
Sure, go ahead.

238
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:25,675
On your way over there,
walk by that cunt's table

239
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:27,577
and give him
a little elbow on the head.

240
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:30,414
If you feel like it.

241
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,111
How am I gonna get
this guy a laid, Johnny?

242
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:40,199
Seriously.

243
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:43,267
Tell girls if they fuck him,
you'll fuck 'em after.

244
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,497
That sounds like
a good deal for Vince.

245
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:46,651
He'd be lying.

246
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:49,098
Oh, Jesus.

247
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:50,928
How did he beat us here?

248
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,391
What's up, Vince?

249
00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:05,949
<i>How is it going over there?</i>

250
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:07,155
It's not.
This guy is nuts.

251
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:08,333
He's tittering on the edge.

252
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:09,791
Did he yell at you?

253
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:11,547
He didn't,
because I didn't tell him yet.

254
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:13,465
I thought you said
you're not afraid of Harvey.

255
00:12:13,555 --> 00:12:15,338
I ain't,
but it wouldn't be good for anybody

256
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,818
if I ended up rolling on the parking lot

257
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:18,899
with one of the most powerful men
in Hollywood.

258
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:20,240
So what you want me to do?

259
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:21,297
I want you to come down here.

260
00:12:21,298 --> 00:12:23,174
- I'm with the mayor, E.
- <i>Fuck the mayor.</i>

261
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:25,864
Harvey's not gonna make the same kind
of scene if you're here.

262
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:27,030
Swallow your pride,

263
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,293
admit you're afraid of him
and I'm there.

264
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:30,999
I'm not scared of Harvey.

265
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,565
How long you think you can keep me
waiting at the table

266
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:34,755
without me getting antsy?

267
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,146
Sorry about that.
I'm actually talking to Vince right now.

268
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,284
Hey, Vince.
How the fuck are you?

269
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:41,486
Hey, Harvey.

270
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:42,814
<i>Where are you, son?</i>

271
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,871
I just walked in a place
called Winston's

272
00:12:44,991 --> 00:12:46,008
I love Winston's.

273
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:47,928
We'll come over there
for a celebratory toast.

274
00:12:48,531 --> 00:12:51,206
Walk the other way, David,
or I'll pull out your fuckin' eyeballs.

275
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:53,049
- Yeah, we see you soon.
- See you.

276
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:54,804
Come on, eat!

277
00:12:58,065 --> 00:12:59,822
Nel really likes this one over here.

278
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:01,923
Could you go talk to her?

279
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:10,341
It's a black LS Hybrid.

280
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:13,229
So don't be afraid to step on the gas
and get it up here.

281
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:15,062
But, sir, this is a black LS.

282
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:17,393
That's the wrong black LS, obviously.

283
00:13:19,242 --> 00:13:21,136
Okay, do you... is there a manager?

284
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:24,179
I am the manager.

285
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:25,847
An English speaking manager?

286
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:28,556
- I speak English.
- First language English speaking?

287
00:13:28,697 --> 00:13:30,605
It's okay.
You switched cars on us.

288
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,396
Oh shit, that's not your car.

289
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:37,587
The guy who just left with the same car,
accused us of stealing his glasses.

290
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,867
Here they are.

291
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,380
Wrongfully accuse again.

292
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,776
So, he's gone?

293
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:44,660
Yeah, but I'm sure he gonna
come back as soon as he realizes.

294
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,863
I don't have time to wait.

295
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:47,960
I have something I need
to get off the car tonight.

296
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,178
There's nothing you can do...

297
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:51,320
There's always something
that can be done, baby.

298
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:53,844
Sometimes, you just have to think
really, really hard.

299
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:55,406
So everybody think.

300
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,078
And do we got something?
You got something?

301
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:04,718
You could always go to his house
and hope that he's home.

302
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:06,126
What, you know where he lives?

303
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,610
But does it never occurs to you,
rich people,

304
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:11,152
that when you are enjoying
a nice dinner, we have your keys

305
00:14:11,212 --> 00:14:12,703
and your fancy navigation system

306
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:14,681
to lead us straight
to your empty house?

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,266
I like your style, Pal.

308
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:25,654
Oxnard. How far is that?

309
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,070
About 50 miles.

310
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,540
You're taking me home first.

311
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,430
Thank you, sir.

312
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,997
5-5-3-2

313
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:38,799
Cool, so I call you at like... 2.00?

314
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:39,867
Huh, make it 2.30,

315
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:41,866
the boys and I usually grab
a bite late night.

316
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:47,750
Thought you're supposed to phone
for the mayor, not ourselves.

317
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,148
I'm just not a good wrangler.

318
00:14:49,178 --> 00:14:51,883
Yeah but I am, and I've been wasting
my skills on Drama's cause.

319
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,781
You're telling me you'd be
poll in it if it was for your cause?

320
00:14:54,953 --> 00:14:57,604
Of course I would be.
What kind of question is that?

321
00:14:58,122 --> 00:15:00,632
Fellas, guess who's into politics?

322
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:01,934
This is Enika.

323
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:02,931
Anika.

324
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:06,299
- Anika, the boys.
- Hello, boys.

325
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:07,761
Anika is from Prague.

326
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:10,751
I told her a little about our man
and she's very impressed.

327
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:12,697
Gotta love the eastern block.

328
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:14,495
Back in a flash.

329
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:21,047
Nel, say hello to Anika.

330
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:25,137
Anika, the one and only mayor
of Beverly Hills, Nel Lawry.

331
00:15:25,243 --> 00:15:28,979
Johnny has told me of your dedication
to the city and of your kindness.

332
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,487
It is so nice to meet you.

333
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:31,827
You too. You too.

334
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,829
Would you like to sit?

335
00:15:34,055 --> 00:15:35,516
Yes, I would love to.

336
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:43,489
My God, you have gorgeous feet.

337
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:46,931
How about that.

338
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:49,619
How about this?

339
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:53,763
He looks like a P.O.W.
(ny: POW = prisoner of war)

340
00:16:13,877 --> 00:16:16,233
- Who is it?
- Hi. My name is Ari Gold.

341
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:18,108
- I think you have my car.
- What?

342
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:21,112
- What are you talking about?
- Will you open the door?

343
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:23,445
No! And I have a dog!

344
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,872
That's great.
I think you also have my car.

345
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,858
Do you drive a black Lexus?

346
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:29,938
My husband does.

347
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:34,072
Well, I think the valet gave him
the wrong car, 'cause I'm driving his.

348
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,497
- Valet? What valet?
- The valet at Morton's tonight.

349
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:42,437
- Morton's in LA?
- Yeah.

350
00:16:42,677 --> 00:16:45,930
What was my husband doing
at Morton's in LA tonight?

351
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,494
What the fuck were you doing
at Morton's tonight?

352
00:16:56,686 --> 00:16:59,011
- What?
- The valet switched our cars.

353
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:01,931
- What?
- Answer me! Who the fuck were you with?

354
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:04,279
See? That's my briefcase!
Thank you God!

355
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:06,465
Answer me, you piece of shit!

356
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:07,585
- What?
- Listen,

357
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:09,433
here are your keys. Can I get mine?

358
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:12,590
I am fucking waiting
for a fucking answer!

359
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:14,164
Deny it 'til you die, pal.

360
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:18,722
I'll tell you what,

361
00:17:19,268 --> 00:17:22,265
Just admit that you're scared of him
and I'll apologize for you.

362
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,483
I don't need you to apologize. I just
want you to be here when he goes down.

363
00:17:25,563 --> 00:17:27,216
I'm right here!
What are you waiting for?

364
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:28,383
The right moment!

365
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:32,009
Buy the chuck,
we're they real Winstons or what?

366
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,684
Yeah, only mine is the good looks,

367
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,560
ten in a buttonny five hundred, suit.

368
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,322
I got one of those suits, bro.

369
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:38,815
Yo, Ben!

370
00:17:39,469 --> 00:17:40,482
Yo, Ray!

371
00:17:40,882 --> 00:17:42,268
This is delicate.

372
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,562
- What's that?
- You know, the boy you came in with?

373
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:46,028
Yeah. What about him?

374
00:17:46,228 --> 00:17:47,988
He's about to suck face with a tranny.

375
00:17:48,163 --> 00:17:49,214
What? Come on...

376
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,868
That's no tranny, Ray! That's Anika!

377
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:53,730
Anika's got a bigger stump
than you do, Drama

378
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,958
If you John had knew that,
he would have kept her for himself!

379
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,138
Ray, are you sure?

380
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:01,895
Trust me. The only reason we let
that he/she in here

381
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,815
is cause she goes on Howard Stern.

382
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:06,629
We don't need a bad ink. I'm sorry bro.

383
00:18:07,563 --> 00:18:09,456
- I can't believe it!
- Believe it, Drama.

384
00:18:10,043 --> 00:18:12,043
- Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
- No doubt, man.

385
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:14,566
What do we do?

386
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:16,432
I ain't saying shit.

387
00:18:16,658 --> 00:18:18,951
Nobody's saying nothing until I'm 90210.

388
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:20,604
Johnny, you'll find out eventually

389
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,551
that you'd better pray
he's not your mayor.

390
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:23,938
Do the right thing!

391
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:27,471
- Fine, I'll tell him.
- E.?

392
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:30,297
I'm going.

393
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,217
A couple of shots, first, to relax?

394
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,603
Definitely!

395
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:48,894
Yeah, Lloyd?

396
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,636
<i>Just make sure you're up and reading.</i>

397
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:52,987
<i>Well, I'm up
and I'm not fucking reading!</i>

398
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:54,627
You're even angry in the evening?

399
00:18:54,794 --> 00:18:55,820
Fuck off, Lloyd!

400
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:57,548
Good night, Ari.

401
00:18:58,114 --> 00:19:00,180
- Yes, alright.
- Talk to me while I drive

402
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:02,107
- so I don't fall asleep.
<i>- Okay, Ari.</i>

403
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,773
Oh, fuck!

404
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,261
- What?
- I'm getting pulled over.

405
00:19:07,524 --> 00:19:08,804
<i>How fast are you going?</i>

406
00:19:08,937 --> 00:19:10,031
225.

407
00:19:10,244 --> 00:19:11,270
That's not good...

408
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:17,885
Cheers!

409
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:22,418
I'm going in.

410
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,245
And E., why aren't your feet moving?

411
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:27,551
Alright. I'm scared of him.

412
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:31,321
We'll see...
Come on. I'll talk to him.

413
00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:33,241
I'll stand right next to you.

414
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:35,620
We'll all be hanging back, having fun.

415
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:38,176
Hi.

416
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:41,562
Or not...

417
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:49,615
Anika, would you excuse us for a second?

418
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:51,455
Yeah, sure.

419
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:54,681
You'd better hurry back,
or I'm gonna come chasing.

420
00:19:56,443 --> 00:19:57,623
I will.

421
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:02,454
Hey, John, what's happening?

422
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,107
- It's about Anika.
- Yeah?

423
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,747
You know, we didn't even need
Vinny central, huh?

424
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,066
Thank you.

425
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:15,373
I tell you, she is one doll...

426
00:20:16,653 --> 00:20:19,840
Yeah, well, according to some,
that Barbie might be a Ken.

427
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:22,400
She might have balls, Your Honor.

428
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:23,758
What?

429
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,252
She's a he, transformer, hermaphrodite,
something that just ain't right.

430
00:20:27,705 --> 00:20:31,012
I don't believe that. Look at her!
She's beautiful.

431
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,491
I got only reasons to lie to you now.

432
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:36,962
It's true!

433
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:40,364
- I'm sorry.
- I am too!

434
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,097
I appreciate your honesty.

435
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:52,618
And I would appreciate
your palsy's discretion

436
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:55,178
cause I don't care
what she's got under that dress.

437
00:20:56,698 --> 00:20:59,272
We have a connection. She gets me!

438
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:03,985
Hey, babe,
you're ready to get out of here?

439
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,098
I got a blue Mercedes tainted windows
see out there in ten minutes.

440
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:15,268
What about my annexation?

441
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,851
Looking good!

442
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:21,769
Sweet.

443
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:26,999
I love you.
Sit down.

444
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:31,274
So... So, what's on your mind?

445
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,267
- It's about <i>Medellin.</i>
- What about it?

446
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:35,866
- We...
- Vodkas, fresh cranberry.

447
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:38,738
- I ordered tonic.
- No, you didn't, you ordered cranberry.

448
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:41,353
Why would I ordered cranberry
if I don't drink cranberry?

449
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:42,855
I don't know, but you did.

450
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:44,570
You believe this fucking guy?

451
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:47,186
I'll give you a tonic.

452
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:50,258
Don't give me a tonic.
Tell me I didn't ordered cranberry.

453
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,796
- But, you did.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

454
00:21:52,907 --> 00:21:54,109
Just get the tonic guy.

455
00:21:56,213 --> 00:21:57,571
Don't go anywhere.

456
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:00,977
What are you doing?

457
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:03,272
I'm not telling him.
He's out of his mind.

458
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:05,142
You know what?
I'll do it.

459
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:09,595
Harvey, look.

460
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,354
You look me in the fucking face.

461
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:14,863
You tell me why,
that after fifty years of life,

462
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:17,690
and never having even sipped
cranberry juice,

463
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:21,501
for some reason, I come in here
and I order cranberry juice?

464
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:23,950
Can you answer that,
you fucking scumbag?

465
00:22:24,106 --> 00:22:26,154
No, I can't, but you did.

466
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:28,469
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

467
00:22:28,603 --> 00:22:30,685
- Take it easy, sir.
- Don't tell me to take it easy!

468
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:32,043
You know who the fuck I am?

469
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:34,958
I was rolling my balls when
you were sucking your mother's titty!

470
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:36,851
- Let's leave my mother out of this.
- Fuck you!

471
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:38,943
- Fuck him!
- Alright pal, you out of here.

472
00:22:39,144 --> 00:22:40,212
Come on!

473
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,172
Get your fucking hands off me!

474
00:22:42,974 --> 00:22:44,956
So you let Vince do your dirty work,
huh, E?

475
00:22:45,557 --> 00:22:46,625
Nah, he couldn't do it.

476
00:22:46,803 --> 00:22:48,673
Hey, E, had him, after all.

477
00:22:48,862 --> 00:22:51,322
Nah, I didn't get a chance too either.
But I'll try tomorrow.

478
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,502
Tomorrow?

479
00:22:52,614 --> 00:22:54,951
What?
You weak, weak man.

480
00:22:55,085 --> 00:22:56,187
Hey, Harvey!

481
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:58,346
We're not selling you the movie.

482
00:22:58,602 --> 00:23:01,029
Sorry bro, we're putting it
on the open market in Cannes.

483
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,077
You're gonna have
to bid like everyone else.

484
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,992
I'll eat you alive.

485
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,919
I'll eat you alive,
and trifle you out of my tooth !

486
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:09,836
After what you've done this time.

487
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,350
You'll never work again!

488
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:14,512
Never! You understand me?
Your career is over!

489
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:18,809
He was talking about E, not me, right?

490
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,797
Morning, Ari.

491
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:28,028
Done.
Night in me office?

492
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:30,036
- Yes sir, he just got here.
- Perfect timing.

493
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:31,992
Are your wearing
the same suit as yesterday?

494
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:33,373
I spent the night in jail.

495
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:34,920
Oh my God!
Why didn't you call me?

496
00:23:34,942 --> 00:23:38,081
You get one call, and I wanted to use it
on someone I like to have sex with.

497
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:39,817
Genius.
Best script yet.

498
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,621
Ask me anything.

499
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,866
How could you
possibly like that third act?

500
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:47,426
Are you kidding?
The twist with the dove? I loved it.

501
00:23:47,449 --> 00:23:49,052
- It was perfect.
- No, it's fucked!

502
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:50,877
What you read is totally fucked!

503
00:23:51,211 --> 00:23:53,570
I tried to call you last night.
You didn't have your cell.

504
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:54,750
I dont' understand.

505
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,155
After you left, it hit me.
The all 3rd act is a mess, man.

506
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,390
It's a mess!

507
00:23:58,858 --> 00:24:01,051
I changed it.
It really works, now.

508
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:04,813
You read it.

509
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:08,077
I'll wait.

510
00:24:09,636 --> 00:24:11,350
Start from the top scene, get the flow.

511
00:24:24,757 --> 00:24:26,182
Morning, fellas.

512
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:30,266
- Get them while they're hot.
- You just saved E's ass.

513
00:24:30,377 --> 00:24:32,492
He's been wresling
with your expresso maker for an hour.

514
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:35,431
Wrestle no more, E.
I got your favourite caramel macchiato.

515
00:24:35,564 --> 00:24:37,880
I hate caramel, but very thoughtful,
nonetheless.

516
00:24:38,047 --> 00:24:39,093
Indeed, it was.

517
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:40,802
But even more thoughtful,
were the coffees

518
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:42,682
I brought over
to the Beverly Hills firehouse

519
00:24:42,735 --> 00:24:44,269
when I went over to introduce myself.

520
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:45,668
You're expecting a fire,

521
00:24:45,732 --> 00:24:47,908
or you just hoping to slide up
and down on their pole?

522
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:51,037
You slay me!

523
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:53,486
No, really, I'm just proud to be a...

524
00:24:53,553 --> 00:24:55,233
soon to be annexed resident

525
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:57,876
of the queen city known
throughout the world as Beverly Hills.

526
00:24:58,518 --> 00:25:01,011
Yeah, I wouldn't be too proud
too fast, Drama.

527
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:03,215
How much longer your boy
is gonna be mayor?

528
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:04,696
What are you talking about?

529
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:08,879
I'm talking about the all seeing,
all knowing lenses of TMZ.com.

530
00:25:09,332 --> 00:25:10,648
Look at this.

531
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,366
Hey, mayor, I'm from TMZ,
how about saying a little something?

532
00:25:17,188 --> 00:25:18,611
Howdy folks!

533
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,027
Why are you sneaking out the alley?

534
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:24,168
I'm not sneaking.
There's no sneaking going on here.

535
00:25:24,276 --> 00:25:25,940
Fast in the car, babe.

536
00:25:34,147 --> 00:25:35,490
That's nuts.
