Subtitles: sub-way.fr

3
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:07,147
<i>Good morning, Mr. Murphy.
This is Amy Miller's office.</i>

4
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:08,930
<i>I have Charlie Williams on the line.</i>

5
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,491
- <i>Can you please hold for Amy?</i>
- Sure, what's up?

6
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,637
- <i>Yo, E, what's up?</i>
- What, are you working out?

7
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:17,891
You know... Just was up all night.
Didn't get no sleep.

8
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:19,126
A little nervous.

9
00:02:19,246 --> 00:02:21,771
Nothing to be nervous about.
Your script is great.

10
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:23,914
Jesus, Charlie.

11
00:02:25,032 --> 00:02:26,380
- Gentlemen.
- Hey, Amy.

12
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,706
Hey, Amy.
What's up?

13
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:29,614
I loved your script is what's up.

14
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,435
- Are you serious?
- That's phenomenal.

15
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,168
When do we shoot?

16
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:35,645
Okay, slow down.
We need to cast the other roles first.

17
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:37,786
- <i>We can do that</i>.
- You got anybody in mind?

18
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,253
I do for the owner of the surf shop.

19
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:42,990
And, I hope you don't mind
that I already spoke with him about it.

20
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,148
Who?

21
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:45,316
Seth Green.

22
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:50,276
- I love seth green.
- Great, we have an overall with him,

23
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:52,336
so we just think
it would be a perfect fit.

24
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:54,110
He could be.
What you think, E?

25
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:56,805
He said you guys
were really good friends and,

26
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:59,390
that you should just
call him to lock it down.

27
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:02,936
<i>I think you should do that.
You should definitely lock it down.</i>

28
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:05,114
Lock it down.

29
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:09,648
Fuck Seth Green.

30
00:03:09,768 --> 00:03:12,278
I still got a piece of his friend's
tooth lodged in my knuckles.

31
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:13,662
Seth Green is a punk.

32
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:16,031
A punk that Charlie and the studio
want to do the show with.

33
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,142
So I got to be professional
and put the shit aside.

34
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:21,321
Hear hear, no more wasting
energy on gripes and grudges.

35
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:22,919
- How you feeling?
- Rejuvenated.

36
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,437
Did you sleep on that tempur-pedic
pillow I put on your bed?

37
00:03:25,557 --> 00:03:26,755
I sure did. Thank you.

38
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:28,910
They dropped off
your sides this morning.

39
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,437
- Thank you, Turtle.
- So E's got to kiss Seth Green's ass

40
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:34,535
and we don't get to take down
the douche director.

41
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:36,083
Sorry to ruin the dream.

42
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:37,846
- I don't believe it.
- What's wrong?

43
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:41,399
- He give away more of your lines?
- No, he just cut out most of them.

44
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:45,336
Cocksucking nazi bastard.

45
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:50,082
Jesus christ! Is it too much to ask
for a goddamn egg in the house?

46
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:52,110
- What's your problem?
- What's your problem?

47
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:54,237
Be more immature.

48
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:56,263
If a man can't have
breakfast cooked for him,

49
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:59,407
is it too much to expect a trip to the
store so he can cook it for himself?

50
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:01,953
Mom cooks us breakfast every morning.
You're always at work.

51
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:05,685
Let me get this straight.
All women defend each other blindly?

52
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:08,198
- Daddy!
- There he is.

53
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:10,469
Finally a man
who can understand me.

54
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:12,797
Hey, Jonah, you hungry?

55
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:16,808
How about...

56
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:18,643
Some eggs?

57
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:20,467
Yes, please.

58
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,628
- What's really bothering you?
- You would not understand.

59
00:04:23,748 --> 00:04:26,582
You are a delightful,
unspoiled little girl.

60
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:28,980
I'm 15 and obviously
more adult than you.

61
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,553
So what's your problem?

62
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:33,451
Okay, little Miss adult.

63
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:36,775
My problem is that I can't run
my business the way I want to.

64
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:38,973
Not with that woman
as my partner.

65
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:42,182
Your mother controls me at home,
she controls me at work.

66
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:44,080
Where can a man be a man?

67
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,582
A man can be a man

68
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,497
when he stops whining
and asks for things nicely.

69
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:51,134
- I asked her.
- You asked her or you told her?

70
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:53,046
You need to convince a woman.

71
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:55,457
Andrew Klein is a good agent
with good clients.

72
00:04:55,577 --> 00:04:59,309
- Barbara shouldn't need convincing.
- So explain that to her... Nicely.

73
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:02,388
Really?
You think that'll work?

74
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:05,062
You pretended you were nice
and you got mom.

75
00:05:05,182 --> 00:05:06,527
Is that what she told you?

76
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:08,102
Mom said she fixed you.

77
00:05:09,564 --> 00:05:11,168
Little man.
Girls have cooties.

78
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,942
Mia doesn't have cooties.
I like her.

79
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:16,527
No, she has cooties.
She has cooties. Come here.

80
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:23,100
It's him.
It's him.

81
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:27,967
Hello, is Seth in?

82
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:30,555
- Who's calling
- <i>It's Eric Murphy</i>.

83
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,211
Is your pussy wet, Eric Murphy?

84
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:35,433
- Come on, Seth.
- Tell me,

85
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:38,136
Eric murphy,
do you have a wet pussy?

86
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:39,602
<i>Well?</i>

87
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:41,876
No, Seth,
I don't have a wet pussy.

88
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,096
My god.

89
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:44,806
Well, that's too bad,

90
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:47,789
because who's gonna want
to fuck your dry pussy?

91
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:51,633
That's hysterical. You want
to talk about this pilot or not?

92
00:05:51,753 --> 00:05:54,649
I do, because I really like it, man.

93
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:56,923
But, do you really
feel like we can work together

94
00:05:57,043 --> 00:05:58,773
after everything
that we've been through?

95
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:01,235
I can put personal shit aside
for business. Can you?

96
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:03,571
I don't know.
I'd really feel more comfortable

97
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:05,812
if we could just meet
face to face and discuss it.

98
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,234
- I'm up in big bear.
- How about 1:00 p.m.

99
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:09,789
Village pizza on Larchmont?

100
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:11,771
I don't think
I'm gonna be able to make it.

101
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:14,141
You should make it there if
you want me to do your pilot.

102
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:15,336
Later, E!

103
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:17,979
That sounded like it went well.

104
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:20,240
He wants me to drive into
the city and meet him today.

105
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,196
- That's okay. Go.
- You sure?

106
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,679
Yeah, I can hand herr director.

107
00:06:25,103 --> 00:06:26,244
There he is.

108
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:29,135
Should I gun it and run him over?

109
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,138
Or should we take the slow

110
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,003
and painful approach
and piss in his O.J.?

111
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:36,205
It's cool, guys. I got this.

112
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,269
Yo, E, why don't you
go get us a tv show

113
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:41,731
just in case I don't have
a career as a silent film star?

114
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:43,257
I'll talk to you guys later.

115
00:06:43,377 --> 00:06:44,902
Call me if you need reinforcements.

116
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:46,944
I can be down there
in two and a half hours.

117
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:48,607
Morning, Vincent.

118
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:50,854
- What a wonderful day.
- Not really.

119
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:54,673
I'm sorry to hear that.

120
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:56,676
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to talk to you.

121
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:59,031
Of course.
What's troubling you?

122
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,551
I'm not exactly happy
with the way things are starting off.

123
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,285
Don't you think it's just
the insecurities of an artist?

124
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:08,931
I have those days myself.

125
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:11,899
No, I'm speaking more to the fact
that you gave away

126
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,081
and let me believe
that they'd been stolen.

127
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,064
Not exactly a good first day.

128
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:17,795
I think it was a good day.

129
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:20,642
It was an excellent day
except for the little misunderstanding.

130
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:23,413
Is that why you took
all my lines away today?

131
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:28,576
I don't understand why,

132
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:30,663
everything has to be so personal.

133
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,413
- Really, you don't?
- No.

134
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:36,406
The captain is the leader
and I needed those lines for the leader.

135
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:38,572
You should have just told me.

136
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,552
Yes, I know I should have told you.
I'm sorry, I forgot.

137
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:44,511
- Are we okay? Good?
- What about today's lines?

138
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,334
They're gone
but your character is in.

139
00:07:47,454 --> 00:07:49,654
Verner, without that big
monologue from yesterday

140
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:51,780
my character has no redemption.

141
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,027
And without the lines
from this morning's scene

142
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:55,722
he's got no point of view either.

143
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,172
I love your passion.
I can see that you care.

144
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,307
- You're an inspiration.
- That's great,

145
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:01,794
but I'd like to do the scene

146
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,153
as it was originally intended,
as it's supposed to be.

147
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:09,266
Actors and their words.

148
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:11,619
I understand.
You'll have your words.

149
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:14,664
- You'll do the scene as written?
- Yes, so we have that.

150
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:17,285
Then we do it the other way
so we have that too.

151
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,467
Any word from the wicked witch
of the east wing?

152
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:28,649
She's in your office.

153
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,897
She came over to thank you
for your lovely flowers.

154
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:32,817
- Good work.
- Andrew Klein called twice.

155
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:33,966
What did he want?

156
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:36,231
To know if you know
any good moving companies.

157
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:38,747
Good morning, Barbara.

158
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:40,606
Thank you for the flowers.

159
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:42,608
Was that your idea or Lloyd's?

160
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:46,364
My partner has been named the 33rd
most powerful woman in hollywood

161
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,600
and you think
I wouldn't care enough to send flowers?

162
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,491
- I'm hurt.
- Just checking.

163
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:53,390
What time is the luncheon, by the way?
I'd love to show up.

164
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,663
No men allowed.

165
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,290
So it's more of a rugmuncheon
than a luncheon?

166
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,914
Okay, this has been
a nice morning so far,

167
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:02,003
but I'm gonna leave
before it takes a bad turn.

168
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:03,650
It's not gonna take a bad turn.

169
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,674
I just want to apologize
for putting you on the spot last night.

170
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:09,001
I don't get put on the spot,

171
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:11,283
- but apology accepted.
- That's very kind of you.

172
00:09:11,403 --> 00:09:13,306
Would you please, as a favor to me,

173
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:16,067
consider meeting Andrew
and giving him a chance?

174
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:17,191
Please.

175
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:20,438
- Please?
- Yes, sincerely. Please.

176
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,774
Okay, I'll meet the schnook.

177
00:09:23,934 --> 00:09:25,533
With an open mind, please.

178
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,779
Yes, with an open mind.
But I'm not making any promises.

179
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:31,699
Okay, your consideration
is all I can ask for.

180
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:35,339
- Have a good day.
- You too. And congrats again.

181
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,207
You nasty twat.
"I can't make any promises."

182
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:40,898
"I can't make any-- "

183
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,086
Call Andrew.
Tell him to clear his schedule.

184
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,722
We got a meeting with Barbara.

185
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:50,122
We have 3 hours to make him look like
an agent from this side of the hill.

186
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:53,846
<i>Extreme makeover</i> Miller Gold edition.
I'm so excited!

187
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:21,641
Hey, Seth.
I'm here.

188
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:24,073
- Well, that is hilarious.
- Oh yeah? Why's that?

189
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:26,086
<i>Because this morning
you were in the mountains</i>

190
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:27,398
and I was in L.A.

191
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:29,757
And now you're in L.A.
And I'm on the beach.

192
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:31,554
Oh yeah, that is funny.

193
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:33,707
It's not funny.
It's hilarious.

194
00:10:33,827 --> 00:10:36,013
If you just had a sense of humor,
you would get that.

195
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:38,644
Okay. It's been great
catching up with you.

196
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,662
Oh, so cold.
So cold, E.

197
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,447
Listen, man, I really want
to do your guy's show.

198
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,473
I really think it's a hit.
I just--

199
00:10:45,593 --> 00:10:47,803
I don't want to work with a guy
that sucker punched me.

200
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:49,274
I didn't sucker punch you.

201
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:51,891
We were face to face and you were
saying some not-so-nice things.

202
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:53,621
Still sensitive about your girl Sloan?

203
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:55,451
- Sloan's not my girl anymore.
- Really?

204
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,659
That's too bad.

205
00:10:57,554 --> 00:10:59,662
You know what?
You should call Sloan

206
00:10:59,822 --> 00:11:01,289
and you tell her to call me

207
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:02,873
and ask me to do your show.

208
00:11:03,157 --> 00:11:05,151
Oh, yeah, right.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

209
00:11:05,536 --> 00:11:09,374
You should. That's what you will do
if you want me to do your pilot. Click.

210
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:14,468
Watch how high I can go.

211
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:17,664
That's great, Drama.

212
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,766
- I bet you can't do it.
- I don't want to do it.

213
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:22,766
Pussy.

214
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:24,990
- Fine, how much?
- 50 bucks.

215
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,744
Give me one of these nuts.

216
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:31,607
- That's how it's done.
You owe me 50.

217
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,443
- Who are you people with?
- We're with Vince.

218
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:35,865
I'm Vince's brother.

219
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:38,103
Maybe you recognize me from--

220
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:45,150
- Okay, you guys got to go.
- Go where?

221
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,516
- Anywhere, but not near the monitors.
- You serious, bro?

222
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:49,714
Go. Come on, you too. Let's go.

223
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,378
- Now.
- <i>Come on, guys, here we go</i>.

224
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:54,592
<i>Quiet, please.
Picture is up.</i>

225
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:55,718
<i>Roll camera.</i>

226
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,251
Rolling!

227
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:59,180
<i>Give me some passion here now.</i>

228
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,223
And action.

229
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:05,510
I have $50 for whoever goes first.

230
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:07,772
I'll give you 200 if it's you.

231
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:09,350
You think I won't?

232
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,326
I think you've never seen
something like this

233
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:13,861
and you'll piss your pants
before your feet hit the skids.

234
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:16,597
- What's your problem?
- What's up with you?

235
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:19,348
This is serious,
you make bets and jokes.

236
00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:21,938
You've never seen a fire like this.
None of us have.

237
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:24,220
My father did
and he's fine.

238
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:26,687
If they want to laugh, let 'em.
You'll be fine.

239
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:29,502
I'll give you 300 bucks
if you can guarantee that.

240
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:31,372
I'll go first.

241
00:12:33,496 --> 00:12:34,505
Cut!

242
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,029
Thank you.
Excellent.

243
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:39,095
Now let's do the shorter version.

244
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:42,306
- We didn't get through this one.
- I saw enough.

245
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:44,058
One partial take?

246
00:12:44,218 --> 00:12:45,601
I gave it a try.

247
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:48,655
Give me another one.
The whole scene.

248
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:50,956
Roll again.

249
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:52,182
Going again.

250
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:55,304
- Roll sound!
- Rolling!

251
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,766
And action.

252
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:01,086
I have $50 for whoever goes first.

253
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:02,993
I'll give you 200 if it's you.

254
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:05,129
You don't think I will?

255
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:08,662
- Stop freaking out.
- I just don't understand this.

256
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:10,876
Is barbara Miller
some kind of a fashion guru?

257
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,614
Not if you ask me, she isn't.
When I think of Barbara Miller

258
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,764
the first thing I think of
is way too much skin.

259
00:13:15,884 --> 00:13:17,980
You just want to make
a good first impression.

260
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,623
That bitch knows me for 20 years.
Does she claim she doesn't know me?

261
00:13:20,743 --> 00:13:22,896
- She knows you.
- Then this is not a first impression.

262
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:24,830
No, it's a first working
for her impression.

263
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,896
Am I working for her
or am I working for you?

264
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:30,079
You're working for you. Her name just
happens to appear on your check also.

265
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:31,787
- Where are we going?
- Right here.

266
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:35,943
- This should be cheap.
- It's on me. It's a welcoming gift.

267
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:47,387
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

268
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:51,006
- What are you doing here?
- I just came by to talk to you.

269
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:53,276
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

270
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:56,255
Is this okay? I could come back.
I probably should have called.

271
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:57,995
No, it's fine. Come in.

272
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,166
- The place looks amazing.
- Thanks. I've been redecorating.

273
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:08,738
I think maybe you're done.

274
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,052
Sadly I'll never be done.

275
00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:12,866
- You want a drink?
- I'm okay.

276
00:14:13,304 --> 00:14:14,757
- Are you?
- Yeah.

277
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:20,154
So what's up?

278
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,657
Okay, this is--
Wait, are we alone?

279
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,285
Is my boyfriend here?
He works.

280
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:30,738
- And we broke up.
- Really?

281
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,282
When?

282
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:33,784
A couple months ago.

283
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:35,634
That's too bad.
I'm sorry to hear that.

284
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:38,131
Anyway...

285
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:41,428
- Actually, can I have that water?
- Yeah, of course.

286
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:45,911
So what did you want to talk about?

287
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:47,592
Okay, this is so stupid.

288
00:14:47,743 --> 00:14:51,190
Look, you're here
and you've got me curious. So...

289
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:55,617
I'm trying to get
a tv pilot greenlit

290
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:58,066
and the studio really
really wants Seth Green.

291
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:00,475
And he says the only way
he'll be in it

292
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:02,517
is if you call him
and ask him to be.

293
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:06,033
- Is this a joke?
- Probably,

294
00:15:06,193 --> 00:15:07,368
but it's all I got.

295
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:11,664
Eric, you can't seriously be here
because you want me to call Seth Green.

296
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:14,024
I told you it was stupid.
But he got a thing for you.

297
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:17,604
I think he's got a thing for you
and you keep falling for it.

298
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:19,538
Yeah, I know.
No, you're right.

299
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:22,550
You can tell me now, though.
Did you guys ever...

300
00:15:23,177 --> 00:15:25,296
Are you kidding?
Really?

301
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,721
- You didn't believe me?
- No, I did. I do.

302
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:29,038
I mean--

303
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:32,033
Look, I appreciate the time.

304
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,090
And the water.
Thanks.

305
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,855
Do you want me to call him?

306
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:38,487
No. Not at all. It's just...

307
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:40,640
I hadn't seen you in a while,
it was a good excuse.

308
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,650
- Not a good one.
- Well, an excuse.

309
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:51,255
You don't have a girlfriend?

310
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:53,311
Actually...

311
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:57,084
I have a fiancée.
Getting married in June.

312
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:00,203
I'm only kidding.

313
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,050
I just wanted to see
if you still cared.

314
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,592
Can you tell if I do?

315
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,896
I don't know. I probably should have let
it sit there for a little while longer.

316
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:10,665
- Anyway, I've got to...
- Yeah, anyway.

317
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:13,764
I've got to get back to big bear.
Vince is waiting for me.

318
00:16:13,884 --> 00:16:14,935
As always.

319
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,523
We'll be back soon.
Maybe I'll call you.

320
00:16:20,321 --> 00:16:21,400
Maybe I'll answer.

321
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:23,647
Okay, bye.

322
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,403
Thanks for the--

323
00:16:26,147 --> 00:16:27,156
I'll see you.

324
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,046
Yo, Vin.
Great job.

325
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,829
- You killed it.
- Moving shit, bro.

326
00:16:34,197 --> 00:16:35,997
You guys didn't watch either.

327
00:16:36,415 --> 00:16:39,736
It's not our fault. Seems Vermin's
a little possessive of video village.

328
00:16:39,856 --> 00:16:42,670
- Why, what happened?
- He threw us out like dogs.

329
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:44,131
Here he comes.

330
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:46,642
Yes, sir?

331
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:51,096
- You're not happy with me.
- You walked off in the middle of mtake.

332
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:52,973
That take was for you.
It wasn't for me.

333
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,872
Maybe it would have been for you
if you watched it.

334
00:16:57,438 --> 00:16:58,854
Can we talk alone, please?

335
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:09,194
Today I wanted your body
to feel the part

336
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:11,464
and not be distracted
by the words.

337
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:14,300
But you wouldn't trust me.
You won't trust me.

338
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,813
- I'm trying.
- No.

339
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:18,778
You're trying to decide what is good
for Vincent Chase the actor,

340
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:20,724
not what is good for my film.

341
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:24,088
- I thought it was our film.
- No, it's not our film.

342
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,241
Filmmaking is collaboration
but it's not democracy.

343
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:29,619
You're on this film maybe
eight weeks.

344
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:33,347
Then you fly off to something.
I work on this film for maybe two years.

345
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:36,392
It's got to be my film,
my decisions.

346
00:17:36,774 --> 00:17:39,260
If you trust me
I will get from you the performance

347
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,662
that enhances my film the most.

348
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:44,400
And thus enhances
your performance the most.

349
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:47,327
But you have to trust me.
You can't work against me.

350
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:50,239
I understand. I'll try.
I'll do my best. Whatever you say.

351
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,867
That's good, Vincent.

352
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:56,536
Why don't you go and change
and meet me at the screening trailer?

353
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:59,863
I'll show you some dailies and teach you
a few things that will be good for us.

354
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:12,487
- Why's everybody looking at me?
- 'Cause you look good.

355
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,832
I feel like a douche.

356
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:16,253
My voice must be heard.
You do not look like a douche.

357
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:19,714
You look like a powerful,
handsome new Miller Gold partner.

358
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:23,749
You stick with me, and that won't be the
last offer you have for a blowjob today.

359
00:18:25,923 --> 00:18:27,233
You guys are late.

360
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:30,378
I didn't know
we had a formal time set.

361
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,031
That color
really makes your eyes pop.

362
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:39,287
So how have you been, andrew?

363
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:41,623
I've been good.
I've been really good.

364
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:47,000
- Is it hot in here?
- No.

365
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,370
I don't think so.

366
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,134
I've gone over your company's numbers
and it's impressive what you've done.

367
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:54,501
Very impressive.
From the valley.

368
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:58,498
Can you imagine what this guy does
with a 90210 zip on his business card?

369
00:18:58,877 --> 00:19:01,712
Well, some people
are big stars in the minors

370
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:04,355
and can't swing the bat
when they get called up.

371
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:07,466
I wouldn't consider
what I've been doing the minors.

372
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:08,650
Nor would I.

373
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:12,021
You represent, it seems,
every working staff writer in town.

374
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:13,571
How did you sign them?

375
00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:17,045
Let me rephrase.

376
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,245
How do you feel you could tailor
your successful approach

377
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:22,623
to signing staff writers
to signing say...

378
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,167
Julia Roberts?

379
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,423
- It's hot in here.
- Pretend I'm Julia Roberts.

380
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:34,425
Tell me
what you'd say to impress me.

381
00:19:34,545 --> 00:19:36,118
What?
What do you mean?

382
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:38,461
What do you mean
what do I mean?

383
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:40,256
Pitch me.

384
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:46,127
Wow, Julia, it's amazing how much
you look like Eric Roberts.

385
00:19:48,141 --> 00:19:50,224
Do you mind if I just
step out for a moment?

386
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:52,903
- I just need a fucking breath.
- Listen, you can use my office.

387
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:56,144
- He just needs a fucking breath.
- I need a moment.

388
00:19:57,825 --> 00:19:59,133
Take him to my office.

389
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:00,911
- Are you joking with this?
- Are you?

390
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:03,471
- He's having a panic attack.
- He's not, and you're being mean.

391
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:05,705
Not since my second husband
have I seen such a loser.

392
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:07,206
The answer is no.

393
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:10,418
- I don't think he's okay.
- I'll be back.

394
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:12,773
- I'll be gone.
- You wait for me, barbara!

395
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:15,139
Oh my God!

396
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:17,805
I haven't had a fucking
panic attack since 1993.

397
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,802
Just breathe.

398
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:20,898
I thought this was a done deal,
not an interview.

399
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:22,366
Everything's gonna be fine.

400
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:24,625
My wife is already looking
for houses in Beverly Hills.

401
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:26,913
My clients think
they're repped by Miller Gold now.

402
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:28,633
Oh my god.
I can't go home.

403
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:31,491
Yes you can. Right after you
pick out a new fucking office.

404
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:33,341
All right?
I'll be right back.

405
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,471
I'm sorry.
Ms. Miller left for her big luncheon.

406
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:42,286
What's the fucking address?

407
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:44,280
Why you hating on Seth Green for?

408
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,969
I don't believe he wants to do it.
I feel like he's fucking with me.

409
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:48,276
<i>Why would he do that?</i>

410
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:50,318
- We have issues.
- Well, fix them.

411
00:20:50,738 --> 00:20:53,187
'Cause I think the dude
is funny, all right?

412
00:20:53,307 --> 00:20:55,527
And according to you,
if we get Seth Green

413
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:57,101
the network will make the show.

414
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:58,940
<i>I need this bad.
You feel me?</i>

415
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,023
I do.
Hold on a second.

416
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:05,345
Eric, it's Amy.
Just got off the phone with Seth Green.

417
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,614
Sounds like you guys
had a terrific call.

418
00:21:09,306 --> 00:21:11,857
He wants to sit down
with me you and Charlie today.

419
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:15,805
Can you make it in here by 4:00?

420
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:21,141
- Yeah, sure.
- Great. See you here.

421
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,328
Charlie, 4:00 p.m.
At the studio.

422
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:26,367
<i>Me, you, Amy and Seth Green.</i>

423
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:28,332
- For real?
- I sure am. See you there.

424
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:34,282
Yo, fuck you crew neck
wearing motherfuckers.

425
00:21:34,402 --> 00:21:35,988
I just got my own tv show.

426
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,259
<i>- What's your problem?
- What's up with you?</i>

427
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,351
Do you see what I'm talking about?

428
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:44,139
No, I don't really see it.

429
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:46,020
Look there now.

430
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:48,994
You see your head?
It's leaning to the side.

431
00:21:49,114 --> 00:21:50,862
You look like a dog.
A dog...

432
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:53,910
trying to understand
what it's master is saying.

433
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:56,471
Really?

434
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:59,854
Seems like a whole generation
of actors have taken to this

435
00:21:59,974 --> 00:22:02,746
George Clooney head-tilt acting.

436
00:22:04,307 --> 00:22:06,119
I really don't see a head tilt.

437
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:08,563
Shall I get a protractor?
It's there.

438
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:13,217
You've developed some bad habits.
We have to get rid of them.

439
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,922
Okay. I mean, what other
bad habits are you seeing?

440
00:22:16,923 --> 00:22:18,558
You have a lip quiver.

441
00:22:22,952 --> 00:22:23,985
See there?

442
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,140
Every time you pause
I see your lip quiver.

443
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,268
And then I think,
"why is the character's lip quivering?"

444
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:32,534
then I think, "it's not the
character's lip quivering.

445
00:22:32,654 --> 00:22:34,064
It's Vincent's lip quivering."

446
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,813
The lip is quivering.

447
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:38,151
- I don't see it.
- But I see it.

448
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:41,303
Tomorrow when you're
in front of my camera

449
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:44,282
I want you to feel it
and I want you to get rid of it.

450
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:47,494
It's an important scene.
We have to make it work.

451
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,664
It could be
an oscar scene, Vincent.

452
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,282
But you have to follow me.

453
00:22:54,578 --> 00:22:57,864
- Sir, you can't go in there.
- I'm the guest motivational speaker.

454
00:22:57,984 --> 00:23:00,323
... the women in this room.
So thank you.

455
00:23:04,462 --> 00:23:06,987
- What the hell?
- Wanted to congratulate you in person.

456
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:10,148
Attention, everyone.
I'd like to make a toast, ladies.

457
00:23:10,268 --> 00:23:13,973
To Barbara Miller,
number 33 on your prestigious list.

458
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:16,231
And you know what?
It's actually amazing to me

459
00:23:16,637 --> 00:23:19,460
that at her advanced aged this is
the first time she's made the list.

460
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,706
She probably thought
this is never gonna happen.

461
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:23,661
But this little laddy is sharp.

462
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:27,507
She went out and she found
herself a man to partner up with

463
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:29,369
and look
what she was able to accomplish.

464
00:23:29,723 --> 00:23:32,397
- You're making an ass of yourself.
- It's gonna be interesting though,

465
00:23:32,517 --> 00:23:34,484
once she's lost that man

466
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,378
to see how she's going to claw her way
back into this banquet room.

467
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,049
But anyway,
cheers to you, Babs,

468
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:45,891
and to all of you out there who
have saddled up next to powerful men

469
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:47,929
just so that you can
stand in our way.

470
00:23:48,254 --> 00:23:49,587
But remember this:

471
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:51,833
although you can stand in our way,

472
00:23:51,953 --> 00:23:54,200
you will never keep us down.

473
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:55,657
Thank you.

474
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:03,221
Do you honestly think this is
the way to get what you want?

475
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,972
No, I'm not trying to get
what I want. I'm taking.

476
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:07,324
Oh really? How?

477
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:09,428
I'm gonna split the agency
down the middle.

478
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,411
Civil war, Babs.
Arm your troops.

479
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:14,998
- All over Andrew Klein?
- No, all over your lack of respect.

480
00:24:15,235 --> 00:24:18,346
You think that behaving like a spoiled
five-year-old is the way to earn it?

481
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:21,171
I don't give a fuck. Kiss my ass.
Been nice knowing you.

482
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:23,757
Fine, hire your buddy.

483
00:24:24,415 --> 00:24:27,094
But it's on your column when
he turns out to be a complete zero.

484
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:29,565
- Fine.
- I want an apology.

485
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:31,622
Fine.

486
00:24:31,863 --> 00:24:32,884
Now.

487
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:36,115
Ladies, I'm sorry.

488
00:24:36,235 --> 00:24:38,616
I would love to congratulate
each and every one of you,

489
00:24:38,736 --> 00:24:41,763
but unfortunately
Barbara's cock is all I can handle.

490
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:43,330
Congrats again.

491
00:24:54,496 --> 00:24:56,377
- What up, E?
- What up, Seth?

492
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,961
So, how do you guys
know each other anyway?

493
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:03,209
- We used to date the same girl.
- No we didn't.

494
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:05,841
- I didn't know you had a girl.
- I don't. It was a long time ago.

495
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:07,236
You still talk to her.

496
00:25:07,794 --> 00:25:09,154
Not in a while.

497
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,521
You talked to her today.

498
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:13,807
What up?

499
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:16,065
- How do you know I spoke to her?
- I spoke to her.

500
00:25:16,185 --> 00:25:17,394
You spoke to her?

501
00:25:17,652 --> 00:25:19,730
Didn't you tell her to speak to me?

502
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,844
- Isn't that how we ended up here?
- Wait, hold on.

503
00:25:21,964 --> 00:25:24,184
You guys got to cut the tension
before we go in there.

504
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:27,830
No, there's no tension, Charlie.
It's just two tough white guys

505
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:29,865
being true to their primal nature.

506
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:32,409
- I can't believe she called you.
- She did.

507
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:34,035
And then she came over.

508
00:25:34,904 --> 00:25:36,862
- Don't push me.
- And if I do?

509
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:39,185
We've been down that road before,
haven't we?

510
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:41,877
Yes, we have. And that road
ends with you sucker punching me.

511
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,147
Damn.
You sucker punched the man?

512
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:46,314
Does it look like
I need to sucker punch this kid?

513
00:25:46,434 --> 00:25:49,011
I'll take him out in the parking lot
right now and throw him a beating.

514
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,354
But that's what he wants.
I'm not gonna let him get to me.

515
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:53,020
I've already gotten you to,

516
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,142
and your impossibly
hot girlfriend multiple times.

517
00:25:56,997 --> 00:25:58,835
- And your show is next.
- Hold on.

518
00:25:58,955 --> 00:26:01,703
What you mean by that?
Charlie, what if I told you

519
00:26:01,823 --> 00:26:04,482
that I won't do your show
unless you get rid of Eric?

520
00:26:05,722 --> 00:26:07,752
I'd say E's my boy
and he ain't going nowhere.

521
00:26:07,872 --> 00:26:11,145
Maybe you are. Maybe I'll just tell Amy
that I really want to do this show

522
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:13,632
but I'd much rather do it
with my close personal friend

523
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:15,892
international sensation nick cannon.

524
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:23,168
Guys, enough.
Enough enough enough.

525
00:26:23,952 --> 00:26:26,054
- Charlie, get off him.
- It's my show, motherfucker!

526
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:27,469
Why, will you hit me?

527
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,050
- You got to be professional.
- Shut up!

528
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,309
- You've played this game before.
- Nope. It's my natural athletic talent.

529
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:41,936
I'd like to see you maneuver
your lazy ass on a real court.

530
00:26:46,858 --> 00:26:48,755
How do you do that?
How do you hit it so hard?

531
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,562
You just hit it hard. Time it.

532
00:26:52,151 --> 00:26:53,256
<i>Match point.</i>

533
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:57,517
You're a cheater.
What buttons?

534
00:26:57,637 --> 00:26:59,331
Oh, it's not a button.
It's skill.

535
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,625
- And you, sir, have none.
- You little shit.

536
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:04,559
What button is it?

537
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,998
What's up? You guys
get sick of jerking each other off?

538
00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:08,199
You're crazy, Drama.

539
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,261
Yeah, you name the sport,
I'll bust you up.

540
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:12,147
A real sport, not this.

541
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:14,719
So you got a tv show or what?

542
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:17,438
We're gonna continue to look
for cast. How'd it go here?

543
00:27:18,191 --> 00:27:19,766
It's been weird today.

544
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:21,110
How so?

545
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,354
20 minutes,
it hasn't moved.

546
00:27:25,725 --> 00:27:27,287
- What's up?
- What's up?

547
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,443
- You tell me.
- Just trying to keep my head straight.

548
00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:32,404
- Good day?
- I've seen better.

549
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:36,772
Yeah, me too. But you know what?
Tomorrow's a new sunrise.

550
00:27:37,578 --> 00:27:39,936
Big scene in the morning.
Got to kill it.

551
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:41,691
Need to rest.

552
00:27:49,797 --> 00:27:51,756
I told you it's been a weird day.
