1
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,960
it's raining.

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,540
It's raining!

3
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,360
it's raining!

4
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,100
you have one saved message.

5
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,050
hi,babe.

6
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,550
It's me.I'm gonna be late.

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,110
You should pick up some chinese and we'll eat in bed,okay?

8
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,580
Love y.

9
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,050
hi,babe.It's me.I'm gonna be late.

10
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,670
You should pick up some chinese and we'll eat in bed,okay?

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,690
Love you.

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,610
You listening to allan's message again?

13
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,800
I have other messages.

14
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,000
from patients.

15
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,030
Do those patients ask you to pick up chinese and tell you they love you?

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,080
You know what?

17
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry I told you about it.I thought you'd understand.

18
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,890
Guys don't keep messages from an ex.That's a woman thing.

19
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,670
Well,what do you know about women that you didn't get off the internet?

20
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,670
Just erase the message.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,060
Be a man.

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,360
Um,mom.

23
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,120
you know,I can drive you to school today?

24
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,200
You know what?

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,550
I can-- I can drive her to school.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,380
Daddy.

27
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,850
Back up,woman.

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,520
good girl.

29
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,090
It is raining.

30
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,470
You're wet.

31
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,100
Because it is raining.

32
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,450
it rains in seattle,which is where I left my umbrella.

33
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,880
It does not rain in los angeles.

34
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,090
It rains in L.A.

35
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,470
It's raining right now.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,220
Really?

37
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,450
Right now?

38
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,300
Maya's staying at sam'S.

39
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,090
For a whole week-- she asked to stay at sam'S.

40
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,160
She's growing up.

41
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,310
I hate her.

42
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,710
Are we gonna do the morning meeting?

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,690
- Well,sam's gonna be late 'cause he-  
- and where's pete?

44
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,310
he is running an errand.

45
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,090
Is that a chocolate cake?

46
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,830
Yeah,I made it.

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,060
But you can have some if you want.

48
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,940
Addison,you want some chocolate cake?

49
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,440
Can I talk to you?

50
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,690
Thanks.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,260
Violet says I should come here and talk to you.

52
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,570
I don't believe in it.

53
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,260
But violet says.

54
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,250
she thinks I'm not gonna heal,which is so.

55
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,540
until I say this thing to you,I'm not gonna move on.

56
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,320
That's what she says.I don't know.

57
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,400
But I'm gonna say it.

58
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,900
just in case she's right.

59
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,730
You were a lousy wife,and I hated you.

60
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,420
Okay.

61
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,240
There,I said it.

62
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,450
I think maya likes sam better than me.

63
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,000
I think he wins.

64
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,460
Where are the beautiful people running in slow motion on the beach?

65
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,200
What?

66
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,480
This is L.A. 

67
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,690
L.A.Is supposed to be full of swimming pools and movie stars.

68
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:44,010
L.A.Is a place that you lured me to with your champagne wishes and caviar dreams.

69
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,440
Okay,first of all,you need to start watching more current tv.

70
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,270
And second of all,it's just a little rain.

71
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,220
It'll--it'll pass.

72
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,800
It's not about the rain.

73
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,620
I mean,it is about the rain.

74
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,610
But I would be fine with the rain if everything else was just a little more.

75
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,930
what?

76
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,220
I had this whole dream about.

77
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,350
moving here,that.

78
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,880
it would be.

79
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,600
better and.

80
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,200
special,that I would be.

81
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,610
I don't fit here.

82
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,100
I'm a surgeon.

83
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,630
I think like a scientist.

84
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,930
There's no science to this.

85
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,050
Look,dig in,all right?

86
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,450
Make friends.

87
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,940
Learn to play well with others.

88
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,090
It's raining.

89
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,530
Not to get all pete-zen on you,but it's raining everywhere.

90
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,480
doug.

91
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,270
we've been talking about this for years.

92
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,710
We've come a long way.

93
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,860
You have come a long way.

94
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,770
You asked me to help you decide what you want,and you have.

95
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,350
You are so close.

96
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,770
I-I just don't know if i can leave her.

97
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,020
You have everything you need.

98
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,630
You have all the tools.

99
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,230
Remember?

100
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,520
You're like A.A.

101
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,580
a running back.

102
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,320
A running back,sprinting past the obstacles,

103
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,740
running for the goalposts,and you're almost there.

104
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,540
And I'm sitting right here rooting for you.

105
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,180
I am your own personal cheering section.

106
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,460
I just,I-I don't-- 

107
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,720
Doug.doug.Doug.

108
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
I should leave her.I should-- 

109
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,330
doug.Doug.Doug.

110
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,770
I should stand up to her.

111
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,380
I-I should fight for my right to be happy.

112
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,830
Bring the ball home,doug.

113
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,920
I am telling my wife I want a divorce.

114
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,130
Touchdown!

115
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,180
okay,boundaries,doug.Boundaries.

116
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,650
Sorry.I'm sorry.

117
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,480
Hey,cathleen,geoffreY.

118
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,090
How was the,uh,wedding?

119
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,450
Magical,beautiful,romantic.

120
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,630
Everyone should get married.

121
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,550
Yeah.We had a 3-week honeymoon in africa.

122
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,620
We climbed mount kilimanjaro,scaled victoria falls,and now we're back here.

123
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,120
We--I made an appointment with the new O.B.-G.Y.N.

124
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,700
Honeymoon baby?

125
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,750
Just let us see the doctor!

126
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,240
Sorry.We're just eager to-

127
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,280
yeah.Dr.Montgomery,right.Take you right back.

128
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,010
It's just.

129
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,800
on our wedding night,we,uh.

130
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,190
I couldn't even.

131
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,580
what?

132
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,360
we've been married for three weeks,

133
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,840
and I haven't been able to do it even once.

134
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,890
Sex.You couldn't-- 

135
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,650
she's worried there's something wrong with her.

136
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,840
There is something wrong with me.

137
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,360
My hoo-ha is broken.

138
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,930
so how do you feel?

139
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,350
Like it was a waste of time.

140
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,860
How is talking to a rock over my dead wife's body helpful?

141
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,720
You're in a rut.

142
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,880
You're stuck.

143
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,320
You needed to jump-start your emotions,face them.

144
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,840
You know,I hate to disparage yourrofession,but-- 

145
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,250
you know what?I am good.I am brilliant.

146
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,810
I had a patient this morning trapped for 19 years in a marriage.

147
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,650
But today he's ready to ask for a divorce.

148
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,110
I got him out of his rut.

149
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,530
He's ready to move on.

150
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,030
You like yourself an awful lot today.

151
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,780
I kick a at my job.

152
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,420
I rule.

153
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,980
doug?

154
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,530
Are you the therapist who told my husband to leave me?

155
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,320
Is this her?Is this her?

156
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,490
Honey.

157
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,170
Did you tell my husband to divorce me?

158
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,690
You do.

159
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,030
You do rule.

160
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,510
I don't mean to be a bother.

161
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,750
I had to bring erin back.

162
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,040
She was just so.blue.

163
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,380
Well,it's gotta be hard on her.

164
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,060
It's terrible.

165
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,280
But it's normal for kids to feel a little down when they're sick.

166
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,750
It's really nothing to worry about.

167
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,350
What?

168
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,860
No,she's blue.

169
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,050
Understood.

170
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,970
Light blue.

171
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,080
Okay.

172
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,310
What?

173
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,180
- Cornflower-  
- blue.

174
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,860
Right.

00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,980
Yeah,that's a pretty nasty bleed.

179
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,980
Doug,what happened?

180
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,040
I'll tell you what happened.

181
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,870
Mr.Midlife crisis here came home,

182
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,800
dropped his briefcase in the middle of the living room floor and demanded a divorce.

183
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,200
You're not leaving me.Oh,no,sir.

184
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,360
You made a vow.

185
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,180
I need you to keep your head titled,please,mrs.Adams.

186
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,550
She got upset about the.

187
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,770
then her nose started bleeding,and it wouldt stop.

188
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,200
Mrs.Adams,has your nose ever spontaneously bled before?

189
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,450
No.What are you thinking?

190
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,220
Probably just mucosal irritation.

191
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,510
You know,it's not like life witdoug has been a walk in the park,but I'm not a quitter.

192
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,360
I need you to keep your head tilted back,please.

193
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,760
I'm doing the best I can!

194
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,610
I think the best thing to do right now is for everyone to stay calm.

195
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,880
Um,was she.

196
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,710
exposed to any water from a well or a spring?

197
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,920
No.

198
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,070
How about antibiotics?

199
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,310
Nothing like that.

200
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,440
quiet for mommy.

201
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,010
The doctor's thinkinG.

202
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,250
Dental fillings?

203
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,210
Yes.

204
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,120
She went to the dentist-- her first cavity.

205
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,580
Dental anesthesia can react with hemoglobin in the blood.

206
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,600
I've never seen it before,but it happens.

207
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,440
But it isn't serious?She's gonna be okay?

208
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,940
A onetime thing like this,I'll give her an I.V.

209
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,320
Treatment of methylene blue,she'll be nice and pink in no time.

210
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,070
He that should do the trick.

211
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,060
I gotta take a picture.

212
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,390
You totally do.

213
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,970
Okay,cathleen,I'm gonna ask you some questions about your sex life,

214
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,870
and the more you can tell me about previous partners,experiences-- 

215
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,940
oh,my god.I don't have any previous experiences.

216
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,580
I mean,uh,men,before geoffrey.

217
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,400
I'm a virgin,dr.Montgomery.

218
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,370
I know.

219
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,710
No one waits this long.

220
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,550
It's weird.

221
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,570
It's not weird.

222
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,710
It's just.

223
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
surprising.

224
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,930
I didn't want to give it up in high school to some band geek in the back of his dad's car,you know?

225
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,890
In college,I kept thinking,he's coming.

226
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,790
the one,and I wanted to wait for him.

227
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,400
And then I thought,I've waited this long,I should hold out.

228
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,790
I want it to mean something.

229
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,780
I wanted the fairytale.

230
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,130
I want it to be special and perfect.

231
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,280
- I wanted-    
- the magic.

232
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,500
Exactly.

233
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,100
Some magic.

234
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,470
Let's take a look.Okay?

235
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,350
All righty,this is gonna be a little cold.

236
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,520
I know it's a little uncomfortable.

237
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,690
Just try to relax.

238
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,310
I am relaxed.

239
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,540
you've had exams before this?

240
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,230
Oh,god.

241
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,160
It's really broken.

242
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,040
It's broken,isn't it?

243
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,960
It's not the kind of thing that breaks.

244
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,450
Okay.

245
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,160
We're gonna go really slow.

246
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,430
knocking at the door.

247
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,470
Stopping in for a little visit,and I'm knocking.

248
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,850
Knocking a little harder.

249
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,750
and I'm done knocking.

250
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,190
I'm gonna die a virgin.

251
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,630
We're gonna figure this out,cathleen.

252
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,900
We are going to get you your wedding night.

253
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,290
- She's 35,and she's never-  
- nope.

254
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,150
And the gates are closed,locked,welded shut.

255
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,120
Holding on to your virginity for that long?

256
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,430
I think it's sad.

257
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,190
It's not sad.It's sweet.

258
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,710
Okay,not being able to have sex with your husband when you want to,that'sad.

259
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,000
But the waiting?

260
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,060
I mean,what's wrong with wanting a little magic?

261
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,790
I lost my virginity when i was 17.

262
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,460
It was not magic.

263
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,550
A lot of friction.

264
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,960
I got rug burns in bad places.

265
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,620
you know,I didn't get the magic until sam?

266
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,830
I didn't know it could be magic until sam.

267
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,810
I hardly rember the last time I had a little magic.

268
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,930
I hear that.

269
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,820
How can you eat that much sugar this early in the morning?

270
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,680
Dell made it.

271
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,040
I'm just being polite.

272
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,790
You know,and what's all this magic talk anyway?

273
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,190
First L.A.Doesn't have it-- 

274
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,180
I don't know.

275
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,680
The last time I was here,I just felt more.

276
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,620
magic-Y.

277
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,930
Well,yeah.

278
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,070
You kissed pete.

279
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,120
I did not kiss pete.

280
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,490
Pete kissed me,which I did not ask for.

281
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,770
I don't even know if he's normal.

282
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,690
You know,one minute he's hot,the next minute he's arctic.

283
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,690
I don't need that kind of damage,no matter how fancy his lips are.

284
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,190
Here he comes.

285
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,520
You're talking about sex,aren't you?

286
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,760
We were talking about a patient.

287
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,380
who can't have sex.

288
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,510
Well,send 'em my way.I'll get 'em going.

289
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,250
You know,this is a very serious issue.

290
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,840
This is a woman who has needs,who has wants,

291
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,210
who needs and wants magic in her life.

292
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,610
This is not a dirty little joke that you can make your dirty little jokes about,dirty man.

293
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,080
You don't know me at all.

294
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,650
You think you do,but you don'T.

295
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,260
So.don't call me names.

296
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,090
You should give him a pass this week.

297
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,820
Why?

298
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,160
You just.

299
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,040
should.

300
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,850
See what I mean?

301
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,950
A club.

302
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,920
A closed club.

303
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,550
I went back on my vow,and--and now she's bleeding?

304
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,950
My words did that.

305
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,570
No,you don't control anything except yourself.

306
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,230
Our work together has not been about getting you to leave your wife.

307
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,240
It's been about getting you to say what you want.

308
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,550
Remember the goalposts,doug.

309
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,290
The goalposts.

310
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,400
Right.

311
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,310
so she lost some iron.

312
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,870
Big deal.

313
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,720
I want a divorce.

314
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,130
Yes,you do.

315
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,590
Karen,I.

316
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,150
the bleeding got a lot worse.

317
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,700
I checked her C.B.C.

318
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,310
Her hematocrit's less than 30.

319
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,440
Less than 30?

320
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,660
Are--are you sure?

321
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,430
You mean there's something really wrong with her?

322
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes,there's something wrong with me.

323
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,590
You picked a great time to walk out,doug.

324
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,990
Just great.

325
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,800
it's called vaginismus.

326
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:25,260
It's a condition that causes a constant involuntary muscle spasm.

327
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,240
So you have a way to fix it,right?

328
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,200
You--you can fix it?

329
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,860
Not--not that I'm not fine the way things are.

330
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,640
I'm fine.

331
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,200
I love you,and I don't need to have sex to know that I love you.

332
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,040
You can fix it?

333
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,210
Please tell me you can fix it.

334
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,580
Well,I would like to prescribe a muscle relaxant for you,cathleen,

335
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,440
and you'd take it about an hour before you-- 

336
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,980
a pill.That's good.A-a pill.

337
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,010
I can do a pill.

338
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,880
And it'll work?

339
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,690
Well,there have been case studies.

340
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,030
Um,just,uh.

341
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,550
give it your best shot.

342
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,290
at--at home.

343
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,350
Give it your best shot at home.

344
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,300
and she needs to do her homework and show it to you.

345
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,970
And she can talk on the phone,but do not let her get on the internet

346
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,350
because you still don't have that thing that blocks the child predators.

347
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,460
Good night,naomi.

348
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,030
Shuffling maya back and forth,it's just not practical.

349
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,520
We're gonna be fine.

350
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,550
Maya's gonna be fine.

351
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,130
You and your head take the night off.

352
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,390
It's just that she's a girl.

353
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,020
Mothers know more when it comes to girls.

354
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,870
Uh,I'm--i'm shutting down for the night unless you need anything.

355
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,440
No,uh,but,uh,here.

356
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,350
Uh,here's your cake carrier.

357
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,500
You ate the whole thing?

358
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,100
We.

359
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,400
I-I didn'T.

360
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,460
eat a whole cake.

361
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,640
I mean,I c-- I wouldn'T.

362
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,550
I-I couldn'T.

363
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,160
it was really good.

364
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,770
Well,I'm glad you liked it.

365
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,660
Okay,thank you.

366
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,370
still raining.

367
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,720
Yeah.

368
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,330
I see that.

369
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,580
I made you another one last night.

370
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,330
I r-- I-I really shouldn'T.

371
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,940
this time I baked chocolate chips inside.

372
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,790
I can'T.

373
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,810
thank you.

374
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,200
You know what?Maybe someone else might want it.

375
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,780
So I'll just,uh.

376
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,070
right.

377
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,460
No sex.

378
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,880
Not even a little sex.

379
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,740
Really?

380
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,550
Did--or-- really?

381
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,600
She took the pill.She-- 

382
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,510
we tried.

383
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,020
Oh,sister,how we tried.

384
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,900
Honey,it's okay.

385
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,980
It's not okay.

386
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,070
I need sex.

387
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,300
I need sex,geoffrey.

388
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,080
I have waited and waited and waited,and I want to do it.

389
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,250
I want to do it now.

390
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,090
Look,I know,I'm just saying,you don't need to get upset.

391
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,400
We have other things to connect us.

392
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,680
You're a man,geoffrey,a big,strong,very hot man,which is.

393
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,090
I hit the jackpot with you.

394
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,280
And we want kids.

395
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,330
We want a family.

396
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,050
Which is now not gonna happen because you're gonna leave me for someone else--

397
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,030
I'm not gonna leave you.

398
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,780
I don't need sex.

399
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,060
We don't lie to one another.

400
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,760
We never have.

401
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,530
Don't start now.

402
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,120
Please,doctor.

403
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,620
nothing I've tried has worked.

404
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,410
I mean,she just can'T.

405
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,230
ju--she just can'T.

406
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,960
And she deserves-- he'S.

407
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,420
her guy,her one.

408
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,020
Marriage without sex.

409
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,650
it happens all the time.

410
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,820
Maybe it's psychological.

411
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,750
Can you see her?

412
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,170
actually,pete should see her.

413
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,620
- What? 
- What?

414
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,940
There are some very good studies about guided actualization,and that's his area.

415
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,920
That's my area.

416
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,570
want some cake?

417
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,380
Sweet mother of chocolate.

418
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,540
I know.

419
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,040
You realize your replacing sex with food?

420
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,400
You want some?

421
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,900
They're getting happy over cake.

422
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,150
I mean,if I could get happy over cake.

423
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,650
well,I wouldn't be a man.

424
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,780
Exactly.

425
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,740
Secret to women.

426
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,530
Oh,like you know the secret to women.

427
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,190
You're a child.

428
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,730
You can barely grow facial hair.

429
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,400
You don't know anything about women yet.

430
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,550
Figure out what they want and give it to them.

431
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,730
Yeah.

432
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,310
well,that'S.

433
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,240
you baked that cake?

434
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,160
my grandmother baked that cake.

435
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,530
but naomi doesn't need to know that.

436
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,720
Figure out what they want and give it to them.

437
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,760
It wasn't the fillings.

438
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,060
Is erin okay?What happened?

439
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,480
I-I don't know.They just got worse.

440
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,950
Get an exam room-- 

441
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,320
you want just one?

442
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,340
Your patient who can't have sex?

443
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,710
My patient.Mind your own business.

444
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,790
She's checking her history to see if she might be able to find anything that could be causing the vaginismus.

445
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,390
Dell.

446
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,200
He asked.

447
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:45,920
He snooped.

448
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,110
You really don't want to try my thing?

449
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,180
Your thing?What,to creatively visualize the parting of the red sea,

450
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,750
a gentle opening of a flower?

451
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,840
You know,addison,the way we work around here is--

452
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,250
yeah,I know,you utilize each other.I got it.

453
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,460
But this is-- we take it slow.

454
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,200
And your solution is,what,put her in surgery?

455
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,020
This woman is not gonna die if she doesn't have sex.

456
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,660
Oh,please.If it was you going without,

457
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,190
you'd be begging to go under the knife,my highly skilled knifE.

458
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:14,950
I knew it was too much to hope for a double board certified surgeon not to be the most arrogant-- 

459
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,980
arrogant?You've got a god and a buddha complex all rolled up into one big,arrogant-- I got this.

460
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,460
Back off.

461
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,900
oh,come on.

462
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,340
Naomi is this close to a diabetic coma thanks to your cake,

463
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,340
so you're way worse than I am.

464
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,310
Dr.Turner?

465
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,200
Karen.

466
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,590
Stay out of my marriage.

467
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,880
I think you took careof that.

468
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,930
Doug canceled his therapy appointment this morning.

469
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,690
Well,I want to make sure it stays that way.

470
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,440
And if he shows up again.

471
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,870
I pay the bills.

472
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,910
You won't see a dime.

473
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,630
I don't care about the dime,and even if I did.

474
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,860
w-why are you fighting for something that makes you both so miserable?

475
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,780
You have no idea how my marriage makes me feel.

476
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,160
You have no idea who I am.

477
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,980
You only have doug's side of the story.

478
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,620
I'm the bitch,and he's--he'S.

479
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,780
I-I am not on anybody's-- 

480
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,130
just stay away from-- 

481
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,330
did you-- 

482
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,700
karen!

483
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,270
We need some help!

484
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,530
Pp I hear you got blue girls.

485
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,360
I ran labs.Nothing's turned up so far.It's driving me crazy.

486
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,140
I give them I.V.S,and they turn pink and seem fine and.

487
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,130
their mom insisted on taking them home.

488
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,430
You want me to take a look at 'em?

489
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,200
I ordered extensive blood chromatographs.

490
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,600
When those come back,yeah,maybe.

491
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,310
The mom checked the house for environmental toxins?

492
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,310
Yeah,I gave her the full list and she said she's gonna go over it top to bottom,

493
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,840
which is gonna take a while and.

494
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,760
that's time we don't have.

495
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,920
You know,I'm going over there.I'm gonna give her a hand.

496
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,660
there's nothing here from my list of contaminants,

497
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,980
and the girls were no place else today?No fend's houses?No-- 

498
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,570
they've been here all day,with me.

499
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,630
This was my great plan.

500
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,750
I quit my job,fired the nanny because I could do it better.

501
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,130
You've childproofed,you buy organic,you have,

502
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,560
uh,biodegradable dryer sheets.

503
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,580
I could eat them.

504
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,790
Okay?This is not negligence.

505
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,730
Yeah,but.

506
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,940
if something happens to them,I--their dad travels all the time.

507
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,270
I can't call him up and say--

508
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,250
for now we just need to find out what's doing this so that the exposure doesn't become even more dangerous.

509
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,050
But we've gone through the house top to bottom.

510
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,110
The yard,the garage-- 

511
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,160
what did the girls say about it?

512
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,250
Where were they before this happened?

513
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,210
They don't talk,not to me,not to anyone over 8.

514
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,850
mommy!

515
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,410
Erin.

516
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,980
Mommy,what's the matter with erin?

517
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,760
She's having a seizure.

518
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,990
She'll be okay.She'll be okay.

519
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,250
I got your test results.

520
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,180
You've got something called wegener's disease.

521
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,640
It's a disease of the blood vessels that affects the ears,nose,throat and kidneys.

522
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,910
Does she.

523
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,870
does she die from this?

524
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,020
Well,it takes years to progress to that stage.

525
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,380
With the proper treatment,we should be able to keep it at bay for a long time.

526
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,370
You were lucky.

527
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,380
Some people bleed out internally before the disease is caught.

528
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,240
Lucky.

529
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,220
I can't believe this.

530
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,410
you should change.

531
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,960
Sam.

532
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,280
what would you have done if it were naomi?

533
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,990
If s had gotten sick right before the divorce?

534
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,430
I would've stayed.

535
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,070
Vulvar vestibulitis.

536
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,560
Shistikiniatis.

537
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,180
What?I thought we were saying weird stuff.

538
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,340
My virgin.

539
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,880
She has vulvar vestibulitis.

540
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,890
I went through her entire medical history.

541
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,410
She has inflammation,probably caused by chronic yeast infections,

542
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,990
which made her nerve endings extraordinarily sensitive to pain,

543
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,550
which in turn made any attempt to have sex--

544
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,360
ouch.

545
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,690
That kind of pain is what caused her muscles to lock up.

546
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,940
So I'm gonna do trigger point injections of lidocaine and steroids in the sensitive areas.

547
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,720
And then you're gonna send her to pete?

548
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,840
No.I can fix this myself.

549
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,580
You can fix the vulvar vestibulitis,but pete can fix the vaginismus.

550
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,100
if you work together with him,the two of you will be able to give this woman a normal sex life.

551
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,980
Why is everyone always pushing pete on me?

552
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,720
Why are you pushing so hard against him?

553
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,060
Wait,you want to belong here,you want to feel like you're a part of this place,

554
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,150
you need to accept that pete is part of the solution.

555
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,480
Wisdom coming from a cake fiend.

556
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,440
Well,I just,um,I just take all these feelings--

557
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:49,800
the,uh,rage,the exhaustion,the sexual frustration,

558
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:52,890
,the desire to run sam down with my car,

559
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,190
the fact that my child now thinks that her father is the good parent--

560
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,870
I just take it all and I shove it down as far as it'll go,

561
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,310
and then I just put some food on top of it.

562
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,440
Maybe.

563
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,710
you should talk to sam instead of inhaling 4,000 calories a day.

564
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,750
You know what?

565
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,510
You find your magic your way.

566
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,080
I'll find my magic mine.

567
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,590
violet said that I should cut pete some slack.

568
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,160
Yeah,you should.

569
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,100
Mm,the "why" is what I'm missing.

570
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,850
It's the anniversary of his wife's death.

571
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,910
Is this going to hurt?

572
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,620
I'm sorry.It is.

573
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,890
Here we go.

574
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,100
h-how many more?

575
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,020
Four more.

576
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,390
Four more.

577
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,630
I can do four more.

578
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,100
I'm okay.

579
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,680
I can do this.

580
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,220
This is gonna work?

581
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,710
I mean,she's going through this.It's gonna work?

582
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,690
It will solve the cause of the vaginismus.

583
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,520
And then I'll get my wedding night?

584
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:35,150
dia little research,and I think my patient should try yr thing.

585
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,080
You want my thing?

586
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,830
My patient.

587
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,380
My patient needs your thing.

588
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,060
What,no comments about my dirty talk?

589
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,220
Why are you being so nice to me?

590
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,680
I'm not.I.

591
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,090
can you help or not?

592
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,280
I have an opening at 3:00.

593
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,340
She's toxic.

594
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,520
Treatment's gonna have to be a lot more aggressive.

595
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,370
BuT.

596
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,370
she'll pull through?

597
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,940
It would help if we knew what we were dealing with,the contaminant.

598
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,340
Girls.

599
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,910
thiis very,very serious.

600
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,560
Did you eat anything,touch anything that you're not supped to?

601
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,180
Mommy promises not to get mad.

602
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,320
It would really help erin if you tell.

603
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,010
sam.

604
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,370
You ordered these antibody studies for karen adams,room 1001?

605
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,030
I did.

606
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,560
As chief of staff,I can't sign off on this.

607
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,640
These studies are obviously unnecessary.

608
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,710
I had to confirm a diagnosis.

609
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,850
And since when has that been against hospital policy?

610
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,950
Since your patient-- this karen adams--

611
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,920
was diagnosed with wegener's disease at this hospital six months ago.

612
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,710
Wait,how is that possible?

613
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,250
She just started exhibiting symptoms.

614
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,670
That's what she told you.

615
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,650
These records speak for themselves.

616
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,270
she knew.

617
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,580
And she never told her husband.

618
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,400
Hey,charlotte king just called.

619
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,030
Unnecessary tests on karen adams?

620
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,400
I've got a patient who's lying to me about her medical condition.

621
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,220
It's not my fault.

622
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:51,000
If we could just tell doug that karen's been lying to him,he would leave her.

623
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,880
We can'T.We can't reveal her medical information to anyone,

624
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,940
including her husband,without her approval.

625
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,380
Doctor-patient confideiality.

626
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,060
She's a patient.

627
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,250
She's your patient.

628
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,500
And your patient is messing with my patient's happiness.

629
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,600
Three years of kick-ass therapy down the drain with one swift diagnosis.

630
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,110
Maybe they'll work it out.

631
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,180
I mean,people do make marriages work.

632
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,440
They won't make it work.

633
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,190
She'll end up hating him.

634
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,920
And he'll hate himself for staying.

635
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,850
After she's gone,that's all he'll have.

636
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,670
So I think if you can find a way to help your patient,you do it.

637
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,020
Hey,the hospital sent over these results on erin merring.

638
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,650
I still don't know how these girls are getting exposed.

639
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,130
I can't even get them to talk to me.

640
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,090
Well,what are they into?

641
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,870
Uh,fluffy.

642
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,170
pink pinkness?

643
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,520
Okay,so go there,too.Commit.

644
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,420
Give 'em what they want.

645
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,870
Oh,you and your cake.

646
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,950
They are women,cooper.

647
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,400
Tiny blue women,but still women.

648
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,310
Yeah,no.

649
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,970
I didn't get into this deal because I'm a clown.

650
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,850
What,I'm supposed to play with my patients?

651
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,110
I put a sticker on my stethoscope.

652
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,770
That's as far as I go.

653
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,590
And erin's lying there getting sicker.

654
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,460
Commit to the cake,man.

655
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,010
who wants to play?

656
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,900
Come on in.

657
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,460
Make yourselves comfortable.

658
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,700
I'll be right there.

659
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,470
Flowers opening.

660
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,840
rivers parting.

661
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,400
I gotta go give out the ol' pete special.

662
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,070
Okay,what?

663
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,160
It's just,naomi told me what this week is.

664
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,560
The anniversary.

665
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,500
it's nothing.

666
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,540
where exactly are we going?

667
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,200
A secret place.

668
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,430
Ooh,you have a secret place?

669
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,240
We have a magic castle.

670
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,550
But first we gotta get through the fortress.

671
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,520
The fence is the fortress.

672
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,870
Come on.

673
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,110
Sit down.

674
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,770
Awesome castle.

675
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,570
Magicastle.

676
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,380
It makes you see stars.

677
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,430
See?

678
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,520
Oh,stars.

679
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,790
the stars make me dizzy.

680
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,210
Me,too.

681
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,870
Me three.

682
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,820
See?

683
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,100
See the stars,how they go all funny?

684
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,890
The stars make you dizzy.

685
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,060
dr.BennetT.

686
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,540
I told you we don't need a therapist.

687
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,680
You are not my patient.

688
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,710
I am here for doug.

689
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,940
And I'm here for you,karen.

690
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,940
Now I have your medical records here.

691
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,920
Would you like for me to discuss them in front of doug?

692
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,820
Or would you like doug to leave the room with violet?

693
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,660
It's up to you,because as your doctor,

694
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:36,290
I cannot discuss what's in here in front of him without your permission.

695
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,900
Why--why would i have to leave the room?

696
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,770
Karen?

697
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,010
This isn't fair.You can't do this.

698
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,490
I am not discussing anything without your permission.

699
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,340
Either doug can stay in here with you and sam,

700
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,660
or he can come out in the hall and talk to me.

701
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,130
Karen?

702
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,800
So I knew I was sick before.

703
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,070
So what?

704
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,290
I didn't think you could take it.

705
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,930
I thought you'd run away like the weakling you are,so.

706
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,320
I didn't tell you.

707
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,480
But you knew you were sick all--all this time?

708
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,900
I thought you were a weak,whiny pain in the ass.

709
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,860
But you surprised me.

710
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,940
You didn't run.

711
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,710
So it proves that you're not weak.

712
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,860
You're strong,and need you.

713
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,670
I need your strength.

714
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,400
I want you to stay.

715
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,710
What do you want,doug?

716
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,560
You've been coming to see mefor 36 months--

717
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,290
36 months and thousands and thousands of dollars.

718
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,440
You came and you worked.

719
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,790
all so you could say what you want.

720
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,370
You've earned yourself a very expensive backbone.

721
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,930
Use it.

722
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,360
What do you want?

723
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,190
You promised.

724
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,010
I'm talkinto doug.

725
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,970
what I want.

726
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,750
what I want.

727
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,840
I want to stay.

728
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,060
- Doug,you-  
- I want to stay.All right?

729
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,910
End of discussion.

730
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,850
I'm staying with karen.

731
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,760
I'm staying with my wife.

732
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,030
- good-bye. 
- Thanks.

733
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,120
- Good luck tonight.  
- Take care.

734
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,220
- For what it's worth-  
- don't say anything nice to me.

735
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,620
- I wasn'T.
- You were.

736
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,980
I don't need your pity.

737
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,010
I don't need your sympathy.

738
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,800
I was going to say,

739
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,960
whatever you did in there for cathleen,I hope it works.

740
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,770
They deserve to have a perfect night.

741
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,050
I get a little.

742
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,210
I need.

743
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,820
I'm a little lost here.

744
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,150
My wife went to sleep beside me in bed on a tuesday night.

745
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,300
On wednesday morning,I woke up,and she was dead.

746
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,490
One bad night,but.

747
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,900
all our nights were bad.

748
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,970
And we never had a perfect night.

749
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,280
not even our wedding night.

750
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,260
Nothing's perfect.

751
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,630
Nothing's ever perfect.

752
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,370
That's the most he's ever told anybody about his wife.

753
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:04,200
The,uh,castle in your neighbor's yard is full of toxic fumes from open bags of fertilizer.

754
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,880
That's what made them sick?

755
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,780
Yeah,they were inhaling ammonium nitrate.

756
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,550
First it turned 'em blue,then it attacked their nervous systems.

757
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,300
they play in the yard.

758
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,040
I never thought they'd get beyond the fence.

759
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:18,640
Well,you know,they kinda kick ass so.

760
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,800
mom.

761
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:23,010
Can they sit in my bed?

762
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,930
Be gentle.Okay?

763
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,790
I'm sorry.

764
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,020
I-I know how much.

765
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,250
you cared,how hard you worked.

766
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,360
U worked.

767
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,980
You did most of it.

768
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,760
I-I may not be in love with her,but.

769
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,540
I o her.

770
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,710
No one should have to go through what she's going through alone.

771
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,990
- She doesn't have to be-  
- I just wanted to say,

772
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,190
I-I still think we did something here.

773
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,840
I mean,before I met you,things just happened to me.

774
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,370
I made a choice today.

775
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,260
But you're still picking what's safe,

776
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:20,290
what's familiar,pain that won't even make her better.

777
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,250
- What about-  
- what I want.

778
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,390
is for you to be the therapist and me to be the patient.

779
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,380
It's my life.

780
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,400
At least now I know I've made my bed.

781
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,900
Nobody else.

782
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:37,870
You're right.

783
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,640
It's your choice.

784
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,360
And you made it.

785
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,540
And that is something.

786
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,210
Thanks.

787
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,350
it's not raining.

788
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,300
Yeah.

789
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,290
Yippee.

790
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,540
I'm starting to agree with you.

791
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,100
Out the magic?

792
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,000
Thank you.

793
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,650
That--that's-- thank you.

794
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,800
Okay,so,um,just call me tonight,okay?

795
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,390
- Mom-  
- just--just call me,okay?

796
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,130
Will you make sure she calls me?

797
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,340
Okay.

798
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,560
Quiet down in there.

799
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,740
Double fudge with chocolate frosting.

800
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,460
You know what?

801
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,640
Enough with the cake.

802
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,770
I don't want your cake.

803
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,930
I don't need your cake.

804
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,220
I-I didn't ask for your cake.

805
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,690
I'm all caked out.

806
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,760
You know whose cake I want?

807
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:44,860
I want sam's cake.

808
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,820
I want sam's cake,but sam's not baking a cake.

809
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,940
He's not baking a cake for me.

810
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,300
- So could you just-   
- nai.

811
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,200

812
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,950
I'm not gonna stop bringing you cake.

813
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,470
All right,dell,dell,no more cake.

814
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,160
You know what?It's just that maya likes sam better,

815
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,710

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,010

818
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,980

Yes,we are all gonna get through is.

That's why you have us.

821
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,390
We're gonna get through this together.

822
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,390
Just--when is something good gonna happen?

823
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,340
When is--when is there gonna be a little-- 

824
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,630
magic?

825
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,560
Yeah,that's the unending question.

826
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,370
you drank all the orange juice.

827
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,730
You hogged the covers.

828
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,770
You put our dog to sleep.

829
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,630
You never took my side.

830
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,730
You were mean to me.

831
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,270
You withheld sex.

832
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,490
You were cold.

833
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,610
You were a mean,cold bitch!

834
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,220
And I hate you!

835
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,590
I hate you so much!

836
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,090
I'm sorry I couldn't save you.

They saved a marriage.
