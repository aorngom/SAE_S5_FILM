1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,380
I'm going for sexy
but. but,uh,not slutty.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,710
Smart but not boring.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,710
It's a little.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,710
P.T.A.Mom-bake sale.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,040
Is it really?

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,730
Who. who is this guy?

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,940
Do you like him? Is he cute?

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,890
He asked me out on a date.

9
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,160
I-I haven't been on a
date since c-college.

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,890
He could be a homeless troll for
all I care. I love him. I love him.

11
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,600
I love him because I'm going on a date.

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,640
oh,he's here.

13
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,770
Will you please just. just tell
him I'll be down in a second?

14
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,240
All right.

15
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,470
Coming.

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,010
Cooper and I are next door at sam's playing poker and
having some drinks. I thought you'd want to join us.

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,570
You want to join us?

18
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,840
You're a little bit drunk.

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,860
And you,too,could be a little bit drunk.

20
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,930
You're drunk and you're flirty. Go away.

21
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,890
Or.

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,070
I could come in,and we could actually
get to know one another outside of work.

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,300
You're attracted to me. You admitted it.

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,280
Yeah.

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,660
Well,I'm not attracted to you anymore.

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,010
Good night,pete.

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,090
You're attracted to me right now.

28
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,260
What'd you do with my date?

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,210
That wasn't your date.

30
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,960
It was my date.

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,010
My unsuitable,flirty,drunk.

32
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,800
oh-so-attractive
date.

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,170
you have a really packed day,so
I had them add an extra shot.

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,310
Oh,bless yoU.

35
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,390
Today's files. And,um,I
think 7-down is "requited.

36
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,790
" Nice.

37
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,070
Thanks.

38
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,430
So.

39
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,640
how'd it go?

40
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,560
Not so good. I am so out of practice.

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,000
All I could talk about was. was
uteruses and. and sperm and eggs.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,070
I think the guy thought I was
trying tget a baby out of him.

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,190
He left skid marks,he
drove away so fast.

44
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,470
It's not easy getting back out there.

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,960
I had a date last week.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,770
It was a complete nightmare.

47
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,620
The guy spent the whole
night asking advice.

48
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,370
You're dating?

49
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,060
Everybody's dating.

50
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,860
except me.

51
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,810
Good morning,addison.

52
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,330
okay,I've got angie padgett and her
husband ray coming in for a follow-up.

53
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,590
She's ovulating,so the
fertility issue may be with ray.

54
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,360
I see that marilyn sullivan's coming in?

55
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,510
it's actually her daughter tess.
She fell down and hurt her arm.

56
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,550
She did,again?

57
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,230
Uh,I'll drop by.

58
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,340
I've,uh,got some
samples of this new M.S.

59
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,920
I can pitch in if
anybody needs me today.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,810
Me,too. I'm booked,but,you
know,just all routine stuff.

61
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,370
Hey,you. you want to help
me get angie pregnant?

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,970
Man,I wish that was
as dirty ait sounded.

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,910
yeah,being able to make a couple
happy,that's the good stuff.

64
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,550
You will love the fertility game.

65
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,890
Yeah,I will.

66
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,420
Okay,on the count of three. One,two.

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,430
I'm sorry. How'd this happen?

68
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,770
I missed the curb when I was
walking home from the bus.

69
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,940
I'm a klutz.

70
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,630
She reads while she's walking.

71
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,560
One time,she nearly
wandered into traffic.

72
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,330
You should talk. I
mean,you read at the movies.

73
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,110
Only the ones you drag me to.

74
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,830
Okay. Well,reading. good.

75
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,580
Reading while walking. not so much.

76
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,430
Dr. Sam,the famous writer.

77
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,770
No,you're the one.

78
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,970
You're the one. That thing in the
"times magazine" last week was great.

79
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,180
I sit on my ass all day. I
have a lot of time to think.

80
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,180
here.

81
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,740
-is everything okay at home?
-Yeah.

82
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,900
Still just the two of you?

83
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,980
No,mom does a lot of
dating 'cause guys dig M.S.

84
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,970
'Cause this bruise on your arm,it
looks like someone grabbed you,hard.

85
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,770
You know,if something wasn't right at
home or school,I might be able to help.

86
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,770
I suck at walking. That's the crisis.

87
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,260
Don't freak out on me,Dr. Freedman.

88
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,430
All right.

89
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,310
Good news,angie. Your tests
came back. Everything is fine.

90
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,920
you are fertile. And you still
have plenty of viable eggs left.

91
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,940
Okay. That'S.

92
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,700
I was worried.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,610
Great. That's great,honey,but,um,does.

94
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,190
Let's not race to any conclusions.

95
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,040
We're just gonna run some tests on
you,ray,and then we'll go from there.

96
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,950
Okay. Two doctors.

97
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,880
I'm sensing twins.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,420
all right. Let's start
with a sperm samplE.

99
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,630
uh,Dr. Bennett in? Sam?

100
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,320
Yeah,but he's busy with a patient.

101
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,220
Can you call him on the,uh,the.

102
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,850
intercom?

103
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,290
Yeah. Is it.

104
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,930
Does it not look urgent?

105
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,310
I walked here. on foot.

106
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,750
Okay.

107
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,220
I don't know if you can count
insomnia as hospital business.

108
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,420
I've h three hours in three days.

109
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,790
Place wouldn't run without
me,not that you care about the.

110
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,030
the.

111
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,250
-yeah.
-This is what I'm talking about.

112
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,220
Aphasia.

113
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,100
Yeah,that comes with sleep deprivation.

114
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,920
Obviously I cannot do my
job if I can't m-m-make.

115
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,210
-words?
-Words.

116
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,880
All right. Any shortness of breath
when you lie down,chest pains?

117
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,130
No. And no.

118
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,020
I've run all the tests.
thyroid,everything.

119
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,040
It's. it's all fine.

120
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:09,330
Yesterday I parked my car. somewhere.

121
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,470
-sorry.
-It's not funny.

122
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:18,180
If this got out at st. Ambrose.

123
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,050
All right,now I can
prescribe a sleep aid.

124
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,960
No pills. They don't work for me.

125
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,420
Well,there are some new options.

126
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,400
No pills.

127
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,430
I had a little problem.

128
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,610
-What kind of a problem?
-The kind I'm not talking about anymore.

129
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,140
Can you help me or not?

130
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,300
Yeah,okay.

131
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:41,360
Uh,well,I guess we could go with the
alternative route. I could speak to pete.

132
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,450
Fine.

133
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,720
Send me to the quack.

134
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,980
I don't want to date.

135
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:55,810
I mean,I do,but I want someone with
purpose,someone real,someone who wants a future.

136
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,100
Someone who wants kids?

137
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,760
-Is that desperate?
-No.

138
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,700
No,it's not desperate. It'S.

139
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,350
-focused.
-Right?

140
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,650
My point is,you are out there looking.

141
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,630
I mean,even violet is out there looking. Maybe
I should be out there looking for what I want.

142
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,750
Yeah,and what you want
is a husband and kids.

143
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,320
Dr. Bennett,Dr. Montgomery.

144
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,540
Angie. Ray's up,uh,at the
lab still,but good news.

145
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,750
his tests are viable.
Everything's gonna be fine.

146
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,520
Yep,there should be no reason why
the two of youcan't get pregnant.

147
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,720
Oh,no,no,no. I was hoping.

148
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,210
you all right?

149
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,700
When ray comes back,you have
to tell him he's infertile.

150
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,850
I'm sorry?

151
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,280
You have to tell him it's his
fault we can't get pregnant.

155
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,960
you've been lying to your husband
about trying to have children?

156
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,010
Not exactly. I just.

157
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,550
i just was on the pill for years.
And then I got a cervical cap.

158
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,560
That's lying.

159
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,100
I have my reasons.

160
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,960
Which are?

161
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,140
I just. I don't want to have kids.

162
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,060
Look,ray. he comes from a big family.

163
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:05,010
He's good and kind,and
he adores me so much.

164
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,060
How can you tell someone who loves you like that
that you don't want to make a baby with them?

165
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,450
I'm sorry,but we can't lie
to him about his test results.

166
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,770
Then what am I gonna do?

167
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,140
Talk to your husband.

168
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,320
It's more complicated than it sounds.

169
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,320
I think the lie that you've been
telling is far worse than the truth.

170
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,770
No,it's not.

171
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,170
there you are. I'm all done.

172
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,890
What now?

173
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,970
Now.

174
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,140
now we go home and keep trying.

175
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,350
Okay. Good-B.

176
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,440
Can I just say.

177
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,710
-whoa?
-Right.

178
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,160
I always thought sleep was for the weak.

179
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,710
Would you put that thing away?

180
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,850
Now I just lie there. It's torture.

181
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,890
Insomnia is not caused by how you sleep.

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's caused by how you
live. And this isn't helping.

183
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,030
No e-mails.

184
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,950
Close your eyeS.

185
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,780
try to relax.

186
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,640
It's hard to relax when you're
sticking quarters on my head.

187
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,660
I'm stimulating the sleep
center of the brain with magnets.

188
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,240
So.

189
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,270
you went to medical school,suffered
through residency like the rest of us.

190
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,000
You could be saving lives right now.

191
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,770
Why did you ditch the good
stuff for magnets and hoodoo?

192
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,230
What I do is the good stuff.

193
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,690
Now shh.

194
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,750
move it,coop.

195
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,570
There's people who actually
pay me to lie on that couch.

196
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,950
I'm reviewing tess sullivan's
film from her last doctor.

197
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,040
-She had a humerus fracture when she was younger from a fall.
-Okay.

198
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,200
Except as I suspected,she actually
had a spiral fracture of her humerus.

199
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,840
You know how you get that? Someone grabs
your arm and twists it so hard,it snaps.

200
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,210
So someone hurt her on purpose.

201
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,030
More fun facts.

202
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:17,190
these records from before tess and marilyn
transferred here,she had multiple falls and accidents.

203
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,090
Cooper,if it's abuse,it's
usually the adult in the house.

204
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,990
Marilyn?

205
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,220
Her daughter loves her. Everybody
loves her. Sam loves her.

206
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,800
doesn't mean it's not happening.

207
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:37,770
And now I have to call child protective services
to protect my patient from sam's patient.

208
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,760
you're afraid of killing
people,aren't you?

209
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,370
Excuse me?

210
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,040
That's why you waste your
time with the new age stuff.

211
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,560
You're afraid of killing someone.

212
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,500
I'm lying here wide awake.
The thought occurs. That's all.

213
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,850
Okay,look.

214
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,930
it's almost 6:00. I'm gonna send you
home with a cd of music and meditation.

215
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,440
Try it tonight and report back.

216
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,330
Great. Next you'll be
giving me "baby einstein.

217
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,310
"  no.

218
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,250
No. There's no way marilyn
sullivan would. would hurt tess.

219
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,990
She's always coming in
with scratches and bruises.

220
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,660
Maybe it's. it's a kid at school.

221
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,150
I talked to the school. That's not it.

222
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,020
-Well,it's not marilyn.
-Why?

223
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,180
Because she's funny?
Because she's a writer?

224
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,840
No,because she's decent. All right?

225
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,520
She's handling her disease,her kid.

226
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,420
The woman is two years away from a
wheelchair. You can't just do this on a hunch.

227
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,780
What about the next time,sam?

228
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,680
What,I ignore this and the next time
tess ends up in a hospital or wor?

229
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,770
Unless you are absolutely sure,you have no
business putting these people through this.

230
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,080
If you're not sure,you're
meddling,not helping.

231
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,750
-you're here early.
-Yeah.

232
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,620
Yeah,thanks.

233
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,530
you have reached the los angeles county department of
children and family services child protection hotline.

234
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,820
hey,she's back.

235
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,870
-Who?
-Angie.

236
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,830
Liar-liar-pants-on-fire
angie.

237
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,440
Well,what. what do we do?

238
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,750
We throw her ass out of our practice.

239
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,430
Come on.

240
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,680
-Hey.
-Okay.

241
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,280
-Thanks,dell.
-Here you go.

242
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,410
angie.

243
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,060
I know I shouldn't have come back,but I looked up Dr.
Montgomery on the interne you're a genetic specialist,right?

244
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,690
Yes.

245
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,980
Well,I thought about what you
said,that it's better to know the truth.

246
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,850
So you told ray that you
don't want to have any kids?

247
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,320
No.

248
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,160
Not that.

249
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,730
Angie,I don't think
we can help you here.

250
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,040
You have to. You have to help me.

251
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,540
I need to know. I
need to know the truth.

252
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,280
The truth about what?

253
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,540
I need you to tell me
whether or not I'm dying.

254
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,610
huntington's disease?

255
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,610
-It's a genetic disorder that causes.
-a degeneration of brain cells. We know.

256
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,860
So then you know how horrible it is.

257
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,270
You lose control of your body,your brain
atrophies,you can't talk,you can't eat.

258
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,380
You just slowly die in this.

259
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,770
this shell.

260
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,490
My mom had it.

261
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,700
My grandmother had it.

262
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,690
And you think you might have it?

263
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,770
If her mother had it,she has a
50-50 chance of inheriting the gene.

264
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,950
And if I have the gene,I have a 100%
chance of dying from the disease.

265
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,920
But you've never been tested?

266
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,320
I just wanted to live my life.

267
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,390
And then I met ray.

268
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,690
And he doesn't know that
you could have huntington's?

269
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,850
I wasn't looking to get married.

270
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,760
It was just dating.

271
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,270
And then we were in love. And then.

272
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,910
I had waited too long to tell him.

273
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,380
And he loved me so much,I
didn't want to scare him.

274
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,260
I didn't want to scare me.

275
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,000
-But now.
-he wants to have children.

276
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:02,430
I can't have a baby knowing
I could pass this on.

277
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,870
I can't have a baby if I'm gonna die.

278
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,400
Last night,ray and i
were watching tv in bed.

279
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,140
And he was thinking up baby names.

280
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,390
And my heart started to hurt.

281
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,570
physically hurt.

282
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,140
I want to think up baby names.

283
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:35,090
I want to grow old with thiman
and our kids and our grandkids.

284
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,290
And I thought.

285
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,290
maybe I don't have the gene.

286
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,020
Maybe I won't get sick.

287
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,380
-Maybe.
-maybe knowing the truth is better than hiding from it.

288
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,980
I want the test.

289
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,530
I want to know.

290
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,310
I want to live.

291
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,750
Haven't you people heard
of an expiration date?

292
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,230
No,no,no. Those are. those are.

293
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,770
noodles don't go bad.

294
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,750
Oh,she's back. What.

295
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,290
Throwing away people's noodles.

296
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,530
I'm here because. surprise.

297
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,310
Can you keep your hands
off my food,please?

298
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,040
-Did you make the call?
-Yeah.

299
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,380
Hey,violet,we have a patient
we may need you to see. Angie?

300
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,900
She still lyingto her husband?

301
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,200
It's a little more complicated than
that. She might have a terminal illness.

302
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,040
De's preparing an exam room,and I'm
gonna draw her blood in a few minutes.

303
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,140
-You need to eat.
-I can'T.

304
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,490
Can you imagine? She finds the perfect
guy,she's got a great marriage,they want kids.

305
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,230
she was living the dream.

306
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,510
Not everybody has that dream.

307
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,520
Violet doesn't believe in children.

308
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,070
She acknowledges they exist because they
scream in her restaurants,but that's about it.

309
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,690
I used to be like
that before I had maya.

310
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,310
I was,and then I had her,and.
I'm not saying it's a dream.

311
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,390
but it's. it's pretty darn close.

312
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,930
You really don't want childre look,

313
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,500
not everybody is cut out for it.

314
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,160
And it is incredibly hard for a woman
to admit that she doesn't want kids.

315
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,600
'Cause they're basically
admitting they're men.

316
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,890
Oh,okay,no. Just because
you've apparently moved in.

317
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,580
it's not a disease,you know?

318
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,320
A woman can be alone
and be fulfilled,very.

319
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,690
Try saying that like you mean it.

320
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,200
Why isn't she sleeping?

321
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,160
Pete's working on it. Excuse me.

322
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,700
Uh,angie's set up in exam room two.

323
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:28,350
Uh,the sullivans,from yesterday,they're.
they're back and they're very angry.

324
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,120
I asked you to wait.

325
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,630
He did the right thing,sam.

326
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,360
You don't know that!

327
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,740
excuse me.

328
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,470
There's a social worker in our home.

329
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,500
He called a social worker on me.

330
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,360
Once I suspect,legally,I
have to call the authorities.

331
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,320
But you're wrong.

332
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,560
what does he think,the handicapped
woman beats her daughter with cane?

333
00:17:54,650 --> 00:18:01,110
I-I think he was just worried
a-about the nature of tess' injury.

334
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,060
I know you didn't fall off a curb.

335
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,710
I help my mom when she
has a flare,all right?

336
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,640
She fell down,she grabbed
my arm,and it got tweaked.

337
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,610
I fell.

338
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,980
I reached out and I grabbed
tess' arm. It was an accident.

339
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,540
Then why didn't you just say that?

340
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,480
Because. people like Dr.
Freedman get the wrong idea.

341
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,880
Has that happened before,people getting the
wrong idea? You've had a lot of injuries.

342
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,310
She has M.S. She falls.

343
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,660
But my mom would never hurt
me on purpose. She wouldn'T.

344
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,820
she's my whole world. I would
never hurt her,not on purpose.

345
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,120
Please believe me,sam.

346
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,200
She's my girl. If they
take her away from me.

347
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,250
I believe you.

348
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:45,360
If they take me away from
her,I won't forge you,not ever.

349
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,970
I like the name margaret for a girl.

350
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,500
We could call her maggie or meg.

351
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,150
Or henry for a boy.

352
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,620
angie,if the tests come back
positive,you'll need to tell ray.

353
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,790
Do you have children?

354
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,680
No.

355
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,390
But you want them.

356
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,500
I do.

357
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,940
Have you thought of baby names?

358
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,740
Carson.

359
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,350
it works for a boy or a girl.

360
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,480
Don't piss dell off.

361
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,050
He was weighing in on a case. I
call that overstepping his bounds.

362
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,020
I need him here to
keep this place running.

363
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,790
Is that all you need him for?

364
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,350
What,you heard I went on a date,and
now you're gonna take it out on dell?

365
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,820
No,but you guys got some
kind of a thing going.

366
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,500
There's no "thing. " Do I like
that a cute boy thinks I'm pretty?

367
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,990
Yes.

368
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,240
Could I ever take it seriously? No.

369
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,900
He's a child,sam.

370
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,350
Just.

371
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,280
leave it alone.

372
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,270
All right.

373
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,150
shouldn't you be in
there,administering your heang touch?

374
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,400
Shush. It might be asleep.

375
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,770
It?

376
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,490
You're enjoying this,aren't
you,seeing me tortured?

377
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,060
Mm,it is satisfying.

378
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,090
hey,why did you come to my
house the other night? Really?

379
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,140
I thought we could have fun.

380
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,710
I'm not looking for fun.

381
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,390
sam told me that you're
the marrying kind of woman.

382
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,480
I am.

383
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,030
I've been married.

384
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,200
I don't plan on ever
going down that road again.

385
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,490
So if you want fun,I'm here.

386
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,100
-If you want more.
-I should.

387
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,750
-look elsewhere.
-Addison.

388
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,850
it's not working! I'm not sleeping!

389
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,300
and still satisfying.

390
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,030
Go.

391
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,140
Make it sleep.

392
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,380
Obviously you'll be expected
to testify,Dr. Freedman.

393
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,100
Now tomorrow is the hearing.

394
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,090
That's fast.

395
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,260
We move fast. We have to.

396
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,150
Now if the judge decides it's an unsafe home environment,
the girl would be taken immediately into foster care.

397
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,880
-What about the mother?
-What about her?

398
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,140
Well,if tess gets taken away,marilyn
shouldn't be left alone. She has M.S.

399
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,340
That's not our department's
concern. Our concern is the child.

400
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,040
I should say,um,tess is pretty
insistent that there's no abuse.

401
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:35,360
Well,that's not unusual. The child protects
the parent,even rationalizes the behavior.

402
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,080
And what if tess is telling the truth?

403
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,600
That's why there's a judge.

404
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:45,230
But the medical testimony carries a lot of weight,and
I'm sure Dr. Freedman did not make this call lightly.

405
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,420
Angie,this is,uh,Dr. Violet
turner. She's our psychiatrist.

406
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,350
I thought you were just
gonna tell me my test results.

407
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:13,760
Oh I have it.

408
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,260
I really have it.

409
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:23,370
But as of now,you have no symptoms. You could
go years before you show any sign of illness.

410
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,240
Illness?

411
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,140
You mean dementia,violent
rages,wetting myself?

412
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,330
A lot of research they're doing with
repression proteins is very promising.

413
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,500
Hopefully,in time.

414
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,900
oh,I don't have time,Dr. Bennett.
Time is the one thing I don't have.

415
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,400
I've got a great life,an
amazing husband,but no time.

416
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,880
Damn it. I am so out of time.

417
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,610
I know this is a lot to process.

418
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,170
But you're not alone.

419
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,590
You have ray.

420
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,900
No.

421
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,120
No,I knew what I was getting
into when I took that test.

422
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,050
that stupid,stupid test.

423
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,140
-angie.
-why don't you stay?

424
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,090
We can talk.

425
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,910
I can't,but thank you,all
of you,for trying to help.

426
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,810
Well,what about ray?

427
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,580
-What do you.
-don't worry.

428
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,940
I know what I have to do.

429
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,360
-I'm begging yoU.
-Oh,no.

430
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:28,400
I have tried acupuncture,massage,pressure
points,melatonin supplements,aromatherapy,sound therapy.

431
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,790
And I can tell it's not working
because she's still bitching at me.

432
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,380
Charlotte needs a shrink.

433
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,450
-Yeah,agreed,in more ways than one,but.
-squeeze her in.

434
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,610
I.

435
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,450
this is co-op
medicine,and I'm referring.

436
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,790
You need to co-op. Now.

437
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,990
90% of sleep issues are psychological.

438
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,420
Fine. Shrink away.

439
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,030
When you sleep,do you toss
and turn,thrash around a lot?

440
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,860
How would I know? I'm asleep.

441
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,950
Yeah,I realize that.

442
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,070
Well,that. that's where a
partner could be helpful.

443
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,720
Uh,the last time you
slept with someone else.

444
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,260
was years ago.

445
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,590
So you haven't had sex in.

446
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,300
I have sex.

447
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,280
-They just don't sleep over.
-Ever?

448
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,820
Are you asking because you're
interested in my well-being,

449
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,110
or because you're secretly thrilled to
find someone who's as alone as you are?

450
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,330
Just because I don't want a child?

451
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,910
I'm fine.

452
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,290
I am better than fine,in fact. I.

453
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,490
let's just stay on you.

454
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,380
Dr. Montgomery.

455
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,400
Hey,ray. How are you?

456
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,080
-How's angie?
-Gone.

457
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,560
She's gone. Angie left me.

458
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,480
I came home,and I found
her packing a suitcase,and.

459
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,160
she said that her appointment here
was like some kind of wake-up call,

460
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,260
and then she just left.

461
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,960
And that's all she said?

462
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,340
here,uh,ray,why. why don't you.

463
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,350
I don't understand. She spends two minutes with the
two of you,and then throws in the towel on our marriage?

464
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,240
-Ray,please calm down.
-No,I want to know.

465
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,310
What the hell did you say to my wife?

466
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,890
It smells like christmas in here.

467
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,340
It's an ayurvedic sleep remedy
that might knock charlotte out.

468
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,850
-What did you get?
-Intimacy issues,severe.

469
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:26,500
She tries to alienate anybody who might
get close,even people she asks for help.

470
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,500
Sleep's triggered when you comfort
yourself into a self-sedated state.

471
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,190
And people like charlotte.

472
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,880
chances are nobody ever really nurtured
her,taught her how to self-soothe.

473
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,450
Nurture her,pete. Be kind.

474
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,100
people have babies in this bed?

475
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,690
We change the sheets. Promise.

476
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,920
Go ahead and close your eyes. Relax.

477
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,030
You're smiling like an idiot.

478
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,140
I'm staying positive.

479
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,390
oh,brother.

480
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,840
People need connection to stay
healthy,positive connection with another human.

481
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,860
look,I don'T.

482
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,510
I don't need your pity positivity.

483
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:21,360
I don't know what violet
told you,but I connect,okay?

484
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,590
Yeah,when?

485
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,890
-None of your bus.
-business,right.

486
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,720
You know what? Maybe.

487
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,420
I'm not the guy to help
you. Maybe you need someone.

488
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,800
who I can't irritate.

489
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,430
Find that man for me,and I'll marry him.

490
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:43,210
My family didn't believe in displays.

491
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,730
Of affection?

492
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,150
my mher.

493
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,680
there was the occasional sloppy
kind that followed cocktails.

494
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,410
And since then?

495
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,380
Who has time for that kind of thing?

496
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,780
I'm sorry,charlotte.

497
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,180
Do you want to try again?

498
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,280
Why not?

499
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,210
My hair's already shot.

500
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,130
Can you drop these at the lab for me?

501
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,960
thanks.

502
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,540
Um,ahem,marilyn sullivan
called for you again.

503
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,380
I'm not allowed to speak to
her until after the hearing.

504
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,140
Don't start,man. There's
nothing vague about the law.

505
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,160
-I suspect and. -tess
wrs long sleeves a lo -

506
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,500
what?

507
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,460
Well,even when it's,like,95
degrees outside,down over her hands.

508
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,240
And does she ever look at you,I
mean,like,really look you in the eye?

509
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,550
-Not really,no.
-Right.

510
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,660
When she has appointments without her mom,she shows up
early,she hangs out after,like she doesn't want to go home.

511
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,200
I've seen that.

512
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,840
How do you know all this?

513
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,310
Uh,because I did the same thing
when I was in her situation.

514
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,190
It's what you do.

515
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,540
All right,I'll get
the lab right on this.

516
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,940
Fascinating.

517
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,930
She's been here all night?

518
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,030
She snores?

519
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,790
God,asleep,she looks almost harmless.

520
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,190
Mm,like a sleeping tiger.

521
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,140
Don't wake the tiger.

522
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,120
I have to go,um,and put my
tie on for tess' hearing.

523
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,750
He needs you.

524
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,080
He put her to sleep.

525
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,680
-He actually did it.
-yep.

526
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,480
Angie's here.

527
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,390
She finally responded
to our phone messages.

528
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,450
Well,we got her to come
back. That's something.

529
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,600
-Any ideas on what we say to her?
-No.

530
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,050
You said the baby making game
would be fun I am not having fun.

531
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,000
Oh,god. Me neitheR.

532
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,220
Not with this one.

533
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,090
Mm,it's not. it's not fair.

534
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,720
Good people should get
to have what they want.

535
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,050
I was heading to the airport.

536
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,750
You said there was something with ray?

537
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,420
Ray came by to see us yesterday.

538
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:23,200
He was worried sick about you,not
to mention confused and hurt.

539
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,760
You didn't tell him,did
you? You cannot tell him.

540
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:29,850
Angie,he is your husbD. He
deserves to know the truth.

541
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,440
let him thinkI left him.

542
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,990
Let him hate me.

543
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,790
Then he can move
on,find someone,be happy.

544
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,720
He's happy with you.

545
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,160
But. he's gonna.

546
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,210
I'm gonna get so sick.

547
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,690
I'm gonna die.

548
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,910
I don't want to die.

549
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,250
Angie.

550
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,670
you have a disease.

551
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,780
And you will die. That's the truth.

552
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,770
Hiding it from ray is
not gonna change that.

553
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,960
But the bigger truth. the better truth.

554
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,360
is that you are alive now.

555
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,860
You're living,and you should get.

556
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:18,660
you should get everything
that life has to offer.

557
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,710
You should get what you want.

558
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:27,090
You should get to have a
child and a family and ray.

559
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:31,920
Just because you're sick doesn't
mean you don't get to live your life.

560
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,800
Go home.

561
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:40,000
Tell ray the truth,tell him what
the future is,and let him decide.

562
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,800
A person.

563
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,600
should get to have a whole life.

564
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:57,030
Didn't allan wear yellow ti. did
you bring me one of allan's old ties?

565
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,770
I bought this tie for you.

566
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,540
Today you become a man.

567
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,210
Yeah.

568
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,900
What are you gonna say?

569
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,740
-You shouldn't really be.
-what are you gonna say?

570
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,830
I'll tell you if you
roll up your sleeves.

571
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,710
So whatever.

572
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,230
She hits me a little.

573
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,090
But she's sorry.

574
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,700
Afterward,I mean.

575
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,910
She's really sorry.

576
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,870
And it's not like I couldn't
hit her back. I mean,look at her.

577
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,540
Oh,tess.

578
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,140
But I don't need to hit her.

579
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,340
She needs to hit
someone. Her life sucks.

580
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,210
tess,everyone has pain.

581
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,850
So why can't this just be mine?

582
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,670
what time is it?

583
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,590
It's about 12:15.

584
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,000
-Tomorrow?
-Today. Well,y-yes.

585
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,040
Today is your tomorrow.

586
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,550
Oh,my god.

587
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,790
oh,my god.

588
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,760
This is. oh,god.

589
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,380
It'll wash out.

590
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:26,580
I mixed you a tonic to take home with you. It
should help you fall asleep more easily tonight.

591
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,390
I don't need your potions.

592
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,920
Really? It kinda seemed like you did.

593
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,230
Don't throw yourself a party.

594
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,320
You don't have me figured out.

595
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,420
I said some things when I was
loopy. Probably just hit a wall.

596
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,780
I hit a wall and.

597
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,640
it happened to be here.

598
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,350
Okay.

599
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:57,260
Dr. Freedman,would you please explain to the court
the injuries you've noticed on tess over the last year?

600
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,870
Sorry. That's all right.

601
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,290
sorrY. Thanks.

602
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:11,440
In the last year,um,two lacerations,multiple
contusions and abrasions.

603
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,700
plus the recent wrist fracture.

604
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:22,420
And in your opinion,is there any way that the injury could have
occurred other than by the intentional twisting of the child's arm?

605
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,020
No,there's not.

606
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,860
Thank you very much,Dr. Freedman.

607
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:43,850
Wait,can I. can I just
say one more thing?

608
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,160
-Sure.
-Okay?

609
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:53,540
I've known tess for a little while
now,and she is a great kid,so tough.

610
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,030
She doesn't let anybody see her cry.
I don't even know if she does cry.

611
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,580
But it doesn't matter how strong she is.

612
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,100
Some things,a kid should
never have to take.

613
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:11,930
Being hurt,being hit by someone who
is supposed to love and protect you.

614
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,350
you don't have to take that,tess.

615
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,620
You can't take it.

616
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:22,680
Because once you let yourself shut
down like that,you're not a kid anymore.

617
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,290
Uh,I'm. okay,I'm done talking.

618
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,690
You can return to the gallery.
Thank you,Dr. Freedman.

619
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,300
They're taking her away from me.

620
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,730
I can'T. Not now,marilyn.

621
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,420
It's not right. I'm her mother.

622
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,800
I'm her mothersam.

623
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:49,050
right. You're her mother.

624
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,860
Don't tell me you believe them.

625
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,040
I'm not evil. I made a mistake.

626
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,560
I love my daughter.

627
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,080
That kid.

628
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,430
all she wants is her mom.

629
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,170
I didn't want to see it.

630
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,590
and I should have.

631
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,800
I should've.

632
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,990
excuse me.

633
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,300
We know we don't have
an appointment but,uh.

634
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,550
no,please.

635
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,210
Come in.

636
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:10,370
So,um,the fertility tests,they came back
fine for both of us. So we can make a baby?

637
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,570
We want to share what life
I have left with a child.

638
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:21,380
And we were wondering if there was something you
could do to make me pregnant sooner rather than later.

639
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,440
Because angie doesn't
have a lot of time.

640
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,660
I just want to make
sure that you understand.

641
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,300
oh,I. I understand.

642
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,720
Angie will die.

643
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,850
sooner than we want.

644
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,330
Angie will,uh.

645
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,170
but that's the future.

646
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,510
And I don't care what happens
tomorrow or in a few years.

647
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,150
We have this now. We have us now.

648
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,900
there is still the risk that
the child will have the gene.

649
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,670
We know.

650
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,820
We're willingto take that chance.

651
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,260
I mean,if everyone who had the
gene was never born,I never.

652
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,050
I never would've met angie.

653
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,880
But I really.

654
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:08,450
naomi,they want us to
help them make a baby.

655
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,830
A person gets to have her whole life?

656
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,870
A person gets to have her whole life.

657
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,050
So you're a convert now?

658
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:36,410
just covering my bases.

659
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,760
Well,I am sure pete
appreciates your gratitude.

660
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,430
Pete doesn't need it.

661
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,640
He congratulates himself
enough for all of us.

662
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,450
but damn.

663
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,600
the n has good hands,doesn't he?

664
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:06,660
What would you be doing
right now if you were angie?

665
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,150
You mean I-if I knew.

666
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:13,720
knew how limited your
time was. If you knew.

667
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,770
pretty much what I'm doing right now.

668
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,150
Check you out. all zen.

669
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,860
also known as margarita number two.

670
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:34,430
I'd be on a plane to somewhere
spectacular with maya.

671
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,380
What about you?

672
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,280
I.

673
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,850
I don't know.

674
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,070
I'm going for more serenity.

675
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,540
Baby girl.

676
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,080
thank you.

677
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,420
liar.

678
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,260
Where's your power tie?

679
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,510
Oh,I took it off. I didn't
want to throw up on it.

680
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,110
Plan on throwing up tonight.

681
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,860
Cooper. because of you.

682
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,410
tess knows that an adult saw her
and cared enough to protect her.

683
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,010
How many times have we
met marilyn sullivan?

684
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,660
Did you ever think that.

685
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,960
yeah. That's why people who shouldn't
have children shouldn't have children.

686
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,860
And you count yourself among
those people. You're crazy.

687
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,370
-You would never.
-well,who knows?

688
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,480
I don't think anybody who
had a child ever thought

689
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,050
,oh,boy,now I have something I can hit.

690
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:59,010
Violet,you are the most
caring,generous person I know.

691
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,840
Yeah,and the most neurotic,the
most self-involved.

692
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,200
look,you're telling me that if you
met the right man and fell in love.

693
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,330
and he wanted to,you
wouldn't even consider it?

694
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,300
You would.

695
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,310
You would.

696
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,460
Um,sam told me about
how you helped with tess.

697
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,280

talk or need some help.

You do a lot for the practice.

700
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,690
You are the practice.

701
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,570
You keep it running. the way you deal
with the patients,the way you care.

702
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,310
Your dream is what started
it in the first place.

703
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,730
-And sam'S.
-And sam'S.

704
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,480

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,890

713
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,130
No.

714
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:48,980
I don't want fun,and a person
should get what she wants.

715
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,300
What does that mean?

716
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,010
Good night,pete.

717
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,460

can't just kiss a person and.
