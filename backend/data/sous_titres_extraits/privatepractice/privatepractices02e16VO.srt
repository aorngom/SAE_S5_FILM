1
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:05,872
they'll call.

2
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:08,086
- they should call now.
- they will, when there's news.

3
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:10,312
- I hate waiting.
- Archer's in good hands.

4
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:12,956
he's got little worms
growing in his head, Pete.

5
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:16,245
- they're cysts.
- with worms inside.

6
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:18,320
I'm gonna call. I'm gonna
make sure Addison's okay.

7
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:19,927
Sam and Naomi are with her.

8
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,023
- we just have to wait.
- Waiting's hard for us?

9
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:23,655
imagine how awful it is for them.

10
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:34,700
You people...

11
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,982
you people realize
it's morning time, right?

12
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,281
Stay awake for 20 hours,

13
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:44,044
and then you tell me if you notice
where the sun is in the sky.

14
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:46,523
It's hard to believe,
the five of us back together again.

15
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:48,763
Six.
Archer makes six.

16
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:50,672
Right, six. I forgot
about Archer. Six

17
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:53,640
and if you count the worms in Archer's
brain, that makes, like,

18
00:00:54,107 --> 00:00:54,990
26 of us.

19
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:58,640
Here is to dead brain worms.

20
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:00,781
- dead brain worms.
- brain worms.

21
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:04,160
I can't believe
that you fell for a Grey,

22
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,412
and you're too scared of Derek
to tell him about it.

23
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:09,013
Don't be mad at me.

24
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:11,481
Be mad at Derek, be mad at the ring
his mother never gave you,

25
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:13,352
- but don't be mad at me.
- What ring?

26
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:16,713
What's this about a ring
from your mother?

27
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:18,900
- she'd have found out eventually.
- I knew it.

28
00:01:18,987 --> 00:01:21,852
I knew that woman never liked me so you
lied and tell me that she did but i knew

29
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:23,993
- where are you going?
- I gotta go back to work.

30
00:01:24,257 --> 00:01:25,872
- Is it Archer?
- What is it?

31
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:28,913
Was he always that cagey?
I don't remember him being that cagey.

32
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,453
- no, he's not.
- you guys, what if he's lying?

33
00:01:31,536 --> 00:01:32,590
What if it is about Archer

34
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:35,233
and he just doesn't want us all
running over there and panicking?

35
00:01:46,186 --> 00:01:47,332
Is he all right?

36
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:49,772
- let the man rest.
- where's Derek?

37
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:53,210
I don't know. Weren't you all
gonna stay outta my hair for an hour?

38
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:56,832
- Naomi?
- Baby, I'm right here. I'm here.

39
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:58,490
What's... my socks?

40
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:01,243
It's the drugs talking.
It's better if he sleeps.

41
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:02,893
Let him enjoy the ride.

42
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:06,961
Sam, you okay?

43
00:02:10,807 --> 00:02:15,790
<i>Private Practice S02e16 Ex-Life</i>

44
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:19,692
you're gonna have to talk to the Chief.
He should be in the E.R

45
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:21,342
asthma attacks are not surgical.

46
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,962
Miranda, we need to keep an eye on him
and Archer. We can't do that if

47
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:25,861
I refer you back
to my previous statement.

48
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:28,041
Fine, I will speak to the Chief.

49
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:32,623
He should probably be on continuous nebs
and a course of steroids.

50
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:34,360
Do you think that, they know that...

51
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:36,421
see the two nurses in
there gratuitously

52
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:39,460
mopping his brow, fluffing his pillow?
I think they got it.

53
00:02:39,547 --> 00:02:41,561
I've never seen an attack
this bad before.

54
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,343
He wasn't exerting, he wasn't walking
through through a field of wild

55
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:46,500
blooming flowers.
He was in a hospital

56
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:51,593
watching you doting over Archer, and he
was unable to get oxygen into his lungs.

57
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:53,903
- do I need to draw a picture?
- we are divorced,

58
00:02:54,077 --> 00:02:57,243
we are happily divorced.
I am with Archer. He is with sonya.

59
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:59,421
We're way, way, way past each other.

60
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:04,490
- what do we got?
- she can't breathe.

61
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:06,701
I can breathe,
it's just a lot of work.

62
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:08,200
Try not to talk, all right?

63
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:10,300
- what's her pulse ox?
- 92 on 4 liters.

64
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:12,613
I tried to use the bronchodilator
but no response.

65
00:03:13,118 --> 00:03:15,663
Panicking is only gonna make it
harder for you to breathe.

66
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:19,593
Both you and your baby need all the
oxygen you can get, so try to calm down.

67
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:22,013
Let's do a chest film,
blood gas and an E.K.G

68
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:24,421
why is this happening?
Did something go wrong with the surgery?

69
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:26,641
Like I said, there were some
complications in the surgery,

70
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:29,330
but it shouldn't have anything to do
with this. Squeeze my hands for me.

71
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:33,103
I don't know what's going on yet,
but I promise you, I'll figure it out.

72
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:40,772
Archer's out of surgery,
and it went well.

73
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:45,430
On the other hand,
Sam almost passed out from asthma,

74
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:47,602
which I heard was
actually kind of fun.

75
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:51,432
Anyway, I just thought you'd want
to know since Archer works for you.

76
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:54,000
Thanks for the update, dr. Freedman

77
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:57,573
I know you're upset about me living with
Violet. I know you feel excluded,

78
00:03:57,657 --> 00:03:59,462
but it doesn't have to be like that.

79
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:02,332
- you could be part of it.
- part of it, Cooper

80
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:05,442
Really? What exactly
do you think that would look like?

81
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:08,730
Me living with the two of you, reading
"mother goose" to Violet's swollen belly

82
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:10,713
while you're giving her
pregnancy massages?

83
00:04:10,857 --> 00:04:14,053
Or how about me puttin' on my
bo peep outfit, trying to seduce

84
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:16,993
you while she's calling out
from the next room for a puke bucket?

85
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:20,921
Or better yet me taking video of you and
Violet bringing your little snot home?

86
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:23,802
It's not my little snot,
and I'm not trying to be the father.

87
00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:26,163
- I'm just trying to be a friend.
- above and beyond.

88
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:27,973
If you got to know
Violet a little better

89
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:30,560
- I'd rather have teeth pulled.
- she's my best friend,

90
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:33,333
if she were a guy, wouldn't you make
an effort to get to know my best friend?

91
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:36,021
If she were a guy, she'd be on
"20/20" for getting pregnant.

92
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:38,550
Just think about it.

93
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,782
Start with thinking about...
lunch.

94
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:44,991
I gotta go, but just...

95
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:48,012
just think about it.

96
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,813
- Is she okay?
- Lungs are clear

97
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:54,530
No wheezing, no congestion

98
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:57,701
I went to get the phone, and she slept
and I didn't know that she slept

99
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:00,883
I didn't know, and then
I didn't hear her

100
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,122
and there were bubbles
coming out her nose. Oh God!

101
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:07,801
Cynthia's fine. It happens, accidents
happen to new moms all the time.

102
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,701
That beeing said, don't answer
the phone when the baby's in the tub.

103
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:13,170
I know that.

104
00:05:13,705 --> 00:05:15,800
I know that, I mean you told me that

105
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:19,812
I know that, I mean, I should've known
that. I'm an educated person I mean

106
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:22,091
I mean, who does anything
while their baby's in the tub?

107
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:25,562
I mean, who does anything
but love their baby?

108
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,931
I'm so sorry, I'm so tired
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:29,942
Baby's not sleeping much, is she?

110
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,242
Not sleeping through the night

111
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:35,531
Come here Cynthia, you know Rachel,
have a seat,

112
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,791
take a few deep breath
and close your eyes

113
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:40,143
I take the baby,
you just rest for me, okay?

114
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,241
I'll be right back.

115
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:50,090
You really not coming to me
for help with the baby yet

116
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:52,481
No, it's the mom, she's hysterical

117
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:57,312
Rachel, this is...

118
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:00,863
- Where is she?
- Crap.

119
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:07,730
I want to publicize
your brother's case

120
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:09,582
and when I do,
I need to use his name

121
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:12,280
Since when do we named patients in
medical studies?

122
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:15,860
Well a world class neurologist has been
saved by a world class neuro surgeon

123
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:18,133
It's not a paper, it's a story

124
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:20,271
and I need a story

125
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,731
- You hate that kind of stuff
- I do a lot of stuff I hate now.

126
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:25,711
My hospital dropped
to number twelve.

127
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:27,440
Well, haven't you heard

128
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:31,621
And, if you're comfortable with it,
we'd like to use your name

129
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,132
I mean, it's a nice angle.

130
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,833
- Neuroseurgeon saves neurologist
- Sure!

131
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:38,652
- He didn't save me though
- I'm pretty sure he did

132
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:41,360
with you beeing here alive
and breathing at all

133
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:44,952
My hand is shaking,
my head is killing me

134
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,810
my vision is blur
and the room is spining

135
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:50,582
Get a C.T

136
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:53,380
He miss something.

137
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:13,330
You okay?

138
00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:15,022
I have this list of names

139
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:17,812
for the very moment she was in me,
I want to meet her first

140
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:22,613
Sarah and Lily and Elori witch I thought
was so pretty. I never heard it before

141
00:07:22,697 --> 00:07:24,452
but I read in a book.
And Grace... and...

142
00:07:24,535 --> 00:07:26,770
it was a day an a half
of labour and pushing

143
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:30,150
and I did it with no drugs or anything.
And I pushed, and i pushed but

144
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:33,592
She was stuck, she's stubborn...
She's so...

145
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:37,451
stubborn, she didn't want to come out.
The doctor even got the vacuum but she

146
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:39,554
didn't want to come, she was

147
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,952
such a good baby when she was
on the inside, she was

148
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:45,880
a good baby when...
I couldn't use any of the names because

149
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:49,571
When she came out, they didn't fit, so
my husband named her Cinthya

150
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:51,952
- He named her, but I love her
- Of course you do.

151
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:57,182
- I really love her. Where is she?
- Just right here

152
00:07:57,466 --> 00:08:00,180
Just right here,
but I think Dr Freedman is just gonna...

153
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:03,142
run a few more tests.
We just wanted you to know

154
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:04,392
She's not okay?

155
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:06,401
- She's fine
- She's fine

156
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:09,233
I want just gonna make sure
we gonna run a few more tests. So

157
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:13,162
Dr Fredman, you can go with Cynthia
and I'll stay with Rachel.

158
00:08:19,227 --> 00:08:21,482
- You're really tired aren't you?
- I am.

159
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:24,133
I'm really really tired.

160
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:37,972
Archer's awake and complainig,
am I right?

161
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:40,173
You have to be happy,
is on five of morphine.

162
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:42,753
He says that his
vision is blurry and

163
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:45,382
he would like you to run another C.T

164
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,883
Your brother's an ass,
his vision is probably impaired

165
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:51,712
because he can see past his own ego

166
00:08:51,755 --> 00:08:54,152
His post-op examination
was fine, he doesn't need a C.T

167
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:56,571
He just need to sleep at off

168
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,671
you're gonna act like some random
surgeon with a God complex

169
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:05,431
so I'm gonna speak to you like one.
What's going on with you? Wath's wrong?

170
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:08,000
I operated on a pregnant
woman earlier tonight

171
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:10,632
- and now she can't breathe.
- Did you toss E.P?

172
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:11,952
No, scan's negative.

173
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:15,902
I nicked her aneurysm during surgery

174
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:17,720
I repeair her perfectly?

175
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:20,433
I've just never seen a post-op
complication like this.

176
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,323
I get a C.T, chest X-Ray

177
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:23,991
- eccho
- Did you chek the baby?

178
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:26,721
- I checked the FHT, they were fine.
- You need to run a doppler.

179
00:09:26,768 --> 00:09:29,112
- It's the mother who can't breathe.
- Trust me on this Derek.

180
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:32,460
You need to run a doppler, do it now.
The baby could be the problem.

181
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:37,980
Excuse me. Could someone
tell me what's going on please?

182
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:40,532
It's possible that your wife is
having trouble breathing

183
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,603
because there's something
wrong with the baby

184
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:45,513
- There's something wrong with the baby?
- Sometimes it can happen

185
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:47,883
My wife was fine
when we walked in here.

186
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,961
Now, she can't breathe and you tell me
there's something wrong with the baby

187
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:53,571
- My wife was fine, she was fine.
- She wasn't fine.

188
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:55,893
She ran over you with the car,
and then she has sezure.

189
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:57,892
- She wasn't fine
- She's mirroring

190
00:09:58,538 --> 00:10:00,190
- What does that mean
- Mirror Syndrom

191
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:02,983
It's rare, but sometimes,
if the baby is sick in utero

192
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:04,743
the mother will mirror its symptoms

193
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:07,582
- So it's psycological
- No, the symptoms are very real.

194
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,402
And in this case, the baby is anemic

195
00:10:09,528 --> 00:10:12,123
and the anemia is causing congestive
heart failure in both of them

196
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:14,092
- What can we do?
- He need to get a blood type

197
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,321
and do an antibody screen

198
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:18,601
- What if one of them is positive?
- Just... Take it a step at a time.

199
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:23,822
You want to put needles in me?

200
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:27,421
Well, I prefer you let me give you some
pills to calm you down, but you said

201
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,810
No, I'm still nursing, so I'm

202
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:32,510
I don't want to hurt the baby,
I don't... want to hurt my baby

203
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:36,370
So that's why Dr Wilder gonna use
the needles to help you get some rest.

204
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:39,832
- He's very good.
- What about Cindy

205
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:43,502
She's fine. We're runnig the tests.
The nurses are with her.

206
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:46,441
We have babies here all the time.

207
00:10:47,117 --> 00:10:50,481
You're so kind. Jut...
Thank you for beeing so kind.

208
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:00,460
Okay Rachel, lay right down

209
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:02,293
Post partum hormons

210
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:05,190
are all over the place usually they
have a calming effect but sometimes,

211
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:07,740
the body chemistry goes a little
haywire they can really amp you up

212
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:09,953
keep you from sleeping.
What acuponture does

213
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:13,271
is target specific points
to put your bodyback in balance.

214
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,451
It realises endorphines,
which counter the hormones

215
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:18,963
- it's kind of a natural sedative.
- The baby doesn't sleep. Not a night.

216
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:21,502
She doesn't sleep and
the refrigator's broken

217
00:11:21,658 --> 00:11:23,431
It sounds like dying pigeon, like

218
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:27,292
like a dying pigeon my husban says.

219
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,481
And you get so tired of feeling
so tired so you just drink more cofee

220
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,842
and then the baby falls asleep
and you can't sleep anyway

221
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,882
and then last night, I was up, I was
holding baby I was nursing her and

222
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:39,910
I left the TV on and there all this
infomertial that you would never see

223
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:42,413
if you only watch TV during
the day. All these infomercial about

224
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:44,833
how to become a refrigirator
repair man and then...

225
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,260
she fell asleep on my boob
and I was dozing off and I was

226
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:50,040
finally, finally sleeping

227
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,892
and then
the refrigirator did that...

228
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,080
someone should put that refrigerator
out of its godforsaken misery

229
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:59,401
That's smells nice
You're burning it. It smells nice

230
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:03,261
Where the hell is Addisson?

231
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,651
Where is the hot

232
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:09,293
of a brother-in-law?
Does he know how to do a post-op exam?

233
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:11,142
I'm his highest
profile case in years.

234
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:15,161
Dr Shepherd has another complicated
case, and Addisson's consulting.

235
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:18,001
- It's a woman who's mirroring
- I'm dying!

236
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:23,320
Alone... The trials of Seattle's
wretched refuse do not interest me.

237
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:26,460
- You're not alone.
- Right I have you.

238
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:31,840
- That's the drugs talking
- Right.

239
00:12:32,588 --> 00:12:35,601
And Naomi's all,
"Archer, honey, you okay?"

240
00:12:35,897 --> 00:12:36,930
You hit the deck.

241
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:39,063
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

242
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,973
Well, it's not my theory, it's
Addisson's but it's a compeling one.

243
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,262
I'm not hung up on my ex-wife,
I divorced her willingly.

244
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:50,030
I have asthma, all right?
It's medical.

245
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:51,671
Not emotional.

246
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:53,700
I always liked Addisson.

247
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:56,640
I don't always like everybody
but I always liked her.

248
00:12:57,056 --> 00:13:00,101
She smells nice, she's polite
and she saves babies.

249
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:02,002
So what happen to the brother?

250
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:05,771
- Was he lost at birth, raised by wolves?
- He's not always such an ass.

251
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:08,571
- Yeah he is.
- Dr Bailey do me a favor

252
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:10,172
Help me set this idiot straight.

253
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,541
Will you please find something
medically wrong with me.

254
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:13,973
I do my best.

255
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:22,910
- What?
- How does a woman go from you

256
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:25,022
to Archer Montgomery?

257
00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:30,100
That's a nice compliment.
That is? It's a compliment? Right?

258
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:33,101
And, how do you stand by and watch?

259
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:36,903
- Why would you want to?
- Well, Archer is an old friend

260
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:39,031
Not an old friend, he's like family.

261
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:41,582
We go back and...

262
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,210
he was gonna die...

263
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:47,003
I thought he was gonna die
and I knew that I couldn't

264
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:49,151
stay in LA while that was happening.

265
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:53,862
I couldn't wrap my head around it.

266
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:58,243
- It's an old college friend dying.
- But he's not. He's not dying.

267
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:03,110
And now, you're just up here in Seattle
watching your wife, stand by her

268
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:04,973
highly unlikable boyfriend.

269
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,670
- Ex-wife.
- Right.

270
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:10,950
Life never turns out the way you thought
it would when you were young, does it?

271
00:14:15,218 --> 00:14:18,691
I'd like you to run a post-op
C.T on Archer Montgomery.

272
00:14:19,398 --> 00:14:21,673
I thought Shepherd nixed that idea.

273
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:23,670
He's not worried... I am.

274
00:14:24,226 --> 00:14:27,901
I'm about to call a bunch of newspapers
and tell them about this medical miracle.

275
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:30,561
I can only do that if it was
indeed a miracle.

276
00:14:30,717 --> 00:14:32,972
And Derek has a lot
going on already so

277
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:35,480
- No need to bother him...
- Okay, fine.

278
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:37,233
I keep it under wraps

279
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:42,802
as much as one can wheeling a
hopped-up blowhard around the hospital

280
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:54,080
I think your patient needs a little
more than sleep. She's maniac.

281
00:14:54,587 --> 00:14:56,550
She's got a real sleep dep.
I'm thinking...

282
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,731
Post Partum psychosis

283
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:00,042
I know, I just got off the phone
with her husband.

284
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,312
He's gonna get the baby. He's gonna
pre-admit Rachel to the hospital.

285
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:06,181
What?

286
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:08,870
You think you would have
mention the psychosis thing

287
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:11,472
I was chewing on it.
I told you she needs help.

288
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:14,680
- You were using me to buy time.
- I was using you to do what you do well.

289
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:17,173
I just don't stick needle into
people, Violet. I'm a doctor.

290
00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:19,523
If you had consulted with me,
treat me like a partner,

291
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:21,361
I could've told you she needs
more than acupuncture,

292
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,251
but instead, you treated me
like a baby-sitter

293
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:26,860
Cooper's the baby-sitter.
You're the mommy-sitter

294
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:35,721
She needed sleep, I needed you.

295
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,390
You keep everything
to yourself, Violet.

296
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:39,622
This practice is about sharing,
you used to know that.

297
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,240
I don't think you're mad about Rachel,
I think you're mad about me.

298
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:45,081
Why? 'Cause I might be the father of your
child you won't even talk to me about?

299
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,620
My baby's crying.
She's crying, where is she?

300
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:49,432
- Rachel, she's okay
- She's okay, you're okay.

301
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:52,042
- Rachel look at me.
- I can hear her, I can hear her crying.

302
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:55,053
Cyndi! Cyndi, mommy's coming.
Where is she?

303
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:02,520
There's evidence of hemolysis.

304
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,281
Damn it!

305
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:08,273
Damn it.

306
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:10,923
Can I ask you something?

307
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:12,892
Are you happy?

308
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:16,160
My brother just had a brain surgery

309
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:18,331
No, I know, I just...

310
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,080
I'm with Izzie
Did you hear we're together now?

311
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,743
She's a mess. She's a mess
and I know it's my own fault

312
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:26,563
I'm always picking the crazy chicks.

313
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:28,863
Present company excepted.

314
00:16:29,665 --> 00:16:30,662
I love her.

315
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:33,413
I do, I love her, and
I wanna be with her, except

316
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:37,360
I kinda don't. I kinda want to run

317
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:41,513
'cause it's like there's a train coming.
There's...

318
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:44,022
I can feel the ground shaking.

319
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:47,653
Something's coming, and I kinda just
want to run,

320
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:49,932
go somewhere new,
start over like you did.

321
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:54,341
So I'm asking, are you happy
you did it? Did it work?

322
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:57,821
I didn't run, Alex.
I walked.

323
00:16:58,905 --> 00:16:59,803
I walked away.

324
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:02,012
- There's a difference.
- But are you happy?

325
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:05,902
Recheck the labs and titers.
I want to make sure,

326
00:17:05,996 --> 00:17:08,661
absolutely sure, before
I give that family catastrophic news.

327
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:16,991
Give me my baby!
Give her to me. Give me my baby.

328
00:17:17,175 --> 00:17:20,013
- I was just gonna give her a bottle.
- She's fine, Rachel. She's fine.

329
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,633
Come back to my office.
Everything's fine. You need rest.

330
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,791
I want her. I want her.
Give her to me.

331
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:30,031
Why won't you give her to me?
I didn't mean to hurt her. Please.

332
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:32,962
- I didn't mean to hurt her.
- Cindy's okay. She's okay.

333
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:37,390
And she needs you, but, sweetie,
you're not any good to her right now.

334
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:41,451
You need to sleep, okay? So why don't
you let us take care of her while you

335
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:43,080
She was in the tub

336
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:46,222
and she was crying. She's always
crying, and I was asking her to stop.

337
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,340
I just wanted her to stop crying.

338
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:53,743
And she slipped, and her head
went under, and I reached for her...

339
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:57,703
and then...
I held her down.

340
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:04,523
And it was quiet,
and I just kept thinking, Andrew

341
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:10,573
won't be home until dinner, and no one
would know until dinner, and I could...

342
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:15,253
I could finally get
a couple of hours of sleep.

343
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:34,001
So Archer is gonna get
another C.T just to be sure.

344
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:35,703
I know. That's good.

345
00:18:38,437 --> 00:18:39,463
You okay?

346
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:42,611
Am I crazy, jumping in
so fast with Archer?

347
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,770
You have someone to care about.
He has you. That's a good thing.

348
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:52,322
What?

349
00:18:54,156 --> 00:18:59,473
Alex, you, Archer, Mark, Sam
you all have new people.

350
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:01,572
I am treating a patient

351
00:19:01,846 --> 00:19:04,841
who ran over her husband
with a car and he still loves her.

352
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:07,842
While Derek is proposing.
Did you hear about the ring?

353
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:09,581
No. What ring?

354
00:19:10,227 --> 00:19:11,382
No. Forget it.

355
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:14,810
- You have two. I have none. No fair.
- No. Sam? Please.

356
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,530
It's an adorable theory,
but it does not hold water.

357
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:21,391
I'd lap it up if I were you. I don't have
anybody having asthma attacks over me.

358
00:19:21,857 --> 00:19:25,353
I'm over her. This is not
a panic attack. This is asthma.

359
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:28,290
It's physiological not emotional.

360
00:19:28,857 --> 00:19:30,651
I'm over you. I'm here for friends.

361
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:35,001
You are a friend. But I'm over you,
okay? I'm over you.

362
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:41,602
- Here.
- Shut up.

363
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:47,762
Karev, why haven't
I seen Jen's lab results?

364
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:50,210
Dr. Montgomery wanted
to run another round of

365
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:51,623
I never saw the first round.

366
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:53,371
Sam's not responding to his meds.

367
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:55,702
What did the preliminary lab results
say about Jen's condition?

368
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:57,501
They were inconclusive.
That's why I ordered a repeat.

369
00:19:57,598 --> 00:20:00,140
Look, it's not that complicated.
Either the baby's gonna die or he's not.

370
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:01,722
Either the mother's
gonna die or she's not.

371
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:03,710
Would you excuse us for a moment?

372
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:07,362
Look, I have been up all night, too,
and I don't appreciate you yelling at

373
00:20:07,787 --> 00:20:11,883
My patient. Let me know
when the damn test results get in.

374
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:24,241
- What was that?
- That was we're having lunch,

375
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:27,541
the three of us. And you're
gonna be on your best behavior.

376
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:35,341
- How's Rachel?
- She's stable.

377
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,871
I sedated her with benzos, got her
started on an atypical antipsychotic.

378
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:42,850
She'll have to stop breast-feeding,
which is not ideal, but...

379
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,291
what if mine doesn't sleep?

380
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:52,291
- she'll sleep.
- What if she doesn't?

381
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,982
Then I will stay up
with her while you sleep.

382
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:58,670
What if I go crazy?

383
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,682
What if I get postpartum
psychosis and depression?

384
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,882
What if I try to hurt the baby? Or
what I if I just have a terrible child?

385
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:08,230
Seriously. What if I'm the one
that gives birth to the sociopath

386
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,471
who tries to burn
the high school down?

387
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:13,331
Or what if I just screw up in so
many ways that no amount of therapy

388
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:16,243
can ever repair the damage
that I do to that poor child?

389
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:17,820
Stop.

390
00:21:18,008 --> 00:21:20,331
Postpartum psychosis is very rare.

391
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:22,210
This isn't normal.

392
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:27,562
What if mine doesn't sleep?

393
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:34,852
- sorry.
- I'm afraid you'll have to step out.

394
00:21:34,947 --> 00:21:37,651
I'm a physician,
and I'm his girlfriend.

395
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:40,870
You're not his physician,
and as for girlfriend,

396
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:44,372
Washington state medical code
doesn't consider that a legal role.

397
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:46,502
Fine.

398
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:49,733
Can you just give me some idea
of what you're doing for Sam?

399
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:51,640
He's not responding to the meds.

400
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:53,182
I'm his wife.

401
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:55,171
Ex. And I thought you
were this one's girlfriend.

402
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:57,352
Are you like this with everyone,
or am I just special?

403
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:59,402
Fine. Stay.
But no questions.

404
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:05,641
- Post-op C.T everything okay?
- I don't know.

405
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,493
You know what's weird?

406
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:13,662
You, who has never worn flannel
a day in your life,

407
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:16,523
living in Seattle and
having a semi-incestuous

408
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:19,960
relationship with your
best friend's almost sister.

409
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:24,031
I was gonna say it's weird
that I dislike Archer as much as I do,

410
00:22:24,246 --> 00:22:27,582
and somehow this you-and-Archer
thing gives me hope.

411
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:30,080
- Lexie.
- That's the sister?

412
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:32,822
She's a good girl.
She's a nice girl

413
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:37,561
well-raised, kind and understanding,
sane. She's like you.

414
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:42,650
So if you can find happiness with Archer
I'm thinking, maybe there's hope.

415
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:46,320
You really think this thing is real
between you and this little girl?

416
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:48,841
I'm afraid to hurt her.

417
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,930
- You think Archer's gonna hurt me?
- I hope not.

418
00:22:53,296 --> 00:22:55,953
Like I said, you two give me hope.

419
00:22:59,436 --> 00:23:02,902
Give her another 40 off furosemide
and get a repeat chest.

420
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:06,862
- what do you got?
- I've been hoping. I...

421
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,431
I ran a thousand tests,
and I didn't tell you the results

422
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:13,142
cause I was hoping I was wrong,
but the baby is severely anemic.

423
00:23:13,235 --> 00:23:17,000
His heart's failing. Most likely it's
caused by a kell antigen incompatibility

424
00:23:17,116 --> 00:23:19,563
in the blood you gave
Jen during surgery. It's

425
00:23:19,805 --> 00:23:23,923
causing a reaction that's destroying
the baby's blood. I'm... I'm so sorry.

426
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:25,941
Don't be sorry.
Just tell me how we can fix it.

427
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:29,071
In an ideal circumstance,
I'd do an in utero blood transfusion,

428
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:32,780
but this isn't an ideal circumstance.
Jen is deteriorating rapidly.

429
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:35,051
She could arrest at any minute, and

430
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:37,210
- the priority has gotta be the mother.
- So what are you saying?

431
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:39,013
I'm saying that
we have to get the baby out.

432
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:41,012
The baby's 24 weeks.
The odds of him surviving

433
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:45,401
but if i take him out, she lives.
If we don't, we risk losing them both.

434
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:52,543
He's not ready. He's too little.
He's not ready

435
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:55,182
Jen, I know that this is scary,
but I'm gonna do everything that

436
00:23:55,305 --> 00:23:58,573
My book says he can live if we get
him to 26 weeks. That's in two weeks.

437
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,130
So let me just... I can stay in
the hospital and be on oxygen

438
00:24:02,218 --> 00:24:03,842
and keep him in for two more weeks.

439
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:07,183
Jen, your baby is in congestive
heart failure. So are you.

440
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,602
You don't have two more weeks.

441
00:24:10,327 --> 00:24:12,483
You're not taking him out.
He's too little.

442
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:14,572
- He's too little.
- Would he survive?

443
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:17,620
- If you take him out, will he
- he absolutely could survive.

444
00:24:17,797 --> 00:24:20,822
I've delivered babies that are one to
two days younger even that've survived.

445
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:24,583
I've also lost babies that are several
weeks older. It's just a risk.

446
00:24:24,776 --> 00:24:27,523
I'm not going to lie to you.
But I'm going to do everything

447
00:24:27,737 --> 00:24:30,630
- that I can to save him.
- Please tell me this isn't happening.

448
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:34,713
There's absolutely nothing else you
can do, right? There's no other options?

449
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:37,601
There is an in utero procedure.

450
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:40,301
Wait? What is that?

451
00:24:40,757 --> 00:24:43,281
- That's not an option here.
- She's strong

452
00:24:45,365 --> 00:24:47,703
that's not an option here.
The risk is far too high. I'm sorry.

453
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,313
You have to do it.
You have to fix him.

454
00:24:50,785 --> 00:24:52,651
It's your job to fix him.

455
00:24:53,068 --> 00:24:55,712
Jen, let me be clear...
if we do this and your heart

456
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:58,401
condition worsens
or you get another brain bleed,

457
00:24:58,646 --> 00:25:01,142
both you and the baby could die.

458
00:25:01,296 --> 00:25:02,720
That's not gonna happen.

459
00:25:02,897 --> 00:25:04,421
No, it's not gonna happen.

460
00:25:04,688 --> 00:25:08,923
Please. Just do the thing where you
leave him in. That's what I choose.

461
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:10,521
Leave him in.

462
00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:18,781
You cornered me. I come in and say we
have to deliver that baby,

463
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:21,962
and then you ride in on a white
horse offering some in utero procedure

464
00:25:22,055 --> 00:25:23,561
that you know nothing about.

465
00:25:23,698 --> 00:25:24,960
Is it gonna kill her
or is there a chance?

466
00:25:25,077 --> 00:25:27,290
I don't know, Derek.
Those are odds I don't like to evaluate

467
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,311
in front of a weeping mother
clutching her belly.

468
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:32,210
Evaluate it now. Run some tests.
Figure it out. Just keep that baby alive

469
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:34,083
and I will keep her alive.

470
00:25:40,356 --> 00:25:41,643
How does this happen?

471
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,913
She's...
She loves this baby.

472
00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:49,571
How did this happen? How did I
let it happen? How did I miss it?

473
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:51,851
Postpartum depression
is very insidious.

474
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:56,321
It sneaks up on you, so it can
be triggered by sleep deprivation,

475
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:58,623
then the depression
makes it harder to sleep.

476
00:25:58,797 --> 00:26:00,851
It's a vicious cycle,
and then when there's psychosis

477
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:03,493
I'm tired, too. I am so tired.
But I couldn't...

478
00:26:04,655 --> 00:26:05,923
I couldn't...

479
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:08,101
how could she do this?

480
00:26:08,255 --> 00:26:10,580
You can't understand
because you're not in her body.

481
00:26:10,676 --> 00:26:13,541
- You can't experience...
- it isn't anything you missed, Andrew.

482
00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:15,713
You're the dad.
You're on the outside.

483
00:26:15,896 --> 00:26:19,280
You're as close as you can be,
but you are on the outside.

484
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:22,130
And if she doesn't let you in...

485
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:27,842
she didn't tell you what she was
feeling. It isn't your fault.

486
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:31,331
Rachel wants to see Cindy.
She

487
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:34,723
was asleep for a couple of hours, but
her milk let down, and it woke her up

488
00:26:34,938 --> 00:26:36,471
What do I do now?

489
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,542
How are you?

490
00:26:45,808 --> 00:26:48,482
I've seen you and Archer together.
We've talked about

491
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:51,871
your sex life. We've talked about
my sex life. I'm okay with where we are.

492
00:26:52,085 --> 00:26:54,033
- It's fine, Sam.
- No, I don't want it toe fine.

493
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,910
I want you believe that...

494
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:58,760
dr. Bailey, please give me
some good news.

495
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:02,731
Sorry. No news. I ran everything again.
You had bronchospasms.

496
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,491
We started you on steroids
and a bronchodilator, we

497
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:07,972
reintroduced the new inhaler
we got you yesterday

498
00:27:08,185 --> 00:27:09,943
Wait. You gave him a new inhaler?

499
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,443
Was it an inhaler
with a corn-based propellant?

500
00:27:12,638 --> 00:27:15,181
No how would I know that?
Is it a problem?

501
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,291
I'm allergic to
corn-based propellants.

502
00:27:17,497 --> 00:27:19,992
Did you tell me you were
allergic to corn-based propellants?

503
00:27:20,086 --> 00:27:22,322
But I gave you
my inhaler to be refilled,

504
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,940
and I specifically
requested that inhaler.

505
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:28,263
- I ordered the generic.
- He didn't ask you for the generic.

506
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:32,741
We don't keep the brand names on the
clinic shel... I was doing him a favor.

507
00:27:33,296 --> 00:27:35,403
- Excuse me?
- I said "ha!"

508
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,311
Ha because I was right.

509
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,991
Ha because it was
an allergic reaction,

510
00:27:40,246 --> 00:27:44,301
so ha to Mark and Addison
and you if you believed them.

511
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:47,393
It was not a panic attack.
It was an asthmattack.

512
00:27:47,585 --> 00:27:50,222
I am not pathetic.
I am a man.

513
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,673
I am a man with asthma.
So ha!

514
00:27:54,535 --> 00:27:56,231
Give me some, dr. Bailey.

515
00:28:08,076 --> 00:28:08,871
So?

516
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:12,340
She's in no condition to have fetal
surgery a surgery that will

517
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:15,661
likely kill her. Only her surgeon has
promised... promised

518
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:18,422
to keep her alive,
and you want me to say yes.

519
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:22,041
I think the best plan
is to deliver the baby, Derek.

520
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,422
I have an excellent
record with preemies.

521
00:28:24,718 --> 00:28:26,222
I nicked her aneurysm.

522
00:28:26,378 --> 00:28:28,830
I don't do that. I never do that.
I don't know why I did it.

523
00:28:28,928 --> 00:28:31,292
I don't know if it was
because I was tired...

524
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,690
- or sloppy.
- Derek, things happen during surgery.

525
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:36,581
They happen to great surgeons who aren't
tired and sloppy. They just happen.

526
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:37,980
- Not to me.
- This isn't your fault.

527
00:28:38,027 --> 00:28:41,092
The transfusion didn't work... The blood
didn't match perfectly. That happens

528
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:52,531
If I hadn't have nicked the aneurysm...
she wouldn't require blood.

529
00:28:53,206 --> 00:28:54,670
It is my fault.

530
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,142
It is.

531
00:28:58,347 --> 00:29:01,362
If that baby dies,
I can't live with that.

532
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:03,112
Please.

533
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:05,850
Addison, please.

534
00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:12,101
Okay, I'll do it.

535
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:25,941
- how you doing, Jen?
- If you're saving my baby. I'm great.

536
00:29:26,168 --> 00:29:28,273
Heart rate shot up to 134.

537
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:30,782
Jen, are you panicking?
I need you not to panic.

538
00:29:30,878 --> 00:29:33,550
I'm not.
I'm not panicking. I just...

539
00:29:33,747 --> 00:29:36,401
- I just... I can't really breathe.
- Her lungs are filling up with fluid.

540
00:29:36,495 --> 00:29:40,021
- Push another 80 of furosemide.
- Bring in the crash cart.

541
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:44,643
She's in and out of
a psychotic state.

542
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:48,060
Until the medication is totally in her,
until she's treated, she could hurt her.

543
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:50,912
- She could snap her neck.
- but she's not gonna be alone with her.

544
00:29:51,155 --> 00:29:53,412
- She'll be monitored the whole time.
- Well, all it takes is a minute.

545
00:29:53,507 --> 00:29:54,872
She stopped herself, Violet.

546
00:29:55,057 --> 00:29:57,121
She had a horrible impulse.
She did a horrible thing.

547
00:29:57,425 --> 00:29:59,373
But she stopped herself
and came to us for help.

548
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:00,862
I know. It's just...

549
00:30:01,605 --> 00:30:03,163
she could've killed her.

550
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:06,052
Do we want to be the ones
who put her back in her mother's arms

551
00:30:06,145 --> 00:30:08,813
and then something terrible happens
and they think, what were they thinking?

552
00:30:08,897 --> 00:30:12,020
But you can't just cut her out.
You can't take her baby away from her.

553
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:15,143
She needs that to get better.
You can't cut a parent out.

554
00:30:15,418 --> 00:30:17,801
Just stop it.
Just stop it, Pete.

555
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:20,052
This is not about you.

556
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:21,823
This is not about us.

557
00:30:23,675 --> 00:30:27,651
Violet, here, look at me.
Look. You just said it.

558
00:30:28,018 --> 00:30:29,501
It's not about you or Pete.

559
00:30:29,905 --> 00:30:31,911
We know that you know more
about what's going on in her head.

560
00:30:32,037 --> 00:30:33,982
So as far as I'm concerned,
I'll back you with Andrew.

561
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:36,521
If you advise him to keep
the baby way, I will back you,

562
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,683
but Rachel is not a criminal.

563
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:42,580
She's a good mom,
a mom who wanted this child.

564
00:30:42,677 --> 00:30:44,262
And if there's a chance

565
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:46,712
that her staying bonded
with this child is gonna help her

566
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:48,812
hold on, help her get better...

567
00:30:49,946 --> 00:30:52,352
don't you think
we ought to give her that chance?

568
00:30:57,278 --> 00:30:58,950
The hormones are insane.

569
00:30:59,896 --> 00:31:02,901
They're like...
god, they're insane.

570
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:06,111
I mean,
already it's like I'm not me.

571
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:10,702
I mean, mostly I am,
but sometimes it... I'm just not.

572
00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:14,801
And my hormones are in the normal range.
Hers were not.

573
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:16,812
So we can't be emotional.

574
00:31:16,907 --> 00:31:19,791
- We have to be responsible.
- So you cut her out.

575
00:31:20,115 --> 00:31:22,321
You decide. You cut her out.

576
00:31:28,578 --> 00:31:31,681
- I'm gonna hug you now.
- That would be good.

577
00:31:41,255 --> 00:31:43,930
- I knew we shouldn't have done this.
- You can do it, Addison. Keep going.

578
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,682
- Pulse ox is only 88. Keep going.
- Shut up. Damn it.

579
00:31:46,935 --> 00:31:49,093
You cornered me.
I let you corner me. This...

580
00:31:49,528 --> 00:31:52,030
This is the hot dog thanksgiving
all over again.

581
00:31:52,045 --> 00:31:55,513
You know what. Your mother breaks her
wrist, so the day before thanksgiving,

582
00:31:55,766 --> 00:31:58,260
you invite 34 people over to our
house without asking me,

583
00:31:58,355 --> 00:32:00,441
knowing I've never
cooked a turkey in my life.

584
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:03,123
Your sister gets salmonella,
and your mother, who never liked me,

585
00:32:03,205 --> 00:32:05,423
accuses me of trying to kill
everyone, and then you...

586
00:32:05,687 --> 00:32:08,051
make hot dogs, and you're the hero.

587
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:10,653
It's the exact same thing, Derek.
You make some cavalier statement,

588
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,952
then I gotta do all the work,
and no matter how it turns out,

589
00:32:12,995 --> 00:32:14,333
you're the hero and I'm incompetent.

590
00:32:14,377 --> 00:32:17,163
- Her respirations are stabilizing.
- How's her pulse ox?

591
00:32:17,388 --> 00:32:18,591
It says 92.

592
00:32:19,527 --> 00:32:20,701
Lungs are clearing.

593
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:24,950
You did it.

594
00:32:26,898 --> 00:32:27,822
I did it.

595
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:30,452
I did it.

596
00:32:31,028 --> 00:32:33,203
- Who's the hero now?
- Shut up.

597
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,980
- How are you feeling?
- Little more awake?

598
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:41,183
You took scans.

599
00:32:41,538 --> 00:32:44,322
Derek's nowhere to be found.
What the hell is wrong with him?

600
00:32:45,618 --> 00:32:47,290
Does he even know?

601
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:50,643
Derek's still in surgery. Let's
not keep you in the dark any longer.

602
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:52,342
Just give 'em to me.

603
00:32:59,668 --> 00:33:00,461
What?

604
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:07,082
Well, here and here,
those are persistent cysts.

605
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:09,381
Those are parasitic cysts.

606
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,972
See, Derek didn't get it all.

607
00:33:12,927 --> 00:33:14,313
I'm going to die.

608
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:19,800
I could die any minute.

609
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:25,050
Just admit it.

610
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:27,292
Your mother never liked me.

611
00:33:28,265 --> 00:33:31,182
She didn't dislike you, it's
just, when you gave Nancy salmonella,

612
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,381
- it didn't help
- Come on

613
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:35,382
She hated me long before
I poisoned your sister.

614
00:33:35,538 --> 00:33:38,073
She hated me from the moment
she met me, and that never changed.

615
00:33:38,165 --> 00:33:42,600
She thought that I was rich
and privileged and wrong for you,

616
00:33:43,097 --> 00:33:45,901
and that's why
she didn't give me the ring.

617
00:33:46,295 --> 00:33:50,301
Just admit it, so at least then I'll
know that I wasn't crazy for 11 years.

618
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:52,851
She hated you.

619
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:54,931
Thank you.

620
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:58,350
- You two finished here?
- What?

621
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:01,211
- What's wrong? How's Archer?
- Take a look at these.

622
00:34:01,577 --> 00:34:02,903
- Who ordered these?
- I did.

623
00:34:02,985 --> 00:34:05,070
- Why?
- Just look at 'em.

624
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:22,682
Stay close.
Stay right there with them.

625
00:34:22,837 --> 00:34:25,403
- Hold them both.
- I love her.

626
00:34:26,138 --> 00:34:29,091
I know, I know.
It's gonna get better.

627
00:34:29,906 --> 00:34:32,861
You're gonna get better.
You're gonna be okay.

628
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:47,040
I know. I'm so sorry.
My baby, I'm so sorry. Mommy's so sorry.

629
00:34:58,418 --> 00:35:00,791
I'm headed back to the bar.
You guys want...

630
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:03,801
why is it so quiet in here?

631
00:35:05,757 --> 00:35:08,292
- What, somebody die?
- That's not funny.

632
00:35:08,528 --> 00:35:09,861
I slept with Amy Garrison.

633
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:11,851
- What? Who?
- When?

634
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:15,051
You're talking about my girlfiend,
sophomore year?

635
00:35:15,148 --> 00:35:17,871
You went to Atlantic City with
a bunch of guys, and she was lonely.

636
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:20,112
And I slept with her, and I'm sorry.

637
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:23,160
- Archer, you don't have to do this.
- No, I have to.

638
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:25,902
I'm dying.

639
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:27,981
I'm dying and...

640
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:32,713
I wrecked your car, too.

641
00:35:34,988 --> 00:35:37,633
- the plymouth?
- Elsie Jacobs wrecked that car.

642
00:35:37,766 --> 00:35:39,093
No, it was me.

643
00:35:39,377 --> 00:35:40,831
And I was sleeping with her, too.

644
00:35:41,037 --> 00:35:42,540
- what?
- I'm so sorry, man.

645
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:44,883
Dying or not,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

646
00:35:46,528 --> 00:35:48,750
What about Nai, you sleep
with her while she was married?

647
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,601
- No!
- Of course not.

648
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:52,580
But I shouldn't
have slept with her at all.

649
00:35:52,677 --> 00:35:56,190
I shouldn't have done that.
A man doesn't do that to his friends.

650
00:35:56,547 --> 00:35:59,062
- I'm so sorry.
- What do you mean, you're sorry?

651
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:02,242
- What, you're sorry you're with me?
- No, I'm sorry...

652
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:06,432
I have feelings for you. I'm sorry
I'm gonna die and leave you alone.

653
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:10,553
I'm sorry for everybody I ever hurt.
I'm sorry for all the lies I ever told.

654
00:36:10,806 --> 00:36:13,083
I'm sorry I'm not gonna
live long enough to be a better man,

655
00:36:13,246 --> 00:36:17,690
to be the man that you deserve.
I'm so sor...

656
00:36:17,898 --> 00:36:20,482
the next time I save your life, archer,
a simple thank you would suffice.

657
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:23,621
If you were a neurosurgeon and not just
a neurotic, you would know

658
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:26,440
that it's common for a C. S. P to
temporarily fill with fluid post surgery

659
00:36:26,526 --> 00:36:28,961
Repeat a C. T. In a month, and
this will be clear.

660
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:30,611
What, you mean he's gonna be fine?

661
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:33,610
He's gonna be an ass
like he's always been.

662
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:51,450
I get what you're doing for Violet.

663
00:36:52,738 --> 00:36:54,122
Please tell me you're
not changing your mind.

664
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,203
I get that she's your best friend.

665
00:36:56,438 --> 00:36:59,211
But there comes a point in time when you
can't have a woman be your best friend

666
00:36:59,345 --> 00:37:02,262
because there's a more
important woman in your life.

667
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:04,180
There should be.

668
00:37:04,697 --> 00:37:06,490
But you and Violet, it's...

669
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,051
intimate...

670
00:37:08,657 --> 00:37:09,932
and she needs you.

671
00:37:10,835 --> 00:37:14,042
And I think, at the end of the day,
you need her.

672
00:37:14,385 --> 00:37:17,222
And I'm outside of it.
It's your thing...

673
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,240
your thing with violet.

674
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:22,431
And you want me to be
a part of it, but...

675
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:25,892
I don't have it in me
to make it work that way.

676
00:37:26,386 --> 00:37:28,590
I'm supposed to be
your best friend, ooper.

677
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:03,150
I'm doing the best I can...
for the baby.

678
00:38:04,026 --> 00:38:05,172
That's all I can do.

679
00:38:05,328 --> 00:38:08,033
And you don't think your
baby needs a father? You think that

680
00:38:08,555 --> 00:38:10,761
Uncle Coop is gonna fill that void?

681
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:15,283
Cooper gives me support, no strings.
And that's what I need.

682
00:38:16,008 --> 00:38:19,190
- That's all I can handle right now.
- I get that he loves you.

683
00:38:19,907 --> 00:38:21,771
He might even love your kid.
But...

684
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:23,651
it's not the same.

685
00:38:24,058 --> 00:38:27,511
It's not what's best for your baby.
If I'm the father...

686
00:38:30,638 --> 00:38:33,830
you give a great speech, Violet,
but really...

687
00:38:35,085 --> 00:38:37,123
all you're thinking about is you.

688
00:38:47,126 --> 00:38:48,861
That should be me in there.

689
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:53,161
You wish you'd just had
parasites removed from your brain?

690
00:38:54,676 --> 00:38:58,142
Always thought that when we got
older, we'd be there for each other.

691
00:38:58,376 --> 00:39:03,250
If one of us got sick, the other could
hold their hand and, you know, be there.

692
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:06,042
Of course you did.
That's what you do for your wife.

693
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,841
Well, ex-wife now.

694
00:39:08,188 --> 00:39:09,823
It was an asthma attack.

695
00:39:10,078 --> 00:39:12,860
Either way, I'm gonna
go home to my husband,

696
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:15,450
with whom things have
been difficult lately,

697
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:20,213
and I'm going to hug him
and kiss him and thank him for...

698
00:39:20,987 --> 00:39:25,630
all the good things that he is
that I sometimes don't bother to notice.

699
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:29,652
And I have you to thank for that,
cause I'm not gonna make your mistake.

700
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:33,663
I don't want to end up standing
outside the window, watching

701
00:39:33,927 --> 00:39:36,062
my life go on without me.

702
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,171
Ex-life.

703
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:51,333
Sorry about the C.T.,
About the second-guessing...

704
00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:54,790
and about Archer. He's sorry, too.
He's grateful. He just...

705
00:39:55,095 --> 00:39:57,230
- He won't admit it.
- I know.

706
00:39:57,967 --> 00:39:59,823
Okay, there he is.
There's the heartbeat.

707
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:02,802
- How's he doing? Is he okay?
- Heart rate's regular and he's active.

708
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:05,392
- So... it worked?
- It worked.

709
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:11,433
God, thank you.
Thank you.

710
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:15,623
- Honey.
- Jenny. Honey, you did it.

711
00:40:16,117 --> 00:40:18,113
- The baby's here. You're here.
- And we're okay?

712
00:40:18,378 --> 00:40:21,650
Everybody's okay.
You got a tough little boy in there.

713
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:25,390
- He's a fighter like his mom.
- we're okay?

714
00:40:28,147 --> 00:40:31,503
I was so scared, Rob.
I was so scared.

715
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:37,332
I kept thinking the tigers would
think I was baby cut... of... blue...

716
00:40:38,678 --> 00:40:40,562
of making baby cut...

717
00:40:41,687 --> 00:40:44,581
She's not making sense.
Why isn't she making sense?

718
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,743
