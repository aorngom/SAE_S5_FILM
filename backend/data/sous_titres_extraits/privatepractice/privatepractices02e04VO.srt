00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,890
***

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,300
I just came back from a
run on the beach alone.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,110
I had lunch alone.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,630
I ran my errands over the weekend alone.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,690
It is what it is.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,450
What does that even mean?

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,190
I want my friend back.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,330
Well,that could be tough,the
way you sandbagged her.

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,050
We have to fix this.

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,430
Maybe.

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,060
maybe sam and naomi
should work together.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,670
-Maybe that's the answer.
-Maybe it is what it is.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,950
You know what? There's something
wrong with you. I'm calling violet.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,830
No,don't--don't
call violet.

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,830
-Hello?
-We have to do something.

16
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,620
-Tonight?
-About sam and naomi.

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,950
There's nothing too.

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,460
-Are--are you with
pete? -Conference call.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,110
Remember the good old days-- sam and naomi
together,the practice running in harmony?

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,370
You--you didn't
work here then.

21
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,840
That's not the point. The point is
we must return to the way it was.

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,580
Days of yesteryear? Bad idea.

23
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,640
No,no,actually,it's a--it's a great
idea. Hold on. I'm gonna get coop.

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,830
No,don't get coop.

25
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,610
how come I didn't know any
naughty schoolgirls in high school?

26
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,450
I did.

27
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,340
Pete,are you at violet's?

28
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,200
No. Technology. Conference call.

29
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,430
We're doing an intervention.

30
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,440
Ending the war--sam and
naomi,peace at the office.

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,220
Oh,I'm in.

32
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,720
I'm not getting involved,people.

33
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,560
We are gonna put them in a room and create
a supportive,nonthreatening environment.

34
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,950
I need someone to lick my lollipop.

35
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,890
I gotta go.

36
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,790
D-don't hang up.
are--are we agreed?

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,440
Yep,tomorrow,first thing-- operation
"get naomi and sam back together.

38
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,380
" I gotta go. Uh,kevin's here.

39
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,480
If you hang
up,does that mean--

40
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:44,160
Chinese takeout,bottle of wine,fancy subtitled movie,
hot action movie-- whichever you need to be happy.

41
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,710
This is exactly what I need.

42
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,990
How do you feel about rules?

43
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,130
You think we should set
rules for naomi and sam?

44
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,360
No,no. Rules about dating.

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,450
-Sex rules?
-yes,that's right.

46
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,740
Is this you trying to bond with me?

47
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,660
No,I'm seekyog ur professional opinion.

48
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,460
I'm thinking about setting
some rules for myself.

49
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,560
Is this about the S.W.A.T. Guy?

50
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,780
-You two haven'T.
-nope.

51
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:10,840
You're one of those women.

52
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,130
I'm not one of those women. I'm
cautious. I'm trying to be cautious.

53
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,770
-So you don't like him?
-I do like him. I just.

54
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,040
once you sleep
with someone--

55
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,660
I don't know,in the past,I-I messed up.

56
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,120
I just don't want to do that again,so
I thought if I made some rules--

57
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,840
-but you want to sleep with him?
-Yes,

58
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,350
-but my rules,I--
what rules?

59
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,970
-You need to see a therapist.
-Therapists are overrated.

60
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,790
okay,just saw 'em in the
lobby. They're on the way up.

61
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,010
Together? That's a good sign.

62
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,840
Yeah,but they're not talking
at all. Well,that's a bad sign.

63
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Hey,you're back.

64
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,320
I am,I am,full-time
as of today. Okay,okay.

65
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,960
See? Back to the way it was.

66
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,150
all right,be strong,be firm
and don't take no for an answer.

67
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,440
I thought we said no
more secret meetings.

68
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,180
-It's not secret.
-Whose cupcakes?

69
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,120
-What is this?
-It's an intervention.

70
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,780
-Somebody have a problem that I'm not aware of?
-Oh,no,no,no.

71
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,390
-It's for you,for both of you.
-To get you two back.

72
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,160
to the way it used to
be-- our leaders,together.

73
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,130
No. No,that's-- that's
not gonna happen.

74
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,270
Sorry.

75
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,890
Okay,I was being polite.

76
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,010
That is exactly what is going to happen.

77
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,460
We canceled your morning patients.

78
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,890
You two are gonna sit in this
room,you're gonna eat the cupcakes,

79
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,640
and you're gonna remember why it is that you
started this practice in the first place together.

80
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,730
And then you are going to
agree on a way to move forward,

81
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,510
with this practice,together as a family.

82
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,660
Don't come out until you're done.

83
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,200
braden doesn't speak,doesn't
understand when I do.

84
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,280
We've been to five doctors.

85
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,630
My friend beth said you were
amazing with her daughter.

86
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,820
Check this O.

87
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,520
Look at that. A little guy in there.

88
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,660
Please don't just tell me he's autistic.

89
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,500
Braden might be processing more
than you think,and if he is--

90
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:26,950
augmentative communication therapy,sensory
integration programs-- they haven't worked for him.

91
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,390
So he started speaking and.

92
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,070
he just stopped at 4?

93
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,020
So now you say it could be environmental,it
could be genetic,it could be anything.

94
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,700
Sometimes kids ecst bome autistic.

95
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,930
Unfortunately,it's one of those disorders
that just isn't that well understood.

96
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,490
You know,you look familiar.

97
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,410
Do we know each other from somewhere?

98
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,840
-Do we?
-I don't know. Maybe I just want to know you.

99
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,700
So you'll do something for braden.

100
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,430
I'll take a look,I'll see what we
can find,and I will do what I can.

101
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,950
I promise.

102
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,480
Okay. Hey,braden.

103
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,630
Cayou follow the light for me?

104
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,440
Can you look up?

105
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,840
Here. There you go.

106
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,220
Hi.

107
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,520
It's working,

108
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,510
-naysayer.
-It is what it is.

109
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,180
What does that even mean?

110
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,020
You think we're back?

111
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,500
I think we might be back.

112
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,980
Hey,well,

113
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,240
we agree.

114
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,100
-You see?
-We're all gonna vote.

115
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,860
-my way or naomi'S.
-What? No.

116
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,200
You choose which one
of us runs the practice.

117
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,460
And we'll abide by the decision.

118
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,450
This is a bad idea. This
is gonna tear us apart.

119
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,010
I warned you.

120
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,470
Look,you were right. We can't keep
on the way things have been going.

121
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,790
-So we will campaign fairly.
-Right,no dirty tricks,no bribery.

122
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,730
Civil,democratic--the way
the practice should be run.

123
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,960
Are you suggesting that
I want anything else?

124
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,120
Do I get a vote?

125
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,610
I mean,I am part of the
practice. That was the deal,rht?

126
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,380
Yeah,of course you are.

127
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,730
Right. I-I wouldn't
have it any other way.

128
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,390
-So,uh,tomorrow at
the close of business.

129
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,960
Right. We vote.

130
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,380
tomorrow. All right?

131
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,500
so seeing as you're gonna need
votes,I want to start shadowing.

132
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,020
I don't have your vote?

133
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,410
After I bullied sam
into taking you back?

134
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,290
You were the reason that I left.

135
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,780
U're doing a gamete micromanipulation
on friday. I want to assist.

136
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,140
Oh,uh,the coles.

137
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,630
Um,that's--that's
difficult.

138
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,610
It is what you promised. I need to get
the hours for my midwife certification.

139
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,920
I know. It's just that the
coles,uh,can be a little bit jumpy.

140
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,260
So let me think about it,okay?

141
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,020
You think about it. Vote's tomorrow.

142
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,700
Sharb--
sharbat qalzai?

143
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,540
I am sharbat's father,idrees qalzai.

144
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,460
Hello. How do you do?
I'm Dr. Montgomery.

145
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,090
Sharbat identified you as the
top doctor there is for ladies.

146
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,830
I would like for you to give her the
exam you give your very best patients.

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,210
All of my patients get the very
best,and sharbat will be no exception.

148
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,580
So why don't,uh,why don't you come back?

149
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,770
stay right here.

150
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,100
Oh,hey.I'm
not gonna--

151
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,810
I'm not gonna know anything
till I get his labs back.

152
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,780
-I remember where I know you from.
-Nicole?

153
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,920
You're the one in the
pictures,naked,on that web site.

154
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,930
-What?
-The dating site for adults.

155
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,900
-You saw that? -You are
a doctor,a pediatrician--

156
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,470
please,nicole-- how can
you work with children?

157
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,400
Okay,that site has nothing to.

158
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,410
my personal life does not impact
the care I give my patients.

159
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,210
How can it not?

160
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,400
You should not be a doctor.

161
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,040
-So you've been having some discomfort?
-Sort of.

162
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,160
Where exactly are you feeling pain?

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,460
I know discussing these
things can be uncomfortable.

164
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,910
But let's see if I can help?

165
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,520
My daughter was attacked by a man.

166
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,940
I'm so sorry.

167
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,510
-When did this happen?
-A few months ago.

168
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,690
And,uh,is this something
that you reported?

169
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,570
No. That's not what I want.

170
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,070
It is metht soing we do. But if.

171
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,610
if you were raped,sharbat,you
really should speak to someone.

172
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,180
We have a psychiatrist here--
that's not why I came here.

173
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,250
Okay.

174
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,200
Are--are you still feeling
pain from the attack?

175
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,030
There is no pain.

176
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,940
Well--
no,please.

177
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,640
I need you. to make me a virgin again.

181
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,480
You can make her virgin again.

182
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,430
I-I know it's possible. In our
culture,sometimes it is done.

183
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,780
You're talking about hymenoplasty?

184
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,180
That's not something to be done lightly.

185
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,460
It is a real surgery with
real potential complications,

186
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,440
and as much as we could repair the
hymen,it doesn't make you a virgin.

187
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,860
I am engaged to a man in afghanistan.

188
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,900
He will take me and my
parents back to our country,

189
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,050
where we will be married,where
he will take care of us.

190
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,550
And he doesn't know about
what happened to you?

191
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,130
I have not met him yet.

192
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,010
He can't know.

193
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,020
Her status,it. it is checked.

194
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:10,460
And islamic law says sex before marriage
is not allowed. We would be disgraced.

195
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,010
I understand. But do you understand that
what happened to you is not your fault?

196
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,080
I need to be pure. Can you help me?

197
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,070
-Coop,do you think maybe we should-
- sorry,man.Uh,a little later.

198
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,170
Okay,this afternoon then. Just need
a couple minutes,big guy. Thanks.

199
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,090
His vote is spoken for. It's for naomi.

200
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,580
Wait,nothing's decided
until election day,violet.

201
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,950
This is a campaign
ab-about ideas. You hear me?

202
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,770
-I-- lost
cause. -No.

203
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,210
Nobody's a lost cause,except for
maybe dell. Dell is a red state.

204
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,370
I'm not gettin' involved.

205
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,680
I did give him his job
back,but he and nai.

206
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,480
it's gonna be hard to
get over what they had.

207
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,900
I'm not getting involved.

208
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,840
You know,he quit because of
her. Should I remind him of that?

209
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,960
I thought you said
it was gonna be civil.

210
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,720
So civilly,I'll remind
him of how bad it was.

211
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,880
Bad timing,coop.

212
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,580
Board's got a couple of bigwigs in,and if I get one
more complaint about how many surgeries I should be--

213
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,950
I am not in the mood.

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,840
My day's worse. I don't feel
like having sex ever again.

215
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,310
-Then what are you doing here?
-I came to talk.

216
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,340
You wanted to talk. You're not talking.

217
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,000
Do you think I'm a pervert?

218
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,620
I am too busy for this.

219
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,820
Hey,does this not bother you?

220
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,600
We're both in the middle of tough days,we
can't en discuss it with one another?

221
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,910
I don't want to discuss it,cooper.
I want to get through it.

222
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,250
Maybe that's the difference between you and
me. I don't know how to get through mine.

223
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,200
What happened?

224
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,490
A patient's mother recognized
me from an adult web site.

225
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,510
-She does not want me to treat her son.
-That's absurd.

226
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,360
You don't worry about that,a patient
recognizing you from your private life?

227
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,390
One has nothing to do with the other.

228
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,510
Besides,I took mine down.

229
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,500
You didn't?

230
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,280
How many sites are you on,coop? Ftwo?

231
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,680
Ive?

232
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,570
Ten? Ish.

233
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,540
Your patient might be right.
There is something wrong with you.

234
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,530
I'm a good doctor.

235
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,900
I want to help this kid.

236
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,170
She wants to be revirginized?

237
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,670
Essentially,yes.

238
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,140
But I just can't see sewing her
back up. It just feels wrong.

239
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,240
Okay,s-so wait a minute.

240
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,920
You're going to deprive this girl of the life
that she wants because you have issues with it?

241
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,110
I-- she's a victim,and
you're not gonna help her?

242
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,930
I just feel like I am
colluding with the whole system.

243
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,080
Well,you are. You have to tell her no.

244
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,970
-On what grounds?
-Legal,moral,humanitarian.

245
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,060
What'd you get in medical ethic the
test is beneficence and autonomy.

246
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,140
What is beneficent about helping a young girl
indulge a chauvinist fantasy by sewing up her vagina?

247
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,770
Yeah,but the question is not whether
the doctor thinks it's right,is it?

248
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,560
It's whether the patient does.

249
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,100
she should really talk to someone.
If you want to bring her in.

250
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,290
I already asked. She's not interested.
She won't even call the police.

251
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,060
Call the police about what?

252
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,370
addison has a patient who
wants to be revirginized.

253
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,140
So she can marry a man she's never met.

254
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,080
-And that's against the law?
-She was raped,sam.

255
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,300
-Well,that's awful.
-Yeah,it's awful.

256
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,300
But if addison does this,then the girl goes
back to kabul to marry a man she doesn't know,

257
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,890
who'll only have her if
her hymen is untouched?

258
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,260
That's wrong. It's like
violating her twice.

259
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,030
-Yeah,but it's her choice,isn't it?
-Choice?

260
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,050
That girl will likely live under
a veil in a clay hut in a country

261
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,320
where she could be stoned for
listening to a madonna album.

262
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,520
You think she understands
she's choosing that?

263
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,770
Meg?

264
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,090
Hello,peter.

265
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,130
-Meg?
-Meg.

266
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,470
Did he ever mention her to anyone?

267
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,590
If you vote for me,I promise
to tell you everything I know.

268
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,760
-Sam.
-I'm just kidding.

269
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,310
-Who is she?
-She was,uh.

270
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,750
she was something.

271
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,400
where do you think he knows her from?

272
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,660
Addison?

273
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,560
-So you will do this?
-Please sit.

274
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,460
I ran your labs.

275
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,540
-Is someone still hurting you?
-No.

276
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,050
You said you were raped months
ago,but there are traces of sperm,

277
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,610
sharbat,which indicates
something is still happening.

278
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,870
It's not rape. There was never a rape.

279
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,100
I didn't mean to
lie,to take it this far.

280
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,150
I have a boyfriend here,and I love him.

281
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,870
But your father arranged
a marriage to someone else.

282
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,540
My parents-- they did not know about
the boy. He's not from our culture.

283
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,070
So I told my mother-- I
told her I'd been raped.

284
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:09,240
I thought she'd understand that this meant I
could not marry this man,only she found a way.

285
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,150
-a way for us all to be happy.
-Happy?

286
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,640
My father drives a cab.

287
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,110
He used to teach university.
My mother,she is lonely.

288
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,120
They came here for
me,but they are miserable.

289
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,140
This man,he will bring us
all back and take care of us.

290
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,630
But only if you're a virgin.

291
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,310
If i'm a virgin,we can go.

292
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,630
We can be happy. I
want them to be happy.

293
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,310
Uh,I just wanted to apologize for pushing
you so hard when I first took over.

294
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,020
That--that was
wrong,and,uh,okay,look,

295
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,850
I know that you and violet are joined
at the hip,and she's gonna go for naomi,

296
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,460
but you are your own man,and
I've got a lot of great ideas--

297
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,630
do you know anything
about acquired aphasia?

298
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,700
Ac--uh,a
bit.

299
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,760
This kid came in. He presented with what
looke but I think it might be something else.

300
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,260
-Why?
-Well,we had this moment of.

301
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,920
eye contact.

302
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,930
All right. Well,autistic
kids make eye contact.

303
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,990
I know,but this was real. It
really seemed like he wasonnecting.

304
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,270
Kid stopped talking at 4.

305
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,540
You think there's any chance he's having
seizures in his sleep, so maybe nobody noticed?

306
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,680
You think I'grasping?

307
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:17,200
Uh,I think you're a good doctor, and if you figure
that there's something going on,then there probably is.

308
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,330
Oh,this vote thing makes
you and naomi nicer.

309
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,280
Well,not everything is about the vote.

310
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,810
You're a good doctor.
You'll figure it out.

311
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,200
big office,oh,view of the ocean,

312
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,700
patients who
can,uh,pay the bills--

313
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,870
so what's wrong?

314
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,490
You said you were here for a developing nations
conference. You never mentioned psychoanalysis.

315
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,480
I thought I'd stop in while
I was in town,but look at you.

316
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,150
You need help--your
eyes,your--your face,your energy.

317
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,640
It'S.

318
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,900
the practice is going
through a rough patch.

319
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,270
You're going through a rough patch.

320
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,230
You know,uh.

321
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,320
I always hated the way you
did that,knew everything.

322
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,110
It's a curse.

323
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,110
But come on. You need a change.

324
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,440
-Like what,aid mission to the congo?
-Ghana.

325
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,720
I'm going to nalerigu to
organize a malaria program.

326
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,880
Oh,the peter I remember never hesitated.
He jumped in and did what needed doing.

327
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,720
Then again,the peter I remember would've thrown
me down on this desk ten seconds after I walked in.

328
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,540
Have they come out of pete's office yet?

329
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,240
Th-the. blinds are still drawn.

330
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,440
I don't know what to do.

331
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,110
We wait until they come out,and
then we interrogate him or her.

332
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,410
No,about my patient sharbat.
She lied. She wasn't raped.

333
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,260
-She lied?
-She has a boyfriend.

334
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,540
She freaked out,couldn't tell her parents
the truth,knew that it would come out.

335
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,920
Y-you don't lie about rape,ever.

336
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,610
I know,but--
no,there's no buts.

337
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,080
That's what makes people doubt women.

338
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,500
One woman does that-- I don't care the
reason-- it's--it's bad for everybody.

339
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,230
Damn it. I hate that.

340
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,650
you shouldn't do this,the surgery.

341
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,900
But I thought that--
she lied,addison.

342
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,030
If she's some girl who's
sleeping around and telling lies

343
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,040
and making real victims
look bad,no,she made her bed.

344
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,350
You don't lie about rape.

345
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,090
That's one of my rules.

346
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,730
Now that's the peter I remember.

347
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,540
Just doing what has to  done.

348
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,910
what's that on your back?

349
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,050
I don't know. Sand fly
bite. I get 'em all the time.

350
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,880
You get sand fly bites all the time?

351
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,350
Yeah,I live 20 meters off
the kunu river in nigeria.

352
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,840
That's the least of my problems there.

353
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,820
Sand fly bites don't have
annular lesions like this.

354
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,010
Stop worrying. It's a bite.

355
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,980
it's an insect bite,right?

356
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,850
Wo what bit you and did that?

357
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,690
I don't know. Probably a sand fly.

358
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,050
I've been living in nigeria.

359
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,530
-so how do you know pete?
-We were residents together.

360
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,960
Then we did doctors without borders for
a couple of years before he moved here.

361
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,560
Pete did doctors without borders?

362
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,030
-When was that?
-15 years ago.

363
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,920
He was supposed to take
a couple months off,

364
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,010
but then he met somebody,married
her,settled.down here.

365
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,180
-He never told you about it?
-No,but you can tell us.

366
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:03,800
Pete's a very private person.

367
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,320
He's very shy. He's very
shy. He doesn't like to brag.

368
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,590
Uh,trust me. He's not shy.

369
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,570
Well,I-I didn't mean shy
in the--the "shy" sense.

370
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,210
So what was he like then?

371
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,430
Amazing. Amazing doctor.

372
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,360
Well,you know.

373
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:25,000
We've only seen pete do eastern
medicine. We've never seen him in action.

374
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,280
One time we were,uh,treating
these children in bosnia.

375
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,060
The orphanage was under mortar fire.

376
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,860
An evacuation was ordered,but it
was impossible to get the kids out.

377
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,130
Peter refused to leave the kids behind.

378
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,660
He stayed with 'em through the night.

379
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,420
Most of the kids
survived because of him.

380
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,620
-Pete did that?
-Our pete?

381
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,370
You know,it's funny.

382
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,580
"pete.

383
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,780
" To me he was always "peter.

384
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,190
" Peter.

385
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,780
Hey,you got a minute?

386
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,140
To snoop about meg,or
hock me for a vote?

387
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,290
This is not about the vote.

388
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,650
-This is about the practice.
-okay.

389
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,070
And the direction that it is headed in.

390
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,110
Nai-- and I think that I can sum up everything
you need to know about the difference

391
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:22,570
between sam and me and the way we
see this practice into one word-

392
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,870
-defatalator.
-Defatalator?

393
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,930
It was an experiment,a lead-in
to a total wellness program.

394
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,770
It's a shame you didn't
have it in west africa.

395
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,120
He didn't have much of a choice.

396
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,480
Another doctor in the practice was pressing
him into trying to bring in business--

397
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,890
something I would never do.

398
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,200
-Hi,I'm naomi bennett.
-She's campaigning.

399
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,260
And you're the
anti-defatalator candidate?

400
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,910
It's a little more
complicated than that.

401
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,340
Is it?

402
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,400
To what do I owe this surprise?

403
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,960
I've got this coming weekend off,and
I was thinking you,me,cabo san lucas.

404
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:10,560
A weekend away-- palmilla,very
fancy,perfect,clear blue waters.

405
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,320
We could get away.

406
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,900
-too much?
-No.

407
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,910
Yes.
No. Ye--

408
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,920
yes.no. Here-- here's the thing--
um,we've been out a few times,

409
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,330
and,um,it's--it's--
it's been great. I.

410
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,200
I really like you-- is this
where you break up with me?

411
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,960
No,no. It's just,um.

412
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,620
I have these rules.
They're stupid rules,really.

413
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,630
But,um,in the past,when I didn't have
rules,it--it-- it didn't go so well.

414
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,200
My--my--my point is that
now that I have my rules.

415
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,750
I don't want to break them. You know?

416
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,370
Yeah,I have no idea what
you're talking about.

417
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,380
I want to know,but,um,rules?

418
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,860
-Sex rules.
-Rules about sex.

419
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,080
You know,a hotel mean a room,a
room means a bed,a bed means-

420
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,090
- you have sex rules.
-I'm waiting.

421
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,740
-Until marriage?
-No!

422
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,100
No. no,no. I--
just till,um.

423
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,160
until it feels right,until I'M. sure.

424
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,040
Okay.

425
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,910
So we'll wait.

426
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,440
I'm good with waiting.
I'm happy with waiting.

427
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,660
-Really?
-No,but I can wait.

428
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,250
and I am sure.

429
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,840
-Go away.
-This will just take one second.

430
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,240
I don't want to hear
your rationalizations.

431
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,900
braden might not be autistic.

432
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,510
Is this some
sick idea-- no.

433
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,980
He might have something called
landau-kleffner syndrome.

434
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,790
In kids like braden,that lose the ability
to communicate,they might be having seizures.

435
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:16,240
At night. You don't notice them,but it causes
problems with the synapses in their brain.

436
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,120
They start misfiring.

437
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,370
It impairs their ability to communicate,and
when they can't communicate,they withdraw.

438
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,100
And the thing is,with corticosteroids,with
anticonvulsants,it might be treatable.

439
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,240
The first page has the name of
three excellent pediatricians.

440
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,490
The rest is all the
research I could find.

441
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,610
you know,we were both on the web site.

442
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,870
In order to know I was on the web
site,you had to be on the web site,too.

443
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,010
So,you know,I'm just saying,you're
the pot calling the kettle.

444
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,320
pervert.

445
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,570
I'm a good doctor. I
want to help your son.

446
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,260
Dell,I've been thinking a lot
about what you asked this morning,

447
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,380
and I still don't think that you
assisting with the coles is a good idea,

448
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,470
but the hennesseys are coming
in for a similar procedure.

449
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,480
-How about shadowing me then?
-Yeah.

450
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,880
That would be nice.
Thank you. Thank you.

451
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,180
Look,dell,I know we've had a
difficult patch,but we have a history.

452
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,670
And,uh,I hope you know how important
you are to me and to the practice.

453
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,780
though I'm the one who
gave you your job back.

454
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,490
-Yeah,well,after I begged you to.
-Excuse me.

455
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,400
Dell,I know that you're the person
that keeps this practice running.

456
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,080
And I understand that
you want to be doing more.

457
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,290
And I think you should.

458
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,330
I think you're ready for it,ready
for more than just "shadowing.

459
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,100
" Sam. Uh,dell and
i were talking,so--

460
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,490
oh,I'm sorry.All right.
Well,when you're done with all--

461
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,020
stop by my office for a few,all right?

462
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,330
You know what? Sam
doesn't care about you.

463
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,750
All he cares about is the bottom line.

464
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,780
Oh,well,you've seen what the
bottom line with naomi is,right?

465
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,400
You keep her secrets,you hide her
mistakes,then you just wait for the ax to drop.

466
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,620
You know what? Sam doesn't care about
what this place is supposed to be.

467
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,340
Well,this place wouldn't be anything
but broke if she's running things.

468
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,620
Is this how you expect to get my vote?

469
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,340
You can't change what you did.

470
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,150
You know,and we can't live
with what you're doing.

471
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,400
Why are you fighting with me?

472
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,500
I'm making progress here,all right?

473
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,870
I'm getting us up out of this hole.

474
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,320
You know what? Because
people aren't happy.

475
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,290
People aren't happy,or you're not
happy because it's not your way?

476
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,890
-My way?
-Well,that's what it all comes down to,right?

477
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,370
democracy in action.

478
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,250
Why don't you just admit it? I'm the
one who did everything in the beginning!

479
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,800
I think lies are contagious.

480
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,680
Pete not telling us about
his past is not a lie.

481
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,150
It's an omission.

482
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,070
Fine,that's one thing.

483
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,680
-You lied about charlotte.
-I told you.

484
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,770
And now I have to not tell
everybody else. That's a lie.

485
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,930
-Sam?
-Secretly sleeping with naomi.

486
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,040
Lie. Lie.

487
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,400
-Dell?
-Kept naomi's secret.

488
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,960
Omission. Lie.

489
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,100
Addison?

490
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,860
Well,her patient lied about being raped.

491
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,580
But I guess I can't
hold that against her.

492
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,030
You know what,addison? You may be
the only one here that's trustworthy.

493
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,500
Low bar.

494
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,690
Do you really think you can help him?

495
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,780
If we give braden prednisone now,it'll absorb
into his bloodstream in a matter of hours.

496
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,290
Bere he goes to bed,we
could know if it'll help.

497
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,740
Did you really work in africa
treating kids with river blindness?

498
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,320
-Have you heard the story about him and the bosnian orphans?
-No!

499
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,310
-Where did you hear about that?
-In the ladies room.

500
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,270
What do you people do in there?

501
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,420
Why didn't you tell us you
had this whole past,pete?

502
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,580
Peter.

503
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,250
-Peter?
-It was a long time ago.

504
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,250
You really like her.

505
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,510
Look. sharbat.

506
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,260
I know you want this.

507
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,390
-You think you want this.
-It's the only way.

508
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,190
It may be the only way for this man
you're supposed to marry,but for you--

509
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,070
you need to figure out
what's right for you.

510
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,200
Look,you told your
mother about the rape.

511
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,340
Tell her about this boy you love.

512
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:21,230
Do you really want your
future to be based on a lie?

513
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,180
Have you been having
fatigue,headache,joint pains?

514
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:32,780
I've been on and off airplanes all month
in half a dozen different time zones.

515
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,760
Y-yes,I have.

516
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,650
Oh,come on,sam. What is it?

517
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,460
There we go.

518
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,910
This.

519
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,550
That was in my back?

520
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,930
Yeah. It's the remnants of a tick.

521
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,060
Probably been in there a week or so.

522
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,780
Pete was right. These things
can cause a nasty infection.

523
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,340
If you would've let it last any longer,

524
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,760
you could have wound up withserious
cardiac problems,encephalitis-

525
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,290
- well,thank you.

526
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,330
Well,you can thank peter.

527
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,000
I don't suppose I could pay you
off to say it was a sand fly bite?

528
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,770
you decide what to do?

529
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,560
I decided the truth seemed better.

530
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,590
Hey,speaking of which,uh,why is it that
no one seems to know anything about you?

531
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,250
-You know me.
-Apparently we don't even know your name.

532
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,660
peter.

533
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,600
Look,the past is the past.
I'm not one to dwell on it.

534
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:39,810
But meg--she seems like
a good part of your past.

535
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,510
She's here now. Then she'll be gone. So.

536
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,240
-it is what it is.
-Unless it isn'T.

537
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,890
You could not let her go.

538
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,060
You know what your problem is?

539
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,110
You are a romantic.

540
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,890
You don't want them
running this place together.

541
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,350
You want them together--
sam and naomi the way it was,

542
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,920
you and naomi the way it was.

543
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,880
What's wrong with that?
I like the way it was.

544
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,020
thank you.

545
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:25,450
What sharbat is asking for,what
she wants to give up is a lot.

546
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,110
And I thought you should know the truth.

547
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,050
I knew.

548
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,890
Mothers are mothers. What
she couldn't tell me,I knew.

549
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,750
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
You let her say she was raped?

550
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:39,980
If she broke the trust that her father
and I have in her,it would be her sin.

551
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,340
She would have felt shame.

552
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,260
It was easier for her to
say it was someone else'S.

553
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,210
We've talked.

554
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,110
Now will you do the surgery?

555
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,150
sharbat,no matter what I do,I can't
make you forget what you had here.

556
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,180
I love my parents more
than anything in this world.

557
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,410
I just want to take them home.

558
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:08,200
Please,if I don't bury my past,my
family will have no future.

559
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,150
No,no,no,I'll tell you
what-- stop,stop talking.

560
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,800
-Just listen--listen towhat I'm saying.
-Wait,no,no,no. I'm gonna tell you what.

561
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,270
You got me out of the marriage.

562
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,220
Now what you can do is you an addison
can go ahead and take over the practice.

563
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,470
-For the last time-- probably not the last
time. -maybe I'll go work over at st.Ambrose.

564
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,440
-no,really,I'm sure that i could find a job there.
-since we've already had itthree times.

565
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,790
Addison-- if you don't mind,we're
trying to have a private conversation.

566
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,270
I don't care.

567
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,060
Great.

568
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,100
Look,maybe this is my fault.

569
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:48,000
I pushed us to try to recapture the
past,what we had,what this place ed to be.

570
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
But the past is cluttered with anger
and mistakes,and we need to bury that.

571
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,200
It doesn't matter who did what when.

572
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,400
It matters what we want to do now,what
we want this place to be going forward.

573
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,880
We need to focus on patients,and
we need to earn money.

574
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,010
We need naomi and we need
sam,the best of bothf you.

575
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:13,600
And this vote,it's a bad idea,an
idea that we might never recover from.

576
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,730
We shouldn't do it.

577
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:18,560
Let's sit down and figure out what
we want this place to be,together.

578
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:24,220
If you force us to choose between
you,that will create scars that won't heal.

579
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,440
We need to move forward,not back.

580
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,750
We vote at the end of the day.

581
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,150
sharbat.are you ready?

582
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,590
He's just a boy.

583
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,610
He's a nice boy,but we would not last.

584
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:18,140
He's young,he's got
college,he's so american.

585
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,020
He's not my future.

586
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:27,240
I nt to do this. So,yes,I am ready.

587
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,790
Doc. tor?

588
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,940
Thank you. for the truck.

589
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,390
you're welcome.

590
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,760
he started 45 minutes ago. He woke up.

591
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:22,190
Whatever you are,you
are a wonderful doctor.

592
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,020
So we're really gonna do this?

593
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,000
I'm not voting. I won't be part of this.

594
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,260
Well,let's just--let's
count the votes we have.

595
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,950
Sam.

596
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,140
naomi.

597
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,230
Addison.

598
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,750
Okay,whoever did that,it is not funny.

599
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,000
Addison.

600
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,930
Addison.

601
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,460
Addison.

602
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,420
No. No,no,no,no,no,no,no.

603
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,120
No. No.

604
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,910
-Nice speech.
-It won my vote.

605
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,400
Congratulations,boss.

606
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,670
Even you voted for me?

607
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,650
If either one of them had won,this
place still would have been divided.

608
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:58,140
What am i supposed to do now?

609
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,500
Figure out what the future is.

610
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,150
Figure out what the new rules are.

611
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,190
You think rules really work?

612
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,630
So long as you remember
they're meant to be broken.

613
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,380
Hey,violet.

614
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,640
about what happened
in your office--

615
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,080
I don't--I don't want
to talk about that.

616
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,500
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. We're not-

617
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,850
-we're not going there,addison.

618
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,810
It is what it is.

619
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,230
I'm sorry,naomi.

620
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,370
If I could go back
and change what I did.

621
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,230
how I treated you.

622
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,950
I messed up.

623
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,450
I'm sorry.

624
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,410
Thank you.

625
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,560
for worrying about me.

626
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,590
You know,I really
could use you in ghana.

627
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,090
Don't you remember what it was like?

628
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,340
No matter what godforsaken
part of the world we were in,

629
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,480
no matter what disaster or
disease we were fighting,

630
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,510
people always responded to you.

631
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,020
That's a gift.

632
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,040
Don't waste it here.

633
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:17,010
I'm part of something I believe
in-- building it,making it work.

634
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,840
I like it here.

635
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,170
I also like you here.

636
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,810
Yeah,except for the smoking.

637
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,680
I forgot you came with cigarettes.

638
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,540
So is that an invitation?

639
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,000
Something like that.

640
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,310
But you gotta quit smoking.

641
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,430
I don't change for anyone.

642
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,730
nice outfit,fraulein.

643
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,340
Get over here.

644
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,580
No.

645
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,160
Do I look like a person
who takes no for an answer?

646
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,140
I would very much like it if we
could spend the evening. talking.

647
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,540
Again with the talking?

648
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,520
I'm serious. We're gonna
get to know each other.

649
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,770
Why?

650
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:21,790
Because,herr charlotte,I want
us to be about more than sex,

651
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,950
because I want to know you and
you to know me,like normal people.

652
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,020
for instance,me.

653
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,300
I'm from akron.

654
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,730
I'm an only child.

655
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,610
I was adopted,and I never cared.

656
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:42,810
I never sought out my birth parents
because my parents were great,are great.

657
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,490
And,uh,I spent summers
working at a camp in indiana,

658
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,000
which is when I realized
that I loved children and,

659
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,980
uh,decided I wanted
to be a pediatrician.

660
00:39:54,210 --> 00:40:02,430
My favorite color is chartreuse because I like the
way it sounds coming out of my mou-- chartreuse.

661
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,670
