1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,490
*

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,165
*

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,760
One night.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:28,360
*

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,390
Actually, he's my, uh,
biological <i>padre.</i>

6
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,690
So... what's the plan?

7
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:39,618
Plan is to keep you safe.

8
00:00:39,718 --> 00:00:40,833
I was exposed...

9
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,573
so that free pass
I had for you went away.

10
00:00:42,673 --> 00:00:46,058
But even Danko's reach doesn't
extend south of the border.

11
00:00:46,158 --> 00:00:48,243
Yet.

12
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:49,878
And what about everyone else?

13
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:52,043
I'll make some calls.

14
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:54,670
Put some things in motion.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,530
All right, well...

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,073
we also gotta eat.

17
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:07,408
There's a cantina down the way.

18
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:10,550
Can I buy you a taco?

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,690
With, uh, what money?

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,550
I'll think of something.

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,443
Think I'm just gonna go for a walk.

22
00:01:22,543 --> 00:01:25,878
Now, look, it's probably best
that we stick together. Okay?

23
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:28,320
It's for your own safety.

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,715
I'll be careful. I promise.

25
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:36,074
All right, look, I'll meet you
at the cantina, okay? Don't be-

26
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,880
*

27
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,883
Think we're clear.

28
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,340
My very own guardian angel.

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,643
You're a good son, Peter.

30
00:01:52,743 --> 00:01:55,878
That's not why I saved you.
I want answers.

31
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:57,083
And you think I've got them?

32
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,858
You always know more than you let on.

33
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:02,233
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

34
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:05,338
but I need to find some answers
for myself right now.

35
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,430
That's why I had you bring me here.

36
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,280
This is where I'm supposed to be.

37
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,063
So, tell me exactly what happened.

38
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:34,128
*

39
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:36,173
We were moving in to apprehend this guy.

40
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:38,248
Agents Whitman, Price and Holiday went in,

41
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:39,613
I watched the hallway.

42
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:41,283
And I heard three gunshots.

43
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:43,688
I ran in as fast as I could
and I found them.

44
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,633
Like this.

45
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:48,508
And you didn't see anyone?

46
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:50,608
No, sir.

47
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:52,661
Nothing. I...

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,373
I'm sorry, sir.

49
00:02:59,473 --> 00:03:03,050
Go back to H.Q. Get cleaned up.

50
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,173
What are you thinking?

51
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,738
No sign of a scuffle.
One bullet each in the back.

52
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:13,718
Who was their intended target?

53
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,543
James Martin. 32.

54
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:18,248
High school geometry teacher.

55
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:19,743
Amateur fly fisher.

56
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:22,118
Bio doesn't exactly read
"trained assassin. "

57
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:23,538
What's Martin's ability?

58
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:24,583
Unknown.

59
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:26,648
His DNA was in the national database.

60
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,420
Set off a red flag.

61
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,693
We're doin' that now.

62
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:34,178
You gonna lecture me
about civil liberties?

63
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:35,453
No.

64
00:03:35,553 --> 00:03:37,383
About sending your men in blind.

65
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,083
Unknown means Martin could be anything.

66
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:41,538
He could be a telepath,
a teleporter, an invisible man.

67
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,435
Each one requires a different tactic.

68
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:46,574
Our orders are to take them all in.

69
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:48,463
You're so desperate to chalk up a win,

70
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:50,283
you're cutting corners - is that it?

71
00:03:50,383 --> 00:03:53,118
Let's not forget you're
Nathan Petrelli's boy.

72
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:55,918
And the last crusade
was to catch this Rebel,

73
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:59,043
and you didn't catch him, did you?

74
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:03,510
You need a win a hell of a
lot more than I do.

75
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,238
# As I walk along I wonder
what went wrong with our love,

76
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:22,278
# a love that was so strong #

77
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:25,320
I love this song.

78
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,528
Well, quite a bloodbath
in there, isn't it?

79
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:34,050
Did you get my gifts?

80
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,168
Taxidermied bunny and
the near-dead puppeteer...

81
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:40,183
you shouldn't have.

82
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:41,838
It was an overture toward collaboration,

83
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:45,238
since we both want the same thing.

84
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:47,615
And what's that again?

85
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:49,923
Killing people like me.

86
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:55,090
I think we should pool our resources.

87
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,333
What's in it for you?

88
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:04,900
Let's just say you fascinate me.

89
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,720
And you're in way over your head in there.

90
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,938
I can help you...

91
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:17,583
if you want.

92
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:22,570
I can find the guy who killed your agents.

93
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,913
# I'm-a walking in the rain

94
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:47,620
# tears are falling, and I feel the pain #

95
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,725
Heroes Season 3 Episode 21

96
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:03,035
I want eyes on every road,

97
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:07,358
every terminal, air, bus, roadblocks.

98
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,605
This isn't a drill, people.

99
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:09,783
Three of our own died.

100
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:12,078
And they will not die in vain.

101
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:14,178
Not on my watch.

102
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,073
Not on yours.

103
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:18,820
So remember your training.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,635
Remember agents Whitman, Price

105
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:24,158
and Holiday and their families.

106
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,710
Remember, we don't sleep...

107
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,660
until this son of a bitch is caught.

108
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,950
Any questions?

109
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,083
Nice speech.

110
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:43,763
We need a win.

111
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:47,578
You have 20 years' experience
with these people,

112
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:49,263
and I need a plan.

113
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:52,868
And I don't wanna hear
"one of us, one of them. "

114
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:54,495
Then I won't say it.

115
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:56,053
But it got the job done.

116
00:06:56,153 --> 00:07:00,048
The very same tactics that you used
on all those counter-insurgency programs

117
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:02,123
you ran from Havanna to Kabul.

118
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:03,778
I don't know what you're talking about.

119
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:06,073
- No.
- Right.

120
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,683
Well, if you did know
what I was talking about,

121
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:13,348
then you'd probably understand the value
of co-opting the native population.

122
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:15,723
Working the enemy.

123
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:19,733
A little focused manipulation
goes a long way.

124
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,458
How could you work with these people?

125
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:25,723
Trust them?

126
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:26,903
Who said anything about trust?

127
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:30,403
They're assets - weapons to be mobilized.

128
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:31,653
Motivate them.

129
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:37,290
Greed, revenge, love, hate -
whatever it takes to make the collar.

130
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,090
Speaking of which...

131
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:48,260
I have reason to believe that
Sylar is here... in D.C.

132
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,513
This could be the win that we both need.

133
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:53,208
Or it could be another chapter
in the big book of you

134
00:07:53,308 --> 00:07:57,078
letting him slip through your fingers.

135
00:07:57,178 --> 00:07:59,313
No. I, uh...

136
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:03,430
got another assignment for you.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,743
Voila.

138
00:08:17,843 --> 00:08:19,263
Where'd you get that?

139
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:20,713
I sold my kidney.

140
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:24,070
Actually, both of them. Twice.

141
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,593
I found a pawn shop down the street.

142
00:08:27,693 --> 00:08:29,968
Sold the necklace my dad gave me.

143
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:31,393
My other dad.

144
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:32,603
You didn't have to do that.

145
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:35,623
I didn't want to,
but he's Mr. Survival Skills,

146
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,538
and if he knew we were in a pinch
and didn't sell it, he'd be mad.

147
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:40,785
I expect he would.
It's a nice gesture,

148
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:43,860
but I got everything under control.

149
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,848
This isn't exactly a
simple situation here.

150
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:49,948
It seems simple to me.

151
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,308
Government agents are out there
hunting innocent people,

152
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:54,718
and they're gonna keep going
until you tell them to stop

153
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:55,973
what you started.

154
00:08:56,073 --> 00:09:00,298
Would it kill you to show me
just a little bit of gratitude?

155
00:09:00,398 --> 00:09:01,923
For what?

156
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:04,223
For-for giving you a free pass.

157
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:06,318
For risking my neck to save
your life when it was over.

158
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:09,813
Pick one - either one.

159
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:12,638
Just common courtesy, Claire.

160
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:15,460
Why did you give me a free pass?

161
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,170
I had my reasons.

162
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,053
Be back.

163
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:29,588
What are you gonna do with it?

164
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:32,870
Turn it into more.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,103
Gentlemen.

166
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,393
Is that tequila?

167
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:42,613
The mass is ended.

168
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:48,450
May you go forth in peace
and love and serve the lord.

169
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,518
You think sanctuary's gonna
stop the agents from coming?

170
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:05,463
I can't sleep, Peter.

171
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,538
To find where we should go,
what we should do,

172
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:09,578
I need to dream,
and to dream I need to sleep,

173
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:10,760
and I can't.

174
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,873
I haven't.

175
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:13,498
Not for a long time.

176
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:14,895
Take a pill.

177
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:16,223
Doesn't work.

178
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:20,433
For the dreams to come, ones that matter,

179
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:24,608
sleep has to be natural,
has to be earned.

180
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,708
Earned.

181
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,310
I always found peace here.

182
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,028
Your father and I were
married in this church.

183
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:37,615
We walked down this aisle.

184
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:40,469
Your first communion...

185
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:43,320
even Nana's funeral.

186
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,310
You're probably too young to remember,
but you held my hand.

187
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,658
There used to be love in this family once.

188
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:55,865
Look at us now.

189
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:58,003
It's all my fault.

190
00:10:58,103 --> 00:11:00,043
You come here to be forgiven?

191
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:04,040
I'm not sure even God has that in him.

192
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,718
You boys wanna make this
a little more interesting?

193
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:12,998
What'd you have in mind?

194
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:13,953
Listen.

195
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:15,388
- Come on, let's go.
- $100 a hit.

196
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:18,728
Last man standing takes all.

197
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,493
Listen, I can do this.

198
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:23,028
I used to do this scraping for shore
leave money in the Philippines, all right?

199
00:11:23,128 --> 00:11:25,690
I'm good at it.

200
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,858
- Fine.
- All right.

201
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,130
Go for it.

202
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,410
All right, boys.

203
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,650
Line 'em up.

204
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,793
- Jenkins.
- Sir.

205
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:46,498
I wanted to check in. See if there was
anything else I could do.

206
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:48,683
No.

207
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:50,993
Just try to get some rest.

208
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:56,558
I wanted to tell you that what
you said earlier about the guys...

209
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,393
It was inspirational.

210
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:03,340
I wish I had your strength.

211
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,773
Hello.

212
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,130
Special delivery.

213
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,483
How the hell did you get in here?

214
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,768
Well, you'd be amazed what you can do
with a lifted I.D. badge,

215
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:35,010
a $4 tie, and a West Baltimore accent.

216
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,113
But you've got much bigger problems.

217
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:40,278
Done some homework about
that killer of yours.

218
00:12:40,378 --> 00:12:42,183
I don't need your help.

219
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:45,368
Well, I just found some
evidence to the contrary.

220
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:48,518
There's another body.
He stashed it, you missed it.

221
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:50,688
I found it, of course.

222
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:52,815
You're lying.

223
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:54,940
Look in the box.

224
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,298
What's in the box?

225
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:02,580
Your answer.

226
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,828
How James Martin was able to shoot
your men in the back so easily.

227
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:10,470
It's because of what he can do.

228
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,920
He's a shape-shifter.

229
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,460
Come on.

230
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,353
Where is he?

231
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:35,270
Just around the northeast corner.

232
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,510
'Scuse me.

233
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,858
Hey-hey, I didn't do anything.

234
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,490
Take him in.

235
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,903
Your coat's sopping wet.

236
00:14:59,003 --> 00:15:01,538
Found this one in the bins.
It looked like something you'd wear.

237
00:15:01,638 --> 00:15:03,520
Well, it should. It's mine.

238
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,433
I made a donation last week.

239
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:07,438
It's supposed to go to
someone who needs it.

240
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:09,900
You need it. Come on.

241
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,278
Didn't know you were still so active.

242
00:15:18,378 --> 00:15:19,813
I give them things.

243
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:21,758
Not devotion, not myself.

244
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:23,863
Not the same.

245
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:25,808
It's like with you and your brother.

246
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:27,955
Your father and I supported you,

247
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:30,068
but we didn't give you support.

248
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:32,168
Sure, you did.

249
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:34,245
Oh, Peter.

250
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:35,878
There were times when
you were growing up,

251
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:38,133
you were so confused.

252
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,303
You were so desperate for answers,

253
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:42,438
and I could have told you the truth.

254
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:44,938
I could have given you comfort.

255
00:15:45,038 --> 00:15:47,840
I didn't.

256
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,010
You must hate me.

257
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,428
I'm gonna find you a cup of tea.

258
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,930
It'll help you sleep.

259
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,610
I don't hate you.

260
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,200
Look, whatever's happened,
you're still my mother.

261
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,830
I'm afraid that unconditional love
isn't really love at all.

262
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,918
Hey, why don't we just call it a draw?

263
00:16:50,018 --> 00:16:53,270
You guys don't look so good.

264
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,078
- Nonsense.
- You don't have to do this, you know.

265
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:00,993
Yeah, I do.

266
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:02,753
We need the money, don't we?

267
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:05,808
Besides, your dad's not
the only one who can...

268
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:07,953
your other dad...

269
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:12,218
he's not the only one
who can do stuff, you know.

270
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,540
You better get your old man off to bed.

271
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,698
You need a rematch, huh?

272
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:25,413
How 'bout a rematch?

273
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:27,688
Uh-uh, no, man.
I beat him fair and square.

274
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:29,323
Come on, what about...

275
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,538
winning a little bit more?

276
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:35,750
What do you have in mind?

277
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
What about this watch?

278
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:44,598
It's a pretty nice watch, huh?

279
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:46,568
It's a really nice watch, but...

280
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:50,363
I'm like... 22 shots deep.

281
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:54,050
You're a little bit late for the party.

282
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,880
Then I'd better catch up, huh?

283
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,828
You're not the only one
who can get the drop on someone.

284
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:23,325
Oh, you've been waiting here for me.

285
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:26,060
Your M.O.'s predictable enough.

286
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:28,613
You desperately wanna find Martin

287
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:32,228
so you can get that ability, don't you?

288
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:34,765
I have plenty of powers.

289
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,268
But this is different.

290
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:39,795
Shape-shifting.

291
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:42,224
You're salivating.

292
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:44,583
I read your profile.

293
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:49,278
How you like to take on
accents, affectations.

294
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,783
Play characters.

295
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:53,033
- It's fun.
- It's sad...

296
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,718
you're so desperate to be someone else.

297
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:59,203
You want out.

298
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:02,748
You have no idea what I want.

299
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:04,703
Shape-shifting.

300
00:19:04,803 --> 00:19:06,803
It's your escape hatch.

301
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:09,638
'Course, I could save you the trouble...

302
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:12,313
end it all for you, right now.

303
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:16,608
The part of my brain that you'd
need to hit to kill me...

304
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,973
is microscopic.

305
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,153
I'm a pretty good shot.

306
00:19:20,253 --> 00:19:22,263
It's not that simple.

307
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:26,348
I also gotta jam something
in there, right?

308
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:30,020
To make it stick.

309
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,503
You've clearly thought all of this
through, haven't you,

310
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:39,108
except for the part where you
can't catch your guy without my help.

311
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,758
You're all the win I need.

312
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:43,708
The white whale.

313
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,013
Maybe...

314
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:48,968
I'm the goose who lays the golden egg.

315
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:51,870
I can round them all up.

316
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,770
You suggesting that I can't?

317
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,288
You chased a shape-shifter.

318
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:00,995
You don't chase...

319
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:03,700
a shape-shifter.

320
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,533
Just one...

321
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:12,478
photo on that board... just one...

322
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:17,420
and I could help you find them all.

323
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,970
Then you can take your shot.

324
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,580
I asked to be extraordinary.

325
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:24,385
And I promised to make
the world a better place.

326
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,620
So when I got my chance, I lived
up to my end of the bargain.

327
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,550
For what?

328
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,390
I'm running for my life.

329
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,230
A lot of people are
running for their lives.

330
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,090
They're hurt and they're
dying, and I can't...

331
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,190
help them.

332
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,820
Do you even care what
you put people through?

333
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:04,455
I mean, when I kneel here
before you and I ask for help,

334
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:06,720
do you even listen?

335
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,630
And I'm tired of fighting.

336
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,340
And I'm angry.

337
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,410
I'm angry at my father, Nathan...

338
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,570
and my mother.

339
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
At you.

340
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,280
We had a deal.

341
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,320
I think it's about time
you lived up to your end.

342
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,730
Please, just...

343
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
show up.

344
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,115
I want the perimeter locked down.

345
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,215
Excuse me...

346
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,620
what do you people think you're doing?

347
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Sit down, sir.

348
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:17,340
Sir, we have reason to believe the
church is harboring two fugitives.

349
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,420
Chain the doors. No one gets
in or out, you understand?

350
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
Yes, sir.

351
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,660
This is a waste of time.

352
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,330
Martin's halfway across
the country by now.

353
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,405
No, he's not.

354
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:43,805
He hasn't left the city.

355
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:45,185
He had his chance,
and he didn't take it.

356
00:23:45,285 --> 00:23:47,325
He showed up as Agent Jenkins
right under your nose.

357
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,675
Yeah, why would he do that?

358
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:49,960
Martin's only human.

359
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,770
We all crave routine.
We just need to find his.

360
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,630
You got some special power for that?

361
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,730
I do.

362
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,620
But I don't need it.

363
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,820
You can tell everything about
a person from their belongings.

364
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,155
I thought you'd be better at this.

365
00:24:06,255 --> 00:24:08,000
Why's that?

366
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,460
'Cause you're a shape-shifter too.

367
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,150
I've been to your apartment -
you've got no books, no art,

368
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,340
no keepsakes, no correspondence.
Nothing to define you.

369
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,070
This is the part where
you get under my skin.

370
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:23,270
- I've seen your file too.
- Must be very hollow and boring.

371
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,130
Not like Martin's closet.

372
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,230
I've never seen so many costumes.

373
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,250
Not much call for a geometry
teacher to wear an Armani suit.

374
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,350
Or scrubs...

375
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,130
or this.

376
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,260
It's fractured.

377
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,625
Disjointed.

378
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:41,535
He's trying on personalities
like clothes.

379
00:24:41,635 --> 00:24:44,270
- Has he made a choice?
- Not yet.

380
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,185
Like all of us, he's still looking.

381
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:48,310
What's the common denominator here?

382
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,070
Lawyer, doctor, priest?

383
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
Power.

384
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,790
These roles give Martin something
he could never find in real life.

385
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,780
- Why?
- Why does anybody want power?

386
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,830
To screw with people...

387
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,370
or to simply screw people.

388
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,650
Here.

389
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,110
Tell me what you notice
about all those pictures.

390
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,550
Martin isn't in any of them.

391
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,650
Or these are all... Martin.

392
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,485
Different men of power with
different women of allure.

393
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,220
It's a clichÈ for a reason, and
it's Martin's routine.

394
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Where is he?

395
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,350
Where he goes every night...

396
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,490
lookin' to fall in love.

397
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,935
what do you weigh, like a buck ten?

398
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:01,600
That's none of your business.

399
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,630
Well, I'm just sayin', man.
You just don't even look drunk.

400
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,910
I think that you're just
jealous that I caught up.

401
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,750
Yeah.

402
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,540
After I put your old man to sleep.

403
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,020
Oh, please. That's not hard.

404
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,900
He tends to bite off
more than he can chew.

405
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,530
He's pretty slick,
but he seems like a good guy.

406
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,205
He wants to be.

407
00:26:28,305 --> 00:26:30,080
Free passes and...

408
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,840
swooping in and...

409
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,095
taking me off to Mexico, thinking
that's all he has to-

410
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:37,775
I get it.
My parents are divorced too.

411
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,160
No. It's not like that.

412
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,610
Maybe it is.

413
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:54,590
I just wish he would take off
his armor, shining or otherwise,

414
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,005
and just act like a normal human being.

415
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,880
Thank you.

416
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,980
We need to go.

417
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,930
Hey, come on.

418
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,235
We gotta go.

419
00:27:12,335 --> 00:27:14,335
I won the money.

420
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,040
Right there, that door.

421
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,140
All right, I'll get it.

422
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,545
You got it?

423
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,225
I'm checking every one.

424
00:27:27,325 --> 00:27:28,235
I'm sorry, Peter.

425
00:27:28,335 --> 00:27:30,300
Mom, you need to be quiet.

426
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,415
No. This may be our last chance together,
and there are things I have to say-

427
00:27:33,515 --> 00:27:35,190
- You don't have to say anything-
- It's okay.

428
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,290
Listen to me.

429
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,010
I was just like you.

430
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:42,240
My head in the clouds, full of hope.

431
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,030
I was gonna be a teacher.

432
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,910
And then my power manifested,
and the dreams came.

433
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:53,960
Visions of a bloody future of
deceit and death - the apocalypse.

434
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,685
And when I woke...

435
00:27:55,785 --> 00:27:58,635
I tried to warn everyone,
but no one would listen.

436
00:27:58,735 --> 00:28:00,565
Why would they? Why should they?

437
00:28:00,665 --> 00:28:03,570
I was Cassandra screaming
that the sky was falling,

438
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:08,090
but when they looked up,
there was no cloud in sight.

439
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,435
And I did it with lies...

440
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,120
and with manipulation...

441
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
and betrayal.

442
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:22,310
And it cost me everything -
my friends, my husband, my boys.

443
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,380
Mom.

444
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,480
But Peter...

445
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,005
it's the price I chose
to pay to save the world.

446
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,120
All clear.

447
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,230
You heard him. Back up.

448
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,010
Guess who's here?

449
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,785
Where?

450
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,450
Which one?

451
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,035
I suppose that fits the pattern -

452
00:29:25,135 --> 00:29:28,210
a position of power, authority, significance.

453
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,775
I think you'll recognize him.

454
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,560
What happened last time you chased him.

455
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,660
What's he up to?

456
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,895
Why me?

457
00:29:57,995 --> 00:29:59,995
He's after power.

458
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,950
He thinks that's something you have.

459
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,430
He's trying to convert
the power into love.

460
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,030
He's doing a pretty good job of it too.

461
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,425
He's a better you than you.

462
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,190
Where'd he go?

463
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,525
Okay.

464
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,140
You should...

465
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,605
never, ever...

466
00:30:57,705 --> 00:31:02,130
fly in that condition... again.

467
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,190
How are you not...

468
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,605
Ah, the whole tissue regeneration thing-

469
00:31:07,705 --> 00:31:10,155
I think it includes my liver tissue.

470
00:31:10,255 --> 00:31:12,255
Oh, yeah?

471
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,610
I didn't know that.

472
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,690
I'm so sorry, Claire.

473
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,310
Let me... help.

474
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,740
I really messed up.

475
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,450
It's all right. It's fine.

476
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,300
It's not fine.

477
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,490
You know what I did when
I found out about you?

478
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
I did what I always do.

479
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,530
I denied there was a problem,
just like I'm doing right now.

480
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,880
You know, we should probably...

481
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,095
have this conversation in the morning.

482
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:05,400
The truth is, Claire, I get a pit in
my stomach every time I think of you.

483
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,095
It was just so stupid
the way I handled it.

484
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,690
You know, I thought if I...

485
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,810
kept my distance...

486
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,980
when the time was right, we would...

487
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,190
catch up.

488
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,630
But look at you.

489
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,130
I missed my chance.
You're all grown up.

490
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,740
Hardly.

491
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,325
You wanna know why I
gave you a free pass?

492
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,515
Because I thought in one move,
I could win you over.

493
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:49,950
Look, right now I'm using you as an
excuse to hide behind this mess that I'm-

494
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,180
You know what?

495
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:58,210
I know everybody's counting
on me to fix it.

496
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,085
And I wanna try.

497
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:02,540
I'm gonna do it for everybody.

498
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,785
Peter...

499
00:33:03,885 --> 00:33:05,885
my mom...

500
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,710
For you.

501
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,230
I'm gonna fix it all.

502
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,590
I'll make it all...

503
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,780
I lost him.

504
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,885
Me too.

505
00:33:51,985 --> 00:33:53,985
I guess he's gone.

506
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,750
For good this time.

507
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,470
Let's go.

508
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,305
You killed him.

509
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:25,405
No.

510
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,790
He's still alive.

511
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,080
Wait.

512
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,900
Can you do it without leaving...

513
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,060
Good morning.

514
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,950
Morning.

515
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,165
Ou really bailed me out
with those kids last night.

516
00:35:15,265 --> 00:35:17,265
I appreciate it.

517
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,260
That's what family's for, right?

518
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,350
So what's the plan? Are we
going straight to washington?

519
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,090
No.

520
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,320
Look, I-I didn't make any calls to anybody.

521
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,190
I don't really have any friends
on the hill at the moment.

522
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:36,710
But last night, you said that
you would fix everything.

523
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,810
I was drunk.

524
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,950
I'm sorry if I got your hopes up.

525
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,265
There's gotta be
something that you can do.

526
00:35:44,365 --> 00:35:47,340
I'm wide open if you got any ideas.

527
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,860
Claire, I overreached.

528
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
I screwed up...

529
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,600
and now it's just way beyond my control.

530
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,130
Some things are bigger...

531
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,900
than one man.

532
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,960
You know what?

533
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,060
Over the years...

534
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,290
I couldn't help but...

535
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,330
think about my real dad...

536
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:26,260
who you were, what you
looked like, your job...

537
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,580
and then I met you.

538
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:34,760
And you were more amazing than
anything I could have ever imagined.

539
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,660
It's just a fantasy.

540
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,410
No.

541
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,720
No, it doesn't have to be.

542
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,760
You can do anything you want.

543
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,200
You can fly.

544
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,520
Claire.

545
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,920
You're supposed to be superman.

546
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,210
Feeling better?

547
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,880
I slept...

548
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:43,400
and I had a dream.

549
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,230
What about?

550
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,480
That.

551
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,580
Or should I say "her"?

552
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,280
I know what we have to do now.

553
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,670
First...

554
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,270
we need to go find Nathan and Claire,

555
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,640
and we need to bring
this family together.

556
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,055
And then we need to
go visit my sister.

557
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,000
Sister?

558
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,110
So where they headed anyway?

559
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,240
There's a quarter past ocho to San Diego.

560
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,340
What time is it?

561
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,255
I got nothin'.

562
00:38:38,355 --> 00:38:40,735
What happened to your watch?

563
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,990
I'm heading back up, you know.

564
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,590
Good.

565
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,100
Comin'?

566
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,890
You okay, sir?

567
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:42,390
Those things'll kill ya.

568
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,490
So how did that feel...

569
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,950
zipping up that body bag?

570
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Cathartic.

571
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,100
Poetic.

572
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,955
And tactically fortunate.

573
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,175
I'll be a lot easier for us to operate...

574
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,120
if everybody thinks I'm dead.

575
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,490
If we do this...

576
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,840
we succeed...

577
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,655
you'd be the only one left.

578
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,380
Funny how that works.

579
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,310
