<i>Previously on </i>Heroes...

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,713
I'm going home.
I'm scared for my life, okay?

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,423
- I know.
- Do you?

4
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:10,093
I'm just not like you.

5
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:14,723
And this thing here, just pretend
it never happened, okay?

6
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,391
I'm haitianing you.

7
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,453
We're pretending
that we've never been

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,061
to the <i>Burnt Toast Diner</i>.

9
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:24,719
I came to warn you.
You need to know the truth.

10
00:00:24,886 --> 00:00:27,028
The answer you seek is here.

11
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:28,708
- What do you got?
- A body.

12
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,812
- What is it?
- It's me.

13
00:00:31,694 --> 00:00:33,700
One touch, Nathan, and it's over.

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,116
Don't touch him. You touch him.
He's got my power.

15
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:39,456
- His mind will go back into his body.
- Take my hand now. Do it now.

16
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,249
- I said, get away.
- Back away.

17
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,300
I need you to go back eight weeks,
to a motel room in Texas.

18
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:46,546
To save his life?

19
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,833
No, to save that film
before he destroyed it.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,529
Once you return, deliver it to me,
your sweet Charlie will be set free.

21
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:54,902
I have your film.
Now I want Charlie.

22
00:00:55,295 --> 00:00:56,295
Soon.

23
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:00,226
<i>This is entry number four.</i>

24
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:04,311
<i>When two or more
of these forces are proximate,</i>

25
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:06,480
<i>they amplify exponentially,</i>

26
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:10,070
<i>like a kind of gravity or magnetism.</i>

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,586
<i>An abnormal spike

00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:14,449

<i>being held here.</i>

31
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,294
- <i>A pregnant woman.</i>
- <i>Doctor!</i>

00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:22,165
- <i>He's crowning.</i>
- <i>And I fear...</i>

33
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:25,983
<i>I fear that this child may indeed...</i>

34
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,697
<i>I'm coming.
It's okay.</i>

35
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:35,620
<i>It's okay.</i>

36
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:39,391
Butterfly man, open up.

37
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,184
You can't avoid me.

38
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:44,247
I can see you in there.

39
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:45,796
Open up!

40
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:49,323
You are in there, I know!

41
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,494
Come out!

42
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,622
Butterfly man!

43
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,741
Hiro, is that you
making all that noise?

44
00:01:57,908 --> 00:01:59,243
I've done what you asked.

45
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,371
Now, tell me where
and when you put Charlie.

46
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:05,554
It's beautiful out, isn't it?

47
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:07,585
Makes a man glad to be alive.

48
00:02:08,057 --> 00:02:10,953
It feels poetic that today
is the day we give thanks.

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,485
Stop ignoring me, butterfly man.
I want Charlie.

50
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:16,582
You will have her. But there are
more pressing matters to discuss.

51
00:02:16,749 --> 00:02:19,889
That film that you retrieved,
it's brought everything into focus.

52
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,991
I discovered the truth
about my destiny.

53
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:24,258
Our destiny.

54
00:02:26,088 --> 00:02:29,607
- Give me Charlie.
- Sorry. Not yet.

55
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,280


56
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,590
There's a nice sharp ax
right over there.

57
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:42,346
Go on. Freeze time.
Chop me into bits.

58
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:44,346
No, that's right.
You can't.

59
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:46,791
'cause if you kill me,
you'll never find Charlie.

60
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:55,550
I'm your savior, Hiro.
You just don't know it yet.

61
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,030
Now go help set the table.

62
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:00,733
And smile.

63
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:02,474
It's Thanksgiving.

64
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:10,462
- So when should I expect you?
- <i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

65
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:11,816
You've got to come.

66
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:13,798
Happy Thanksgiving.

67
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:21,382
I just don't know
that I'm in the mood.

68
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:24,050
<i>Come on.
You can invite Gretchen.</i>

69
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:25,413
Actually, I can't.

70
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:29,334
She moved all the way across campus.

71
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:31,458
I'm sorry to hear that.

72
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,255
And that's my fault, isn't it?

73
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:37,339
It's okay.
It wasn't gonna work out anyway.

74
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:39,764
So I guess it's official.

75
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:41,402
I'm a social pariah.

76
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:43,515
<i>And I haven't helped things much.</i>

77
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,275
I want to make it up to you,
starting with a real Bennet family

78
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:47,674
Thanksgiving dinner...

79
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:50,377
Turkey, trimmings, the whole thing.
What do you say?

80
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:52,524
<i>And since when do you cook?</i>

81
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,610
Well, you know, I'm learning as I go.
Is that a yes?

82
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:58,285
I don't know.

83
00:03:58,594 --> 00:03:59,656
Is Lyle coming?

84
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,705
No, he sends his regrets.
He can't get away from school.

85
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:06,079
Don't make me be alone
with your mother and Doug.

86
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,834
She's bringing the new boyfriend?

87
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:09,666
<i>She never goes anywhere without him.</i>

88
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,376
It would mean a lot to me.

89
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:14,538
Okay.

90
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,882
There's something I've been meaning
to talk to you about anyway.

91
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,927
Great, I'll see you at 4:30.
Don't be late. Love you.

92
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,896
- Oh, my God.
- Lauren.

93
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,816
Of all the supermarkets
in all the towns in all the world.

94
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,586
- It's great to see you.
- You too.

95
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:41,194
Well, what are you doing
in Washington?

96
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:44,030
Well, after Primatech exploded,
I was kind of unemployed.

97
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:47,287
CIA seemed like the obvious choice.
And you?

98
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:50,629
You know, a little bit of this,
a little bit of that.

99
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:52,292
- All right.
- Mostly that.

100
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,961
- I got a place in Dupont circle.
- Nice.

101
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,672
What brings you
to this side of town?

102
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,582
These yams.
These canned yams.

103
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:04,377
I love them, and I can't get 'em
anywhere else.

104
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,141
Didn't peg you for a yam man.

105
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:10,184
Oh, yeah, big yam man.

106
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,188
You're stalking me, aren't you?

107
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:20,066
Yes, but I am also cooking
Thanksgiving dinner

108
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:22,196
for my daughter and my ex-wife.

109
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:23,448
Ex-wife.

110
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,905
Yes.
Sandra left me.

111
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:28,009
Can't say as I really blame her,
but we're still on good terms.

112
00:05:28,176 --> 00:05:30,445
I mean, hence the oversized bird.

113
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:33,458
Are you having Thanksgiving
on Christmas?

114
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,878
Because this frozen beast is not
gonna thaw until tomorrow.

115
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,714
You need one
of those already-cooked birds.

116
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,718
Follow me.

117
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,221
Thanks.
I appreciate it.

118
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:51,074
'cause I'm not exactly
an expert in...

119
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:52,856
life skills.

120
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,881
How many people?

121
00:05:55,048 --> 00:05:59,406
Four. Five,
if you would like to join us.

122
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:02,570
That is, if you don't already
have plans.

123
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:07,213
And by the way you're sizing up
my single-serve turkey pot pie,

124
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,332
you've already surmised
that I don't have plans.

125
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:13,027
It would be great to catch up.

126
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,185
Happy Thanksgiving.

127
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:50,352
Mom...

128
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,026
Please, set up in there, boys.

129
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:54,122
What is this?

130
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,210
- Where's your brother, honey?
- That's a good question.

131
00:06:59,122 --> 00:07:01,295
Would you please put these
in a bowl for me?

132
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,816
We need to talk.

133
00:07:03,983 --> 00:07:06,506
I know. That's what
Thanksgiving's all about.

134
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:09,053
Just families sharing our lives.

135
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:11,014
Thank you, gentlemen.

136
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,069
Okay, and please remember
to stir some milk into that.

137
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:15,990
That's the way
your brother likes it.

138
00:07:21,385 --> 00:07:23,234
I went to a storage unit yesterday.

139
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,830
Rented out to you.

140
00:07:28,124 --> 00:07:29,774
Saw Nathan's dead body.

141
00:07:34,472 --> 00:07:35,872
Rene told you about that.

142
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:39,354
Well,

143
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,343
it was not
your brother's body you saw.

144
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,913
It was a shape-shifter
posing as your brother.

145
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,684
It's the worst kind of identity theft.
And he had to be stopped,

146
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:53,001
and then we had to store him
away discreetly.

147
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:55,822
You can imagine if the press
had gotten wind.

148
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:57,393
Matt also said that...

149
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,087
Matt Parkman said what?

150
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:04,327
Officer Parkman is unbalanced.

151
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,779
Suicidal, last I heard.

152
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:08,488
Because Sylar's in his head?

153
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:11,365
Is that right?

154
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,912
What did you do, ma?

155
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:22,043
Is my brother really dead?

156
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:24,415
Answer him, mom.

157
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:27,980
We'd all like to hear that one.

158
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:30,965
Happy Thanksgiving, Nathan.

159
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:34,715
So, if you two will just
help me set the table,

160
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,691
we will sit down like a family

161
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:38,736
and we will discuss everything.

162
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:43,064
Let go of me, Nathan.

163
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:46,984
Answer him.

164
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,488
It's Thanksgiving,
and you are my family.

165
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,359
And we will sit down like a family
as we do every year,

166
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:56,202
or I will leave here, and you will never
hear from me again.

167
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,740
Your choice.

169
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:51,574
- Hello.
- Hey. Happy Thanksgiving.

170
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:52,953
Come on in.

171
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,130
Something smells good.

172
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,971
Look at this place.

173
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,081
Are you sure this is your apartment?

174
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:00,433
We clean up good.

175
00:10:00,749 --> 00:10:02,768
So what can I get you?
Some sparkling cider?

176
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:05,033
No, I'm all right,
but before everyone gets here,

177
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,148
I do want to talk to you
about something.

178
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,576
Just let me check
the gravy first, okay?

179
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,027
Oh, I got that.

180
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:13,321
Claire, you remember Lauren?

181
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,671
She worked with me at primatech.

182
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,620
Hi. You're all grown-up.
You look beautiful.

183
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:23,105
It's okay.
I've got this, Wolfgang.

184
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:24,248
Thanks.

185
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:31,180
Does mom know you brought a date?

186
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,895
No, Lauren's not a date.
She's an old friend.

187
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:35,618
She's helping me cook.

188
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,388
She is so a date.

189
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:43,042
- You should have told mom.
- Your mother will understand.

190
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,519
We're a complex,
modern family, and...

191
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:47,998
She's got Doug.

192
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:50,149
So what did you want to talk about?

193
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:53,396
Hold that thought.

194
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,412
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You too.

195
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,206
Good boy.

196
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:07,667
Hey, Noah.
Happy Thanksgiving.

197
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,918
- A host gift.
- Thanks, Doug.

198
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:11,213
Come on in.

199
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,856
- Hi.
- How are you?

200
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:15,716
Good.
Who's your little friend?

201
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:18,636
Dame Penelope Jean Lovegood III.

202
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,362
But you can call her Ms. Lovegood.

203
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:23,166
Can't she, snookums?
Yes, she can. Yes, she can.

204
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,037
Claire, you remember Doug.

205
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,062
<i>Enchanté.</i>

206
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:30,739
Dinner's ready.

207
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:32,098
You hired a cook?

208
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:33,776
No, that's Lauren.

209
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,883
Mistaken for a domestic.

210
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,491
That certainly breaks the ice.

211
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:43,077
Lauren Gilmore. It's nice
to finally meet you, Sandra.

212
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:45,621
Okay.
Let's eat.

213
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:47,998
You brought a date?

214
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,295
That's Lauren.
Okay. Who's hungry?

215
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:54,499
Got lots to eat.
Come on.

216
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,667
Not a fan of Thanksgiving?

217
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:01,003
I'm from japan.

218
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,216
We celebrate <i>Kinro Kansha</i>,
not Thanksgiving.

219
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:08,010
What's the matter?
You can talk to me. We're family.

220
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,726
I'm not part of this family.
I'm a prisoner.

221
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:14,066
- No one's a prisoner here.
- Samuel broke his promise.

222
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,537
I fixed the past, but he won't
give me back Charlie.

223
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:18,279
He's a liar and an evil man.

224
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:30,249
If the time traveler
fixed the past, where's Joseph?

225
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:32,877
That's a good question.

226
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:44,722
You got a minute, Hiro?

227
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:47,449
Come inside.

228
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:48,916
We need to talk.

229
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:56,150
Tell me, what did you do
when you fixed the past for Samuel?

230
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,291
I'm sorry.
I cannot say.

231
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:02,281
Samuel might get mad,
and Charlie's at stake.

232
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:03,982
I understand.

233
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:07,806
I have to change for dinner.

234
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:09,512
You stay a minute, will you?

235
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,713
You know, Hiro,

236
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:20,375
we can help each other.

237
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,100
- I could use my ability.
- Really?

238
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,347
I can be inside of your soul.

239
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,408
We can be...

240
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:32,237
as one.

241
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:36,524
Painted lady,

242
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,610
I think you are trying to seduce me.

243
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:41,612
But you should know
my heart belongs to Charlie.

244
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,355
I'm sorry...

245
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,888
If I'm making you uncomfortable.

246
00:13:47,055 --> 00:13:48,055


247
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:50,437
But...

248
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:53,315
I need contact,

249
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,549
closeness to make this work.

250
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Of course.

251
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,838
Every ability has a different...

252
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,845
set of rules.

253
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,145
I can feel what you feel, Hiro.

254
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,099
Touch me.

255
00:14:23,658 --> 00:14:26,107
You want Charlie back desperately.

256
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:31,285
And now Samuel's forcing you
to work for him.

257
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:36,223
Why didn't he have you save
his brother Joseph?

258
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:40,254
I don't know.
You should ask Samuel.

259
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,004
He'll never tell me.

260
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,101
You need to take me back.

261
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:47,816
Eight weeks ago, when a man

262
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:49,846
came to the carnival
and murdered Joseph.

263
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:51,640
- I don't think I should...
- Please.

264
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,225
I need to know the truth.

265
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:03,001
You made us time travel.
We must go back.

266
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:09,971
- Is that the man that killed Joseph?
- No, that's Dr. Suresh.

267
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:18,512
- We need to talk.
- Joseph?

268
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,086
- I'm behind on my chores.
- Forget the chores.

269
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:22,796
This is not good.

270
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:25,982
All right, brother.
But not here.

271
00:15:30,905 --> 00:15:31,955
Is this it?

272
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:34,531
Is this the night
that Joseph gets murdered?

273
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,451
I don't know.

274
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:39,730
But it is very dangerous to be here.
We must go before we step on a...

275
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,861
Butterfly.

276
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,493
Okay, mom, you got us here,
sitting, just like you wanted.

277
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,716
So talk.

278
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,121
Peter, where are your manners?
Nathan, would you please say grace?

279
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,283
It's Thanksgiving, Nathan.

280
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,627
It's the one day
we should express our gratitude.

281
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,639
What do I have to be grateful for?

282
00:16:04,946 --> 00:16:07,070
I'm dead. He knows it.
You know it.

283
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:09,927
Why don't you tell us why
and put us all out of our misery?

284
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:13,846
Tell us.

285
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:19,409
I don't expect you to understand

286
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:22,019
or approve of the decision I made,

287
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:24,138
but I hope you can keep an open mind

288
00:16:24,305 --> 00:16:25,442
and not condemn it.

289
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,779
Sylar was gonna kill the president,

290
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,091
and you two had flown off
to stop him

291
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,825
at that hotel in Washington.

292
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:35,934
And I had a dream about you, Nathan.

293
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:37,871
I saw you fighting for your life.

294
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:40,708
I also saw Matt Parkman save you.

295
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:42,364
But I panicked

296
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:46,707
and I went and found him,
and I dragged him to the hotel.

297
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:49,814
- But by the time we got there...
- I was already dead.

298
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,273
I made Matt Parkman do it.

299
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:03,731
This is the part
where I ask you to forgive me.

300
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:06,362
So that body that we saw...

301
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,952
That was Nathan.

302
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:13,912
Technically...

303
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:15,413
yes. But...

304
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:19,026
as far as the world is concerned,
Nathan is still alive.

305
00:17:19,193 --> 00:17:20,520
Yeah, but I'm not me.

306
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:21,937
It's your mind.

307
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,092
They are your memories.

308
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:26,226
You look exactly the same.

309
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:28,264
You are Nathan Petrelli.

310
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:31,449
You are my son.
You're Peter's brother.

311
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:33,385
And it's been this way for months.

312
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:39,516
Just because you know the truth,
nothing has to change.

313
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:41,310
We are still

314
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
a family.

315
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,359
To us.

316
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:00,787
I would like to propose a toast

317
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,653
to all of you for being here

318
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,948
on this my first Thanksgiving
in this apartment,

319
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:07,479
my first Thanksgiving
I've ever hosted.

320
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:09,152
I...

321
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,054
And that's especially to Lauren.

322
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,321
Without her,

323
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:15,344
we would all be eating
Japanese takeout right now.

324
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:22,768
So Sandra,
how did you and Doug meet?

325
00:18:24,998 --> 00:18:26,522
- May I?
- Please.

326
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,800
It was love at first sight.

327
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:31,907
For Mr. Muggles
and Ms. Lovegood, that is.

328
00:18:33,672 --> 00:18:34,804
We met at the groomer.

329
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:37,700
My little angel wouldn't stop barking
until they put her cage

330
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,326
right next to his, am I right?

331
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,493
It's true.

332
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,286
Nasty.

333
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,291
- Dougy's allergic.
- Legume-intolerant.

334
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,254
So how did the two of you meet?

335
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,755
Well,

336
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:55,551
Lauren and I used to work together
at Primatech.

337
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,001
And we... we recently reconnected.

338
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,386
This morning, actually.
Frozen food aisle.

339
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:02,349
I troll the place for eligible men.

340
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:03,885
Primatech.

341
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:06,186
Is that the paper company
or that other thing?

342
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:08,731
You know about that other thing?

343
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,530
Yes, dear.

344
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:13,235
A memory can be erased
only so many times.

345
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,822
So you worked closely then?

346
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,032
- It wasn't like that, you know.
- Or am I...

347
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:22,578
stumbling onto something
that I'm not supposed to remember?

348
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:25,095
You're not stumbling onto anything.

349
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:27,833
I think we should all just enjoy
our Thanksgiving dinner.

350
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:36,508
You know, in my family,
on Thanksgiving,

351
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,927
we used to go around the table
and everyone

352
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:41,159
would say
what they were thankful for.

353
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:49,042
Okay, I'll go first.

354
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:52,687
I am thankful for the two
beautiful women in my life...

355
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:55,458
Ms. Lovegood and my beautiful Sandy.

356
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,945
Nice.

357
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:03,410
I am thankful
that my daughter Claire

358
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,342
decided to come for Thanksgiving.

359
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:07,748
It would not be the same
without her.

360
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,687
I'll second that.

361
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:13,170
I'm thankful for canned yams.

362
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:16,482
How about you, Claire?

363
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:22,961
I know that I should be thankful,

364
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:25,224
but I'm just not feeling it
right now.

365
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,809
Is everything okay?

366
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:29,454
Her roommate moved out.

367
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:32,481
Why on earth would she do that?
You're so likable.

368
00:20:33,878 --> 00:20:35,808
Doug, you don't know
anything about me.

369
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,735
What?

370
00:20:40,162 --> 00:20:41,865
You want to talk about it right now?

371
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:44,985
Fine.

372
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:47,926
I'm thinking
about dropping out of school.

373
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,429
My family...

374
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:00,450
This will surely be

375
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:04,100
a Thanksgiving...
to remember.

376
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:07,440
Where's Lydia?

377
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,143
Not sure.

378
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,733
Amanda, sweetheart,
where's your mother?

379
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:15,654
I think she went
to go find the Japanese man.

380
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:16,900
Did she now?

381
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:22,801
Happy Thanksgiving.

382
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:29,191
That man from India,

383
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,754
he wasn't writing a book.
He wanted to talk about me.

384
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:35,205
You sent me away, but I stayed,
I listened, I heard everything.

385
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,549
- How long have you been lying to me?
- You need to calm down, brother.

386
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:42,532
Then stop controlling me.

387
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:45,714
- Stop manipulating my emotions.
- Fine.

388
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,603
You want me to let go.

389
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:48,957
I will.

390
00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:54,277
My whole life, you've kept me
under your thumb. Why?

391
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,148
Because you're dangerous.

392
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,098
What's that supposed to mean?

393
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:00,558
- Oh, never mind.
- No, tell me what you meant.

394
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:03,220
You can move the earth.

395
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:06,053
But it's more than that.

396
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,035
Cities.

397
00:22:09,012 --> 00:22:09,982
Mountains.

398
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:14,030
You have the power to kill millions.

399
00:22:14,197 --> 00:22:15,598
I can't let that happen.

400
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,731
I always thought I was missing out
on something.

401
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:22,337
Some untapped potential.

402
00:22:24,016 --> 00:22:25,366
Just tell me how.

403
00:22:27,397 --> 00:22:29,091
How can I be that powerful?

404
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,558
I've already said too much.

405
00:22:36,258 --> 00:22:38,034
You think I wanted this life?

406
00:22:39,787 --> 00:22:41,443
You had to be controlled.

407
00:22:42,873 --> 00:22:44,375
From the day you were born,

408
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,780
I gave up everything
to watch over you.

409
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,893
Let me free you of that burden.

410
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:51,822
Show me the film.

411
00:22:52,802 --> 00:22:54,534
Let me learn what I am.

412
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:56,970
- Take responsibility for myself.
- Too late.

413
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:00,253
I told Dr. Suresh to burn it.

414
00:23:00,503 --> 00:23:01,960
Why would you do that?

415
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:09,123
You can never know the truth.

416
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,809
I've made arrangements.

417
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,633
A man from the government is coming

418
00:23:17,326 --> 00:23:18,460
to take you in.

419
00:23:21,044 --> 00:23:22,401
I gave him a compass.

420
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:24,695
You've betrayed me.

421
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:29,897
My entire life, you've betrayed me.

422
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,533
I'm still your brother.

423
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,957
I love you.

424
00:23:52,855 --> 00:23:54,455
God, what have I done?

425
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:56,893
What have I done?

426
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,524
He's coming.

427
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,102
He's coming.

428
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:32,929
I know that you guys
are freaking out,

429
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,320
but I don't think college
is where I'm supposed to be.

430
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:38,490
Is this about Gretchen?
Because that is one relationship.

431
00:24:38,657 --> 00:24:41,126
Yeah, it is about Gretchen.
And it's about Becky,

432
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:43,482
- and everything that's happened.
- Who's Becky?

433
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,601
Mom, look, I just don't think
that I belong in college.

434
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:49,656
Where do you think you belong,
or have you even thought about it yet?

435
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,545
Maybe I'll go for a year abroad.

436
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,177
Maybe I'll go backpack
through Europe. A job.

437
00:24:54,344 --> 00:24:56,418
I just need to find somewhere
where I fit in,

438
00:24:56,585 --> 00:24:57,914
where I could be myself.

439
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:00,707
And the $40,000 I just gave
to the school, where that should go?

440
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,085
I don't know.
Where'd it come from?

441
00:25:04,762 --> 00:25:06,630
This is about what
that guy Samuel said?

442
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,548
Who is Samuel?
What is going on?

443
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,695
- Maybe it is.
- How could you even consider

444
00:25:10,862 --> 00:25:12,872
- listening to him?
- What did your father do?

445
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,846
This is not about dad.
It's about me.

446
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,348
I can't lie anymore.

447
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,896
I'm a freak,
and people don't like freaks.

448
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:21,125
- Can I just interject something here?
- No!

449
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:23,271
We should
all just take a deep breath.

450
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:26,274
All I was gonna say is that what
Claire is feeling is perfectly normal.

451
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,456
I mean, we've all felt
like we didn't fit in

452
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:30,428
at one point or another
in our lives.

453
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,116
Heck, growing up and discovering
I had a penchant

454
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,284
for dog breeding,
you think I had any friends?

455
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:39,830
Trust me, Claire,
this will all blow over.

456
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:41,488
Really?

457
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:43,176
Is it, Doug?

458
00:25:43,582 --> 00:25:46,503
Do you think that this
is going to blow over?

459
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,460
What are you doing?

460
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,298
Jeez.

461
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:52,479
How's that for normal?

462
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:03,353
Great.

463
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,602


464
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:08,969
Get more wine.

465
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,768
- I have to tell them.
- No. You can't say anything.

466
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:18,827
If someone finds out I took you to the
past, I will never see Charlie again.

467
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:22,460
I have something special.
I'll be right back.

468
00:26:23,776 --> 00:26:26,198
- Please.
- I'm sorry, Hiro.

469
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,837
But we have to stand up to him.

470
00:26:30,004 --> 00:26:32,254
Some things are just too important.

471
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,125
Where you been, friend?

472
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,570
I got lost.

473
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,107
Well, now you're found.

474
00:26:50,557 --> 00:26:52,154
Something going on over here?

475
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:00,633
Something in your hair.

476
00:27:05,236 --> 00:27:06,875
Well, then, you must be starved.

477
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:10,911
Join me.

478
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:12,781
Make yourself useful.

479
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:14,516
Pass the chair, will you?

480
00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:27,437
Guess he's never seen her
regen before.

481
00:27:31,587 --> 00:27:33,860
- So some dinner, huh?
- Par for the course.

482
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:37,034
Especially when it comes
to my ex-husband.

483
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:39,532
I don't know what's going on
between him and Claire.

484
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:42,763
I don't know either,

485
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,332
I think that Thanksgiving dinner
was just his way

486
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:48,583
of letting Claire know
that she has a family that loves her.

487
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,259
Nothing wrong with that.

488
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,807
I thought you gave up all this.

489
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,308
Yeah, so did I.

490
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,102
And then

491
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,363
I come across this compass,
which almost gets me killed.

492
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,275
It turns out it belongs
to the strange man

493
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,735
who shows up
in my daughter's dorm room

494
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,405
threatening the normal life
she so desperately wants.

495
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,243
Well, maybe it's impossible.

496
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,034
Maybe I'm just not supposed
to have a normal life.

497
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,749
It sounds like you're giving up.

498
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:26,621
Why did you cut yourself?

499
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,281
I don't know. Maybe...

500
00:28:28,448 --> 00:28:31,376
because you guys
all think that you know

501
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,426
what it's like to be me, but you don't.
How could you possibly?

502
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:37,605
I have to lie to everyone.
Otherwise,

503
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,676
they faint.

504
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,167
I know that it has been hard,

505
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:45,203
and I know
that I have caused you pain,

506
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,392
but I'm concerned about you, Claire.

507
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,025
These are not good people.
They're dangerous.

508
00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:51,980
You just have to trust me on this.

509
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,190
Would you stop treating me
like I'm a child?

510
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,994
Then stop acting like one.

511
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,180
Let me get this.

512
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:14,355
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey, come on in.

513
00:29:31,365 --> 00:29:32,865
Who's ready for pie?

514
00:29:44,477 --> 00:29:45,742
Is there a problem, mom?

515
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,347
Some family.

516
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:56,211
You look at me,
you don't see your son.

517
00:29:57,326 --> 00:29:59,130
You see the man who killed your son.

518
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,630
Don't be silly.

519
00:30:01,783 --> 00:30:03,881
You don't see your brother.

520
00:30:07,414 --> 00:30:10,064
Well, that's because I'm not
your brother.

521
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,161
Guess again.

522
00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:18,134
God, Sylar's in there
with you, isn't he?

523
00:30:21,215 --> 00:30:23,029
We never should have gone
to Texas, Pete.

524
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,735
It feels good
to finally be me again.

525
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:17,551
What's for dinner?

526
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,003
I'm starved.

527
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:31,306
You know what makes
this meal truly special?

528
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,338
It's knowing that each
and every one of you

529
00:31:34,505 --> 00:31:36,555
had a hand in making it happen.

530
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:41,387
Just as we've had a hand
in each other's lives,

531
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:44,179
in our shared destiny.

532
00:31:51,332 --> 00:31:52,332
Heaven.

533
00:31:53,835 --> 00:31:56,535
We have depended on each other
for so long.

534
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,098
Through good times and bad.

535
00:32:01,972 --> 00:32:03,285
But tonight,

536
00:32:04,187 --> 00:32:06,387
we should be especially thankful.

537
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,800
The future...

538
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,719
is here.

539
00:32:12,676 --> 00:32:16,017
And it will be greater than my brother
could ever have imagined.

540
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:19,145
But I can't tell you about it yet.

541
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:22,899
Not while there's a traitor
in our midst.

542
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:31,295
I just learned that the person
who killed my brother

543
00:32:32,096 --> 00:32:33,096
is here,

544
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:36,955
sitting at this table.

545
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:40,452
It's time we all knew the truth,
isn't it?

546
00:32:43,765 --> 00:32:44,796
Tell them, Samuel.

547
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:48,466
You murdered Joseph.
The time traveler saw it.

548
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:50,177
Really?

549
00:32:52,116 --> 00:32:53,888
Is that what you saw, Hiro?

550
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:01,479
I'm sorry.
I have to think about Charlie.

551
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,900
- I didn't see anything.
- We know what you did.

552
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,040
Why so angry, Edgar?

553
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,200
Is it because you've done
something... shameful?

554
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:19,872
You killed Joseph, didn't you?

555
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,550
You betrayed us to the government.

556
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,700
And when Joseph found out,
you killed him.

557
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:29,267
You lying bastard.

558
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,308
What have you done?

559
00:33:39,965 --> 00:33:42,228
I saved your life.
Look.

560
00:33:46,377 --> 00:33:47,377
Thanks.

561
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:51,757
- I'm gonna finish him.
- No, you can't hurt him.

562
00:33:52,376 --> 00:33:54,281
He's the only one
who knows where Charlie is.

563
00:33:54,448 --> 00:33:55,504
He killed Joseph.

564
00:33:55,671 --> 00:33:58,412
I know, but this is not
the time for revenge.

565
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,085
Sometimes a hero has to run away

566
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:03,124
to live to fight another day.

567
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,962
We will defeat him.
I promise you.

568
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,631
I'll hold you to that.

569
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,350
Only the guilty turn tail and run.

570
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:35,782
Edgar is gone.
Good riddance.

571
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,450
I feel like I haven't eaten
in months.

572
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:55,836
You think that's some kind
of existential soul thing?

573
00:34:56,003 --> 00:34:57,303
You have a soul?

574
00:35:00,728 --> 00:35:01,978
Come on, buddy.

575
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:06,437
That's the best you got?
No big speeches about hope?

576
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:09,273
Triumph of the human spirit?

577
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:12,027
Why don't you let me
out of this chair and find out?

578
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:15,363
And you...

579
00:35:17,895 --> 00:35:20,345
You have raised
the evil incarnate bar

580
00:35:21,223 --> 00:35:22,973
to an entirely new level.

581
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:25,827
Thank you...

582
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,616
For giving me something
to strive for.

583
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,239
All this talk of...

584
00:35:37,406 --> 00:35:38,631
souls and...

585
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,948
spirits sends my head spinning.

586
00:35:41,115 --> 00:35:43,725
I am not... a religious man.

587
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:46,018
But...

588
00:35:46,536 --> 00:35:48,479
there is one thing I do believe in.

589
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:50,103
Blood.

590
00:35:52,722 --> 00:35:54,472
Time to carve the turkey.

591
00:35:56,059 --> 00:35:57,154
Get away from her.

592
00:36:03,149 --> 00:36:04,499
What's happening?

593
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,666
It's Nathan.
He's in there.

594
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,501
Come on, fight him, Nathan.

595
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,627
Fight him.

596
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,046
Nathan's dead.

597
00:36:14,718 --> 00:36:16,674
No, he isn't.
He's still in you.

598
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,301
His spirit and his mind

599
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,553
are fighting for his family.

600
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,065
Come on, Nathan!

601
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:44,660
Nathan, fight him.

602
00:36:52,725 --> 00:36:54,962
What have you done to me?

603
00:37:14,908 --> 00:37:16,708
- Thanks.
- I'm so sorry.

604
00:37:17,497 --> 00:37:18,497
It's okay.

605
00:37:19,387 --> 00:37:21,100
So my dad called you?

606
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,199
Yeah, well,

607
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:27,787
he said you were feeling low,
and he knew I was feeling low, so...

608
00:37:29,692 --> 00:37:31,123
How's your new roommate?

609
00:37:31,551 --> 00:37:32,551
Fine.

610
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,900
Dull.

611
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:38,381
Actually, it's awful. No one's tried
to kill me for days now.

612
00:37:39,198 --> 00:37:40,548
And she's a slob.

613
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:43,719
Well, you know, the other side
of the room is still available.

614
00:37:45,824 --> 00:37:46,656
Sorry.

615
00:37:46,823 --> 00:37:48,190
You're right.
I don't know...

616
00:37:48,357 --> 00:37:51,357
why you would ever want
to move in with me again.

617
00:37:52,598 --> 00:37:55,022
Maybe because of all the people
that I've met in college

618
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:58,822
so far, you're the only one
who's ever made any sense to me.

619
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,423
Now see, I told you
you were gonna have fun.

620
00:38:04,385 --> 00:38:07,410
- What do you think about Christmas?
- How about a movie?

621
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:09,335
Much better.

622
00:38:09,502 --> 00:38:11,610
Should I give you my number
or were you just planning

623
00:38:11,777 --> 00:38:15,209
- on stalking me in the produce aisle?
- Canned goods I think it was.

624
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,376
My home number is on the back.

625
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:19,319
Use it.

626
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:22,567
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You too.

627
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,506
Good night, ladies.
Nice meeting you.

628
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:30,657
We're leaving, Claire.

629
00:38:30,824 --> 00:38:32,274
Happy Thanksgiving.

630
00:38:37,689 --> 00:38:39,000
Sorry about Doug.

631
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:41,432
He's fine.
I told him he ate a peanut.

632
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,289
He's not the sharpest tack,
but he's a good man.

633
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:46,007
Never a dull moment, Noah.

634
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:48,125
- Not if I can help it.
- Thank you.

635
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,291
I'm gonna go wait in the car.

636
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,757
- Thanks for the invite, Mr. Bennet.
- Anytime.

637
00:39:00,973 --> 00:39:04,342
I guess... "I'm sorry"
doesn't begin to cover it?

638
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:06,802
No, it's not your fault.
I'm just...

639
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:08,993
I know.
You've got a lot to figure out.

640
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,933
I just want you to take your time
and really think about your choices,

641
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,083
because you do have choices.

642
00:39:14,502 --> 00:39:17,730
- You're absolutely right.
- So you're going back to school?

643
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:21,292
Yeah, classes start Monday,
and I will be there.

644
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:22,985
Great news.

645
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,852
- Love you.
- Love you.

646
00:39:25,832 --> 00:39:28,824
And thank you for inviting Gretchen.

647
00:39:29,074 --> 00:39:30,326
I wasn't overreaching?

648
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,287
No, it was actually
the perfect dad thing to do.

649
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:36,248
Next Thanksgiving, your place.

650
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,750
It's a date.

651
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:44,757
Ready to head back?

652
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:46,883
Actually, no.

653
00:39:48,716 --> 00:39:51,616
We have a couple days off
before classes start, and...

654
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:55,507
I want to find out where this leads.

655
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:57,186
Where'd you get that?

656
00:39:57,655 --> 00:39:59,063
I stole it from my dad.

657
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:02,345
He said I had choices.

658
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:05,125
And I want to know what they are.

659
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:07,113
And this is going to lead me to 'em.

660
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,363
A compass?

661
00:40:09,149 --> 00:40:11,722
- Okay.
- You up for an adventure?

662
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:13,742
It's okay if you're not.

663
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:15,609
I understand.
I mean...

664
00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:17,581
We might run into Becky there.

665
00:40:18,828 --> 00:40:21,478
Yeah, she's not one
of my favorite people.

666
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:23,595
But you are.

667
00:40:25,264 --> 00:40:26,414
So which way?

668
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,910
Take a right.

669
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:39,645
You saved Edgar.

670
00:40:41,153 --> 00:40:42,353
How honorable.

671
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,940
Of course, when you betray me,

672
00:40:45,107 --> 00:40:46,944
you put Charlie in danger.

673
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,599
Your brother was right.

674
00:40:52,766 --> 00:40:54,206
You are powerful.

675
00:40:54,373 --> 00:40:55,995
But I am powerful too.

676
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,083
I'll make it
so you never see her again.

677
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,699
You won't do that.

678
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:03,961
You still need me.

679
00:41:04,436 --> 00:41:06,714
So... you tell me exactly when

680
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,414
and where Charlie is,
or I am leaving.

681
00:41:09,783 --> 00:41:11,491
And you will be the one who is lost.

682
00:41:11,658 --> 00:41:12,553
I like this.

683
00:41:12,913 --> 00:41:15,163
Little man standing up for himself.

684
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,184
But you don't actually think
I'd ever let you leave, do you?

685
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,584
- You don't have a choice.
- I always have a choice.

686
00:41:40,503 --> 00:41:42,103
How do you feel, Hiro?

687
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:46,211


688
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,796


689
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:54,781
What have you done?

690
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,810
I'm gonna find him,
and I'm gonna bring him back, mom.

691
00:42:01,202 --> 00:42:02,202
It's over.

692
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,738
It isn't possible anymore.

693
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:08,509
The one thing I know,
the one thing I can count on

694
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:11,695
since all this started,
is that anything is possible.

695
00:42:12,169 --> 00:42:13,046
It's Sylar.

696
00:42:13,213 --> 00:42:15,463
Nobody wants him dead more than me.

697
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:17,978
You want to know
what I want even more?

698
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:19,825
My brother alive.

699
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:22,706
I'll find a way.

700
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:33,547
